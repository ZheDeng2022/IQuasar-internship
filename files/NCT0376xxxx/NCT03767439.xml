  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase II study to assess the efficacy of combined SMO and PD-1&#xD;
      inhibition with Vismodegib (SMO inhibitor) and Nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) in BCNS&#xD;
      patients (target enrollment of 22 patients), with a primary endpoint of 18-month disease&#xD;
      control rate. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that Nivolumab and&#xD;
      Vismodegib will improve the percentage of BCNS patients who achieve disease control (defined&#xD;
      as total tumor burden &lt;50% of baseline) at 18 months from 50% to 80%. Baseline and&#xD;
      on-treatment biopsies will be obtained to characterize the immune effects of combined SMO and&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is by far the most common form of human malignancy, affecting more&#xD;
      than 3.5 million Americans each year. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway,&#xD;
      typically through loss of the receptor Patched (PTCH) or oncogenic activation of Smoothened&#xD;
      (SMO), has been identified as the primary driver of BCC growth and development. In&#xD;
      particular, up to 1 in 57,000 individuals in the US are affected by a rare, autosomal&#xD;
      dominant disorder characterized by mutations in protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) known as&#xD;
      basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS). These patients can develop dozens to hundreds of BCCs at&#xD;
      any one time (1-5). Surgical removal of the entire tumor burden is not feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hh-targeted therapies employing inhibitors of SMO (i.e., Vismodegib, Sonidegib) have shown&#xD;
      remarkable efficacy in reducing tumor burden in BCC patients. However, the sustained clinical&#xD;
      utility of these agents has been hampered by the rapid development of clinical resistance,&#xD;
      significant tumor recurrence, and toxicity. Treatment strategies directed at finding&#xD;
      additional molecular or immunological targets may enhance the possibility of sustained&#xD;
      remission and/or cure of these tumors. Emerging data from our research group and others&#xD;
      suggest the therapeutic efficacy of SMO inhibition may be dependent on immunological&#xD;
      mechanisms. Hh inhibition appears to increase T cell recruitment and activation as well as&#xD;
      upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on tumor cells. These&#xD;
      data, together with case reports demonstrating the efficacy of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte&#xD;
      associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibition in Hh inhibitor-na√Øve&#xD;
      and resistant BCCs, support a role for anti-tumor immunity in BCC and underscore the&#xD;
      potential enhanced therapeutic efficacy of combined SMO and immunological checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
