  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called GDC-0084 as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GDC-0084&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab (Herceptin®)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved GDC-0084 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab is a targeted therapy approved by the FDA to be used alone or in combination with&#xD;
      a chemotherapy drug to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GDC-0084 has been shown to stop the activity of a protein called PI3-kinase. This action&#xD;
      blocks a pathway in the body that cancer cells commonly use to grow and divide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trastuzumab is called a &quot;targeted therapy&quot; because it works by attaching itself to specific&#xD;
      receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When targeted&#xD;
      therapies attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and&#xD;
      the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the immune system. This process allows&#xD;
      trastuzumab to help slow or stop the growth of the breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how your cancer responds to the&#xD;
      combination of GDC-0084 and Trastuzumab.&#xD;

          -  Patients with known contraindication to MRI (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic&#xD;
             implants, claustrophobia, extreme obesity, hypersensitivity, etc.). However, head CT&#xD;
             with contrast may be used in place of MRI at baseline and throughout the trial if MRI&#xD;
             is contraindicated and a participant's brain metastases are clearly measurable by head&#xD;
             CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy or targeted therapy within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol&#xD;
             therapy. No washout is required for trastuzumab.&#xD;

             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association&#xD;
             Class III or IV, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the&#xD;
             previous six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM), gastric or duodenal&#xD;
             ulceration diagnosed within the previous 6 months, chronic liver or renal disease, or&#xD;
             severe malnutrition. If a participant has controlled DM but is unable to monitor blood&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive tumor involvement of the lungs,&#xD;
             resulting in dyspnea at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known intolerance to trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QT interval time of ≥ 470 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             strong inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Should a participant be taking one of these&#xD;
             agents and is able to discontinue the therapy or switch to a different agent, no&#xD;
             washout will be required prior to starting study medication. Please see Appendix M for&#xD;
             the list of medications. Corticosteroids, which are weak CYP3A4 inducers are allowed.&#xD;
             Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
             regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product&#xD;
