      BACKGROUND：Chronic total occlusion (CTO) angioplasty is one of the most challenging&#xD;
      procedures remaining for the interventional operator. Today, with contemporary CTO&#xD;
      negotiation available strategies and significant operator expertise, the literature reports a&#xD;
      50%-95% success rate for recanalizing CTOs. But PCIs of CTO lesions still carry a high rate&#xD;
      of in-stent restenosis (ISR). Because previous reports have not specifically compare&#xD;
      contemporary antegrade and retrograde dissection and re-entry dissection (ADR/RDR) technique&#xD;
      on the long-term impact of ISR, so the investigators focused on the objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: This study hope to evaluate the frequency of angiographic ISR and further&#xD;
      elucidate some ISR related higher risk factors among CTO PCI patients in intimal stent group&#xD;
      using antegrade or retrograde wire escalation (AWE/RWE) techniques and sub-intimal stent&#xD;
      group using contemporary antegrade or retrograde dissection and re-entry (ADR and/or RDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: A total of 300 consecutive selected patients with CTO lesion who will undergo&#xD;
      successful revascularization by AWE/RWE and ADR/RDR techniques treatment will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this prospective multicenter registry from December 1 2018 to December 31 2019. The primary&#xD;
      study endpoint of the protocol is the bionary in-stent restenosis of CTO vessels at&#xD;
      angiographic follow-up about 13 months. The secondary endpoints are: 1) CTO technique and&#xD;
      procedure success rate; and 2) in-hospital and 30 days MACE (Cardiac death, acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, urgent repeat tratget vessel revascularization with either pericardiocentssis or&#xD;
      surgery and stroke and stent thrombosis and stroke); 6months and 1-year and 2-year MACE&#xD;
      including death, MI, and target CTO vessel revascularization and stroke ; and 3) Restenosis&#xD;
      scores (R-scores) of related risk factors.&#xD;

      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trial overview and study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ① This clinical trial is a prospective, exploratory, nonrandomized, multicenter trial&#xD;
           evaluating the frequency of angiographic restenosis and clinical outcomes among patients&#xD;
           undergoing CTO PCI in intimal stent group using antegrade or retrograde wire escalation&#xD;
           (AWE/RWE) techniques and sub-intimal stent group using contemporary antegrade or&#xD;
           retrograde dissection and re-entry (ADR or RDR) with everolimus-eluting stents (XIENCE&#xD;
           Coronary Stent).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ②According to high patient's volume registry studies in CTO lesions, the patients&#xD;
           percentage of ADR or RDR strategy application was just only 20-25%36-37. If to get 60&#xD;
           patients for ADR or RDR strategies, the minimum CTO number are 300 patients. So in this&#xD;
           registry study, 300 CTO cases, to which PCI will be attempted, are prospectively&#xD;
           enrolled from Dec 1st 2018 to Dec 31st 2019 in the CTO registries of ten centers. The&#xD;
           study was approved by the institutional review board at each site. For patients with&#xD;
           multiple treated CTO, only the first CTO attempted was considered for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ③ Exclusions included age &lt;18-years-old or &gt;85-years-old, left ventricular ejection&#xD;
           fraction ≦30%, allergy to medications (antiplatelet drugs, heparin, metal alloys, or&#xD;
           contrast agents), a planned surgery within 6 months of PCI or planned thrombolysis,&#xD;
           pregnant, a life expectancy of &lt;6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ④ Participants will sign written informed consent for long-term telephone FU before the&#xD;
           interventional procedure. Participants will be followed by a clinical visit or by a&#xD;
           telephone interview for 30 day, 6 months and 12 months and 24 months post-procedure for&#xD;
           assessment of adverse events. All patients with successful CTO PCI and without moderate&#xD;
           or severe renal insufficiency will be scheduled for angiographic follow-up at 13 months.&#xD;
           Compared with CTA, coronary angiography to evaluate restenosis is appropriate in all&#xD;
           patients especially for severe coronary heart diseases patients with atrial fibrillation&#xD;
           and ventricular arrhythmia. It could provide accurate information about mild-severe&#xD;
           angulation lesion and the stents traits like total stent length. Procedural and outcome&#xD;
           data collection will be collected and entered by operators entered into a dedicated&#xD;
           database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ⑤ The study will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of FMMU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study endpoints and definitions The primary study endpoint of the protocol is the&#xD;
           bionary in-stent restenosisof CTO vessels at the scheduled angiographic follow-up at 13&#xD;
           months. The secondary endpoints are: 1) CTO technique and procedure success rate; and 2)&#xD;
           in-hospital and 30 days MACE (Cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, urgent repeat&#xD;
           tratget vessel revascularization with either pericardiocentssis or surgery and stroke&#xD;
           and stent thrombosis and stroke); 6 months and 1-year and 2-year MACE including death,&#xD;
           MI, and target CTO vessel revascularization and stroke ; and 3) Restenosis scores&#xD;
           (R-scores) of related risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary CTOs will be defined as angiographic evidence of total occlusions with TIMI&#xD;
      (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade 0 and estimated durations of at least 3&#xD;
      months. Estimation of the occlusion duration is based on first onset of anginal symptoms,&#xD;
      prior history of myocardial infarction in the target vessel territory, or comparison with a&#xD;
      prior angiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural success will be defined as angiographic success(final residual stenosis &lt;30% by&#xD;
      visual estimation and TIMI flow grade 3 after CTO recanalization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical success will be defined as a procedural success without In-hospital MACCEs.&#xD;
      In-hospital MACCEs is defined as the composite of non-Q-wave and Q-wave myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI), recurrent angina requiring urgent repeat revascularization with PCI orcoronary bypass&#xD;
      surgery, stroke, and death. Non-Q-wave MI is defined as creatine kinase-MB enzyme elevation&#xD;
      &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal. When new pathological Q waves, in addition to enzyme&#xD;
      elevation, will be observed on the electrocardiogram, the event is defined as a Q-wave MI. In&#xD;
      all patients, creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB is evaluated 6 h after the procedure and&#xD;
      until their normalization if levels is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesion complexity will be judged using the J-CTO (20)and calculated by allocating 1 point&#xD;
      each for non-tapered proximal cap (ie, blunt or ambiguous), any calcification, any&#xD;
      tortuosity, occlusion length &gt;20 mm and any prior unsuccessful attempt. J-CTO score of ≥2 was&#xD;
      defined as complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTO proximal cap location is defined according to American Heart Association (AHA)&#xD;
      classification and additionally coded as either ostial or non-ostial and proximal (left main,&#xD;
      proximal left anterior descending, proximal circumflex or proximal right coronary artery) or&#xD;
      distal (all other sites). Cap morphology is coded as blunt or tapered, or as ambiguous when&#xD;
      there is lack of clarity over the origin of the ongoing vessel. Calcification within the CTO&#xD;
      is coded as none visible, mild(spots only), moderate (&lt;50% of vessel circumference) or severe&#xD;
      (&gt;50% of vessel circumference). Disease proximal and distal to the CTO is classified as&#xD;
      absent, mild, moderate or severe. Aproximal or distal cap side branch is considered present&#xD;
      if occurring ≤3 mm from the respective CTO cap. Occlusion length is estimated by dual&#xD;
      injection, or from apparent length after guidewire crossing. Collaterals are classified&#xD;
      according to Cohen and Rentrop and deemed interventional if, on angiographic inspection, are&#xD;
      thought amenable to crossing by a guidewire and a microcatheter by the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All deaths are considered cardiac unless otherwise documented. Stent thrombosis is defined&#xD;
      according to the Academic Research Consortium criteria (13). Reocclusionis defined as a TIMI&#xD;
      flow grade of 0 to1in the target CTO vessel, where restenosis is defined as &gt; 50% luminal&#xD;
      narrowing at the segment site, including the stent and 5 mm proximal and distal to the stent&#xD;
      edges. Target lesion revascularization (TLR) is defined as any repeat PCI or coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass graft surgery of the target lesion that includes 5 mm proximal and distal to the&#xD;
      stented vessel segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A procedure is considered retrograde if an attempt is made to cross the lesion through a&#xD;
      collateral vessel supplying the target vessel distal to the lesion. Complex lesions with&#xD;
      unclear location of the proximal cap or with poor distal target are initially attempted by&#xD;
      the retrograde approach. In those cases, after positioning of a microcatheter at the distal&#xD;
      CTO cap, a true-to-true retrograde lumen crossing technique is first attempted for shorter&#xD;
      lesions (&lt;20 mm). When entering in the subintimal space or with longer lesions, knuckled&#xD;
      wires are used to reach the proximal cap, followed most often by reverse-controlled&#xD;
      anterograde and retrograde re-entry techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A procedure is considered antegrade if no retrograde crossing attempts are made. An&#xD;
      anterograde approach is initially attempted for short lesions (&lt;20 mm) with clear proximal&#xD;
      cap location and good distal vessel target using a wiring strategy. Anterograde&#xD;
      dissection/re-entry using dedicated devices (CrossBoss and Stingray catheters) is, however,&#xD;
      preferred for longer lesions with an optimal distal re-entry zone, without significant side&#xD;
      branches that could be occluded by the technique, or when an initial wire escalation strategy&#xD;
      failed. Wire-based anterograde dissection/re-entry was also used successfully when an initial&#xD;
      attempt at crossing from a &quot;true-to-true&quot; approach failed. Such a strategy involves the use&#xD;
      of a microcatheter delivered on a knuckled polymer-jacketed wire advanced into the subintimal&#xD;
      dissection plane, with subsequent re-entry into the true distal lumen using a stiff tapered&#xD;
      guidewire or a knuckled guidewire. A Stingray system will be used to cross from the false&#xD;
      lumen to the true lumen, the so-called hybrid procedure, rapidly switching from one approach&#xD;
      to another when the initial strategy attempted is failing.&#xD;
