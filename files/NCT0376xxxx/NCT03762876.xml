    <textblock>
      Changes in trans-hepatic flow after major and extended hepatectomy (EH) can lead to small for&#xD;
      size and flow syndrome (SFSF), which is associated with a significantly higher rate of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The current therapies for SFSF are not effective because tissue&#xD;
      damage following SFSF is usually irreversible and the liver parenchyma loses the ability to&#xD;
      regenerate. Therefore, the best approach to improve patient survival is to predict SFSF and&#xD;
      perform adequate intraoperative preventive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portal vein flow (PVF), hepatic artery flow (HAF), and portal vein pressure (PVP) are the&#xD;
      main criteria for development of SFSF after living donor liver transplantation. The&#xD;
      mechanisms that change trans-hepatic flow are similar after hepatectomy and living donor&#xD;
      liver transplantation. Trans-hepatic flow is routinely measured during liver resection, but&#xD;
      the effect of these changes on SFSF has not been studied. Identifying the factors that alter&#xD;
      trans-hepatic flow after hepatectomy would allow hepatic inflow to be modulated before and&#xD;
      after surgery, to prevent SFSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trans-hepatic flow and pressure parameters (PVF, HAF, and PVP) are routinely measured and&#xD;
      monitored during liver resection. The aim of the proposed study is to analyze changes in&#xD;
      these parameters after major hepatectomy and determine the factors that alter trans-hepatic&#xD;
      flow after hepatectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection is an efficient treatment for primary and secondary hepatic tumors and&#xD;
      increases long term survival. Improvements in patient selection criteria, surgical methods,&#xD;
      and postoperative care have increased the indications for major and extended hepatectomy&#xD;
      (EH). Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is a major complication following EH and is&#xD;
      called small for size and flow syndrome (SFSF). SFSF significantly increases morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The current SFSF treatments are not effective because tissue damage following SFSF&#xD;
      is irreversible and the liver parenchyma loses the ability to regenerate. The best approach&#xD;
      to improve patient survival is to predict SFSF and perform adequate preventive procedures&#xD;
      during liver resection. SFSF is caused by changes in trans-hepatic flow and a low future&#xD;
      liver remnant volume. Portal vein flow (PVF), hepatic artery flow (HAF), and portal vein&#xD;
      pressure (PVP) are the main criteria for SFSF development. Following EH, the ratio of HAF to&#xD;
      the remnant liver weight (HAF/100gr) decreases, while the PVF/100gr and the PVP increase.&#xD;
      This has various pathologic consequences, which lead to SFSF. Troisi et al. suggested an&#xD;
      upper limit of 250 ml/min/100g for PVF to prevent SFSF after living donor liver&#xD;
      transplantation. A vascular modulation that decreases the PVF/100gr and PVP and increases the&#xD;
      HAF/100gr may prevent SFSF. The mechanisms that alter trans-hepatic flow after hepatectomy&#xD;
      and living donor transplantation are similar, but the effect of these changes on SFSF has not&#xD;
      been studied following liver resection. Exploring the changes in trans-hepatic flow after&#xD;
      major and extended hepatectomy and determining the factors that influence these changes would&#xD;
      allow us to modulate hepatic inflow during hepatectomy to prevent PHLF.&#xD;
