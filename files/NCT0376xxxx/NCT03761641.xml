  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is aimed at collecting oculomotor response data from a variety of brain&#xD;
      injuries and impairments, and to secondarily evaluate the functionality and ease of use of&#xD;
      the NeuroTriage device in the ED in patients with any presumed brain injury and/or&#xD;
      impairment. For example, prior studies in adolescents with a concussion have shown that they&#xD;
      tend to overshoot the pattern when asked to follow the movement of the lights in the&#xD;
      binoculars&#xD;

      Study personnel will identify potential subjects in the ED, hospital and ICU during &quot;peak&#xD;
      hours&quot; as appropriate through conferring with medical records, trauma logs, triage notes, and&#xD;
      head CT, MRI, and other brain imaging orders as well as on-duty doctors and nurses to&#xD;
      identify potential subjects. Many of the inclusion/exclusion criteria can be evaluated by a&#xD;
      review of the potential subject's medical records, such as mechanism of injury or impairment,&#xD;
      extent of non-head injuries, prior medical history, and prior clinical visits at the center&#xD;
      of care. When a potential subject is identified and has been screened against the primary set&#xD;
      of inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be approached about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrolling a subject, the research personnel will screen the subject for competency&#xD;
      to provide informed consent. This is necessary because, by its very nature, suspected brain&#xD;
      injury patients may or may not be able to initially provide informed consent. The Galveston&#xD;
      Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) will be used as the standard assessment instrument for&#xD;
      this screening. A score of 75 or greater on the GOAT would indicate that the subject is&#xD;
      competent to provide informed consent. If the subject scores &lt; 75 on the GOAT, then consent&#xD;
      must be provided by a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR). This is a threshold of&#xD;
      competency that has been used in previous studies here at UTSW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects that pass the GOAT will be given time to read the Consent Form and to&#xD;
      consult with family members who may be present or by phone. If the subject agrees to&#xD;
      participate, then they will sign the appropriate forms. A copy of the form will be given to&#xD;
      the subject. The NeuroTriage and GOAT will then be serially performed on the patient no more&#xD;
      than once every two hours (particularly in the ED, where the stay is often short) or with&#xD;
      changes in neurological status.&#xD;

    <description>NeuroTriage binocular handset monitors pupil dynamics &amp; eye position with infrared cameras. Rubber non-allergenic ocular spacers contoured to eye sockets come in contact with the face &amp;cushion between the skin &amp; eyepiece. During pupil dilation tests, an LED briefly illuminates the pupil. The NeuroTriage system measures neurological pupil index, constriction velocity, &amp; dilation velocity. Total pupil dilation testing time is &lt; 1 minute. During saccade-tracking tests, patients direct their gaze towards dim LED targets selectable across the range of view. Visual targets involve center-out ocular motion or smooth pursuit following of illusory movement. The NeuroTriage system measures eye position &amp; movement velocity during these tests. Total saccade-tracking testing takes &lt; 3 minutes. Ocular measures are non-invasive, are done quickly and commonly used to measure neurological function.</description>

      <textblock>
        Patients who present to Parkland ED with suspected brain injury greater than 18 years of&#xD;
        age, of an race or gender. Patients will need to be fluent in Spanish or English&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        One hundred individuals presenting to Parkland Emergency Department, Zale Lipshy and&#xD;
        Clements Hospital for treatment diagnosed to be any form of mild, moderate or severe TBI,&#xD;
        between the ages of 18 and 65 will be given the opportunity to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients injury should have occurred within the past 24 hours,and have an acute brain CT&#xD;
        performed based on clinical care. We will enroll patients presenting to the Emergency&#xD;
        Department (ED) with a history of TBI as per American Congress of Rehabilitation&#xD;
        Medicine(ACRM) Criteria, in which the patient has sustained a traumatically induced*&#xD;
        physiological disruption of brain function, as manifested by â‰¥ one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any period of loss of consciousness (LOC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any loss of memory for events (e.g. amnesia) immediately before or after the accident-&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any alteration of mental state at the time of the accident (feeling dazed,&#xD;
             disoriented, and/or confused)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be permanent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Traumatically induced includes the head being struck, the head striking an object, or the&#xD;
        brain undergoing an acceleration/deceleration movement (e.g. whiplash) without direct&#xD;
        external trauma to the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients will need to be fluent in English or Spanish and be able to personally provide&#xD;
        informed consent or have a legally authorized representative provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals will not be excluded based on gender or race.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have a penetrating Traumatic Brain Injury or a Spinal Cord Injury with ASIA&#xD;
        score of C or worse will not be eligible for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patients that are already participating in an interventional trial (e.g. drug,&#xD;
             devise or behavioral) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English or Spanish speakers will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any cognitive defect that limits comprehension of the study procedures and risks&#xD;
             associated will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant polytrauma that would interfere with assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have a significant history of pre-existing conditions that would&#xD;
             interfere assessments (e.g.substance abuse, alcoholism, HIV/AIDS, major transmittable&#xD;
             diseases that may interfere with consent, endstage cancers, learning disabilities, and&#xD;
             developmental disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on psychiatric hold or patients with a major debilitating mental health&#xD;
             disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) will be excluded as they may&#xD;
             interfere with follow-up and the validity of assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with major debilitating neurological disease (e.g. stroke, CVA, dementia,&#xD;
             tumor) impairing baseline awareness,cognition, or validity of follow-up and outcome&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
