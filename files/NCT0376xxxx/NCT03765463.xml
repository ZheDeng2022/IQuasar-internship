  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aversive sensory phenomena such as premonitory urges play a central role in the behavioral&#xD;
      treatment model of tics. Extinction learning and extinction recall are learning processes&#xD;
      implicated within this model, but have not been directly evaluated in youth with Tourette&#xD;
      syndrome (TS). This study examines extinction learning and extinction recall in youth with TS&#xD;
      using an experimental task. This study will also explore the relationship between extinction&#xD;
      processes (i.e., extinction learning and extinction recall) and treatment outcomes with&#xD;
      behavior therapy. Findings from this investigation will be used to update the behavioral&#xD;
      treatment model, which serves as the basis for evidence-based behavioral interventions.&#xD;

    <measure>Tic severity as assessed by the Hopkins Motor and Vocal Tic Scale (HM/VTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 week after completion of HRT</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will nominate up to five motor and five vocal tics they deem bothersome on the HM/VTS. Each bothersome tic is then rated by a clinician on the composite two (vocal and motor) 5-point HM/VTS scale ranging from none (0) to severe (4) for the motor as well as vocal tics. The individual tic scores are summed (minimum of 0 and maximum of 40) and averaged together to create an average tic severity score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tic severity as assessed by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Revised (YGTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 week after completion of HRT</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS is a clinician-rated semi-structured interview that measures tic symptom severity over the previous week. It consists of 10-items that assess different dimensions of tic severity for motor and vocal tics, which are rated on a 0-5 scale. The YGTSS produces a Total Tic Score (range: 0-50), with higher ratings indicating greater tic severity. The YGTSS has demonstrated treatment sensitivity to pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions.</description>
