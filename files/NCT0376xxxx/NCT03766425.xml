      Comparison of efficacy and safety of Mitomycin and Aflibercept used to support primary&#xD;
      trabeculectomy - a prospective, randomized trial in patients with open-angle glaucoma&#xD;
      undergoing surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dying of retinal&#xD;
      ganglion cells, axonal loss and damage to the optic nerve. This leads to a gradual loss of&#xD;
      the visual field, and in the final stage to blindness. High intraocular pressure is&#xD;
      considered to be the main risk factor for glaucomatous neuropathy. In the treatment we use&#xD;
      pharmacological therapies and surgical treatment. The trabeculectomy has been the golden&#xD;
      standard for the treatment of glaucoma for many years. This procedure consisting in the&#xD;
      creation of a filtering bleb, which allows drainage of aqueous humor from within the eye to&#xD;
      underneath the conjunctiva where it is absorbed. in addition to the surgery,&#xD;
      anti-proliferative substances play a significant role in suppressing the physiological&#xD;
      healing process. Bleb insufficiency observed in the postoperative period results to a large&#xD;
      extent from progressive scarring of the follicle, which is responsible for excessive&#xD;
      fibroblast proliferation and subconjunctival fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic produced by Streptomyces caespitosus. It is one of&#xD;
      the bi- or tri-functional alkylating agents causing cross-linking of DNA and inhibition of&#xD;
      DNA synthesis. Its properties cause that mitomycin is now a popular medicine used to support&#xD;
      trabeculectomy, with proven effectiveness of inhibiting the unwanted healing process of the&#xD;
      fistula, and thus extend its period of its proper functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aflibercept is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Its properties&#xD;
      cause inhibition of the pathological process of formation of new vessels and their excessive&#xD;
      permeability, as well as reduction of leukocyte infiltration and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the effectiveness of primary trabeculectomy in patients with open angle&#xD;
      glaucoma supported with Eylea (Aflibercept) compared to the group of patients treated with&#xD;
      mitomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research conducted at the Department of Glaucoma Diagnostics and Microsurgery in Medical&#xD;
      University of Lublin will include patients treated with antiproliferative substances and&#xD;
      trabeculectomy. Two groups of patients will participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I - patients qualified for mitomycin trabeculectomy Group II - patients qualified for&#xD;
      Eylea assisted trabeculectomy (Aflibercept) Mitomycin will be administered in the first group&#xD;
      of patients during an operation at a dose of 0.3mg / ml for 3 minutes on a soaked sponge.&#xD;
      Aflibercept will be applied intraoperatively in a dose of of 0.05 ml (40 mg / ml)&#xD;
      subconjunctival and one week after surgery in the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Open angle glaucoma or capsular glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient's age&gt; 40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Local treatment ineffective due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. intraocular pressure more than 21mmHg with maximum pharmacological therapy (using&#xD;
                B-blocker + carbonic anhydrase + prostaglandins) or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. intolerance to topical treatment or&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. progression in the visual field examination (assessed on the basis of MD, PSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lack of previous ophthalmological surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. No previous laser gonioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. No previous laser trabeculoplasty or laser trabeculoplasty performed for more than a&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient with angle-closure glaucoma or secondary glaucoma (except for glaucoma in the&#xD;
           course of pseudoexfoliation syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One-eye patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A patient with pseudophakia or aphakia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient after previous ophthalmic procedures (phacoemulsification with intraocular lens&#xD;
           implantation, traditional pars plana vitrectomy, keratoplasty).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A patient diagnosed or suspected of having uveitis or intraocular inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Any corneal abnormalities or other conditions that make it impossible to reliably test&#xD;
           with an applanation tonometer in the treated eye, including earlier refractive surgery&#xD;
           of the eye&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of surgery in both groups will be assessed at subsequent postoperative controls&#xD;
      based on the following diagnostic tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual acuity examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraocular pressure examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the filtering bleb in the slit lamp;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A photo of the filtering bleb;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography of the filtration bleb;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual field;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of corneal endothelial cell density.&#xD;
