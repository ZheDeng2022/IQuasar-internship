  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on patients&#xD;
      with chronic periodontitis during a post-orthodontic period for 12 months. Following aspects&#xD;
      will be assessed: 1. Effects on tooth stability maintenance and bone remodeling. 2. Effects&#xD;
      on periodontal inflammation status. 3. Effects on cervical dentin sensitivity and quality of&#xD;
      life. The study design is a randomised controlled trail. To eliminate any bias, the&#xD;
      investigator will initially hypothesis there is no significant difference in the&#xD;
      aforementioned aspects between teeth retained with an adjunctive LLLT strategy and those&#xD;
      retained in a conventional regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomised split-mouth design based on the result of investigator's&#xD;
      pilot study. Thirty-five non-smoking Ethnic Chinese patients (male and female, age: 25-65&#xD;
      years) with chronic periodontitis will be recruited. The teeth in experimental group will&#xD;
      receive LLLT during orthodontic retention period for 12 months, while the teeth in the&#xD;
      control (placebo) group will not receive laser therapy. Orthodontic occlusal indices will be&#xD;
      measured to explore LLLT's role in maintaining tooth stability. The effects of LLLT on&#xD;
      periodontal inflammation status will be evaluated by assessing clinical periodontal&#xD;
      parameters and the levels of supra-gingival and sub-gingival bacteria. The effects of LLLT on&#xD;
      bone remodelling will be explored by testing the biochemical biomarkers in gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid (GCF). Cone-beam computed tomography will also be used to provide clinical&#xD;
      evidence of periodontal status and bone remodelling. Possible effects of LLLT on patient's&#xD;
      quality of life will be investigated via validated questionnaires, subjective assessment of&#xD;
      tooth sensitivity, and objective measurement of bite force.&#xD;

    <description>LLLT will be performed by a diode gallium-aluminum-arsenide (Ga-Al-As) laser with a 940-nm wavelength (Ezlase; Biolase Technology Inc., Irvine, CA) and delivered by a quadrant-sized probe which cover the region from the central incisor to the first molar on the test side. The laser probe will be 1 cm from the soft tissue around the test tooth at the gingival margin and alveolar mucosa covering the root area using a setting of 800 milliwatt in a continuous wave. Each tooth will receive 30 seconds of exposure, with no more than 8.6 J/cm2 of energy delivered. In addition, a spot-size laser probe will be applied for 30 seconds 5 mm from the cervical dentin with an output power of 700 milliwatt to reduce tooth sensitivity.</description>
