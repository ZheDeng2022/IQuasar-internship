  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effect and tolerance of a thymol containing dietary supplement,&#xD;
      Musclin, in healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open label, uncontrolled, ascending dose clinical trial to assess the&#xD;
      tolerance and effect of orally ingested Musclin, 20 mg thymol per capsule, in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects. In addition, this study will evaluate whether Musclin has an effect on creatine&#xD;
      kinase and myostatin levels. The study will aim to enroll 20 consenting men and women.&#xD;
      Consented subjects will ingest 2 capsules of Musclin daily for 30 days and increase to 4&#xD;
      capsules daily for an additional 30 days . Physical assessments and biological samples will&#xD;
      be collected at baseline (day 0) and at end of treatment (d 60). Surveys to include reported&#xD;
      stamina and energy levels will be collected at baseline, prior to increased dosage (d 30) and&#xD;
      end of treatment period. Risk to participants is expected to be minimal and will be outlined&#xD;
      through an informed consent.&#xD;
