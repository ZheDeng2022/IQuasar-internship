  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial comprises an Enrollment Visit, a Qualification Phase, a Treatment Phase (including&#xD;
      3 treatment periods), a Final Examination, and a Follow-up Phone Call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Qualification Phase includes a naloxone challenge test (to verify that participants are&#xD;
      not opioid-dependent) and a drug discrimination test (to determine whether or not&#xD;
      participants are able to distinguish intranasally administered active drug from placebo).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive a single intranasal dose each of oxycodone active&#xD;
      pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and matching placebo in a double-blind manner. The total mass&#xD;
      of each single dose will be 30 milligrams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who successfully complete the Qualification Phase are eligible to be included in&#xD;
      the Treatment Phase. During the Treatment Phase, participants will receive test product,&#xD;
      comparator, and placebo following a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-way crossover&#xD;
      design. Participants will receive a single intranasal dose of each of the treatments&#xD;
      (combined doses of investigational medicinal product {IMP}) on Day 1, Day 4, and Day 7 of the&#xD;
      Treatment Phase. A single dose of a treatment is defined as insufflation of single doses of&#xD;
      the 2 applicable IMPs in quick succession. The 2 applicable IMPs must be insufflated in the&#xD;
      following pre-defined order. Oxycodone API or placebo to match oxycodone API must always be&#xD;
      insufflated first. Oxycodone immediate release (IR) abuse-deterrent formulation (ADF) or&#xD;
      placebo to match oxycodone IR ADF must always be insufflated second. The total mass of each&#xD;
      single dose of treatment will be 570 milligrams.&#xD;
