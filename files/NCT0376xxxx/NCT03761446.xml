  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the impact of type 2 diabetes on muscle atrophy during&#xD;
      a period of bed rest and recovery of muscle mass, strength, and physical function following&#xD;
      bed rest.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with type 2 diabetes experience an accelerated rate of sarcopenia, which is the&#xD;
      deterioration in muscle mass, strength and physical performance. Periods of disuse caused by&#xD;
      illness or hospitalization cause rapid loss of muscle mass and strength, which negatively&#xD;
      impact physical function upon re-ambulation. The impact of type 2 diabetes on acute muscle&#xD;
      atrophy and recovery from disuse is a critical issue that has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objectives of this study are to employ highly innovative methods in muscle biopsy&#xD;
      specimens in order to decipher the temporal sequence by which mitochondrial dysfunction and&#xD;
      lipotoxicity in older adults with T2D impact atrophy and recovery of muscle mass, strength&#xD;
      and physical function following bed rest. Older adults with and without T2D will complete 10&#xD;
      days of strict bed rest followed by 4 weeks of ambulatory recovery. During bed rest muscle&#xD;
      biopsies will be collected to determine mitochondrial function and lipid profile. During the&#xD;
      recovery period the recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
