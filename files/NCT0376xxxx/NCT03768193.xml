  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic surgery, and surgery involving the chest wall in general, is associated with poorly&#xD;
      controlled acute pain, which may result in delayed functional recovery, and may progress to&#xD;
      chronic pain. Multimodal opioid-sparing analgesia regimens are a key component of the&#xD;
      thoracic surgery enhanced recovery pathway, the aim of which is to improve outcomes in&#xD;
      patients undergoing both minimally invasive and open thoracic surgical procedures. Novel&#xD;
      interfascial plane blocks are emerging as feasible alternatives to central neuraxial&#xD;
      analgesia techniques in a variety of clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to show non-inferiority of serratus anterior blockade compared with&#xD;
      surgically placed paravertebral blocks in the management of perioperative acute pain in&#xD;
      patients undergoing VATS procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-thoracotomy pain syndrome is an unwanted complication of thoracic surgery. Poorly&#xD;
      controlled pain may precipitate increased morbidity in the immediate and early postoperative&#xD;
      periods due to its adverse effects on respiratory mechanics and mobilisation, which may&#xD;
      result in further morbidity such as postoperative pulmonary complications and thrombosis.&#xD;
      Poor perioperative management of this pain may also result in the development of chronic&#xD;
      pain. Enhanced recovery, particularly functional recovery has become an important goal in the&#xD;
      perioperative management of our patients. A key principle of this pathway is multimodal&#xD;
      opioid-sparing analgesia to facilitate improved recovery and patient outcomes. Regional&#xD;
      anaesthesia forms the cornerstone of this multimodal analgesia regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, thoracic epidural and thoracic paravertebral blockade have been the main forms&#xD;
      of regional anaesthesia utilised in thoracic surgical patients undergoing lung resection.&#xD;
      With the increasing use of minimally invasive thoracic surgery and with a cohort of patients&#xD;
      who may not always be suitable for central neuraxial blockade, alternatives are needed. More&#xD;
      recently, there has been an emerging use of interfascial plane blocks in this patient group.&#xD;
      The interest in these techniques is derived from case reports, case series, cadaveric&#xD;
      studies, and small clinical trials, which have demonstrated clinical efficacy in a variety of&#xD;
      elective and emergency thoracic surgical procedures and also in chronic thoracic pain&#xD;
      syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deep serratus anterior plane (deep SAP) block is a relatively new interfascial plane&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia technique, which has been postulated to provide analgesia of the entire&#xD;
      hemithorax. The mechanism of its analgesic effects are believed to occur via blockade of the&#xD;
      lateral cutaneous branches of the thoracic intercostal nerves (T2-T12), which produces&#xD;
      analgesia of the anterolateral chest wall. A recent anatomical study by Mayes et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated consistent blockade of the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves.&#xD;
      Clinical studies, although small, have shown dermatomal spread in the T2 - T9 distribution of&#xD;
      the anterolateral chest wall. Therefore, this block presents a potential alternative to&#xD;
      central neuraxial blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, whether SAP blockade can produce non-inferior analgesia compared with either&#xD;
      thoracic epidural or thoracic paravertebral, both in terms of somatic +/- autonomic blockade,&#xD;
      and the reliability of dermatomal spread, has been questioned by some.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided continuous deep serratus anterior plane blockade compared with&#xD;
      surgically-placed continuous paravertebral blockade, for perioperative analgesia, in the&#xD;
      patients undergoing minimally-invasive videoscopic thoracic surgery.&#xD;
