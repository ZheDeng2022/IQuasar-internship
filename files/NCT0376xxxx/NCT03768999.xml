    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance coronary angiography (MRCA) has its advantage in its ability to assess the&#xD;
      coronary artery morphology without radiation or contrast media. The clinical application of&#xD;
      MRCA is still challenging mainly because of technical limitations such as: its time-consuming&#xD;
      image acquisition, inconsistent image quality, and low spatial resolution. Optimization of&#xD;
      MRCA image acquisition method is in progress and compressed sensing (CS) with post-processing&#xD;
      (de-noising) by deep learning reconstruction (DLR) is promising to solve these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of a consensus method to assess the coronary stenosis on MRCA is another issue.&#xD;
      Generally, a stenosis in MRCA is observed as a signal intensity (SI) drop along the artery&#xD;
      compared to the healthy segments. A previous study has reported from its comparison of MRCA&#xD;
      with coronary angiography (CAG) that the SI drop of 35% in MRCA stenosis lesion corresponded&#xD;
      to the significant stenosis in CAG. Although this SI drop phenomenon was not observed in a&#xD;
      different study on chronic total obstruction cases. One of the hypothesized reasons is that&#xD;
      the SI drop in MRCA is affected not only by the stenosis severity but also the plaque&#xD;
      characteristics, which is not assessable by CAG. To investigate this hypothesis coronary CTA&#xD;
      is needed, which is a robust modality to assess coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics.&#xD;
      Comparison between MRCA with CTA has the potential to give better information for developing&#xD;
      a robust method to assess MRCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of MRCA scanned with&#xD;
      optimized protocol and post-processing, and to develop robust coronary artery assessment&#xD;
      method on MRCA, by comparison with clinical coronary CTA.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of significant stenosis of the coronary artery and managing the ischemia is&#xD;
      important to prevent cardiac events. Coronary CT angiography (CTA) is one of the current gold&#xD;
      standard methods to assess coronary stenosis as well as coronary angiography (CAG), but both&#xD;
      coronary CTA and CAG are limited by radiation exposure or contrast media administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance coronary angiography (MRCA) has its advantage in its ability to assess the&#xD;
      coronary artery morphology without radiation or contrast media. Unfortunately, the clinical&#xD;
      application of MRCA is still challenging mainly because of technical limitation such as its&#xD;
      time-consuming image acquisition, inconsistent image quality, and low spatial resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimization of MRCA image acquisition process is under great interest and compressed sensing&#xD;
      (CS) is one of the promising methods to reduce the acquisition time. Although it's noise-like&#xD;
      granular characteristics is a weakness due to its random k-space data acquisition. The&#xD;
      granularity may affect the interpretation of the MRCA images considering the small diameter&#xD;
      of the coronary arteries. To solve this problem, post-processing denoising approach with deep&#xD;
      learning reconstruction (dDLR) is proposed, however too much image smoothing may lead to&#xD;
      unfavorable image blurring or produce artefactual smoothing leading to the removal of&#xD;
      clinically meaningful signal intensity drops across the artery. Hence, merely assessing the&#xD;
      noise level is insufficient. Evaluation of the optimized images with coronary CTA, which is&#xD;
      one of the current gold standards, is inevitable to assess its clinical feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of a consensus method to assess the coronary stenosis on MRCA is another problem.&#xD;
      MRCA interpretation is generally performed visually, but its quantification is clinically&#xD;
      important to detect the significant stenosis. A previous study has reported by investigating&#xD;
      the signal intensity (SI) profile across the coronary artery and its drop of 35% corresponded&#xD;
      to significant stenosis by coronary angiography (CAG). Although this SI drop phenomenon was&#xD;
      not observed in a different study on chronic total obstruction cases. One of the hypothesized&#xD;
      reasons is that the SI drop in MRCA is affected not only by the stenosis severity but also&#xD;
      the plaque characteristics, which is not assessable by CAG. To confirm this hypothesis&#xD;
      coronary CTA is needed, which is a robust modality to assess coronary stenosis and plaque&#xD;
      characteristics. Comparison between MRCA with CTA has the potential to give better&#xD;
      information for developing a robust method to assess MRCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of MRCA scanned with&#xD;
      optimized protocol and post-processing, and to develop robust coronary artery assessment&#xD;
      method on MRCA, by comparison with clinical coronary CTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-randomized study. Overall 50 participants in total will be&#xD;
      recruited within 12 months. Each participant will undergo one non-contrast MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The candidate for recruitment will be clinical patients who underwent clinical coronary CTA&#xD;
      within 6 months. Candidate participant selection will be performed by investigating the&#xD;
      electronic medical record (EMR). Then the candidate participants will receive a phone&#xD;
      screening using a questionnaire which contents are corresponding to the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (which will be described later). When the candidate fulfills all the&#xD;
      criteria and if the person gives consent, the investigators will recruit the person into this&#xD;
      study. The written consent will be obtained at the MRI preparation room from one of the study&#xD;
      team members. The consent to use the previously scanned coronary CTA is obtained at the same&#xD;
      time of consent for the MRI, although the investigators do not include the clinical CTA&#xD;
      acquisition into this study protocol because it is a routine clinical care that performed&#xD;
      previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the MRI scanning, the participant will get blood pressure measurement to confirm the&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) â‰¥110 mmHg, which is an inclusion criteria for a sublingual&#xD;
      nitro tablet be administered to the participant in advance to the MRI. Sublingual nitro&#xD;
      tablet administration is aimed to dilate the coronary artery, which is a routine procedure in&#xD;
      coronary CTA as well. When the SBP was &lt;110 mmHg, then the participant will not receive the&#xD;
      sublingual nitro. The participant will undergo non-contrast cardiac MRI, including&#xD;
      non-contrast whole heart MRI with T2-prepared segmented fast low-angle shot 3D spoiled&#xD;
      gradient echo sequence with ECG-gating, diaphragm navigator-gating, and fat suppression. All&#xD;
      the scans will be performed with a 3 Tesla Vantage Galan scanner (Canon Medical systems).&#xD;
      After the acquisition, the MRI data will be reconstructed and then undergo post-processing&#xD;
      denoising. The DICOM images will be anonymized and stored in a folder for this study inside&#xD;
      Hopkins network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRCA and CTA image assessment will be performed from anonymized images on workstations&#xD;
      with suitable function.&#xD;
