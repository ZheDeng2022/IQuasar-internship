  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Societal changes have resulted in reduced demands to be active and increased daily time spent&#xD;
      sitting. Sedentary behavior (SB) has been linked to many health problems such as type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and heart disease. University students are a high-risk population for excessive SB.&#xD;
      Increasing the length and frequency of breaks from sitting and increasing the time spent&#xD;
      standing and engaged in light physical activity are ways to decrease SB. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether combining a Health Action Process Approach-based&#xD;
      (theory-driven), specifically action and coping planning intervention, with a tailored text&#xD;
      messaging intervention can reduce occupational (student) sitting time among university&#xD;
      students. Participants in the intervention group will receive one behavioural counselling&#xD;
      session, followed by daily, tailored text messages over a 6-week period, with a focus on&#xD;
      encouraging them to reduce their sitting time as a student by increasing their frequency and&#xD;
      duration of breaks from sitting, as well as time spent standing and engaged in&#xD;
      light-intensity physical activity. It is expected that university students who receive the&#xD;
      planning intervention and tailored text messages will report greater increases in&#xD;
      non-sedentary behaviours (e.g., break frequency, break duration, standing, light physical&#xD;
      activity) than those who do not receive the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized controlled trial design, the purpose of this study will be to examine&#xD;
      whether combining a Health Action Process Approach (HAPA)-based intervention, specifically&#xD;
      action and coping planning, with a tailored text message intervention can reduce occupational&#xD;
      (student) sitting time by increasing frequency and length of breaks from sitting and&#xD;
      non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) behaviours (i.e., standing, light-intensity&#xD;
      physical activity) among university students. A secondary purpose will be to examine the&#xD;
      effects of the intervention on participants' action planning, coping planning and action&#xD;
      control regarding reducing their sitting time as a student, as well as self-rated work&#xD;
      performance and health-related outcomes (i.e., role limitations due to physical health, role&#xD;
      limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue).&#xD;
      Another secondary objective will be to determine if action and coping planning and action&#xD;
      control towards reducing occupational (student) sitting time are related to actual break&#xD;
      behaviour, time spent standing, and time spent in light-intensity physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, participants in the intervention group (sedentary intervention group) will&#xD;
      report greater break frequency and break duration, time spent standing, and time spent in&#xD;
      light-intensity physical activity, compared to participants in the control group (no&#xD;
      treatment). In addition, it is hypothesized that participants in the intervention group will&#xD;
      report greater action and coping planning and action control towards reducing sitting time as&#xD;
      a student, as well as improved work- and health-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a prospective, 2-group, repeated measure, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) design. Participants will be full-time university and/or college students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants (estimated enrolment: 112) will be recruited by Andrew Scott Rollo,&#xD;
      Co-Investigator, for this study. Participants will be recruited from (1) undergraduate and&#xD;
      graduate classes at the University of Western Ontario. Professors across faculties at UWO&#xD;
      will be contacted via email and asked to (a) distribute the recruitment poster and study&#xD;
      invitation to students in their course(s), and/or (b) allow study investigator(s) to provide&#xD;
      a short presentation during their lecture time. The opportunity for students to participate&#xD;
      will be posted on their UWO OWL site, as well as presented in their class. Participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to contact the researcher via email and/or phone if they wish to participate or&#xD;
      receive additional details prior to making a decision as to whether to participate. A second&#xD;
      recruitment approach will involve recruiting full-time university and/or college students&#xD;
      through recruitment posters distributed through social media (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn).&#xD;
      Recruitment posters and brief study details will be posted on social media. For social media&#xD;
      outlets, permission from group administrators will be sought prior to posting social media&#xD;
      recruitment materials, as applicable. As stated previous, university students interested in&#xD;
      the study will be instructed to contact the researcher via email and/or phone to sign up for&#xD;
      study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point of contact, an email response will be sent to any interested individual.&#xD;
      University students who choose to take part in this study will receive a link (with serial&#xD;
      number authorization code) via email that directs them to the Letter of Information,&#xD;
      electronic Informed Consent, and questionnaire for assessment of baseline measurements, which&#xD;
      will be administered through a third party website called SoSci (online survey service).&#xD;
      After viewing the Letter of Information and indicating that they consent to participate in&#xD;
      the study (by clicking &quot;I agree&quot; on the survey), participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      brief demographics questionnaire, followed by a questionnaire for baseline assessment of&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the Baseline assessment and prior to intervention delivery, all&#xD;
      participants will be randomized, using computer-generated randomized stratification, into&#xD;
      either a 6-week HAPA-treatment (SB-related planning + text messages intervention) or&#xD;
      waitlisted control (no treatment) condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, all participants will be sent a specific email (outlined below) depending on&#xD;
      group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-baseline questionnaire EMAIL response sent to intervention participants,&#xD;
      participants (randomly assigned to the intervention group only) will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      day and time (within 3 days of completing the baseline assessment) that they would be&#xD;
      available to schedule the behavioural counselling session they will receive. As a follow-up&#xD;
      to electronic consent, written consent will be obtained during administration of the&#xD;
      behavioural counselling session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-baseline questionnaire EMAIL response sent to control participants, they will&#xD;
      simply be reminded that they will receive a link to a questionnaire every two week for 8&#xD;
      weeks in their email and will be asked to complete these upon receiving them. Participants in&#xD;
      the control group will also be asked to SIGN and RETURN the LOI/written informed consent via&#xD;
      email at their earliest convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those in the treatment group, the study objective will be to reduce occupational&#xD;
      (student) sitting time by increasing non- sedentary or NEAT behaviours (i.e., increasing&#xD;
      break frequency to a break every 30-45 minutes, with each break having a duration of 2-4&#xD;
      minutes, and increasing their time spent standing and engaged in light- intensity PA.&#xD;
      Participants randomly assigned to the control group will receive no information or&#xD;
      intervention of any kind and will only be asked to complete the outcome questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the agreed upon and scheduled time, the researcher will deliver the intervention (i.e.,&#xD;
      implement the appropriate HAPA-based behavioural counselling session involving action and&#xD;
      coping planning) either in person OR electronically via phone and an online presentation&#xD;
      website (www.zoho.com) (only for those randomized into the intervention group). The method of&#xD;
      delivery will entirely depend on the participant's availability, preference, and whether they&#xD;
      live within driving distance of the investigator. To ensure equal numbers of local and remote&#xD;
      participants, two computer-generated random number lists will be created by the lead&#xD;
      investigator using an online research randomization program. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a second informed consent (i.e., written informed consent) at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one-on-one counseling sessions will be delivered by the principal investigator to ensure&#xD;
      standardization between participants. During the counseling session, the researcher will&#xD;
      first ask if the participant has any strategies that he/she would like to try or think would&#xD;
      be effective. As much as possible, strategies will be kept as original and specific to the&#xD;
      participant's lifestyle as possible, while still fulfilling the study objectives. Upon&#xD;
      creation of each strategy, the researcher will ask the participant if they think that the&#xD;
      strategy they came up with is realistic. The number of strategies will also be personalized&#xD;
      depending on how the participant's baseline measures compare to the objectives of their&#xD;
      treatment group. This will be done in order to attenuate for any neglected/unused strategies&#xD;
      by those with larger differences between baseline and objective values. Similarly, coping&#xD;
      strategies will be created alongside each strategy in order to boost the adherence to the&#xD;
      developed strategies. When an action plan strategy is developed, the researcher will ask the&#xD;
      participant &quot;what are some challenges you foresee with executing this strategy?&quot;, followed by&#xD;
      &quot;what do you think is something we can do in order to overcome this/these challenges?&quot; This&#xD;
      will be done in order to keep the coping strategies personalized to the participant's&#xD;
      lifestyle. Overall, the behavioral counseling sessions will take approximately 20 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Participants will be given the form with their action plan and coping strategies&#xD;
      and told to display it somewhere prominent so they will be reminded of the strategies. The&#xD;
      principal investigator will conduct the planning interventions in a non-interfering manner by&#xD;
      providing brief instructions and then remaining available to answer any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the HAPA-treatment condition will then be entered into a contact list on&#xD;
      the text-messaging website called &quot;Oh Don't Forget.&quot; &quot;Oh Don't Forget,&quot; is a Web-based&#xD;
      application (http://ohdontforget.com) that works through &quot;Recess Mobile&quot; to send messages&#xD;
      from a computer to mobile phone numbers that are programmed into the application. All&#xD;
      participants will begin receiving tailored text messages the day after receiving their&#xD;
      one-on-one counseling session. Every participant will receive the same daily texts as each&#xD;
      other participant in their group, with times varying slightly depending on their schedule. As&#xD;
      planning is an ongoing process, participants will be reminded (via text message) to formulate&#xD;
      another set of action and coping plans at the beginning of weeks 3 and 5. Upon completion of&#xD;
      the intervention period at 6 weeks, participants will be notified that they will no longer be&#xD;
      receiving text messages and that the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial behavioural counseling session, ALL participants will be told they will&#xD;
      receive a link to a questionnaire (assessment of primary and secondary outcomes) in their&#xD;
      email every 2 weeks, for the next 6 weeks (i.e., weeks 2, 4, and 6), and to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire the day they receive it. Participants will also be told that 2 weeks following&#xD;
      the end of the 6-week intervention, there will be a follow-up questionnaire (week 8), which&#xD;
      they will receive and be asked to complete. Regardless of group assignment, all participants&#xD;
      will complete the same outcome measures at Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 2-week&#xD;
      follow-up (8 weeks). All primary and secondary outcome questionnaires will be completed&#xD;
      online and administered through a third party website called SoSci (online survey service).&#xD;
      Participants in the HAPA-treatment condition will also be reminded via text to complete&#xD;
      these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes including frequency of breaks, length of breaks, and NEAT behaviours&#xD;
      (i.e., standing, light- intensity PA) in the occupational domain of study (i.e., as a&#xD;
      student) will be assessed using subjective, self-report approaches. Secondary analyses will&#xD;
      be performed to examine effects of the intervention on theoretical determinants of behaviour&#xD;
      change (i.e., action planning, coping planning, action control), as well as participants'&#xD;
      perceived work-related outcomes (i.e., self-rated work performance) and health-related&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e., role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to personal or&#xD;
      emotional problems, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue). All primary outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed at four time points (baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks), and again at a two-week follow-up&#xD;
      (8 weeks). Action and coping planning and action control towards reducing occupational&#xD;
      (student) sitting time will be assessed at the same time points. Secondary outcome variables&#xD;
      (i.e., perceived work- and health-related outcomes) will be assessed pre- (baseline) and&#xD;
      post-intervention (6 weeks).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive a one-on-one behavioral counseling session, and planning sheet as reference for developing strategies as part of their Action/Coping Plan. Participants will be asked to form 3-4 actions plans specifying when, where, how, and for how long they would reduce occupational (student) sitting time; and anticipate potential barriers and identify ways they could be overcome. Strategies will explicitly focus on the ultimate objective of increasing break frequency to every 30-45 minutes, achieving a break duration of 2-3 minutes, and increasing time spent standing and engaged in light-intensity PA, in the occupational domain (i.e. as a student; during school-related activities).&#xD;
Participants will also receive sedentary behaviour-related text messages twice daily, depending on their preferences and schedule, which will act as mini-booster interventions.</description>
