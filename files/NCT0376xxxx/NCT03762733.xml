      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A person s blood, tissue, and other samples contain DNA. Cancer is a disease of cells that&#xD;
      are not working properly. It is caused by changes in DNA that build up. Researchers want to&#xD;
      do future studies on DNA changes This may help them learn how to guide treatment for cancer.&#xD;
      They need biological samples like tumors, blood, and urine for these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create a place to collect and store biological samples from people with gynecologic&#xD;
      malignancies like breast cancer. Samples from certain relatives of theirs will be collected&#xD;
      too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who are being seen at NIH for breast cancer or other gynecologic&#xD;
      malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their biological relatives of the same age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about their family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. This will include questions about&#xD;
      age, ethnicity, and disease history. They will also answer questions about their medical&#xD;
      treatments and responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give a tumor tissue sample. This will not be taken specifically for this&#xD;
      study. It will be from a previous procedure or one that is already planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other samples may be taken only if a procedure is required for treatment. These include bone&#xD;
      marrow, cerebrospinal fluid, and other fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of doctors and other professionals will oversee the sample storage place. The group&#xD;
      will review all requests to be sure the use of the specimens is valid.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased understanding of the genomic variations of cancer through laboratory evaluations&#xD;
      can result in breakthroughs in treatment and improved patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exceptional responders on clinical trials may have mutational characteristics that are unique&#xD;
      and unknown, necessitating identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current drug development strategies employ precision oncology. This approach identifies&#xD;
      molecular targets, with therapies being either chosen or developed to interact with the&#xD;
      specific target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection and banking of a variety of tissue samples for future translational studies&#xD;
      would support research and advance the mission of the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural effusions, ascites as well as other tissues, such as blood, CSF, tumor, bone marrow,&#xD;
      and urine, provide a unique opportunity to conduct a variety of translational research,&#xD;
      addressing many clinical questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of a tissue repository would enhance the mission of the NCI, in helping to&#xD;
      advance research supporting precision oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a tissue repository for the collection and banking of tissue samples from&#xD;
      patients with breast and/or other gynecologic malignancies, as well as patients consenting&#xD;
      1st -3rd degree biological relatives, seen at the NIH for support of future translational&#xD;
      research conducted at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal diagnosis of breast or other gynecologic malignancy, or be a 1st-3rd degree&#xD;
      biological relative of a patient with cancer, currently or previously on a NIH clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects (index patient with cancer and their 1st-3rd degree biological relatives) must&#xD;
      sign consent and enroll onto this study, in order to donate tissue for biobanking on this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults, &gt;= age 18, willing to provide tissue for biobanking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples include, but are not limited to, tumor (e.g., tissue, outside paraffin blocks or&#xD;
      slides), blood, serum, plasma, and urine; to be collected after subjects have met eligibility&#xD;
      and signed consent. Clinically-indicated samples (e.g., bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      (CSF), malignant ascites, and effusions) collected under treatment protocols may be&#xD;
      transferred to this biorepository protocol for research We will also obtain samples (mainly&#xD;
      blood) from volunteer, consenting 1st-3rd degree biological relatives of patients with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed cancer, to be paired with their family member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue will be accessed by study investigators. Additional CCR investigators who wish to use&#xD;
      tissue from this repository must first provide a written Letter of Intent, (LOI), to be&#xD;
      reviewed by an investigator appointed ad hoc committee for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays used for sample processing, establishment of cell lines, patient derived xenograft&#xD;
      models, and storage are described in detail within this protocol. Also, some assays for&#xD;
      future translational research are either listed or described herein. Further detailed&#xD;
      description of experimental designs, along with statistical analysis, will be provided within&#xD;
      future investigator-initiated sample use addendums to this protocol, or new IRB approved&#xD;
      protocols, developed in order to study samples from this biorepository.&#xD;
