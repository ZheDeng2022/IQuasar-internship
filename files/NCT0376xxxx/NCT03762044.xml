      This study evaluates the effectiveness of an experimental proposal therapy for upper limb&#xD;
      lymphedema secondary to breast called Activity-oriented proprioceptive antiedema therapy&#xD;
      (TAPA) facing the consensual gold standard treatment, the complete decongestive therapy. TAPA&#xD;
      consists in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health education / patient empowerment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurodynamic activities oriented to Activities of Daily Living (ADL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises oriented to ADL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-adherent self-adhesive antiedema of low compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of patients will receive TAPA treatment while the other half will receive CDT standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is defined as the abnormal accumulation of tissue proteins, which is accompanied&#xD;
      of edema and chronic inflammation of a limb, so post-mastectomy lymphedema is one of the most&#xD;
      serious sequelae of Breast Cancer (BC) that affects the quality of life of women operated for&#xD;
      breast cancer. Its incidence is approximately between 6 and 30% of patients and its&#xD;
      prevalence varies between 15-20%. It is considered a process without spontaneous resolution&#xD;
      that involves the application of a palliative therapy conservative for life, with preventive&#xD;
      measures to reduce it and prevent complications and an expected increase in the number of&#xD;
      patients with lymphedema in the next years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in work performance resulting from lymphedema vary from minor temporary changes to&#xD;
      significant difficulties in the ADL, depending on the chronicity and severity of the&#xD;
      affectation. It could affect physical components and psychological, as well as social and&#xD;
      economic environment. In these limitations on activities and / or restrictions of&#xD;
      participation, the Occupational Therapists (OT) provide a unique approach, since they are&#xD;
      professionals specifically enabled for the use of the therapeutic potential of the activity&#xD;
      and graduation of its control parameters in favor of the best occupational performance&#xD;
      possible of the person. Furthermore, there are some research that support the inclusion of OT&#xD;
      in the cancer rehabilitation and reveal a significant need for more research to explore ways&#xD;
      in which the OT favorably influences the results of the cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anamnesis, clinical exploration and complementary studies if necessary, allow us confirm&#xD;
      the diagnosis of lymphedema, stage, possibilities of progression and approach the most&#xD;
      indicated therapeutic in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conservative therapeutic of upper limb lymphoedema secondary to breast cancer plan&#xD;
      includes preventive exercises and lifestyle habits, complete decongestive therapy (CDT) and&#xD;
      compression garments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CDT comprises a series of measures, a first intensive phase consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kinesitherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multilayer bandage. The maintenance phase is based on self-care and the use of&#xD;
           compression garments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the consensus of the experts in the evidence of decongestive therapy in lymphedema,&#xD;
      there is still a lack of evidence to inform the optimal doses of treatment and the level of&#xD;
      evidence about its efficacy in the treatment of lymphedema is only moderately strong, due to&#xD;
      the scarcity of randomized trials with control group, well interventions controlled, accurate&#xD;
      measures of volume, mobility or function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, the prescription of compression garments for lymphoedema is very varied and it may&#xD;
      be due to the lack of underlying evidence to inform about the treatment. The evidence also&#xD;
      suggests that the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of rehabilitation post-operative BC&#xD;
      should also consider the self-control (empowerment) of patients, approaches to redesign the&#xD;
      lifestyle and incorporate aspects of the promotion of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, there are studies that confirm that women with lymphedema and pain after&#xD;
      BC may present alterations in neural mechanosensitivity, neuropathic pain, as a result of&#xD;
      nerve compression or peripheral neuropathy induced by chemotherapy and that it is worth&#xD;
      conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the techniques of Neural mobilization (NM) oriented&#xD;
      to the functionality of upper extremities, supporting the clinical mechanism of NM in the&#xD;
      reduction of intraneural edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published research suggests incorporating proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)&#xD;
      with the traditional NM method, to facilitate the process of treatment for patients with&#xD;
      lymphoedema, because it induces powerful synergistic effects on the volume of edema, range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM) of the shoulder, pain and depression. That treatment independently or in&#xD;
      combination with laser also improves these variables and even the speed of blood circulation&#xD;
      in the armpit. Furthermore, in a study in which bandaging could not be used and CDT was&#xD;
      combined with PNF and respiration, reducing lymphedema and improving ROM too, which could&#xD;
      improve performance of activities, level of participation and, therefore, quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are research supporting use of CobanÂ®3M bandage as early start of pressotherapy in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment of lymphedema to reduce prolonged edema (agent cause of multiple&#xD;
      complications and functional loss), we consider the possibility of testing the efficacy of a&#xD;
      bandage with similar characteristics, in terms of elasticity and self-adherence, more&#xD;
      economical, applying it from distal to proximal, with a low level of compression, in order to&#xD;
      provide proprioceptive information, but avoiding compressive syndrome, reducing pain and&#xD;
      edema and improving the performance of ADL through the practice of them. It consists in only&#xD;
      two thin layers and it is fast (10 minutes) and simple placement (can be self-administered by&#xD;
      the patient and / or caregiver), improving cost- effectiveness of treatments combined with&#xD;
      three other techniques whose evidence has been previously reviewed. We have agreed to call&#xD;
      this therapy we propose in this study Activity-oriented Proprioceptive Antiedema Therapy&#xD;
      (TAPA in Spanish):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health education / patient empowerment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurodynamic activities oriented to ADL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises oriented to ADL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-adherent self-adhesive antiedema of low compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the consensus of the CDT as a gold standard treatment in lymphedema, we consider that&#xD;
      our experimental treatment TAPA should make the comparison with it. So, half of patients will&#xD;
      receive TAPA treatment while the other half will receive CDT standard treatment.&#xD;
