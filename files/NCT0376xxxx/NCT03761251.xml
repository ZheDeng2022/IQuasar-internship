      This study evaluates the short-term effects of incorporating the structured care of a pet&#xD;
      fish into a diabetes self-care routine on glucose control in early adolescents with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of treatment for Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is dependent on adherence to&#xD;
      self-care behaviors and collaborative parental involvement. Adolescence is a vulnerable time&#xD;
      for the deterioration of glycemic control in patients with T1DM. In particular, parental&#xD;
      monitoring declines during early adolescence. This often occurs before the child has&#xD;
      developed self-efficacy and competence in independently performing diabetes-related tasks,&#xD;
      including blood glucose monitoring. Consequently, there is a great need for innovative&#xD;
      strategies in early adolescents that promote self-efficacy development and facilitate&#xD;
      parental involvement.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be provided a fish tank with supplies to care for the fish and access to a fish (Betta splendens) from a local pet store. All participants will receive specific instructions for coupling the fish care and diabetes care:&#xD;
feed fish one pellet in the morning after waking; check and record BG reading at that time&#xD;
feed fish one pellet in the evening before dinner; check and record BG reading at that time&#xD;
feed fish one pellet at night before bedtime; check and record BG reading at that time&#xD;
every week clean the tank alternating with test the water quality in partnership with caregiver; review blood glucose readings with caregiver with each weekly fish care activity and problem solve any issues related to the blood glucose pattern.&#xD;
Each child will also receive two books intended to supplement and enrich their pet fish experience.</description>
