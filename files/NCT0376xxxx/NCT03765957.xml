    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory skin disease and its histological features&#xD;
      are characterized by epidermal hyperplasia, increased angiogenesis and immune cell&#xD;
      infiltration. Psoriasis prevalence is about 0.1%-3%, affecting approximately 125 million&#xD;
      people worldwide. In China, there are about 10 million psoriasis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human umbilical cord-derived MSC (huc-MSC) has many advantages for the treatment of immune&#xD;
      disease. Because it was demonstrated that huc-MSCs are effective in modulating immune cells&#xD;
      and treating diseases and it has low immunogenicity. Furthermore, huc-MSCs do not raise&#xD;
      ethical issue for clinical applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some experimental results and cases has showed that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) can prevent&#xD;
      or treat psoriasis. This clinical study is conducted to provide more data to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect and safety of treatment of psoriasis by human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cell.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ≥75% (PASI 75) Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body-surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of desquamation (scaling), erythema, and plaque induration/infiltration (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no psoriasis to 72 for the most severe disease. Participants achieving PASI 75 was defined as having an improvement of at least 75% in the PASI scores compared to baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of (0, 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a physician's determination of the participant's psoriasis lesions overall categorized by descriptions for induration, erythema, and scaling.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a simple, participant-administered, 10 question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Response categories include &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;a lot,&quot; and &quot;very much,&quot; with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and unanswered (&quot;not relevant&quot;) responses scored as &quot;0.&quot; Totals range from 0 to 30 (less to more impairment), and a 5 point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant. Least Square (LS) Means in total DLQI score were calculated using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) with baseline score as covariate, treatment, pooled center, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects.</description>

    <measure>Adverse event</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.</description>

    <description>The mesenchymal stem cells will be derived from human umbilical cord. After the subjects are screened and qualified, random number envelopes will be selected to group 12 subjects into group A, group B, group C and group D at a ratio of 1:1:1:1. The subjects of group A and B will be injected intravenously with 1.5x10E6/kg and 2.0x10E6/kg（according to the weight of subject）mesenchymal stem cells respectively at baseline and every 2 weeks, 4 times is a course of treatment. Subjects will be followed up for evaluation on 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, month 2, month 3 and month 6 after treatment. The subjetcts of group C and D will be injected intravenously with 2.5x10E6/kg and 3.0x10E6/kg （according to the weight of subject）mesenchymal stem cells respectively at baseline and every 4 weeks, 2 times is a course of treatment. Subjects will be followed up for evaluation on 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, month 2, month 3 and month 6 after treatment.</description>
