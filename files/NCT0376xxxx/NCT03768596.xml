  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nudge is a set of methods aimed at helping people adopt a behavior by a gentle prompt,&#xD;
      conscious or not. Classically, Nudges rely on heuristics and cognitive biases. These methods&#xD;
      have been studied for years in social psychology and are receiving renewed attention since&#xD;
      the awarding of the Nobel Prize in economics to Richard Thaler for his work on the&#xD;
      application of Nudge to the economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health professionals are very inadequately vaccinated (25 to 45% of the population). Some&#xD;
      studies have shown that a Nudge based on intent implementation can significantly increase&#xD;
      vaccination coverage. However, few studies evaluate the acceptability of Nudge or its&#xD;
      application to health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators sought to apply a Nudge based on availability heuristics to health&#xD;
      professionals, in order to evaluate its effectiveness and terms of behavior adoption&#xD;
      (influenza vaccination) and its acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's hypothesis is that Nudging is both effective and acceptable and that&#xD;
      people found nudging more acceptable if they have been exposed to a nudge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators asked residents in general medicine to pass a questionnaire including a&#xD;
      Nudge. This Nudge was the influenza vaccine prescription form accompanied on the back of the&#xD;
      telephone numbers of the occupational health centers of the hospitals where residents were on&#xD;
      probation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interns of the group &quot;Nudge&quot; saw at the end of their questionnaire the following&#xD;
      statement: &quot;If you are not vaccinated against the flu so far, you can get the form stapled to&#xD;
      this questionnaire, it will allow you to get the vaccine in pharmacy. On the back you will&#xD;
      also find practical information about immunization services at your place of training. &quot; A&#xD;
      group will receive an implemented Nudge questionnaire, a group will receive a questionnaire&#xD;
      without Nudge and a control group will not be asked. (Phase 1) The 3 groups will receive a&#xD;
      month later a questionnaire evaluating the effectiveness in terms of immunization coverage,&#xD;
      and the acceptability of the Nudge, for oneself and for others. (Phase 2) The control group&#xD;
      will only receive the Phase 2 questionnaire to control the Hawthorne effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between the 3 groups will consist exclusively in the exposure of the&#xD;
      participants to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A questionnaire on their attitude (opinion) towards vaccination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The numbers of the occupational health vaccination centers of their places of training;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The flu vaccine prescription form, to be signed and stamped by a doctor (also already&#xD;
           freely available on the internet)&#xD;
