  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the combination of nivolumab and a CCR2/CCR5 dual&#xD;
      antagonist (BMS-813160) with GVAX is safe in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      (LAPC) who have received chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and to see if this combination&#xD;
      therapy enhances the infiltration of CD8+CD137+ cells in PDACs .&#xD;

    <description>Change in quality of life from baseline will be evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire, pancreatic cancer module (EORTC QLQ-C30/Pan26). The QLQ-C30 includes 30 questions assessing global health status/quality of life, function, and symptoms. The PAN26 module comprises of an additional 26 questions assessing pain, dietary changes, jaundice, altered bowel habit, emotional problems related to pancreatic cancer, and other symptoms (cachexia, indigestion, flatulence, dry mouth, taste changes). The score for each item ranges from 0-100, with a higher score reflecting a better level of functioning, a better quality of life, or a worse level of symptoms.</description>
