  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Research findings suggested that persons with mental disorders show a&#xD;
      dysfunctional upregulation of negative affect (NA) but at the same time a dysfunctional&#xD;
      downregulation of positive affect (PA) as distinct processes. Nevertheless, established&#xD;
      treatment approaches focus on the modification of problems and negative affect only.&#xD;
      Experimental paradigms with healthy and subclinical populations showed that PA inductions&#xD;
      lead to higher flexibility in information processing, cognitive appraisal and action&#xD;
      tendencies. Higher amounts of PA were associated with more personal resources, higher&#xD;
      psychological resilience and subjective well-being. Preliminary evidence indicated that a&#xD;
      focus on positive and functional aspects in the life of patients lead to better treatment&#xD;
      sessions and outcome. However, the role of PA for the process in cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method/Design: In regard to this we developed the PACIfIC-study, serving two major&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) to explore the trajectories of PA and NA and their association with relevant process&#xD;
      variables in an early phase of CBT treatment. (2) To develop and test the feasibility of a&#xD;
      brief and easily implementable intervention to promote PA in psychotherapy sessions. (3) To&#xD;
      analyze the impact of this intervention on the therapeutic process between and within CBT&#xD;
      sessions and intermediate outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a randomized contolled, longitudinal design in a outpatient research and&#xD;
      treatment center. Two mental imagery interventions are conducted in the first eight&#xD;
      therapeutic sessions of each treatment. Outcomes were raised by self-rating questionnaires&#xD;
      and video-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The study results may have important theoretical and practical implications on&#xD;
      the use of PA in psychotherapeutic treatment. Furthermore an economic implementation of&#xD;
      strengths-oriented interventions in psychotherapy practice may be initiated.&#xD;

    <description>In all conditions the first eight sessions of treatment are focused. All sessions start with a brief, audio-tape presented positive mental imagery intervention (duration about six minutes). In this intervention patients are guided to imagine a happy, positive situation within the last seven days. Patients get the instruction to imagine from a field perspective, exploring various sensory modalities and feelings in that specific moment. Patients perform this task in the rooms of the treatment center together with their therapists. The text of the mental imagery intervention is standardized and spoken by Prof. Dr. Ulrike Willutzki. Directly before and after the imagination patients are asked on their mood with a single-item. After the short intervention patients are instructed to communicated the content of their imagination with their therapists for about one minute. After completion the regular cognitive behavioral therapy session begins.</description>

    <description>In all three treatment arms, licensed therapists/trainee therapists perform a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) under conditions of the German health care system. All treatments are based on individualized treatment plans for each patient. Therapists are supervized by an CBT expert therapist in the outpatient treatment center. On average every forth session is supervized. The total duration of treatment is variable, oriented on patients symptoms and treatment goals.</description>
