      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1 portion of the study: To assess the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) and to determine a recommended phase 2 dose regimen (RP2DR) of REGN5458 as&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 2 portion of the study: To assess the anti-tumor activity of REGN5458 as&#xD;
      measured by objective response rate (ORR) and as determined by an Independent Review&#xD;
      Committee (IRC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1 dose escalation portion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5458 as determined by the&#xD;
           investigator and measured by ORR, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival&#xD;
           (PFS), rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status, and overall survival (OS)&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>In the phase 2 portion&#xD;
The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including global health status/quality of life, functional Scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social) , symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Participants rate items on a 4-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>In the phase 2 portion&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a self -administered instrument to assess QoL in persons with MM. This 20-item questionnaire measures the following domains: symptom scales, including disease symptoms (6 items) and symptoms related to side effects of treatment (10 items); function scale and future perspective (3 items); and body image (1 item). A high score represents a high level of symptoms or problems.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>In the phase 2 portion&#xD;
The EQ-5D-3L is a self-administered generic standardized health status measure, consisting of an EQ-5D descriptive system and an EQ visual analog scale. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system assesses 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a 3-level scale: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The EQ visual analog scale component is a vertical visual analog scale used by patients to rate their health.</description>
