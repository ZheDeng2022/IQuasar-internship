      The study will be performed in patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be the assessment of the change in the percentage of liver fat mass (assessed&#xD;
      by MRI-PDFF).&#xD;

    <description>MRI acquisitions were performed at pre-qualified local MRI facilities using qualified and standardized instruments at high field strength (3 T or 1.5T) without oral or intravenous contrast. All acquisitions images were transferred to a central reader vendor for central calculation and measurement of MRI-PDFF using the method of Zhong et al. to estimate water and fat components. A 3 cm2 region of interest (ROI) was placed in each Couinaud segment. Central reading was masked to treatment group, clinical data, study site of origin and timepoint.</description>

    <description>Fib-4 score is a non invasive method based on clinical determinations that indicates the level of fibrosis/ scarring of the liver. The set cutoffs for this scoring are: Fib-4 &lt; 1.45: absence of cirrhosis; Fib-4 between 1.45 - 3.25: inconclusive and Fib-4 &gt; 3.25: cirrhosis.&#xD;
Fib-4 score was calculated as (Age [years] × AST [U/L]) / (platelet [10^9/L] × √[ALT [U/L]]). Blood samples used for AST, ALT and platelet counts were collected, handled and stored according to the instructions described in the laboratory manual and all measurements were performed at a central laboratory.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were screened for the study at 15 sites in the United States between 29Mar19 and 13Mar20.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following a Screening period of maximum 2 weeks, eligible participants entered in a single-blind placebo Run-in period of 4 weeks. This Run-in period was set to reduce any bias regarding placebo effect, to assess patient compliance, and to minimize the possible confounding influence of dietary and activity changes. Only participants who have met all the applicable Inclusion criteria and none of the Exclusion criteria at the end the Run-in period were to be randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>MRI acquisitions were performed at pre-qualified local MRI facilities using qualified and standardized instruments at high field strength (3 T or 1.5T) without oral or intravenous contrast. All acquisitions images were transferred to a central reader vendor for central calculation and measurement of MRI-PDFF using the method of Zhong et al. to estimate water and fat components. A 3 cm2 region of interest (ROI) was placed in each Couinaud segment. Central reading was masked to treatment group, clinical data, study site of origin and timepoint.</description>

        <description>MRI acquisitions were performed at pre-qualified local MRI facilities using qualified and standardized instruments at high field strength (3 T or 1.5T) without oral or intravenous contrast. All acquisitions images were transferred to a central reader vendor for central calculation and measurement of MRI-PDFF using the method of Zhong et al. to estimate water and fat components. A 3 cm2 ROI was placed in each Couinaud segment. Central reading was masked to treatment group, clinical data, study site of origin and timepoint.</description>

        <title>Change in Fibrosis-4 (Fib-4) Score From Baseline to Week 12/End of Treatment</title>
        <description>Fib-4 score is a non invasive method based on clinical determinations that indicates the level of fibrosis/ scarring of the liver. The set cutoffs for this scoring are: Fib-4 &lt; 1.45: absence of cirrhosis; Fib-4 between 1.45 - 3.25: inconclusive and Fib-4 &gt; 3.25: cirrhosis.&#xD;
Fib-4 score was calculated as (Age [years] × AST [U/L]) / (platelet [10^9/L] × √[ALT [U/L]]). Blood samples used for AST, ALT and platelet counts were collected, handled and stored according to the instructions described in the laboratory manual and all measurements were performed at a central laboratory.</description>
