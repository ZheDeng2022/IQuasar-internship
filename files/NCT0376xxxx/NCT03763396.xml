  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High grade gliomas (WHO grade III and IV)(HGG) are the most common malignant, and aggressive&#xD;
      brain tumour in humans. Current understanding of the mechanisms contributing to their growth&#xD;
      and progression remain limited. Furthermore, treatment options have not advanced in recent&#xD;
      decades. Recently, it has become evident that these tumours are dependent on glucose&#xD;
      metabolism to maintain oncogenic properties. From a preclinical standpoint, targeting&#xD;
      hexokinase 2 (HK2), the first committed step of glucose metabolism, with azole class drugs&#xD;
      has been shown to display favourable anti-tumour effects in both in vitro and in vivo HGG&#xD;
      models. We would like to translate these preclinical findings into the clinical setting by&#xD;
      implementing a proof-of biological concept study with two azole drugs: ketoconazole (KCZ) and&#xD;
      posaconazole (PCZ). A small cohort of recurrent HGG patients will receive either a single-,&#xD;
      or repeated, steady state dose of either KCZ or PCZ and will then go for surgery where drug&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured intraoperatively. Study drug selection and dosing details&#xD;
      will be selected based on urgency of surgery and patient clinical characteristics Downstream&#xD;
      biological effects of drug on tumour tissue, including HK2 activity, will also be assessed.&#xD;
      This study will provide a preliminary understanding of azole drug activity in recurrent HGG&#xD;
      patients and will help inform future studies of azole drug efficacy in this patient&#xD;
      population&#xD;
