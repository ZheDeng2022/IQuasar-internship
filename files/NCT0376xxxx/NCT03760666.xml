      A Phase 1b/2a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of dose-adjusted brequinar in adult subjects with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML). Ribavirin BID may be added to brequinar twice weekly in eligible subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 27 subjects will be entered in this Phase 1b/2a multi-center, open-label,&#xD;
      non-randomized study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of dose-adjusted&#xD;
      brequinar in adult subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Active Cohort 2 subjects on&#xD;
      brequinar alone twice weekly may roll over into brequinar twice weekly + ribavirin BID.&#xD;
      Cohort 3 subjects will begin treatment with brequinar alone twice weekly then move to&#xD;
      brequinar twice weekly + ribavirin BID as tolerated. Both the brequinar and ribavirin doses&#xD;
      may be adjusted based on safety, tolerability, and enzyme inhibition levels.&#xD;

             years. Participants with treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma or&#xD;
             cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the disease-free duration, are&#xD;

             with organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive&#xD;
             disease are eligible if at the active surveillance stage, hormonal therapy has been&#xD;
