  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is still the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world&#xD;
      according to WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent iron absorption study in adult women with low iron stores in our lab (publication&#xD;
      under review), we found that 15 g of GOS given with an iron supplement in the form of iron&#xD;
      fumarate acutely increased iron absorption when given with water and a bread based meal. The&#xD;
      dose of 15 g of GOS was tolerated well by the participants. As a follow up to the study&#xD;
      mentioned above, we want to investigate: 1) if acute iron absorption is affected by lower&#xD;
      doses of GOS; 2) whether this acute effect occurs for other commonly used iron compounds as&#xD;
      well, such as iron sulphate and iron phosphate; and 3) if there are potential interactions on&#xD;
      absorption with other enhancers of iron absorption, such as vitamin c.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Iron is an important mineral in our body and fulfills essential functions such as for example&#xD;
      oxygen transport from the lungs to the tissues. Iron deficiency is still the most common and&#xD;
      widespread nutritional disorder in the world according to WHO. Common iron supplements all&#xD;
      have their limitations in terms of availability and compatibility. Prebiotic fibers, such as&#xD;
      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), selectively enhance growth of beneficial colonic bacteria.&#xD;
      Prebiotics in general enhance the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and thereby&#xD;
      decrease luminal pH. Through the reduction in pH, prebiotics can enhance absorption of&#xD;
      minerals such as calcium and magnesium and they have been proposed to potentially improve&#xD;
      iron absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent iron absorption study in adult women with low iron stores in our lab (publication&#xD;
      under review), we found that 15 g of GOS given with an iron supplement in the form of iron&#xD;
      fumarate acutely increased iron absorption when given with water and a bread based meal. The&#xD;
      dose of 15 g of GOS was tolerated well by the participants. As a follow up to the study&#xD;
      mentioned above, we want to investigate: 1) if acute iron absorption is affected by lower&#xD;
      doses of GOS; 2) whether this acute effect occurs for other commonly used iron compounds as&#xD;
      well, such as iron sulphate and iron phosphate; and 3) if there are potential interactions on&#xD;
      absorption with other enhancers of iron absorption, such as vitamin c.&#xD;
