  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently 28 million child refugees worldwide - approximately 1 in every 200&#xD;
      children on earth. To date, nearly one million forcibly displaced child migrants have been&#xD;
      resettled in the United States. It is well documented that refugee and immigrant youth,&#xD;
      especially forcibly displaced ethnic and cultural minority youth, present with alarmingly&#xD;
      high rates of stress-related psychiatric illness (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety) and are&#xD;
      grossly underserved by current mental health, medical, and social services. Previous research&#xD;
      found that in a sample of 144 Somali refugee children resettled in the United States, only 8%&#xD;
      of those who met full clinical criteria for PTSD received any mental health services. Through&#xD;
      a process of community-based participatory research with refugee and immigrant communities&#xD;
      and stake-holders the investigators have developed a multi-tiered psychological and systems&#xD;
      intervention for refugee youth and families, Trauma Systems Therapy for Refugees (TST-R),&#xD;
      that includes community outreach and advocacy, group psychological treatment, office-based&#xD;
      psychotherapy, and home-based services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas TST-R is one of the only empirically-based behavioral health treatment models for&#xD;
      refugee youth, it has only been studied as a full intervention model; financial and staffing&#xD;
      resource barriers have limited the wide-spread adoption of the model. This obstacle noted,&#xD;
      implementing one high-impact component of this multi-tier intervention (i.e., protocol-driven&#xD;
      group treatments) may provide significant benefit while also being easily scalable.&#xD;
      Implementing time-limited (i.e., 10 week) manual-based group psychological interventions&#xD;
      focused on culturally-responsive strategies to support refugee youth with, and at-risk for,&#xD;
      PTSD, depression, and anxiety, may be an efficient and cost effective means of (1) reducing&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms for refugee and migrant youth with present symptoms, (2) preventing&#xD;
      symptom onset for those at risk, and (3) enhancing cultural identity self-concept, subjective&#xD;
      social belongingness, and psychological resilience (e.g., ability to thrive in the context of&#xD;
      adversity). Furthermore, if effective, treatment groups can importantly function as a&#xD;
      destigmatizing treatment gateway and triage to other services for youth who require a higher&#xD;
      level of care (e.g., individual psychotherapy and medication management).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline after 10 weeks of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Cultural Identity Self-Concept measured with social and cultural identities adapted version of Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ). Self-report measure. Higher scores indicate greater cognitive and emotional suffering related to social and cultural identity self-concept (example item: &quot;my thoughts about my social and cultural identities cause me distress or emotional pain.&quot; Total score sum may range from 0 to 42. Higher scores indicate worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline after 10 weeks of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Efficacy measured by New General Self-Efficacy Scale (NGSES). Self-report measure. Higher scores indicate greater perceived ability to accomplish goals and overcome challenges (example item: &quot;I will be able to achieve most of the goals that I have set for myself.&quot;) Total score sum may range from 0 to 48. Higher scores indicate better outcome.</description>
