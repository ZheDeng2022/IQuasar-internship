  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effect of CT application in combination&#xD;
      with ESWT and ESWT on pain and grip strength in athletes/patients with lateral&#xD;
      epicondylitis.It is planned that at least 30 athletes aged 18-40 who are at the Ministry of&#xD;
      Youth and Sports, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Health Affairs and who have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with LE by specialist doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking the information about birth dates, height, weight and dominant sides of the&#xD;
      athletes who are willing to participate in the study, pain intensities and hand grip&#xD;
      strengths will be evaluated. Then the athletes will be randomly divided into 2 groups&#xD;
      according to closed envelope method. First group ESWT application; 4 sessions will be held&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. The second group included ESWT + CT; 4 sessions will be held for 4 weeks. Pain&#xD;
      severity and hand grip strength will be evaluated again after treatment.&#xD;

      Lateral epicondylitis (LE); the most common cause of elbow pain. It is typically&#xD;
      characterized by pain around the lateral epicondyle during resistant wrist extension. This&#xD;
      condition has been reported to occur as a result of degenerative angiofibroblastic&#xD;
      hyperplasia of the wrist extensor tendons due to repetitive microtrauma. Although&#xD;
      conservative treatments are usually used in lateral epicondylitis, many of them do not have&#xD;
      sufficient evidence. In some cases, the healing phase lasts for months, which may be long&#xD;
      enough to affect quality of life and sport performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is used in musculoskeletal problems with a possible&#xD;
      mechanism of action, including hyperstimulation analgesia, neovascularization, and induction&#xD;
      of the healing process. However, this method is a painful method due to the shock wave&#xD;
      applied and may cause temporary redness in the area of application. This may cause the&#xD;
      subcutaneous fascia of the affected area to be affected by the application pressure.&#xD;
      Kinesiotaping (KT) is widely used in the treatment of various musculoskeletal problems. The&#xD;
      band, invented by the Japanese chiropractor Kenzo Kase in the 1970s, is a heat-sensitive&#xD;
      acrylic adhesive and an elastic woven cotton stripe with a maximum tensile strength of up to&#xD;
      about 40-60% of its total length. Many effects of KT have been hypothesised, including&#xD;
      improvement of feedback and correction of the articular alignment disorder. KT has an effect&#xD;
      on the skin and fascia. recovery will be provided faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of ESWT application with ESWT + KT&#xD;
      application. In this study, our hypothesis is that ESWT + KT application will have more&#xD;
      effect on pain and muscle strength in LE patients than ESWT alone.&#xD;
