    <textblock>
      Based on the need of clinical practice of maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC and the&#xD;
      reliable data of third-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the investigators&#xD;
      designed a clinical study of antinil hydrochloride versus pemetrexed in maintenance therapy&#xD;
      for advanced NSCLC to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of antinil hydrochloride in&#xD;
      maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC. Value, to provide a scientific basis for prolonging&#xD;
      the survival time of patients with advanced NSCLC, improving the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      in the course of treatment, and optimizing treatment strategies to a greater extent.&#xD;

      This study is planned to be carried out in Jiangsu regional multi-center. 83 cases are&#xD;
      preliminarily expected to be included. The study started in December 2018 and ended in&#xD;
      December 2019. It is expected that the trial will end in December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of such situations as withdrawal of informed consent, intolerance of drug&#xD;
      toxicity and side effects, or inappropriateness for further trials, each participant's&#xD;
      expected time for research and treatment will continue until radiographically confirmed tumor&#xD;
      progression occurs.&#xD;
