    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of galinpepimut-S in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in patients with selected advanced cancers. Patients will be followed long-term for Overall&#xD;
      Survival (OS) and safety. The study will enroll approximately 90 patients and maximum study&#xD;
      treatment duration is approximately 2.13 years.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter, multi-arm study of the Wilms&#xD;
      Tumor-1 (WT1)-targeting multivalent heteroclitic peptide immunotherapeutic vaccine&#xD;
      galinpepimut-S in combination with the programmed death-1 (PD1) inhibitor pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with selected advanced cancers. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      galinpepimut-S and pembrolizumab and investigate the effect of galinpepimut-S and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab on various tumor types. Patients will be followed long-term for OS and safety.&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 90 patients at up to 20 centers in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications treated are colorectal (third or fourth line), ovarian (second or third line),&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer (second line), breast cancer (triple negative; second line), acute&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia (unable to attain deeper morphological response than partial [PR] on&#xD;
      hypomethylating agents and who are not eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 2 galinpepimut-S injections will initially be administered as monotherapy every 3&#xD;
      weeks (Week 0 and Week 3). Thereafter, galinpepimut-S will be co-administered with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for 4 additional administrations (for the galinpepimut-S initial&#xD;
      immunization induction phase series; weeks 6-15) to coincide with the per label pembrolizumab&#xD;
      dosing frequency. After that, there will be one un-paired administration of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (week 18), and then galinpepimut-S will be resumed on an every 3-week schedule for 6&#xD;
      additional doses (early immune booster phase; weeks 21-36). At the end of this phase, there&#xD;
      will be a 12-week interval where 3 unpaired administrations of pembrolizumab will occur&#xD;
      (weeks 39-45), and then galinpepimut-S will be resumed on an every 12-week schedule for 4&#xD;
      additional doses (late immune booster phase; weeks 48-84). After 84 weeks, continuing&#xD;
      non-progressed patients will be treated with pembrolizumab alone up until week 111.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks on Day 1&#xD;
      of each cycle (3 week cycles) starting on Study Week 6 and continuing for up to 2 years&#xD;
      thereafter (Study Week 111). Galinpepimut-S will be administered 30-60 minutes after the&#xD;
      completion of IV infusion of pembrolizumab on Day 1 of each cycle during which the 2 drugs&#xD;
      are being co-administered.&#xD;

             (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness&#xD;
             considered by the investigator as an unwarranted high risk for investigational drug&#xD;
