  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2007 and 2013, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines applied the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria of sMPLC （synchronous multiple primary lung cancers）, and the diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria of Martini and Melamed were extended and developed, Summarized as: (1) different&#xD;
      histological types, different genetic characteristics, or different origin of carcinoma in&#xD;
      situ; (2) the histological type is the same, the tumor is located in different lung or&#xD;
      different lung lobes, the common lymphatic drainage site of lung cancer is not cancerous, and&#xD;
      there is no extrapulmonary metastasis at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative staging of each tumor was carried out in sMPLC patients, if all of them were&#xD;
      stage I lung adenocarcinoma, whether adjuvant therapy could fully refer to the treatment&#xD;
      principle of stage I NSCLC was considered, whether the benefit of subsequent application of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy was still unclear, and whether adjuvant therapy was needed or not has&#xD;
      been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-throughput sequencing, also known as &quot;Next generation&quot; sequencing (NGS), is&#xD;
      characterized by sequencing of hundreds of thousands to millions of DNA molecules in&#xD;
      parallel, and generally shorter reads.For multiple tumor lesions resected by sMPLC, only&#xD;
      biopsy gene information from a single cancer focus may not be enough to identify all active&#xD;
      driver gene mutations from the tumor. Therefore, NGS sequencing was proposed for all cancer&#xD;
      lesions of sMPLC patients to reflect the full picture of gene mutation in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators initiated this prospective clinical study to detect lung cancer related&#xD;
      genes in tumor tissues and patients with at least 2 tumors that were confirmed as invasive&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma by pathology after sMPLC resection (residual non-resectable or non-qualitative&#xD;
      pulmonary nodules). At the same time, application of NGS technology to test lung cancer&#xD;
      related genes in patients' tumor tissues and blood, patients with lung cancer drive genes&#xD;
      were followed up to explore whether different drive genes had an impact on patients' disease&#xD;
      progression. In order to investigate the type of gene that causes disease recurrence in&#xD;
      patients, tissue or blood test was performed again when disease recurrence occur.&#xD;
