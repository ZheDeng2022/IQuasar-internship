  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance is a very serious and dangerous situation in modern world. Judicious&#xD;
      use of antibiotics is therefore of extreme importance not just in preventing antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance but also it decreases cost of the treatment and prevent side-effects of the&#xD;
      antibiotics. No randomized trial is available in literature for antibiotic prophylaxis in&#xD;
      patient undergoing donor hepatectomy. Currently, antibiotic regimen is based on individual&#xD;
      institutional protocol. There have been studies, comparing short course vs long dose of&#xD;
      antibiotics in hepatectomy patients, concluding equivalent efficacy in preventing infective&#xD;
      complications. The investigators aim at proving that 3 doses of antibiotics are equally&#xD;
      effective in preventing infective complications, when compared to 9 doses of antibiotics, in&#xD;
      patients undergoing donor hepatectomy. So, a randomized trial is required to study the&#xD;
      antibiotic duration in patient undergoing donor hepatectomy.&#xD;

      Antibiotic resistance is a very serious and dangerous situation in modern world. Judicious&#xD;
      use of antibiotics is therefore of extreme importance not just in preventing antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance but also it decreases cost of the treatment and prevent side-effects of the&#xD;
      antibiotics. No randomized trial is available in literature for antibiotic prophylaxis in&#xD;
      patient undergoing donor hepatectomy. Currently, antibiotic regimen is based on individual&#xD;
      institutional protocol. So, a randomized trial is required to study the antibiotic duration&#xD;
      in patient undergoing donor hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to prove that, in preventing infective complications, 3 doses of&#xD;
      antibiotics are equally effective as compared to 9 doses of antibiotics in patients of donor&#xD;
      hepatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be an equivalence randomized control trial where data will be&#xD;
      collected from patients who are undergoing donor hepatectomy. Donor evaluation will be done&#xD;
      according to institutional protocol. Donor evaluation will be done step wise as tabulated&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique After opening the abdomen through a J-shaped incision, cholecystectomy&#xD;
      will be performed and intraoperative cholangiogram will be carried out through the cystic&#xD;
      duct stump. The ipsilateral lobe will be mobilized and the hepatic vein will be looped. Hilar&#xD;
      dissection will be performed and the ipsilateral portal vein and hepatic artery are defined.&#xD;
      The transection plane will be determined by the line of demarcation obtained by temporary&#xD;
      clamping of the ipsilateral portal vein and hepatic artery. Parenchymal transection will be&#xD;
      performed without inflow occlusion by a Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA_;&#xD;
      Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA). The last one-third of the transaction will be performed with a&#xD;
      hanging maneuver. After completion of the transaction, the bile duct will be looped along&#xD;
      with the sheath and a repeat cholangiogram will be performed by placing radio opaque markers&#xD;
      at the proposed bile duct transection site. The bile duct will be divided between the&#xD;
      markers. Intravenous heparin will be given (50 IU/kg); after waiting for 3 min, the hepatic&#xD;
      artery, portal vein and hepatic vein will be divided between clamps and the graft will be&#xD;
      taken out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of infective complications with 3 doses of antibiotic: 9%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of infective complications with 9 doses of antibiotic: 7% The alpha error,&#xD;
           the power of the study and the equivalence margin will be taken as 5%, 80% and 15%&#xD;
           respectively. For this investigators will need to enroll a total of 108 patients,&#xD;
           equally divided into 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A shall include 54 consecutive patients who are undergoing donor hepatectomy. These&#xD;
      patients will be followed up closely in the post-operative period and would be serially&#xD;
      sampled at pre-defined intervals. Patients will be assessed for infective complications.&#xD;
      Antibiotics will be continued beyond 3 doses, if any sign of infection is present (Fever/ TLC&#xD;
      more than 11,000/ Wound infection/others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B shall include 54 patients, who will receive antibiotics for 3 days. These patients&#xD;
      will also be followed up closely in the post-operative period and would be serially sampled&#xD;
      at pre-defined intervals. Patients will be assessed for infective complications. Antibiotics&#xD;
      will be continued beyond 3 days, if any sign of infection is present (Fever/ TLC more than&#xD;
      11,000/ Wound infection/others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infective complication rates / total duration of antibiotics/ cost of antibiotics and&#xD;
      morbidity will be compared between the 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOME: To establish that 3 doses of antibiotics are equally effective in&#xD;
      preventing infective complications, as compared to 9 doses of antibiotics, in patients&#xD;
      undergoing donor hepatectomy.&#xD;
