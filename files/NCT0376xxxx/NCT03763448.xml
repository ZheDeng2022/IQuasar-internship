    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the postoperative clinical outcomes of Infrapatellar Fat Pad&#xD;
      (IPFP) preservation versus resection after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis. Participants will be identified as normal IPFP or abnormal IPFP based on&#xD;
      MRI findings before randomization. The primary outcome is the summed score of Knee Injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) covering pain, symptoms, activities of daily life, sport&#xD;
      &amp; recreation, knee-related quality of life, and KOOS subscale assessing activities of daily&#xD;
      life, sport &amp; recreation. The secondary endpoints will be included: KOOS subscales (pain,&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life), Knee Society Score (KSS), 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      Pain, timed up-and-go test, depression, patellar tendon shortening, 100 mm VAS self-reported&#xD;
      efficacy of reduced pain and increased quality of life. Adverse events will be recorded.&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated or reported blindly at baseline and at&#xD;
      postoperative 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Intention-to-treat analyses will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common chronic disease, which often leads to joint pain and&#xD;
      limited function in the elderly, and thus affects participants' quality of life. Total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA) has been developed as a mature surgical procedure to relieve end-stage&#xD;
      osteoarthritic joint pain and improve limb function. Although more than 80% of the patients&#xD;
      reported in the literature are satisfied with the postoperative efficacy of TKA, there are&#xD;
      still a large number of patients whose daily life is affected by persistent knee pain and&#xD;
      limited function after the operation of the affected limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IPFP is a fat mass located behind the patellar ligament, between the lower part of the&#xD;
      patella and the tibial tubercle. The function of IPFP is controversial at present. It is&#xD;
      reported that IPFP can provide blood supply for anterior cruciate ligament, patella and&#xD;
      patellar ligament through the arterial network of the knee joint. In addition, it can fill&#xD;
      the joint gap to lubricate the surface of the joint, reduce friction and absorb impulse so as&#xD;
      to play a physiological protective role. On the contrary, studies have pointed out that&#xD;
      abnormal IPFP could produce various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β,&#xD;
      tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as adipokines such as leptin and&#xD;
      resistin, and thus might play a detrimental role in knee OA. Traditionally, the IPFP has been&#xD;
      removed in order to improve surgical exposure and to prevent interposition during baseplate&#xD;
      implantation. Despite the significant evolution of TKA technology which no longer requires&#xD;
      the resection of IPFP for better surgical access, IPFP is still partially or totally resected&#xD;
      in around 88% of TKAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previous population-based cohort study revealed that IPFP maximal area and&#xD;
      volume were associated with reduced knee pain, decreased loss of cartilage volume and reduced&#xD;
      risks of cartilage defect progression, indicating a beneficial effect of IPFP size. On the&#xD;
      other hand, the investigators' further investigation demonstrated that IPFP signal intensity&#xD;
      alteration was negatively associated with maximum area of IPFP, and moreover, associated with&#xD;
      increased knee cartilage defects, subchondral bone marrow lesion (BML) and knee pain,&#xD;
      suggesting IPFP with abnormal quality may play a detrimental role in knee OA. Based on these&#xD;
      findings, the investigators proposed that IPFP with normal quality should be preserved or not&#xD;
      damaged during TKA, while IPFP with abnormal quality should be resected. This multicentre&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial is designed to test the investigators' hypotheses: in patients&#xD;
      with normal IPFP quality, preservation of IPFP during TKA procedure will reduce postoperative&#xD;
      knee symptoms and improve joint function, comparing with IPFP resection during TKA&#xD;
      procedures; in patients with abnormal IPFP quality, resection of IPFP during TKA procedure&#xD;
      will reduce postoperative knee symptoms and improve joint function, comparing with IPFP&#xD;
      preservation during TKA procedures. The results would provide evidence-based recommendations&#xD;
      on clinical practice to improve OA patients' postoperative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred and sixty eligible participants will be recruited and identified as having&#xD;
      normal IPFP quality (signal intensity alteration score ≤ 1) or abnormal IPFP quality (signal&#xD;
      intensity alteration score ≥ 2). Participants in each site will be randomly allocated to IPFP&#xD;
      resection group or preservation group using computer-generated block randomisation.&#xD;

    <measure>Insall - Salvati Ratio (ISR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From pre-operation to 12 months after operation</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to assess changes in the length of the patellar tendon at baseline and month 12. Lateral radiographs with the knee in about 30 degree of flexion will be taken by well experienced X-ray technicians using standardized radiographic techniques. The numerator of the ISR-the length of the patellar tendon-was determined by measuring the distance from inferior aspect of the patella to the superior aspect of the tibial tubercle. The longest dimension of the patella on the lateral radiograph will be obtained as denominator of the ISR.</description>
