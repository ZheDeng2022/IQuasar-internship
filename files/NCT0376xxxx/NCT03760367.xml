  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effect of toothbrushing with a toothpaste containing blue covarine&#xD;
      compared to a control toothpaste without blue covarine on tooth color. Participants brush&#xD;
      their teeth once with either the blue covarine containing toothpaste or a control toothpaste&#xD;
      for two minutes. Before and after brushing, tooth color is assessed with a spectrophotometer.&#xD;
      Moreover, satisfaction of the participants with their tooth color is assessed using a numeric&#xD;
      analogue scale before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypotheses are that neither brushing with the toothpaste containing blue covarine&#xD;
      nor brushing with the control toothpaste change a) the tooth color and b) the satisfaction of&#xD;
      the participants with their tooth color.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are recruited by advertizing in several public areas in Aarhus, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written and oral information on the study is provided, eligibility criteria are checked, and&#xD;
      informed consent is given by the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The upper front teeth of the participants are cleaned with pumice and a rubber cup by&#xD;
      operator A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants look at the color of their upper front teeth with a mirror, in a room with&#xD;
      controlled lighting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, participants rate their satisfaction with the color of their teeth using an&#xD;
      11-point aesthetic numeric analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth color is assessed by operator B using a spectrophotometer (VITA Easyshade Advance) and&#xD;
      a positioning device to standardize measurements. Measurements are performed in a room with&#xD;
      controlled lighting conditions. VITA SYSTEM 3D-MASTER color, L*, a* and b* are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are then randomly assigned to either the blue covarine toothpaste group or the&#xD;
      control toothpaste group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are given a short video introduction to the Bass toothbrushing technique by operator C&#xD;
      (caregiver).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operator C provides a toothbrush and 1 g of either blue covarine toothpaste or control&#xD;
      toothpaste, according to the randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants brush their teeth for two min, starting with the upper front teeth, and then&#xD;
      rinse their mouth with tap water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, participants look again at the color of their upper front teeth with a mirror, in&#xD;
      the same room as before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They rate their satisfaction with the color of their teeth using the 11-point aesthetic&#xD;
      numeric analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, they rate the color difference before and after treatment on an 11-point aesthetic&#xD;
      numeric analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again, tooth color is assessed by operator B using a spectrophotometer (VITA Easyshade&#xD;
      Advance) and a positioning device to standardize measurements. Measurements are performed in&#xD;
      the room with controlled lighting conditions. Again VITA SYSTEM 3D-MASTER color, L*, a* and&#xD;
      b* are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypotheses of the study are that neither brushing with the toothpaste containing&#xD;
      blue covarine nor brushing with the control toothpaste change a) the tooth color and b) the&#xD;
      satisfaction of the participants with their tooth color.&#xD;
