    <textblock>
      A pilot randomized controlled trial to assess feasibility, acceptability and generate outcome&#xD;
      domains for a future RCT testing the efficacy of immersive virtual reality on pain intensity&#xD;
      in pediatric amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome (AMPS) are invited to take part in&#xD;
      this research project that studies two different audio-visual relaxation technologies in&#xD;
      reducing amplified musculoskeletal pain. In addition, the investigators are interested in&#xD;
      studying if they have an effect on some of the ways adolescents think about their pain and&#xD;
      cope with it. Both of these technologies provide the user with a similar natural environment&#xD;
      designed to have a calming effect, along with guided relaxation and soothing music. The&#xD;
      adolescents will be assigned to use one of these for a total duration of about 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Pain related outcomes including pain intensity, pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy to&#xD;
      manage pain will be collected before and after the relaxation session.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators propose a parallel-group pilot randomized controlled trial with a stratified block randomization and an equal allocation ratio of 1:1. The participants will be randomly allocated to Group A (VR/intervention group) or Group B (iPad/control group). The relaxation session will last for 10 minutes in each group using the same application Happy Place (© Mimerse) played on VR headsets (Oculus GO) versus iPad (Apple Inc. Cupertino CA). The randomization will be stratified on the basis of pain score on the day of intervention.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mean Change in Pain Intensity Reported on Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS will be administered at 5 minutes before the relaxation session, 5 minutes after the session and then at day 2 after the session in both groups.</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a self-reported quantitative measure of pain intensity used commonly in clinical practice as well as in pain research. The VAS is a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 0 mm to 100 mm where 0 denotes 'no pain' and 100 denotes 'pain as bad as it could possibly be'. The participant marks a point on the line that they feel represents the perception of their current pain. The VAS score is then determined by measuring in millimeters from the left-hand end of the line to the point that the participant marks. The primary outcome measure is is the mean change in VAS from 5 minutes before the relaxation session to 5 minutes after the session.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Pain Catastrophizing Reported on Pain Catastrophizing Scale - Child (PCS-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>PCS-C will be administered at 5 minutes before the relaxation session, 5 minutes after the session and day 2 after the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale -Child (PCS-C) is an adaptation of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale with established construct and predictive validity in 8-16 years old subjects. It is a self-report measure which includes 13 items about the thoughts and feelings experienced when a child is in pain. Respondents use a 5-point rating scale (where 0 = never to 4 = always), to indicate how often they experience each thought or feeling. The total score for the PCS equals 52, with a score above 24 indicating a high score. The lowest score can be 0. Higher score represents worse outcome. PCS-C scale has three sub-scales namely, rumination, magnification, and helplessness. The investigators will not assess the sub-scales as a part of this study. The outcome measure will be reported as the mean difference in post-intervention score (assessed 5 minutes after the session) minus pre-intervention score (assessed 5 minuets before the session) for both groups with the 95% confidence interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Self-efficacy to Manage Pain Reported on Self-Efficacy Scale for Child Functioning (SES-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>SES-C will be administered at 5 minutes before the relaxation session, 5 minutes after the session and then at day 2 after the session in both groups.</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Efficacy Scale for Child Functioning (SES-C) is a reliable and validated self-efficacy measure for children 9-18 years of age with chronic pain. The child version has established psychometric properties, excellent reliability and strong evidence for construct validity. It consists of 7 Likert scale questions with a range from very sure (=1) to very unsure (=5). The lowest score can be 7, which reflects highest self-efficacy to manage pain, and the highest score can be 35, which corresponds to lowest self-efficacy to manage pain. Higher score represents worse outcome. It has no sub-scales. The outcome measure will be reported as the mean difference in post-intervention score (assessed 5 minutes after the session) minus pre-intervention score (assessed 5 minuets before the session) for both groups with the 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>Oculus GO is a stand-alone, consumer-grade, virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD). The HMD is placed on the head of the user blocking off the surrounding environment. The visuals and audio are relayed through the HMD in a virtual space.Happy Place (© Mimerse) is a publicly available application with an explicit intent to be used for chronic pain patients. It has the critical elements of VR, namely immersion and interactivity.&#xD;
Immersion: The scene is a serene lakeside campground with guided relaxation and soothing music. The application intends to promote positive effects such as calmness and feeling of wonder.&#xD;
Interactivity: Happy Place uses an innovative 'gaze-based interaction' with the virtual world. Around 50 'gaze objects' are placed around the scene and gazing at them would trigger an event.&#xD;
The entire duration of the experience will be kept at 10 minutes.</description>

        <title>The Mean Change in Pain Intensity Reported on Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>The VAS is a self-reported quantitative measure of pain intensity used commonly in clinical practice as well as in pain research. The VAS is a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 0 mm to 100 mm where 0 denotes 'no pain' and 100 denotes 'pain as bad as it could possibly be'. The participant marks a point on the line that they feel represents the perception of their current pain. The VAS score is then determined by measuring in millimeters from the left-hand end of the line to the point that the participant marks. The primary outcome measure is is the mean change in VAS from 5 minutes before the relaxation session to 5 minutes after the session.</description>
        <time_frame>VAS will be administered at 5 minutes before the relaxation session, 5 minutes after the session and then at day 2 after the session in both groups.</time_frame>

The visuals and audio are relayed through the HMD in a virtual space.Happy Place (© Mimerse) is a publicly available application with an explicit intent to be used for chronic pain patients. It has the critical elements of VR, namely immersion and interactivity.&#xD;
Immersion: The scene is a serene lakeside campground with guided relaxation and soothing music. The application intends to promote positive effects such as calmness and feeling of wonder.&#xD;
Interactivity: Happy Place uses an innovative 'gaze-based interaction' with the virtual world. Around 50 'gaze objects' are placed around the scene and gazing at them would trigger an event.&#xD;
The entire duration of the experience will be kept at 10 minutes.&#xD;

        <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale -Child (PCS-C) is an adaptation of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale with established construct and predictive validity in 8-16 years old subjects. It is a self-report measure which includes 13 items about the thoughts and feelings experienced when a child is in pain. Respondents use a 5-point rating scale (where 0 = never to 4 = always), to indicate how often they experience each thought or feeling. The total score for the PCS equals 52, with a score above 24 indicating a high score. The lowest score can be 0. Higher score represents worse outcome. PCS-C scale has three sub-scales namely, rumination, magnification, and helplessness. The investigators will not assess the sub-scales as a part of this study. The outcome measure will be reported as the mean difference in post-intervention score (assessed 5 minutes after the session) minus pre-intervention score (assessed 5 minuets before the session) for both groups with the 95% confidence interval.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Self-efficacy to Manage Pain Reported on Self-Efficacy Scale for Child Functioning (SES-C)</title>
        <description>The Self-Efficacy Scale for Child Functioning (SES-C) is a reliable and validated self-efficacy measure for children 9-18 years of age with chronic pain. The child version has established psychometric properties, excellent reliability and strong evidence for construct validity. It consists of 7 Likert scale questions with a range from very sure (=1) to very unsure (=5). The lowest score can be 7, which reflects highest self-efficacy to manage pain, and the highest score can be 35, which corresponds to lowest self-efficacy to manage pain. Higher score represents worse outcome. It has no sub-scales. The outcome measure will be reported as the mean difference in post-intervention score (assessed 5 minutes after the session) minus pre-intervention score (assessed 5 minuets before the session) for both groups with the 95% confidence interval.</description>
