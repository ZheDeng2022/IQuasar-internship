      This study is designed to test the following hypothesis: patients undergoing immediate&#xD;
      alloplastic and autologous breast reconstruction following mastectomy that receive&#xD;
      preoperative immunonutrition will experience a reduction in wound complications in the 30-day&#xD;
      postoperative period compared to a standard of care control group (retrospective chart&#xD;
      review) of 264 (132 alloplastic + 132 autologous) consecutive breast reconstruction patients&#xD;
      prior to 5/25/2018.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer is one of the most common&#xD;
      operations performed by plastic and reconstructive surgeons. Unfortunately, breast&#xD;
      reconstruction does not come without complications. Both alloplastic and autologous forms of&#xD;
      reconstruction are frequently complicated by wound healing and infectious complications.&#xD;
      These complications range from incisional dehiscence requiring prolonged wound care and daily&#xD;
      dressing changes, to expander infection and extrusion requiring operative removal, to&#xD;
      mastectomy skin flap necrosis so severe that operative debridement is required during a&#xD;
      second surgery after declaration of viable skin has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that patients undergoing immediate alloplastic&#xD;
      and autologous breast reconstruction following mastectomy that receive preoperative&#xD;
      immunonutrition will experience a reduction in wound complications in the 30-day&#xD;
      postoperative period compared to a standard of care control group (retrospective chart&#xD;
      review) of 264 (132 alloplastic + 132 autologous) consecutive breast reconstruction patients&#xD;
      prior to 5/25/2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of perioperative immunonutrition supplementation is to offset the immune&#xD;
      and metabolic dysregulation that occurs in response to surgical stress. The key ingredients&#xD;
      that promote this response are amino acids (typically arginine), fatty acids and nucleotides;&#xD;
      these can be administered individually but are typically administered together in an enteral&#xD;
      or parenteral formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of the protocol is the incidence of wound complications 30-days&#xD;
      post-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rate of return to the operating room in the 30-day postoperative period in patients&#xD;
           undergoing immediate alloplastic and autologous breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Average length of stay for patients undergoing autologous reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of wound complications and return to the operating room 90-days post-operative&#xD;
           throughout expansion process for patients undergoing alloplastic reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be approximately 33 weeks assuming 100% compliance with the treatment&#xD;
      arms in the alloplastic and autologous populations. The time estimate is based on recent&#xD;
      trends in operative schedules of 2 immediate alloplastic and 2 immediate autologous breast&#xD;
      reconstruction operations weekly with a calculated sample size of 66 patients in each group&#xD;
      (total n=132). This sample size was calculated assuming significance level of 0.05, power of&#xD;
      80%, and 50% reduction in wound complications in the treatment group.&#xD;
