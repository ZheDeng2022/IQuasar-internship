  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm interventional study of 1000 male circumcision procedures using the&#xD;
      ShangRing device. The primary objective of the study is to enhance understanding of the&#xD;
      potential clinical and operational challenges and opportunities that may be associated with&#xD;
      widespread use of ShangRing™ device for circumcision in different settings in Mozambique.&#xD;
      Specific objectives are: 1) To monitor the proportion of men who choose circumcision through&#xD;
      the WHO-prequalified, FDA-approved ShangRing™ device in routine voluntary medical male&#xD;
      circumcision (VMMC) service delivery settings where standard surgical methods of&#xD;
      circumcisions are available; and 2) To ensure safety during initial implementation of the&#xD;
      ShangRing™ device and confirm that adverse event rates are comparable to those found during&#xD;
      implementation in other sub-Saharan countries.&#xD;

      This is a single-arm interventional study of 1000 male circumcision procedures using the&#xD;
      ShangRing device. The primary objective of the study is to enhance understanding of the&#xD;
      potential clinical and operational challenges and opportunities that may be associated with&#xD;
      widespread use of ShangRing™ device for circumcision in different settings in Mozambique.&#xD;
      Specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To monitor the proportion of men who choose circumcision through the WHO-prequalified,&#xD;
           FDA-approved ShangRing™ device in routine voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC)&#xD;
           service delivery settings where standard surgical methods of circumcisions are&#xD;
           available; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To ensure safety during initial implementation of the ShangRing™ device and confirm that&#xD;
           adverse event rates are comparable to those found during implementation in other&#xD;
           sub-Saharan countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 1000 males aged 13 years and above who are seeking male circumcision; 3 clinic&#xD;
      sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Approximately 3 months of recruitment, 60 days follow-up per participant; total&#xD;
      duration expected to be approximately 6 months in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Cumulative target of 1000 ShangRing™ procedures, based on guidance contained in&#xD;
      the WHO Framework for clinical evaluation of devices for male circumcision. The WHO TAG on&#xD;
      Innovations in Male Circumcision recommends active follow-up of the first 1000 clients when a&#xD;
      new device is introduced into a program or as a new program is implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: Baseline demographic and behavioral characteristics of ShangRing™ clients&#xD;
      will be summarized using counts and percentages. Association between these variables and&#xD;
      selected outcome variables (e.g. AEs, failure to return for device removal, preference for&#xD;
      Shang Ring) will be examined through cross tabulations and tests of association (e.g. Chi&#xD;
      square statistics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality assurance: Data quality control efforts will include members of the national&#xD;
      VMMC Technical Working Group, including local ShangRing™ Trainers of Trainers, conducting&#xD;
      scheduled site assessments/monitoring as follows: Prior to the start of the active&#xD;
      surveillance (site initiation) using site assessment checklist; and every month using a VMMC&#xD;
      quality assessment checklist. There will be regular monthly supervision visits to the&#xD;
      facilities to ensure proper record filing and storage of physical forms. Data will be entered&#xD;
      into an electronic system by trained data personnel at the facility level. This data will be&#xD;
      reviewed actively and regularly through the central database on a periodic basis. The PI,&#xD;
      lead local investigator and co-investigators will regularly monitor and evaluate data for&#xD;
      completeness and specifically to monitor for any adverse events that may preclude or&#xD;
      terminate the study early. The electronic system will be monitored regularly and by limited&#xD;
      access of study personnel.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>ShangRing</intervention_name>
    <description>The ShangRing™ is a device for male circumcision that was invented by Jian Zhong Shang and has been on the Chinese market since 2005. It consists of a sterile device with two concentric medical grade plastic rings: an inner ring with a silicone band and an outer, hinged ring. The inner ring fits inside the outer ring which will lock when snapped together. It currently holds a European Conformity (CE) mark, an EN ISO certificate, and is FDA approved. Clinical data from ShangRing studies in Africa were reviewed by the WHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Innovations in Male Circumcision in January 2013 and were found to meet its clinical requirements. The ShangRing manufacturer was accepted by the WHO Prequalification Programme for Male Circumcision Devices in 2015.</description>
