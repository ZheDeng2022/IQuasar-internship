  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the quality of images and diagnostic ability of a handheld device under two&#xD;
      thousand dollars against those of a bigger and more expensive ultrasound machine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound technology is frequently used to obtain information, usually at patients bedside.&#xD;
      The images obtained are used to guide procedure (i.e central line placement, epidural needle&#xD;
      guidance) or to make diagnosis (i.e abnormal placentation, presence of pneumothorax). Given&#xD;
      that the majority of this procedures and diagnosis are made at bedside, the ideal ultrasound&#xD;
      machine should be portable, lightweight, and within an acceptable price range. Our current&#xD;
      ultrasound machine (Sonosite - M turbo) has a price range from 15,000-20,000 dollars, not&#xD;
      including the different probes that are needed to obtain images at different depths in the&#xD;
      human body. Much of the cost is due to the ultrasound transducers, which have been&#xD;
      traditionally based on piezoelectric technology. Such probes work by passing current through&#xD;
      a piezoelectric crystal (typically quartz) that then vibrates rapidly and generates an&#xD;
      ultrasound pulse. Creating crystal arrays is difficult and often requires hand-manufacturing.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this technology is analog and requires downstream analog-to-digital processing&#xD;
      hardware. Together, these characteristics increase device costs and restrict the broader&#xD;
      dissemination of ultrasound technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the Butterfly iQ company created an ultrasound that is portable and at a price of&#xD;
      slightly under two thousand dollars it allows the physician to obtain images for diagnostic&#xD;
      and/or procedural guidance using a single probe. The company was able to significantly&#xD;
      reduced the cost and the need for additional probes by utilizing Capacitive micro-machined&#xD;
      ultrasound transducers (CMUTs). Essentially instead of relying on the use of specific&#xD;
      piezoelectric crystals (current ultrasound technology), they are using a micro-chip&#xD;
      technology to emit the vibrations that would be used to form an image. Butterfly Network has&#xD;
      developed a CMUT imaging device that has been designed to be compliant with all applicable&#xD;
      FDA safety regulations (see section II.C), while enabling increased portability and real-time&#xD;
      smartphone-based image review due to the integrated circuit design. The Butterfly device was&#xD;
      FDA-approved as of October 2017. The proposed study will compare the images acquired by the&#xD;
      Butterfly iQ and our current Sonosite M-turbo US.&#xD;
