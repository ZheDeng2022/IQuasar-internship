  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries, including limb injuries, are the most common cause for&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) visits for children with pain. Broken arms and legs are known to&#xD;
      cause moderate to severe pain in most children, yet previous research shows that children's&#xD;
      pain in the emergency department is still under-treated. Further, children are less likely to&#xD;
      receive appropriate pain medicine than adults with similar injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of 3 different&#xD;
      possible medication combinations, for the pain management of children with acute MSK limb&#xD;
      injuries. The pain medicines the investigators are studying are ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin),&#xD;
      acetaminophen (Tylenol/Tempra), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of 2 trials that will be run simultaneously. Eligible caregiver/&#xD;
      child pairs presenting to the emergency department with acute MSK limb injury will decide in&#xD;
      which trial they wish to participate: the Opioid trial or the Non-Opioid trial. If they&#xD;
      select the Non-opioid trial, they will have an equal chance of receiving either (a) Ibuprofen&#xD;
      OR (b) Ibuprofen and acetaminophen. If they select the Opioid trial, they will have an equal&#xD;
      chance of receiving either (a) Ibuprofen OR (b) Ibuprofen and acetaminophen OR (c) Ibuprofen&#xD;
      and hydromorphone. Regardless of which study they choose, their child will, at minimum,&#xD;
      receive Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin) for their pain. All study medicines will be given in oral&#xD;
      liquid form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help the investigators figure out which pain medicine or combination of pain&#xD;
      medicines works best for children with limb injuries. Promotion of adequate acute pain&#xD;
      treatment of children presenting to the ED may help prevent the known short and long-term&#xD;
      effects of inadequately treated pain in children, including unpleasant memories, stress and&#xD;
      anxiety upon future visits to healthcare, and compromised functional outcomes such as missed&#xD;
      school.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple national and international organizations, including the American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP), have voiced concern over the emergency departments' (EDs) ability and&#xD;
      willingness to provide appropriate analgesia for children's pain. Musculoskeletal (MSK)&#xD;
      injury is a very common cause for ED visits for children with pain, with a child's risk of&#xD;
      sustaining a fracture ranging from 27-42% by the age of 16 years. MSK injury is known to&#xD;
      generate moderate to severe pain in most children and the ED serves as the critical entry&#xD;
      point for these injured children. Despite three decades of pain research in this area, recent&#xD;
      evidence confirms that ED pain management in children is still suboptimal. A retrospective&#xD;
      cohort study of children presenting to the ED with an isolated long-bone fracture showed&#xD;
      almost 1/3 received inadequate medication and 59% received no pain medications during the&#xD;
      critical first hour of assessment. Previous studies have demonstrated that only 35% of&#xD;
      children presenting to a Canadian pediatric ED with fractures or severe sprains received any&#xD;
      analgesic. Further, a medical record review of two Canadian EDs showed unacceptably long&#xD;
      delays in provision of initial analgesia, with children waiting a mean of 118 minutes to the&#xD;
      provision of first analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AAP's consensus statement on the assessment and management of pain in children recommends&#xD;
      acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and opioids as the top three medication choices for the treatment&#xD;
      of acute pain in children. These are also the top three most commonly used treatments in the&#xD;
      ED for children with MSK injury pain. It stands to reason that clinicians (and certainly&#xD;
      patients and their families) would prefer medication that has the best efficacy and safety&#xD;
      profile. Although not based on robust evidence, there has recently been a concerted movement&#xD;
      to limit opioid use in children. This is due, in part, to recent controversial publications&#xD;
      and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC)'s position statement regarding opioid use in adults.&#xD;
      Clinicians are increasingly less likely to prescribe oral opioids to younger children, and&#xD;
      caregivers are increasingly less willing to accept or administer them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians are currently seeking effective (and for many, non-opioid) oral analgesic options&#xD;
      for their pediatric patients. Researchers have yet to identify the optimal acute pain&#xD;
      management strategy for children with a suspected fracture, as very few studies of analgesic&#xD;
      combination therapy for this injury exist, and monotherapy has been shown to be inadequate&#xD;
      50% of the time. This team's previous work has demonstrated that a combination of oral&#xD;
      morphine with ibuprofen was no more effective and was less safe than oral ibuprofen, alone,&#xD;
      for suspected fracture pain. Similarly, oxycodone was no more effective and was less safe&#xD;
      than ibuprofen for post-discharge fracture pain. There is some emerging work from non-ED&#xD;
      settings to suggest that oral hydromorphone may be an effective alternative to these two&#xD;
      opioid medications. The investigators wish to study if acetaminophen or hydromorphone, when&#xD;
      added to ibuprofen, offers more clinical pain relief than ibuprofen alone. They also wish to&#xD;
      study if the combination of hydromorphone and ibuprofen is more clinically effective than the&#xD;
      combination of acetaminophen with ibuprofen. This study, which will consist of two clinical&#xD;
      trials, will inform health-care decisions by providing evidence for the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of commonly prescribed analgesic combination therapies, and compare them to the most&#xD;
      commonly used monotherapy, ibuprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be comprised of two Phase 2, six-centre, randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials that will be run simultaneously. These two 'sister trials will be&#xD;
      run simultaneously within this novel preference-informed complementary trial design.&#xD;
      Caregiver/child pairs presenting to the ED with acute MSK limb injury will decide in which&#xD;
      trial they wish to participate: the Opioid trial or the Non-Opioid trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those willing to consider an Opioid will be randomized to receive either single-dose: (a)&#xD;
      oral ibuprofen (10mg/kg, max 600mg) plus 2 placebos (both oral hydromorphone and&#xD;
      acetaminophen), OR (b) oral ibuprofen (10mg/kg, max 600mg) + oral acetaminophen (15 mg/kg,&#xD;
      max 1000mg) plus hydromorphone placebo OR (c) oral ibuprofen (10mg/kg) + oral hydromorphone&#xD;
      (0.05 mg/kg, max 5 mg) plus acetaminophen placebo. Those not willing to consider an opioid&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the Non-Opioid trial and will be randomized to receive a single dose of&#xD;
      (a) oral ibuprofen (10mg/kg, max 600mg) + oral acetaminophen (15 mg/kg, max 1000mg) OR (b)&#xD;
      oral ibuprofen (10mg/kg, max 600mg) + oral acetaminophen placebo. Those without a preference&#xD;
      for either trial will be assigned to the Opioid trial, as this one includes all three options&#xD;
      of possible medication combinations. The investigators will measure pain scores, assess&#xD;
      safety, and acquire other study measures, at designated study time points.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be comprised of two Phase 2, six-centre, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials that will be run simultaneously. The investigators expect that the number of participants recruited and the time to completion of both trials will be more efficient as recruitment for both will occur simultaneously. They propose to conduct this study with a novel preference-informed complementary trial design, in which they will conduct two simultaneous 'sister' trials. Caregiver/child pairs presenting to the ED with acute MSK limb injury will decide in which trial they wish to participate: the Opioid trial or the Non-Opioid trial. The design of each trial will be informed by its sister, or complementary, trial. Once the caregiver/child pair has chosen their preferred trial, conduct within each trial will follow traditional randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled superiority trial methodology. Study endpoints will be identical for both trials within this study.</intervention_model_description>
