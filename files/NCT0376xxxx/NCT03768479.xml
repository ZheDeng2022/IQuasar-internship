    <textblock>
      This study is focused on the value of 18F-FES-PET in predicting the Fulvestrant efficacy in&#xD;
      hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The imaging agent involved in this study is&#xD;
      16α-[18F]-fluoro-17β-estradiol (18F-FES).&#xD;

      This study is an open, multi-center and prospective clinical study, It is the first time&#xD;
      investigators are examining this imaging agent in Chinese patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chinese FDA has approved 18F-FES as an investigational tracer in a selective few research&#xD;
      studies. The Chinese FDA has not approved this tracer for any use outside of research. In&#xD;
      this research study, the investigators are investigating the use of a PET tracer called&#xD;
      18F-FES in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to take images that can measure the amount of a protein called Estrogen&#xD;
      Receptor, or 'ER' in breast tumors. The expression level of ER is tightly correlated with the&#xD;
      Fulvestrant efficacy in patients with breast cancer. The investigators will take the pictures&#xD;
      of the participant's residual tumor lesions using a PET/CT scanner with 18F-FES used as the&#xD;
      tracer before and after the first cycle of Fulvestrant treatment. The investigators are&#xD;
      trying to clarify the relationship between the clinical Fulvestrant efficacy and the amount&#xD;
      change of 18F-FES uptake by breast tumor around the first cycle of Fulvestrant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This could help them to predict the efficacy of endocrine therapy by monitoring the dynamic&#xD;
      levels of ER in advance, and potentially help guide treatment of breast tumors in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FES was initially developed to image the primary breast tumor. In previous studies of&#xD;
      18F-FES conducted in humans, there were no adverse events (there have been no problems).&#xD;
      While this is not the first time 18F-FES has been used in humans, it is the first study in&#xD;
      which the investigators study its predictive value in the treatment efficacy in breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
