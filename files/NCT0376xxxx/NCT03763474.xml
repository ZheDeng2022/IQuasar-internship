  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      80 children and adolescents with Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 were enrolled in the study and were&#xD;
      randomly assigned in the intervention group (Euglyca group) or in the control group. Patients&#xD;
      in the Euglyca group were asked to use the application in order to calculate the bolus&#xD;
      insulin dose. Primary outcomes of the study were the Glycosylated hemoglobin, percentage of&#xD;
      normoglycemias and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Score. Patients were&#xD;
      evaluated at the baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months after the beginning of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (T1DM) who visited consecutively this&#xD;
      clinic were asked to participate in the study if they owned an Android smartphone and were&#xD;
      familiar with its use. Patients were included after one of their parents or their legal&#xD;
      guardian signed an informed consent. Inclusion criteria were: 1. Treatment with multiple&#xD;
      daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII); 2. satisfactory&#xD;
      knowledge of the concept of carbohydrates and lipids counting acquired following previous&#xD;
      training by the physicians and nutritionist of the department at initial diagnosis and&#xD;
      thereafter during follow-up visits. Exclusion criteria were: 1. Use of another medical&#xD;
      application for diabetes in the previous 3 months; 2. lack of capacity of reading greek.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patients met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study. Subsequently&#xD;
      they were randomized to two equally numbered groups by drawing one of two nontransparent&#xD;
      envelopes which contained one ticket inscribed with either a E (for Euglyca group) or a C&#xD;
      (for Control group). To ensure equal allocation rates within the 2 groups, block&#xD;
      randomization was employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit, patients randomized to the E group were advised to download the Euglyca&#xD;
      application on their smartphones and they were asked to use the application for the&#xD;
      calculation of the bolus insulin dose they were injected. Patients randomized to the C group&#xD;
      were advised to calculate bolus insulin dose they were injected, the way they used to do.&#xD;
      Patients repeated their visit to the endocrine pediatric clinic at 3, 6 and 12 months, the&#xD;
      latter set as the terminal time-point of this study following the initial visit. At all 4&#xD;
      visits, anthropometrics (weight, height, BMI), blood pressure measurement and heart rate were&#xD;
      noted down, while a peripheral blood sample was drawn from all patients in the morning of&#xD;
      each visit after an overnight fast for measurement of glycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin&#xD;
      (HbA1c) levels. Glucose measurements between 70 and 180 mg/dl were categorized as&#xD;
      normoglycemia; any glucose measurement below 70mg/dl was categorized as hypoglycemia; glucose&#xD;
      measurements at two hours postprandial measurement found above 180mg/dl were categorized as&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. At baseline (first visit), at 6 months (third visit) and at terminal&#xD;
      time-point (12 months) all patients filled the World Health Organization-Standard DTSQ.&#xD;
      Patients' logbooks and readings from their glucose meters were reviewed by the physicians and&#xD;
      nutritionist of the department at each of the four visits and the percentage of&#xD;
      normoglycemic, hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes during the preceding trimester was&#xD;
      calculated for each patient. The change of HbA1c values from baseline to the terminal&#xD;
      time-point for each group was set as primary outcome, while the percentage of normoglycemic,&#xD;
      hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events over the total number of glucose measurements during&#xD;
      the preceding trimester of each visit was set as secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycosylated hemoglobin was determined by Siemens DCA Vantage point-of-care immunoassay&#xD;
      analyzer (Siemens Health care Diagnostics Ltd., Frimley, Camberley, UK) with intra- and&#xD;
      inter- assay coefficients of variation (CV) 5% and 8%, respectively; glycemia was determined&#xD;
      by glucose god/pap kit with intra- and inter- assay CVs 5.7% and 7.8%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Euglyca' is a mobile application that we developed . The application has a data base of 7000&#xD;
      foods and food products met in greek eating habits as well as the corresponding amount of&#xD;
      carbohydrates and lipids for each of them. Subsequently, the amount of carbohydrates and&#xD;
      lipids contained in a meal are calculated automatically by the application. By taking into&#xD;
      consideration the amount of carbohydrates and lipids to be consumed, the preprandial and&#xD;
      target post-prandial glycemia concentrations, the insulin correction factor for the patient,&#xD;
      the carbohydrates and lipids factors and the active insulin (in case of CSII), 'Euglyca'&#xD;
      calculates the required bolus dose of insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined by estimating the change in HbA1c values (primary outcome) based&#xD;
      on previous studies (7, 8), assuming 0.5% reduction in HbA1c in the intervention group with&#xD;
      80% power and 5% significance level. Power calculation resulted in 14 patients per group,&#xD;
      while the target of the study had been set at recruitment of 80 patients altogether. Results&#xD;
      are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables. The absolute&#xD;
      difference in a quantitative variable between two different time points was defined as Δ. All&#xD;
      quantitative variables (HbA1c; ΔHbA1c; percentages of normoglycemic, hypoglycemic and&#xD;
      hyperglycemic events over a total number of glucose measurements; DTSQ's scores) were&#xD;
      normally distributed and they were compared between the two studied groups of patients at the&#xD;
      different time-points by employing General Linear Models ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test.&#xD;
      Repeated measures ANOVA involved one factor between patients (factor &quot;Group&quot; with two levels)&#xD;
      and one factor for the repeated measures within patients (factor &quot;time&quot; with 4 or 3 levels&#xD;
      depending on the compared variable). Qualitative variables (gender and type of therapy) were&#xD;
      compared by employing x2 (chi square) test after having computed absolute and relative&#xD;
      frequencies (percentages %), Statistical significance was set at P&lt;0,05. An intention to&#xD;
      treat analysis was followed. IBM SPSS V23 Chicago, USA software was used for the statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
