  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the impedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy device prototype in detection of anal sphincter injuries in women in the early&#xD;
      postpartum period. The study is prospective. The study group comprises 24 patients; included&#xD;
      in it 6-8 weeks after natural delivery. The planned participation of each patient in the&#xD;
      study is up to 4 weeks and three visits will take place at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written consent, at the screening visit (V0) each patient will undergo a&#xD;
      physical examination, blood samples for laboratory tests and stool samples for calprotectin&#xD;
      concentration assessment will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second visit (V1), after the final verification of inclusion/exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      impedance spectroscopy using tested device will be performed in each patient, the electrical&#xD;
      impedance of pelvic floor muscles will be measured and the degree of anal sphincter damage&#xD;
      will be evaluated. Full gynecological and proctological examination (including a&#xD;
      gynecological speculum, two-handed examination, rectal examination and anoscopy) will be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the third visit (V2), two reference diagnostic tests (with evidenced effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety), transanal ultrasonography and anorectal manometry, will be conducted. The collected&#xD;
      data will be used to select the optimal therapeutic method for each participant individually.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed by subsequent measures:&#xD;
Sphincter continuity in physical examination,&#xD;
Sphincter tension in physical examination,&#xD;
OASIS classification of perineal tears in transanal ultrasonography&#xD;
Starck scale for classification of anal sphincter injuries in transanal ultrasound (0-16 scale, no defect - 0; maximum - 16, means severe damage of both sphincters on a considerable length and circumference)&#xD;
Norderval scale for classification of anal sphincter injuries in transanal ultrasound (0-7 scale, no defect - 0, 7 is the maximal damage of both anal sphincters)&#xD;
anorectal manometry assessment to measure anal sphincters function&#xD;
All measurements are used to estimate the presence, extent and severity of anal sphincter injury.&#xD;
The main aim of the study is to establish whether the extension and severity of obstetric anal sphincter injury can be precisely assessed with parameters calculated from pelvic floor muscles using impedance spectroscopy.</description>

    <description>24 women will be included in the study and divided into two subgroups.&#xD;
12 of them (first subgroup) came from patients within 6 to 8 weeks after natural delivery, that had a perianal tear of grade 1 or 2 in OASIS classification.&#xD;
Remaining 12 (second subgroup) came from patients within 6 to 8 weeks after natural delivery, that had a perianal tear of grade 3 or 4 in OASIS classification.&#xD;
The planned interventions are:&#xD;
Blood and faeces tests&#xD;
Impedance spectroscopy test&#xD;
