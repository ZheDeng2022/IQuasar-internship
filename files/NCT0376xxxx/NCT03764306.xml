  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and purpose. Even if periprocedural cerebral microembolism associated with carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy or stenting usually does not manifest as clinically overt stroke,&#xD;
      neuropsychological disturbances resulting from these events represent an important clinical&#xD;
      and socioeconomic problem. Still, it remains unclear whether the use proximal protection can&#xD;
      lower the incidence of cerebral embolism associated with the treatment of carotid stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods. This was a prospective randomised single-centre study, which was aimed&#xD;
      at comparison of surgical eversion endarterectomy with stenting under proximal protection in&#xD;
      symptomatic patients. The investigators evaluated the incidence of new ischaemic lesions&#xD;
      revealed by the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 2-4 days after the treatment&#xD;
      and neurologic events.&#xD;

      The CARECarotid was a prospective randomised single-centre study, which was performed in the&#xD;
      University Hospital in Kraków. It was planned to evaluate 50 patients presenting with&#xD;
      symptomatic lesions of the internal carotid artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms: surgical endarterectomy or&#xD;
      carotid angioplasty with stenting under proximal protection. All patients provided their&#xD;
      written informed consent to undergo the procedures and to participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all surgical patients carotid endarterectomy will perform using the eversion technique.&#xD;
      All surgical endarterectomies will perform under cervical block anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperatively patients in the surgical arm received aspirin; other antiplatelet or&#xD;
      anticoagulant agents were not administered during 5 days before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures in carotid artery stenting will perform with proximal protection system - the&#xD;
      Mo.Ma (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) device. The investigators will implante stents that&#xD;
      were tailored to the localisation of lesions and morphology of carotid arteries: Carotid&#xD;
      Wallstent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA, and in patients with tortuous arteries Precise&#xD;
      Pro RX (Cordis, Fremont, CA, USA) or Roadsaver (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Patients in the stent&#xD;
      arm will receive clopidogrel 75 mg/day and aspirin 75 mg/day. These drugs were administered&#xD;
      during 3 days before planned procedure and then 3-6 months after stent implantation. All&#xD;
      patients will have MRI DWI performed before and 2-4 days after procedures in both groups.&#xD;
      Within 6 months there will be an evaluation of the incidence of neurological events.&#xD;
