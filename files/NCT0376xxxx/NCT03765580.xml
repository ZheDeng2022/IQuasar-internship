  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are important for health, for example for the immune&#xD;
      system, heart health and the brain. PUFA are found in fish, nuts and oils; including these&#xD;
      foods in the diet provides the body with PUFA. The body can also produce some PUFA in a&#xD;
      series of steps. It has been found that genetics influences the levels of PUFA produced in&#xD;
      the body. This study will investigate whether fish consumption influences PUFA status in&#xD;
      women of childbearing age when accounting for FADS genotype by conducting a controlled human&#xD;
      intervention study. Participants will be asked to consume none, one or two portions of oily&#xD;
      fish per week for 8 weeks and their response in PUFA status measured. This study will also&#xD;
      use collected blood, hair, urine and faecal samples collected from the intervention study to&#xD;
      explore other biomarkers of fish consumption. The aim of this study is to investigate whether&#xD;
      fish consumption influences PUFA status in women of childbearing age when accounting for FADS&#xD;
      genotype and to explore the potential of a novel biomarker, using hair MeHg:δ34S values, to&#xD;
      accurately predict fish consumption. The study will initially involve providing a buccal swab&#xD;
      sample which will investigate genes which are related to fatty acids. The participant will&#xD;
      provide a buccal swab sample so that their genotype can be determined. The researcher who&#xD;
      will contact the participant once genotype has been determined to arrange a baseline&#xD;
      appointment. Participants will attend the Human Intervention Studies Unit at Ulster&#xD;
      University, Coleraine once or twice weekly for a period of 8 weeks where they will receive&#xD;
      lunch. This lunch will contain either tuna, sardines, or no fish depending on the&#xD;
      intervention group you will be allocated to. Examples of lunch time meals they may receive&#xD;
      include sandwiches, baked potato or salad which will include the type of fish they have been&#xD;
      allocated to receive. Those allocated to the no fish group will receive a fish free&#xD;
      alternative lunch. Participants will be asked to continue to follow their normal diet and&#xD;
      lifestyle over the intervention period of 8 weeks. All participants will attend a baseline&#xD;
      and post intervention appointment where they will have weight, height and body composition&#xD;
      measured. Participants will also complete questionnaires to provide medical, lifestyle and&#xD;
      dietary information. All participants will be asked to provide a sample of blood, urine, hair&#xD;
      and faeces to assess biomarkers of fish consumption at baseline and post intervention&#xD;
      appointments. Collected blood, urine, hair and faecal samples will be analysed for biomarkers&#xD;
      of fish consumption. Participants will also be asked to return to the Human Intervention&#xD;
      Studies Unit (HISU) 8 weeks after the intervention study has been completed (week 16) to&#xD;
      provide a third hair sample and complete a Fish Feedback Questionnaire. In the 8 wks&#xD;
      following conclusion of the study they will be free to return to their normal diet.&#xD;
