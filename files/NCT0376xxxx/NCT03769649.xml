      This prospective study is intended to evaluate the CelluTite RFAL handpiece combined with&#xD;
      Morpheus8 handpiece for the treatment of cellulite.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of cellulite treatment using two hand pieces:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CelluTite - based on a minimally invasive, temperature-controlled&#xD;
           Radiofrequency-assisted lipolysis (RFAL) technology. RF energy is applied using a&#xD;
           handpiece with 2 electrodes: internal active electrode with spatula-shaped tip and&#xD;
           external electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Morpheus8 - designed to deliver RF energy to the skin surface in a fractional manner&#xD;
           via an array of 24-electrode pins.&#xD;
