      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label phase II study including patients&#xD;
      with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus, refractory or intolerant to combination&#xD;
      therapy with Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, open-label multi-center study comparing treatment of&#xD;
      paclitaxel plus ramucirumab with paclitaxel monotherapy in patients with advanced&#xD;
      squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced squamous-cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the esophagus and refractory or intolerant to combination therapy with&#xD;
      Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 186 patients will be enrolled (Randomization 1:1). 93 patients will be&#xD;
      treated with paclitaxel + ramucirumab (Arm A) and 93 with paclitaxel (Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by time of progression during or after end of first-line&#xD;
      therapy (≤3 months vs. &gt;3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare overall survival (OS) after 6 months in patients with&#xD;
      squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus, refractory or intolerant to combination therapy&#xD;
      with Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs receiving paclitaxel with ramucirumab versus&#xD;
      paclitaxel alone in the intent-to-treat population (ITT). OS is defined as the time from&#xD;
      randomization to death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm A (investigational arm) receive Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 plus&#xD;
      Ramucirumab 8 mg/kg i.v. infusion on day 1 and 15 every 4 weeks. Patients in Arm B (control&#xD;
      arm) receive Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks. Study treatment will be&#xD;
      continued until progression or intolerable toxicity, but for a maximum of 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessment will be performed according to clinical routine at screening / baseline and&#xD;
      every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discontinuation of study medication, patients will be followed for up to 1 year. Tumor&#xD;
      assessments per CT or MRI will be performed every 2 months for 6 months or until&#xD;
      documentation of disease progression. Follow-up for survival will be done and documented&#xD;
      every 2 months for the 1 year follow-up period after end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, clinical visits (blood cell counts, detection of toxicity) will be&#xD;
      performed prior to every treatment dose. Safety of paclitaxel +/- ramucirumab will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously by careful monitoring of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs) reported. Prior to the start of each cycle and at the 30-day safety follow-up&#xD;
      visit Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and&#xD;
      treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30).&#xD;
