      This clinical study will evaluate the early to midterm safety and performance of the JOURNEY™&#xD;
      II UNI UKS in patients with non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease of the knee requiring&#xD;
      lateral or medial knee compartment replacement. Clinical, radiographic, health economic and&#xD;
      safety outcomes will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and performance of the JOURNEY™ II UNI UKS in patients with&#xD;
      unicompartmental degeneration of the knee by demonstrating non-inferiority of the cumulative&#xD;
      percent implant survival in subjects with the JOURNEY™ II UNI UKS implanted, compared to a&#xD;
      literature reference rate of 91.7% (AOA annual report 2015)12 at 5 years.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Journey™ II UNI Unicompartmental Knee System</intervention_name>
    <description>Journey™ II UNI UKS is a CE Marked medical device. The device has been designed to treat both medial and lateral unicompartmental disease.&#xD;
It is a comprehensive system designed to allow surgeons to perform UKA. It is comprised of the following anatomic components: Oxidized zirconium femoral components Titanium tibial components with a grit-blasted surface Polyethylene tibial insert components The device is asymmetric and is available in oxidized zirconium to reduce wear and increase implant longevity.</description>
