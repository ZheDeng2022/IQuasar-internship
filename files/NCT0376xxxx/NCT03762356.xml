    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this questionnaire is to gather the views of qualified clinicians on what&#xD;
      factors contribute to an individual's insight or awareness into their own violent behaviours.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will also explore what type of tool would be useful to develop for use in&#xD;
      clinical practice to aid effective risk assessment and management. Brief demographic&#xD;
      information will also be gathered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite insight into violence being a factor regularly addressed by professionals in the&#xD;
      assessment of future violence occurring research on this concept is sparse. Research instead&#xD;
      tends to focus specifically on insight into violence specifically in relation to&#xD;
      schizophrenia rather than more broadly in forensic and other clinical settings. What evidence&#xD;
      there is suggests that developing an individual's insight or awareness of their own risk of&#xD;
      violence is a key factor in reducing the likelihood of them engaging in further acts of&#xD;
      violence. Being able to appropriately assess this is key and appears to currently be&#xD;
      inconsistent between professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, therefore, a questionnaire will be disseminated to professionals working in&#xD;
      secure care or a forensic community setting in order to gather their views on what factors&#xD;
      contribute to an individual's insight or awareness into their own violent behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinicians/professionals who are currently employed and qualified as an Offender Manager,&#xD;
      Offender Supervisor, Psychologist, Nurse, Social Worker, Occupational Therapist,&#xD;
      Psychiatrist, Prison Officer currently working in a secure care or forensic community setting&#xD;
      will be eligible to participate. Individuals with the appropriate qualifications working&#xD;
      within private practice in the UK will also be eligible to participate. Those working outside&#xD;
      the UK will not be eligible to participate.&#xD;
