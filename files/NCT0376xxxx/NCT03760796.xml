  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unplanned readmissions after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are among&#xD;
      the leading causes of preventable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Digital health&#xD;
      interventions (DHI) could be an effective tool in promoting self-management, adherence to&#xD;
      guideline directed therapy, and cardiovascular risk reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DHI developed at Johns Hopkins-the Corrie Health Digital Platform-includes the first&#xD;
      cardiology Apple CareKit smartphone application, paired with an Apple Watch and iHealth&#xD;
      Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure monitor. Corrie targets: (1) self-management of cardiac&#xD;
      medications, (2) self-tracking of vital signs, (3) education about cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      through articles and animated videos, and (4) care coordination that includes cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation and outpatient follow-up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, STEMI or type 1 NSTEMI patients are being enrolled to use the&#xD;
      Corrie Health Digital Platform beginning early during participants' hospital stay. Enrollment&#xD;
      sites include Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital, and Reading Hospital. The primary objective is to compare time to first&#xD;
      readmission within 30 days post-discharge among patients with the Corrie Health Digital&#xD;
      Platform to patients in the historical standard of care comparison group.&#xD;

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness as Assessed by a Markov Model of Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>We estimated typical costs associated with readmissions or death of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients discharged with standard practices using 2014 US hospital costs from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The hospital cost (in US dollars) for unplanned 30-day readmission is presented for the Corrie Digital Health Platform Group and the Historical Comparison Group. The reported number is the estimated cost per readmission per participant since the exact cost of the readmission for each patient who was readmitted within 30-days wasn't available. No measure of central tendency is available.</description>

        <description>We estimated typical costs associated with readmissions or death of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients discharged with standard practices using 2014 US hospital costs from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The hospital cost (in US dollars) for unplanned 30-day readmission is presented for the Corrie Digital Health Platform Group and the Historical Comparison Group. The reported number is the estimated cost per readmission per participant since the exact cost of the readmission for each patient who was readmitted within 30-days wasn't available. No measure of central tendency is available.</description>

        <description>Among participants in the Corrie Digital Health group, a nine-item five-point Likert scale for assessing in-hospital care satisfaction 3 days post-discharge is used with scoring from 1 &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5 &quot;strongly agree&quot;, with higher scores meaning participants were more satisfied with the care received. A total score of these nine items is calculated with possible total scores ranging from 9 to 45.</description>

      <desc>While 30-day hospital readmission data was collected for both the Corrie Digital Health Platform and Historical Comparison groups this data is not listed here for the Historical Comparison group because they were not enrolled participants. All-cause mortality data could not be obtained from hospital administrative databases. It was reported to the study team by the participant's family member. This explains why outcome measure 20 has no data but 1 mortality reported here.</desc>
