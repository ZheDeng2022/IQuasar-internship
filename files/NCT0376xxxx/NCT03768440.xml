      Overall Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of continuous erector spinae block (ESB) versus&#xD;
      continuous paravertebral block (PVB) for postoperative analgesia in children and adolescents&#xD;
      undergoing surgical procedures via unilateral thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that ESP block efficacy is not inferior to that of&#xD;
      PVB with respect to pain control and consumed opiate equivalents at 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia-and pediatric regional anesthesia in particular-is a rapidly evolving&#xD;
      subfield of anesthesia practice driven with considerable urgency by the growing recognition&#xD;
      that even appropriate perioperative narcotic administration can have significant derogatory&#xD;
      long-term effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthetics can provide targeted, continuous analgesia to select dermatomes with&#xD;
      minimal additional patient risk and have become routine components of opioid-sparing&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative pain management plans for surgical patients at BCH. In&#xD;
      addition to the postulated benefit of reducing overall opioid exposure and potentially&#xD;
      reducing the risk for long term physiologic and behavioral dependence upon opioids, regional&#xD;
      anesthetics may allow for earlier extubation after selected surgeries, shorter ICU, PACU and&#xD;
      inpatient admissions, earlier mobilization, fewer gastrointestinal complications, and&#xD;
      improved patient satisfaction scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the rapid evolution of the field of regional anesthesia and the fact that there are&#xD;
      often multiple approaches for achieving analgesia in a select set of dermatomes, there are&#xD;
      often a variety of regional anesthetic options for any given surgery. Some approaches are&#xD;
      longstanding and well-studied, but with increasing frequency since the advent of ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance, newer, novel nerve block options exist. As it is often expensive and work-intensive&#xD;
      to thoroughly evaluate a given regional technique with a controlled pediatric trial, many of&#xD;
      these blocks become standards of practice based on anecdote, retrospective analysis, or&#xD;
      simply belief in the putative benefits of regional anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are fortunate at BCH to have one of the largest concentrated pediatric&#xD;
      surgical populations in the US. They also have an active, and well organized regional&#xD;
      anesthesia service. Because of this, the investigators are in a unique position to more&#xD;
      thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and safety of regional anesthesia in children.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators feel it is critical that institutions such as BCH take a&#xD;
      leading role in documenting the effects of regional anesthesia on the most important outcome&#xD;
      measures when considering perioperative medicine. These include overall pain management,&#xD;
      surgical healing, functional recovery, long-term pain symptoms, and emotional/behavioral&#xD;
      outcomes after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the ESB has become popular for providing analgesia after a number of anterior chest&#xD;
      and abdominal procedures. This is a simple interfascial plane block that can reliably provide&#xD;
      unilateral chest and/or abdominal wall analgesia. It has been described in numerous case&#xD;
      reports and one case series as an effective block for management of unilateral thoracotomies,&#xD;
      unilateral rib fractures, unilateral abdominal incisions and (when used bilaterally) for&#xD;
      management of post-sternotomy pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an interfascial plane block in a compressible anatomical space, the ESB is thought to be&#xD;
      safe in anticoagulated (or recently anticoagulated) patients. It is fast becoming a preferred&#xD;
      anesthetic option for these patients as opposed to neuraxial (e.g. epidural) and&#xD;
      paraneuraxial (i.e. paravertebral) nerve blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the ESB's potentially favorable risk profile versus the other blocks (it is technically&#xD;
      less challenging, more distant from critical structures, and thought to be safe in&#xD;
      anticoagulated patients) it could provide both a safer and easier to perform regional&#xD;
      anesthesia option for many patients. It also offers a new option for a subset of&#xD;
      anticoagulated patients for whom other regional techniques (epidural, paravertebral) are&#xD;
      contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, given the current information available related to the ESB, the regional anesthesia&#xD;
      service at BCH has begun employing it when possible in circumstances where a PVB would&#xD;
      commonly be used but is relatively or absolutely contraindicated. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      thoracotomies while anticoagulated for cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic clamping, etc. have&#xD;
      been successfully managed with continuous ESBs. In addition, thoracotomies in patients with&#xD;
      acquired (e.g. dilutional) and other pathologic coagulopathies have been managed with ESBs.&#xD;
      As such, the ESB has been adopted for routine use in specific patient populations at BCH and&#xD;
      has even occasionally been utilized in lieu of the more longstanding routine PVBs or epidural&#xD;
      blocks for patients without contraindication for such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective review of BCH outcomes data for 47 ESBs done for a variety of surgeries and&#xD;
      populations has not revealed any significant differences between PVBs and ESBs in terms of&#xD;
      adverse events, postoperative opiate use, median pain scores, or other standard outcomes&#xD;
      measures. As this data is observational in nature, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions&#xD;
      as to the comparative efficacy of the two blocks. However, since there are differences in&#xD;
      technical difficulty, relative contraindications, and there exist populations that might&#xD;
      benefit from these blocks, it would be prudent to comparatively evaluate these blocks in a&#xD;
      controlled, randomized, trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate the comparative efficacy of ESBs and PVBs for patients&#xD;
      undergoing unilateral non-cardiac thoracotomy by means of a randomized, controlled&#xD;
      non-inferiority study (based on a threshold of clinical significance being defined as a 15%&#xD;
      difference) comparing rescue analgesic requirements, rendered as opiate equivalents, at 24&#xD;
      postoperatively. Rescue opiates will be available as needed by means of standard PCA/NCA&#xD;
      demand protocols. Secondary measures will include rescue opiate requirements at 48 and 72&#xD;
      hours, pain scores, adverse events, time to discharge from the ICU, time to extubation,&#xD;
      patient disposition after surgery, and time to perform the block in the operating room.&#xD;
