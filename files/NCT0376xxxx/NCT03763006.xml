  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of povidone iodine solution for prophylaxis of endophthalmitis is well established&#xD;
      for intraocular procedures like cataract surgery and for injections of anti-VEGF agents for&#xD;
      retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. Unfortunately iodine is unfriendly&#xD;
      to the ocular surface, and when repeated often enough (some patients require up to monthly&#xD;
      injections of anti-VEGF agents for the entire year), corneal epitheliopathy and secondary dry&#xD;
      eye results. Unfortunately, there is no good alternative to cleaning patient's eyelid at the&#xD;
      moment. Ocudox is a relatively new antibacterial product (spraying on eyelid wipe) which&#xD;
      contains Neutrox (pure hypochlorous acid) that kills many microbes, but remain very friendly&#xD;
      and non-toxic for the ocular surface.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a multicentre study involving 71 eyes, reported at a conference abstract (ARVO), Avenova&#xD;
      (similar ingredients as Ocudox) reduces bacteria on ocular skin surface by more than 90%&#xD;
      without altering the diversity of bacteria on the ocular skin surface in any significant way.&#xD;
      This lowering of the bacterial load was particularly noteworthy for all staphylococci,&#xD;
      including S. epidermidis, the most frequently recovered species. At 20 minutes following&#xD;
      treatment, 138 unique bacterial strains belonging to 26 different species were recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the efficacy of anti-microbial action has not been compared to the gold standard of&#xD;
      a single wipe with povidone iodine solution. Investigator intend to compare pre and post&#xD;
      treatment of Ocudox and a single use of povidine iodine solution at Day 14 in terms of the&#xD;
      alteration of the conjunctival microbiome of the eye and the effect on the ocular surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance The study has implications on the prophylaxis of infection in many&#xD;
      common ophthalmic procedures conducted in Singapore National Eye Centre and many places in&#xD;
      the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to compare pre and post-treatment of the application&#xD;
           of Ocudox to a single use of povidine iodine solution at Day 14in terms of the&#xD;
           alteration of the conjunctival microbiome and the integrity of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EXPECTED RIKS AND BENEFITS There would be no expected risk involved as all the&#xD;
           evaluations are non-invasive. However, there will be some slight discomfort from measure&#xD;
           tear volume or tear collection (Schirmer's strips) and also slight discomfort from&#xD;
           culturing procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known benefits from participation in this study. However, this project may have&#xD;
      the potential to prevent infection in many common ophthalmic procedures conducted in&#xD;
      Singapore National Eye Centre and many places in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY POPULATION 3.1. List the number and nature of subjects to be enrolled. Due to the&#xD;
      nature of the preliminary study, six participants with Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) will&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study visits and duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial arms No. of study visits Study duration Ocudox eyelid wipes 3 21±3 days Povidine iodine&#xD;
      solution 3 21±3 days Recruitment duration: One year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arms and randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 trial arms (parallel groups) in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Ocudox eyelid wipes n=3 B. Povidine iodine solution n=3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation procedure used will entail:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of two witnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Drawing of lots&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization codes for the 2 groups will be noted. For e.g. 001A, 002B, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study information related to randomisation will be filed and kept at SERI&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Only unblinded personnel have access to the randomization code file&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be blinded and unblinded study team members in this study. Blinded study team&#xD;
      members will only be performing the procedures as described below. Unblinded study team&#xD;
      members will dispense the study product, counsel participants on directions for using Ocudox&#xD;
      eyelid wipes and also to clean the eyelid and conjunctiva if randomised to Povidone Iodine,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directions for using Ocudox eyelid wipes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant who received Ocudox eyelid wipes will be instructed to clean the eyelid according&#xD;
      to manufacturer's protocol during the study period (twice a day). A diary chart will be given&#xD;
      to all participants at the end of baseline visit. Participants will be asked to fill up the&#xD;
      diary chart whenever Ocudox eyelid wipes was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directions for cleaning with Povidone Iodine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Pour 10ml of 10% Povidone Iodine into a 50ml Falcon tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dilute 10% of Povidone Iodine to 5% by pouring 10ml of saline and 10ml of Povidone&#xD;
           Iodine into a 50ml Falcon tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prepare gauze and dip into the 10% Povidone Iodine solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clean participant's exterior eye at least 2-3 times&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Next, flush the interior of the participant's eye with 5% Povidone Iodine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a pasture pipette, flush the interior of the participant's eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wait for 5 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 5 minutes, rinse off with saline solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thereafter, wait for 1 minute before adding tetracaine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After adding tetracaine, wait for another minute before collection of microbiome swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oculus Keratograph 5M will be used on the baseline visit and post-treatment visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workflow procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular symptoms will be examined subjectively using standard patient evaluation of eye&#xD;
      dryness (SPEED). Oculus Keratograph 5M will be conducted to assess tear meniscal height&#xD;
      (TMH), conjunctival redness and Non-invasive Tear Break-Up time (NIKBUT). Meibomain gland&#xD;
      evaluator will be used to assess the number of expressible glands. Bacteria on the eye&#xD;
      surface will be cultured from one of the conjunctivas (white part of the eyes) and Schirmers&#xD;
      I test will carry out to examine tear secretion and tear collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in Tear Meniscus Height, Ocular Redness, Non-invasive Tear Break-up time readings&#xD;
      and findings of DNA/RNA between study visits and study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 2. Study workflow&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of study procedures shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) SPEED questionnaires Investigator will use the previously validated standard patient&#xD;
      evaluation of eye dryness (SPEED) questionnaire, which consists of 2 questions on frequency&#xD;
      and severity of dry eye graded on a scale of 0-3 on frequency, and grades 0-4 on severity.&#xD;
      Scores from all sub-questions will be added, and the greater the total score (0-28), the more&#xD;
      frequent or severe the dry eye (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Non-invasive tear break-up time Both Oculus Keratograph 5M (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany)&#xD;
      will be used to perform the non-invasive tear break up time (NIKBUT) (3). Briefly, seated&#xD;
      patients blink freely while fixing on a target ahead. Once ready, patients blink twice and&#xD;
      then refrain from further blinking. The fully automated instrument will capture any break or&#xD;
      distortion in the image of the projected rings on the cornea and the timings will be&#xD;
      automatically recorded. One reading will be taken per eye (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Conjunctiva redness &amp; Tear meniscus height Oculus Keratograph 5M (Oculus, Wetzlar,&#xD;
      Germany) will be used to measure conjunctival redness. After scanning the ocular surface and&#xD;
      images captured, grading of the conjunctival hyperemia (0-4) will be automatically performed&#xD;
      with subtraction of major conjunctival blood vessels, and temporal bulbar, nasal bulbar and&#xD;
      average readings will be obtained. Higher redness scores indicate more hyperemia(5). Height&#xD;
      of the tear meniscus can be measured by dragging the ruler option icon and the measured value&#xD;
      will appear in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Meibomain Gland Evaluator Meibomian glands will be assessed by gently squeezing the lower&#xD;
      eyelids using a device that delivers standardised pressure to the eyelids (Meibomian gland&#xD;
      expresser, TearScience, France). Texture of the expressed secretion will be graded as liquid&#xD;
      or viscous. The number of expressible glands will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) Collection of microbiome One specimens of microbiome will be collected from both eyes&#xD;
      First: a drop of non-preserved tetracaine will be instilled into the conjunctival fornix.&#xD;
      After the stinging sensation has resolved, a sterile cotton swap will be used to collect the&#xD;
      microbes from the lower conjunctival fornix using a gentle rolling action (up to 8 strokes).&#xD;
      The procedure is then repeated for the opposite eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These swaps will then be soaked in DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo) reagent and immediately homogenised&#xD;
      for 1 minute, stop at 30 seconds, and keep on ice for 1 minute, and homogenized for another&#xD;
      30 seconds. Homogenised samples will be stored at 4°C. This ensures an optimal and sufficient&#xD;
      DNA/RNA yield for our purpose. Subsequent nucleic acid extraction, PCR, sequencing, and&#xD;
      bioinformatics procedures will be performed by our collaborators. Storage: intended to be&#xD;
      analysed within a year, not more than 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Investigator intend to compare composition of known microbes at the specie and&#xD;
      genus level after obtaining the reads in the non-human DNA metagenomics signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi) Schirmers I test Schirmer I test will be done with the standard 5 mm wide Test Strips&#xD;
      (Clement Clark) with a notch for folding, without prior anaesthesia. The strips will be&#xD;
      positioned over the inferior temporal half of the lower lid margin in both eyes, and&#xD;
      participants' eyes will then close. The extent of the wetting will be recorded after 5&#xD;
      minutes, and strips stored at -80˚C until further analysis(7).&#xD;
