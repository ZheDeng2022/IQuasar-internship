      This research study seeks to develop and evaluate a mobile health app which aims to provide&#xD;
      patients who are about to initiate androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer with an&#xD;
      exercise program and better eating habits. The first phase of the research study seeks to&#xD;
      evaluate the experience of the first version of the mobile health app within a group of&#xD;
      participants and what they think of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are interested in how individuals react to the use of a developed mobile&#xD;
      health app and what they think of it.&#xD;

    <description>The developed mobile health app will include the following facets:&#xD;
Physical activities&#xD;
Dietary regimen.&#xD;
The physical activities facet will encourage patients to engage in physical activities, with daily prompts, encouragement, and tips.&#xD;
Users will be asked to record the type of physical activity they engaged in during the week, and for how long.&#xD;
The dietary aspect will ask patients to log what they ate during the day and to rate how 'healthy' it is</description>
