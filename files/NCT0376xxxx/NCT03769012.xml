    <textblock>
      This proposed study is designed to assess the efficacy of a capsule containing beta-glucan&#xD;
      taken orally daily as compared to a placebo capsule on the URTI symptoms, and the immune&#xD;
      response change in marathon runners&#xD;

      At screening, an informed consent form will be given to the potential volunteer. They will be&#xD;
      required to read the information and will be given the opportunity to seek more information&#xD;
      if needed or provided with the option of taking the consent form home to review prior to&#xD;
      making their decision. If agreeable, the volunteer will sign the consent form and receive a&#xD;
      duplicate of the signed copy. Once consent has been obtained, the screening visit will&#xD;
      proceed. Each volunteer will be sequentially assigned a screening number to be entered in the&#xD;
      screening and enrollment log. Screening assessments include: review medical history, assess&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, vitals, study diary, URTI symptom questionnaire, bowel&#xD;
      diary, and GI symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next visit will be scheduled 14 days prior to their marathon date (baseline).&#xD;
      Participants will be reminded to complete URTI questionnaire, daily study diary, modified GI&#xD;
      symptoms and bowel diary in advance of this baseline visit. At baseline participants will&#xD;
      begin daily completion of study diaries, URTI questionnaires, daily bowel diaries, and GI&#xD;
      tolerance questionnaires. In clinic subjects will complete mood and stress questionnaires,&#xD;
      and blood sample for the analysis of CRP and NK cell activity. In addition, on the day of the&#xD;
      marathon the participant will be instructed to complete a muscle soreness assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two and four weeks post-marathon participants will return to the clinic for with unused&#xD;
      investigational product, completed study diaries, daily URTI questionnaires, daily bowel&#xD;
      diaries, and GI tolerance questionnaires. In clinic subjects will complete mood and stress&#xD;
      questionnaires, and blood sample for the analysis of CRP and NK cell activity.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A randomization schedule will be created and provided to the Investigator indicating the order of randomization. Each participant will be assigned a randomization code according to the order of the randomization list generated using www.randomization.com. Enrolled participants will be randomized to the different treatment arms at day -14. Concealment of the allocation of treatment will be employed through the use of opaque sealed envelopes, each labeled with a randomization number. Each envelope will contain information regarding the treatment associated with each randomization number.</masking_description>
