  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence crossover&#xD;
      study in healthy male and female subjects to evaluate the effect of food on the PK of&#xD;
      levoketoconazole.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In each period of the randomized, two period crossover study, levoketoconazole will be&#xD;
      administered orally as a single dose of 600 mg levoketoconazole to subjects in the fasted&#xD;
      state or fed (at 30 minutes after beginning consumption of a standardized high-fat meal).&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to one treatment in Period 1 will be assigned to the opposite treatment in&#xD;
      Period 2.&#xD;

             chocolate-containing products for 3 days prior to CRU admission each week.&#xD;
             Caffeine-containing foods and/or beverages (e.g., tea and cola) should be considered&#xD;
