  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma patients will receive a cancer vaccine, called TXSVN that has been derived&#xD;
      from the bacteria Salmonella. TXSVN is a weakened form of a live vaccine strain of the&#xD;
      Salmonella bacteria (also known as the CVD908ssb strain) that has been genetically modified&#xD;
      in the laboratory to produce a protein known as Survivin that stimulates an immune response&#xD;
      in the body to the Survivin tumor antigen. CVD908ssb has been administered to over 80 healthy&#xD;
      donors as a Salmonella vaccine in reported clinical trials. This trial intends to explore&#xD;
      administration of this vaccine at a lower dose than what was tested in healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survivin belongs to the group of proteins known as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). These&#xD;
      are cell proteins that are specific to the cancer cell. They either are not found or are&#xD;
      found in low levels normal cells in the human body. More than 90% of myeloma cancer cells&#xD;
      have been shown to possess large quantities of Survivin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TXSVN may activate the immune system which is your body's ability to fight disease, and help&#xD;
      develop a response against cancer cells that express Survivin. Survivin has been safely&#xD;
      targeted using immune cells, drugs or direct inhibitors in over 50 patients with cancers in&#xD;
      published reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TXSVN, the modified strain of CVD908ssb has not been tested in humans to this date. TXSVN is&#xD;
      an investigational product not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of TXSVN, to learn what the side&#xD;
      effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help participants with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine will be administered orally (by mouth) as a solution mixed with sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate. Participants may be pre-treated with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine&#xD;
      (Benadryl). Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are given to prevent a&#xD;
      possible allergic reaction to the vaccine. Participants will remain in the clinic for three&#xD;
      hours after receiving the vaccine for monitoring.Two doses of TXSVN will be given two weeks&#xD;
      apart. Participants disease will be assessed pre-treatment and then 6 weeks after the second&#xD;
      treatment. All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at&#xD;
      Houston Methodist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In between the first and second treatments, and for 6 weeks after the last treatment, the&#xD;
      investigators ask that participants not receive any other anti-cancer treatments such as&#xD;
      radiation therapy or chemotherapy. If participants do receive any other therapies in-between&#xD;
      the first and second treatment, then they will be taken off treatment and will not be able to&#xD;
      receive the second treatment of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started&#xD;
      on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of TXSVN. Once that dose schedule proves safe,&#xD;
      the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until&#xD;
      all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side-effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered&#xD;
      or the TXSVN administrations will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, participants will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of participants multiple myeloma by blood tests and bone marrow biopsy (when&#xD;
           available).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of participants tumor by routine imaging studies. The investigators will&#xD;
           use the imaging study that was used before to follow the participants tumor:&#xD;
           Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission&#xD;
           Tomography (PET/CT), skeletal bone survey. These studies will be done on a case-by-case&#xD;
           basis at the discretion of the participants treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (using a blood sample) if the participants is a female who can have&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the vaccine and after:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and stool cultures at 4 days after getting the vaccine and at least weekly for up&#xD;
           to 8 weeks after treatment, to monitor shedding of the administered live vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the participants multiple myeloma by blood tests and/or bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy (when available). Imaging study (as decided by the participants treating&#xD;
           physician) 8 weeks after the 1st vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then come to the clinic every 3 months for the first year&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the vaccine is working in the participants body, an extra 20-40&#xD;
      mL (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before each vaccination, and weekly for eight (8)&#xD;
      weeks after the participants first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: The participants active participation in this study will last for&#xD;
      approximately one (1) year. The investigators will then contact the participants once a year&#xD;
      for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      participants disease response long-term. While participants are being followed on study,&#xD;
      investigators will collect information about the response to the vaccine (how well or not the&#xD;
      participants multiple myeloma responds to the treatment) and any toxicities the participants&#xD;
      may experience. This study will continue until it has completed enrolling subjects and all&#xD;
      subjects have completed follow-up or have come off study.&#xD;
