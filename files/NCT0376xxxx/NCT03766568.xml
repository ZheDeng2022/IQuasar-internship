      This is a pilot study to assess the first time use of the JGG endoscope® in humans and in&#xD;
      primary care. The JGG endoscope® is attached to a Heine® otoscope and allows to inspect and&#xD;
      to collect samples from the middle meatus of the sinus. The JGG endoscope® is sterile&#xD;
      packaged, for one way use and disposable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for consultations and antibiotic&#xD;
      prescriptions in primary care although the condition is primarily of viral origin. The main&#xD;
      reason for antibiotic overuse in acute rhinosinusitis is the lack of diagnostic tests of&#xD;
      sufficient accuracy to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis&#xD;
      (ABRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for the diagnosis of ABRS is a bacterial culture from sinus maxillary&#xD;
      puncture. This procedure is painful, prone to complications and only done in selected&#xD;
      patients by oto-rhino-laryngology (ORL) specialists or for research purposes. Therefore,&#xD;
      endoscopy of the middle meatus and collection of diagnostic material from the ostium draining&#xD;
      the sinus is the diagnostic method of choice for ABRS and routinely used by ORL specialists&#xD;
      in house and elsewhere. In patients with clinical symptoms of sufficient severity and&#xD;
      duration (typically 5-10 days) for ABRS, endoscopy has a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% confidence&#xD;
      interval, 56.2-97.5), specificity of 90.6% (73.8-97.5), positive predictive value of 80%&#xD;
      (51.4-94.7), negative predictive value of 93.5% (77.2-98.9) for culture proven ABRS when&#xD;
      compared with cultures gained from sinus puncture. Because of high upfront costs and&#xD;
      logistical reason (disinfection) endoscopy is not used in general practice or internal&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Jens G. Hansen has developed the disposable JGG endoscope® (JGG stands for the surnames&#xD;
      of the inventor and his wife) which can be attached to the new generation of Heine® otoscopes&#xD;
      with a LED light source that allows the inspection of the ostium in the middle meatus and&#xD;
      collection of material for bacterial culture for the diagnosis of ABRS in primary care. After&#xD;
      local anaesthesiology of the cavum nasi a sample material for cultures can be gained&#xD;
      (earliest 10 min after local anaesthesia). The diagnostic procedure poses patients at minimal&#xD;
      risk for complications and is of very little and short-termed discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study the investigators would like to test the JGG endoscope® in 60 patients with&#xD;
      suspected acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in the ORL unit of the University Hospital Basel and&#xD;
      selected general practices that collaborate with the Centre for Primary Health Care of the&#xD;
      University of Basel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of visualization and sample collection from the middle meatus&#xD;
           with the JGG endoscope® in patients with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial&#xD;
           rhinosinusitis in Swiss primary care setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate whether the JGG endoscope® supports the decision of antibiotic&#xD;
           prescribing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess patients' and physicians' acceptability of the examination with the JGG&#xD;
           endoscope®&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to investigate the prevalence of culture proven acute bacterial rhinosinusitis from&#xD;
           samples of the middle meatus by the JGG endoscope® in patients with clinically diagnosed&#xD;
           acute rhinosinusitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to investigate the number of patients with acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed by the JGG&#xD;
           endoscope® with any and/or deferred antibiotic prescriptions&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to investigate the days with restrictions and symptoms in patients with acute&#xD;
           rhinosinusitis with positive and negative bacterial cultures diagnosed by the JGG&#xD;
           endoscope®&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. to investigate any serious adverse event related to the JGG endoscope®.&#xD;
