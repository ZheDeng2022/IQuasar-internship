      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone followed by&#xD;
      daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has&#xD;
      come back (relapsed) or does not response to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Bortezomib and ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone&#xD;
      followed by daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone may work better and help to control&#xD;
      cancer in patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival of subjects with daratumumab, bortezomib, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (DVd) treatment followed by daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone (DId)&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by International Myeloma Working Group&#xD;
      Criteria (IMWG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate time to response (TTR). III. To evaluate time to progression (TTP). IV. To&#xD;
      evaluate duration of response (DOR). V. To evaluate overall survival (OS). VI. To evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability. VII. To evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) rate. VIII. To&#xD;
      evaluate quality of life (QoL) using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication&#xD;
      (TSMQ-9) and European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) patient reported questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate biomarkers of response to treatment and mechanisms of resistance with&#xD;
      pretreatment and post-treatment bone marrow and blood samples with deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and immune profiling by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 3.5-6.5 hours on days 1, 8, and 15,&#xD;
      bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and dexamethasone IV over 15 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, and 15 and orally (PO) on days 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, and 16. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients then receive daratumumab IV over 3.5 hours on days 1 and 15 of cycles 4-7 and day 1&#xD;
      of subsequent cycles, ixazomib PO on days 1, 8, and 15, and dexamethasone IV over 15 minutes&#xD;
      or PO once weekly. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days and then periodically for up&#xD;
      to 24 months.&#xD;
