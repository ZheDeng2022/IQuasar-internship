      This current chart review study was designed to investigate the incidence of breast cancer in&#xD;
      women treated with subcutaneous testosterone therapy for symptoms of hormone deficiency.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prior ten-year prospective, observational, study was initially approved in March of 2008 by&#xD;
      the IRB board through the Atrium Medical Center, Premier Health Partners in Middletown, Ohio&#xD;
      45005 and registered through the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP). Expedited&#xD;
      approval continued annually through 2013 at which time the IRB board was closed. All&#xD;
      participants signed a study consent and HIPPA consent. Recruitment closed in 2013. The&#xD;
      original protocol was designed to investigate the incidence of breast cancer in women&#xD;
      presenting with symptoms of hormone deficiency treated with subcutaneous testosterone&#xD;
      implants or, testosterone combined with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole implants. A&#xD;
      computer program was specifically designed to track and follow patients prospectively and all&#xD;
      patients continued to be followed through 2018.&#xD;

        Women who presented to the office of Dr. Rebecca Glaser between March 2008- March of 2103&#xD;
        with symptoms of hormone deficiency and received testosterone implant therapy were asked to&#xD;
        participate in the study. This current chart review study will examine the 10-year&#xD;
        incidence of breast cancer in women accrued to the study.&#xD;
