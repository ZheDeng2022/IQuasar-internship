  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose of GRT0151Y that is tolerable and&#xD;
      to explore the safety profile of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each Treatment Period (Visits 2-5), dosing will be separated by at least one week.&#xD;
      Participants in this study will receive up to four doses of the study drug and up to two&#xD;
      placebo (an inactive substance) preparations, one at a time on each of up to six visits.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single dose of either GRT0151Y or placebo beginning with the&#xD;
      lowest dose of study drug 150 milligrams (mg), followed by 200 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg, 350 mg and&#xD;
      400 mg doses of the study drug. Participants will only be allowed to proceed to the next&#xD;
      higher dose of GRT0151Y (or placebo) if the previous dose was well tolerated. Neither the&#xD;
      participant nor the study staff will know whether participants are receiving GRT0151Y or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

    <description>Manual-tracking test with a simultaneous visual target detection component. Participant is provided with joystick and presented with the image of an airplane and a randomly curving road; participant has to position the airplane over the center of the road while being distracted repeatedly by visual targets they have to respond to.

    <description>Choice reaction time (CRT) is a computerized assessment that trains the participant to respond to stimuli presented on the screen. The task requires the participant to react as soon as a colored key appears in one of up to eight locations. The participant must respond by lifting their finger from the central start button and depressing the corresponding response key as quickly as possible. This is the reaction time (RT). Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>

             to 30 kilograms per square meter, inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and&#xD;
             procedures required for the study, and are willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of recreational opiate use (defined as nontherapeutic use&#xD;
             at least 10 times in the past year and at least once in the last 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             screening) but not dependent on opiates Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
             Disorders-4th edition (DSM-IV criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must consent to use a medically acceptable method of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the entire study period, including washout periods. For all females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential only: adequate contraception is defined as any form of hormonal&#xD;
             contraception or intra-uterine device that needs to be in place for a period of at&#xD;
             least two months prior to screening. Additional barrier contraception must be used for&#xD;
             the duration of the study, defined as from the time of the enrolment visit to the&#xD;
             final examination, and for at least one full month thereafter. A single barrier method&#xD;
             alone or abstinence alone is not acceptable. Women of non-childbearing potential may&#xD;
             be included if surgically sterile or post-menopausal for at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             (beta- Human chorionic gonadotropin) at the enrolment visit. For females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential, the time between the enrolment visit and first receipt of drug&#xD;
             will be separated by a minimum of 10 days to ensure accuracy of the pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a positive urine drug screen (for amphetamines, barbiturates,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, phencyclidine and opiates) upon presentation&#xD;
             at enrolment will be allowed to continue only if the investigator or designee&#xD;
             considers that the presence of the drug will not introduce additional risk factors for&#xD;
             the study participant, or interfere with study procedures or data integrity. Positive&#xD;
             drug screens for select drugs are to be confirmed using quantitative methods such as&#xD;
             GC/MS or equivalent, and the investigator or designee's decision to allow participants&#xD;
             to continue will take into account the quantitative levels of drug in the subjects'&#xD;
             urine. Participants may be rescheduled for another treatment period at the&#xD;
             investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deemed healthy on the basis of enrolment visit physical examination, medical history,&#xD;
             vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters (serum/urine biochemistry, urinalysis,&#xD;
             clotting, blood sedimentation rate (BSR), haematology and hepatitis and human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus serology). If the results of the laboratory tests&#xD;
             or the urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges, the&#xD;
             participant can be included only on condition that the investigator or designee judges&#xD;
             that the deviations are not clinically relevant and do not interfere with the study&#xD;
             objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a negative breath alcohol analysis at enrolment. A positive alcohol reading&#xD;
             is one that is above the error measurement associated with the breathalyzer.&#xD;
             Participants presenting a positive alcohol breath test may be allowed to continue in&#xD;
             the study only if the investigator (or designee) considers that the presence of breath&#xD;
             alcohol does not suggest problematic alcohol consumption, and will not introduce&#xD;
             additional risk factors for the study participant, or interfere with study procedures&#xD;
             or data integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to speak, read and understand English sufficiently to understand the nature of&#xD;
