  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can cause transient myocardial dysfunction. Recently, it have&#xD;
      been reported that myocardial dysfunctions that occur in SAH are associated with poor&#xD;
      outcomes. It therefore appears essential to detect theses dysfunctions with the higher&#xD;
      sensitivity as possible. Strain measurement using speckle-tracking echocardiography may&#xD;
      detect myocardial dysfunction with great sensitivity. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the prevalence of myocardial dysfunction in &quot;non-severe&quot; SAH (defined by a WFNS grade&#xD;
      1 or 2), using speckle-tracking echocardiography. This study also aims to analyse Strain&#xD;
      measurement with classical echocardiography and serum markers (troponin, BNP) of cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac complication, occurring in the early phase of SAH has been well described. It seems&#xD;
      that the pathophysiological mechanism involves vegetative hyperactivity due to the acute&#xD;
      cerebral injury. It has been shown that stress cardiomyopathy is associated with delayed&#xD;
      cerebral ischemia (DCI) and poor outcomes. Manifestations of stress cardiomyopathy are&#xD;
      changes in electrocardiogram, release of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and BNP, and&#xD;
      echography evidence of impaired left ventricle ejection fraction with the use of Simpson&#xD;
      technique and regional wall motion abnormalities. These two techniques bear intra-observer&#xD;
      variability. A new method is available to assess left ventricular contractility at the&#xD;
      bedside. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking images with echocardiography allows one to track a&#xD;
      natural myocardial marker within the myocardium by standard transthoracic echocardiography.&#xD;
      It provides unique insights into myocardial function such as tissue deformations and strain&#xD;
      rate, which is the rate of deformation. This method is more sensitive than classical&#xD;
      echographic left ventricular ejection fraction evaluation and bears very low interobserver&#xD;
      variability. The Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) is the most studied parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of cardiac dysfunction in SAH followed by appropriate monitoring and&#xD;
      management may improve outcome in SAH. This is a prospective, observational and mono-center&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with &quot;non-severe&quot; SAH will benefit from an echocardiography where Left Ventricular&#xD;
      Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and GLS will be assessed on day 1, 3 and 7 following the acute&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

    <description>It is calculated using values of longitudinal strain measured in the three-,four-, and two-chamber of the left ventricle of the heart. GLS is expressed as percentage. Strain is a measure of myocardial muscle fiber shortening during contraction and is calculated as the systolic segment shortening between end-systolic (ES) segment length (L) and end-diastolic (ED) length: strain = (-LES - LED)/LED x 100 %.</description>
