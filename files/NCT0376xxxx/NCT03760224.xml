    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WhatsApp group&#xD;
      discussion for smoking relapse prevention. To assess the effect due to treatment modality&#xD;
      through the WhatsApp social group, the frequency and topics of the posts in each social group&#xD;
      will be analysed and in each participant. The primary hypothesis is whether quitters who&#xD;
      participate in the WhatsApp group discussion will have a higher prevalence of validated&#xD;
      tobacco abstinence at 12-month follow-up than those who do not. The second hypothesis is that&#xD;
      greater participation in the social groups, indicated by number of posts received, posted&#xD;
      and/or viewed, was associated with higher likelihood to quit at 12-month. The third&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the WhatsApp intervention for a recent quitter is a more cost-effective&#xD;
      option for tobacco abstinence and prolonged survival when compared to the control group.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2-arm open-labelled pragmatic randomized controlled trial, by comparing the&#xD;
      12-month tobacco abstinence between the recent quitters who will join WhatsApp group&#xD;
      discussion (Intervention group) and those who will not (Control group). A 1:1 randomised&#xD;
      allocation will be used. The intervention content for both trial arms in the proposed trial&#xD;
      will be the same and based on the US practice guidelines for smoking cessation, therefore the&#xD;
      intervention effects due to the treatment content will be the same in both groups. Only the&#xD;
      intervention platform (WhatsApp vs text messaging service) and the communication mode&#xD;
      (one-way vs interactive) will be different between the 2 groups. This trial will be a&#xD;
      pragmatic effectiveness trial to examine the effect of our intervention delivered under a&#xD;
      real-life setting. A less stringent eligibility criteria will be applied for the subjects,&#xD;
      unobtrusive measurement on adherence, and include all subjects in the final analysis&#xD;
      regardless of intervention compliance of each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are receiving the smoking cessation service in the smoking cessation clinic of&#xD;
      the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Tung Wah Groups of Hospital, Shau Kei Wan Jockey Club&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic, Sai Ying Pun Jockey Club Outpatient Clinic and Pok Oi Chinese medicine&#xD;
      clinic. Smoking Cessation Service will be invited to go through the screening process. These&#xD;
      clinics are under Hospital Authority (n=3), or are non-governmental organizations that are&#xD;
      funded by the government (n=7). Patients with the following inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the RCT and will proceed to the recruitment procedure and&#xD;
      intervention phase (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Daily tobacco user before service intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aged 18 years or above&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Have enrolled or re-enrolled in the smoking cessation treatment for no more than 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Not using tobacco products (including traditional cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco&#xD;
           products) for 3 to 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Able to communicate in Cantonese/Mandarin and read Chinese&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Have a smart phone with local network connection The 4th criterion will be used because&#xD;
           our proposed RCT will target the quitters who have recently quit, and exclude those who&#xD;
           will have maintained a longer period of abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not use WhatsApp as communication tool and show no interest to use WhatsApp&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have unstable physical or psychological conditions as advised by doctors or counsellor&#xD;
           in charge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have become pregnant in the past 2 months If the smoker meet all eligibility except the&#xD;
           abstinence (the 4th criterion), he/she will be introduced about our RCT and asked to&#xD;
           sign a consent form that allowing the HKU research staff to contact him again for&#xD;
           another screening in (Phase 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small souvenir worthy of HK$20 (US$2.6) will be given to all participants at baseline.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a HK$50 (US$6.4) shopping voucher for completing one follow-up&#xD;
      survey and HK$100 (US$12.8) for completing one biochemical validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a usual smoking cessation counseling session, the clinic counsellor or onsite trial&#xD;
      recruitment staff (TRS) will briefly introduce the importance of relapse prevention and our&#xD;
      phone-based relapse prevention intervention to the patient. If the patient agree to join, the&#xD;
      TRS will then assess the eligibility section on the consent form. Patients who meet all the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will (i) be introduced about the RCT that they will be randomized to&#xD;
      either the intervention or control group, and will participate in all follow-up assessments;&#xD;
      (ii) be asked to sign the consent form; (iii) fill in a baseline questionnaire; and (iv)&#xD;
      receive a leaflet, a self-help booklet and a souvenir. The consented participant will proceed&#xD;
      to the intervention phase (Phase 2) and will be informed group allocation (WhatsApp social&#xD;
      group (Intervention group) or text messaging service (control group)), where the option of&#xD;
      platform will be determined by a randomization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants meet all eligibility criteria in the first screening except the tobacco&#xD;
      abstinence for 3 to 30 days, the recruitment staff will invite them to set a quit day and&#xD;
      complete the above recruitment procedures, but not to be randomized at that time. TRS will&#xD;
      contact the participant 3 days after the quit date, and re-assess the eligibility of the RCT.&#xD;
      Then, the participant will complete a baseline questionnaire, and receive a leaflet, a&#xD;
      self-help booklet and a souvenir which are the same as those given to patient who meet all&#xD;
      criteria. These participants will proceed to Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient do not meet other eligibility criteria in the first screening, the TRS will&#xD;
      only provide a booklet (which are the same as those given to recruited patient) to the&#xD;
      patient. He/she will be regarded as recruitment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Telephone follow-up) The participants in Phase 1 will be contacted by TRS to confirm&#xD;
      the abstinence status. If the participant has not smoked for 3 days, the individual will be&#xD;
      asked again if he/she agrees to receive the phone-based relapse prevention intervention. If&#xD;
      agree, the TRS will briefly introduce again the RCT, and complete a brief questionnaire on&#xD;
      the telephone. Afterwards, the participant will proceed to the intervention phase (Phase 2).&#xD;
      If the participant disagrees, TRS will ask if he/she likes to participate in the study. If&#xD;
      the participant does not wish to participate in the study, then the individual consent form&#xD;
      will be destroyed and will not be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant has not quit smoking, the TRS will ask the participant to set a quit date&#xD;
      again and ask his/her consent to be re-contacted for another telephone screening after the&#xD;
      quit date. Patients who do not want to be re-contacted will be regarded as recruitment&#xD;
      failure. Otherwise, the TRS will contact the participant again after the quit date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions (Phase 2) When the TRS (that has gone through training to be a WhatsApp group&#xD;
      moderator) collects about 7 to 14 participants (who have met all eligibility criteria) every&#xD;
      one or two weeks from all clinics, he/she will set up the WhatsApp group with them. Each&#xD;
      WhatsApp group (about 50 groups in total) will allow real-time group discussion for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      The participants will receive each week at least 3 text messages or videos from a moderator,&#xD;
      which will be based on the six approaches delineated in &quot;Treatments for the Recent Quitter&quot;&#xD;
      of the US Clinical Practice Guidelines on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. Based on the&#xD;
      Positive Psychology theories, a framework of four principles to enhance the online group&#xD;
      moderation: (1) Using active listening skills to understand the thoughts and feelings behind&#xD;
      individual's sharing; (2) Showing sincere, immediate, specific, and concrete appreciation and&#xD;
      gratitude towards their sharing; (3) Mindful awareness of the group dynamics and giving&#xD;
      strategic reactions; (4) Enhancement of self-efficacy, sense of control and satisfaction&#xD;
      among the individual. All messages will address the five common problems leading to smoking&#xD;
      relapse delineated in &quot;Treatments for the Recent Quitter&quot; of the US Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (26), including (1) lack of support for&#xD;
      cessation; (2) negative mood or depression; (3) strong prolonged withdrawal symptoms; (4)&#xD;
      weight gain; and (5) smoking lapses. If any participant shares their lapse or relapse&#xD;
      experience in the group, the moderator will engage other individual to provide appreciation&#xD;
      and support, or, if that individual agreed, actively refer him/her to existing cessation&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure quality assurance and intervention fidelity, all moderators will be provided&#xD;
      training of smoking cessation knowledge, and moderating skills to motivate individual to&#xD;
      share in WhatsApp. Moderators will also be trained on Positive Psychology by psychologist and&#xD;
      counsellors from United Christian Hospital, United Centre of Emotional Health and Positive&#xD;
      Living. This would allow moderators to learn a more positive approach to the language use&#xD;
      within the group discussion and ways to express gratitude. The control group will only&#xD;
      receive 3 mobile phone text messages each week in the 8 weeks after recruitment. These&#xD;
      messages will be similar to those received by the intervention group. Our intervention will&#xD;
      not interrupt the services that all individual will be receiving in the cessation clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measures will be used to protect the privacy of personal data and internet safety of&#xD;
      joining the WhatsApp groups. First, male and female individual in the WhatsApp group will be&#xD;
      separated into different WhatsApp groups to avoid the possibility of misconduct or&#xD;
      harassment. Second, participants will be reassured that all the WhatsApp posts can only be&#xD;
      read by the individual and the moderator in the group as stated in the consent form. The TRS&#xD;
      will only analyse all the data and WhatsApp posts anonymously. Third, moderator will&#xD;
      encourage all the participants in the WhatsApp groups to share and post messages in the&#xD;
      group, and avoid 1-to-1 individual communication via any channels within the study period.&#xD;
      The moderator will also encourage the individual to report if anyone violate this regulation,&#xD;
      and, if so, may give warnings to that individual. If the participant severely violate this&#xD;
      regulation, this may result in termination of their participation. The moderator will also&#xD;
      monitor the group conversation and report any events of misusing the contact information in&#xD;
      the WhatsApp to the lead PI. This can reduce the chance of any misconduct, harassment,&#xD;
      sharing and spread of harmful programs or virus, and unauthorized marketing using the contact&#xD;
      information. Fourth, to avoid any internet virus or harmful links, the moderators will remind&#xD;
      the group members not to open any suspicious links and files via WhatsApp. Lastly, individual&#xD;
      can withdraw from the intervention study anytime over the study period. In the pilot RCT,&#xD;
      about 83.4% of the eligible individual agreed to participate in the WhatsApp social groups&#xD;
      after informed the above ethical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the recruitment, TRS will immediately send the contact details of the participant to&#xD;
      our research staff for the randomization procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRS will send the Information of all the participant to the research staff, who are&#xD;
      responsible to randomly allocate the group assignment. The principal investigator will&#xD;
      generate a list of random numbers (for each recruitment site) and a list of group allocation,&#xD;
      using the rand function of Excel. TRS will assign group allocation to each participant based&#xD;
      on the list, followed by the intervention delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All TRS and participants will be concealed to the group allocation at recruitment. This&#xD;
      randomization procedure will be done by the research staff in the research office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant and group moderators cannot and will not be blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
      Assessors of the follow-up outcomes and the research analysts will not be involved in the&#xD;
      recruitment and intervention delivery, and will be blinded to the group allocation (single&#xD;
      blindness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals will be followed up via telephone by an allocation-blinded interviewer at 3-,&#xD;
      6- and 12-month after the random group allocation. Only the individual who report abstinence&#xD;
      in the past 7 days during the 6- and 12- month follow-up will be invited to provide samples&#xD;
      of exhaled breath and/or saliva for biochemical validation at their residence, workplace, or&#xD;
      nearby, as preferred by the quitters. The Bedfont Smokerlyzer and iScreen OFD Cotinine Saliva&#xD;
      Test Kit will be used for validations. To increase participation, the participants will be&#xD;
      given HK$100 (approximately equivalent to US$12.8) as a compensation for their time cost. All&#xD;
      participants will not know the validation incentive at baseline. The validation takes very&#xD;
      short time (3 minutes ) and is easy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our pilot RCT showed that the OR of the CO validated quit rates between the intervention and&#xD;
      control group was 2.04 (95%CI 0.74-5.65) (Intervention: 26.0%, Control: 15.0%). Because our&#xD;
      proposed RCT will recruit quitters who have recently quit, PI have conservatively estimated&#xD;
      that the OR will be 1.70 (23.0% vs 15.0%). To detect a significant difference of quit rate&#xD;
      with 2-tailed z-test by GPower 3.1 between the two groups with a power of 90% (to reduce type&#xD;
      II error) and 5% significant level (type I error), 1,008 participantswill be needed in total&#xD;
      (504 individual per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using intention-to-treat analysis, participants who are lost to follow-up or drop out will be&#xD;
      treated as smokers with no changes in daily cigarette consumption. The odds ratio, risk&#xD;
      difference, and 95% confidence interval will be used to compare the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes between the two trial groups. Number needed to treat (NNT), which shows the number&#xD;
      of treated participants needed to have one additional quitter at 12-month, will be computed&#xD;
      by taking the reciprocal of the risk difference between the two trial groups. Assuming the&#xD;
      missing outcomes are dependent on observed data (missing at random), an analysis using the&#xD;
      multiple imputation (MI) procedure to impute the missing data will be conducted as&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis. On the assumption that there will be no heterogeneity of intervention&#xD;
      effect across clinics, the primary analysis will be conducted using logistic regression with&#xD;
      and without adjustment for baseline characteristics. The assumption of homogeneity will first&#xD;
      be checked by testing the clinic by intervention interaction with clinic as a fixed effect in&#xD;
      the logistic model. If there is evidence of heterogeneity (i.e. p-value &lt; 0.1), an analysis&#xD;
      by generalized linear mixed (GLM) model with clinic as a random effect will be used to&#xD;
      summarize the intervention effect on the primary outcome. Number of posts received and posted&#xD;
      by each participant will be documented, and then included in the final GLM model to assess&#xD;
      their association with the cessation outcome. All data analysis will be done using IBM SPSS&#xD;
      version 25.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text mining of the WhatsApp groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All discussion content will be archived and anonymized to remove identifying personal&#xD;
      information. Due to a huge number of messages from the 50 WhatsApp groups, an automatic,&#xD;
      computational text mining and visualization of the dataset will be used for the content&#xD;
      analysis. First, utilizing a lexicon of keywords derived from our qualitative analysis of the&#xD;
      pilot RCT, a heatmap visualization will be developed to illustrate the prevalence of the&#xD;
      discussion topics. Second, topic modelling will be applied to investigate emerging themes in&#xD;
      our WhatsApp dataset, using the Mallet implementation of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation&#xD;
      topic modelling algorithm. Topic modelling algorithms take as input a text dataset (in this&#xD;
      case, the WhatsApp dataset), and output a set of topics (and their associated keywords) in&#xD;
      addition to estimates of the proportion of each topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect opinions towards the WhatsApp group intervention, purposive sampling will be used&#xD;
      to select 20 individuals from the intervention group including both sexes, all age groups and&#xD;
      all smoking status at 12-month, to participate in a qualitative face-to-face or telephone&#xD;
      interview after the intervention. An interview guide with open-ended and iterative questions&#xD;
      was used to probe for more experiences from the interviewees. Each interview will be&#xD;
      conducted by the PI and a trained research assistant, and will last about 30 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview content was transcribed verbatim in Chinese for further analysis. The&#xD;
      qualitative interview transcripts will be analysed using framework analysis to construct a&#xD;
      coherent and logical structure from the classification of many opinions and perceptions of&#xD;
      social groups. Lead PI and two trained research assistants first used the open-coding method&#xD;
      to identify relevant content in the transcripts; next, the lead PI will classified all&#xD;
      labelled content into several independent themes showing distinct features of the social&#xD;
      groups. The results were then discussed and consolidated in the panel meetings with the Co-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken to indicate whether the intervention will be&#xD;
      more cost-effective or even cost-saving option for a quitter over a time horizon of one year&#xD;
      (within trial period) and lifetime. Within and lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses will be&#xD;
      populated based on the healthcare provider perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model parameters input will be identified through within trial data and a review of local and&#xD;
      overseas literature, where necessary. Within trial cost-effectiveness of WhatsApp&#xD;
      intervention versus control group will be evaluated using total costs, the number of tobacco&#xD;
      abstinence and total QALYs over the study period. EQ-5D-5L utility data at baseline and&#xD;
      follow-ups from trial will estimate QALYs in two groups using area under the curve technique.&#xD;
      Lifetime cost-effectiveness will be performed via Markov modelling that will simulate the&#xD;
      annual health status progression of subjects in either intervention or control group. Both&#xD;
      the successful and unsuccessful quitters after the trial will be subject to the annual&#xD;
      transition probability from a status of no diseases to lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      and other diseases, and then mortality. Former smokers may be relapsed after abstinence.&#xD;
      Discounting will only be applied to total costs and QALY calculation under the lifetime&#xD;
      horizon. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted where each parameter will be set at plausible&#xD;
      lower and upper bounds based on 95% confidence interval of estimates in above data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per an additional tobacco&#xD;
      abstinence gained, life-years gained, or QALYs gained for the intervention group in&#xD;
      comparison to the control group will be reported. The WhatsApp intervention will be&#xD;
      considered as cost-effective if its ICER will be less than 3 times per capita gross domestic&#xD;
      product in Hong Kong recommended by WHO or the potential ICER threshold in Hong Kong. The&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness model will be built using Microsoft Excel or Treeage Pro software.&#xD;
