  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely recognized that asthma in adult African American patients is a significant&#xD;
      health problem, which is partly affected by relatively low inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)&#xD;
      adherence rates. The goal of this study is to pilot test an ICS adherence intervention,&#xD;
      ARICA, that aims to improve ICS adherence in adult African Americans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate ARICA in Duke primary care clinics to study its feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability using a quasi-experimental pre-post study design. The study will enroll&#xD;
      between 32 and 48 adult African Americans with persistent asthma and suboptimal ICS&#xD;
      adherence, and their health care providers, to study the use of the intervention and key&#xD;
      indicators of the intervention's potential effectiveness.&#xD;
