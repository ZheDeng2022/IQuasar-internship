  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a widely used treatment on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;
      Swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia) after extubation may cause aspiration, and is associated&#xD;
      with poor outcomes: pneumonia, reintubation, a prolonged length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      increased mortality. The exact underlying pathophysiology of post-extubation dysphagia (PED)&#xD;
      is unknown. This exploratory pilot study is the first step that aims to fill this knowledge&#xD;
      gap to ultimately improve current treatment and prevention of post-extubation dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using FEES (Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing), HRIM (High Resolution Impedance&#xD;
      Manometry) and EMG (electromyography) simultaneously, 5 healthy subjects and 25 patients&#xD;
      within 24 hours after extubation will be studied.&#xD;

      Observational study model:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of healthy subjects will be recruited using posters at the local university and the&#xD;
      internet. The healthy subjects will be studied before the group of patients to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and possible interactions of simultaneously recording FEES, HRIM and EMG. Then,&#xD;
      the group of patients will be studied. They will be recruited from the Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
      See In- and Exclusion criteria for details.&#xD;

    <description>The pathophysiology of PED will be determined after simultaneous measurement of FEES, HRIM and EMG. The pathophysiology will be classified into several categories: reduced pharyngeal contractility / muscular weakness, reduced upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening/relaxation, direct oropharyngeal or laryngeal trauma of the tube, reduced laryngeal sensibility, among other categories. To enable classification, parameters obtained from FEES, HRIM and EMG will be used. FEES: presence of penetration and aspiration, residue, reduced sensibility (among others); HRIM: pharyngeal peak pressure, UES maximum admittance, intrabolus pressure (among others); EMG: duration of muscle activity (among others).</description>
