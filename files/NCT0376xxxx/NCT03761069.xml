  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase 1b study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of PTC299 and&#xD;
      the metabolite, O-desmethyl PTC299, in participants with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) who have exhausted standard available therapies known to provide clinical&#xD;
      benefit. The study is designed as a series of cohort-based dose escalations. For each cohort,&#xD;
      a minimum of 3 evaluable participants with PK and safety data will be assessed. Additional&#xD;
      participants will be recruited if additional PK data are needed to assess mean exposure based&#xD;
      on the observed variability.&#xD;

             2 weeks will be followed. Persistent chronic clinically significant toxicities from&#xD;
             prior chemotherapy must not be &gt;Grade 1. Use of hydroxyurea (Hydrea) is permitted up&#xD;
             to 24 hours prior to start of study drug for control of proliferative disease. Hydrea&#xD;

             exclusively substrates of CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is receiving moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. (Note: This exclusion&#xD;
             criterion is not applicable to subjects participating in sub-study where only subjects&#xD;
