  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rural patients with life-limiting illness are at very high risk of not receiving appropriate&#xD;
      care due to a lack of health professionals, long distances to treatment centers, and limited&#xD;
      palliative care (PC) clinical expertise. Secondly, although culture strongly influences&#xD;
      people's response to diagnosis, illness and treatment preferences, culturally-based care&#xD;
      models are not currently available for most seriously-ill rural patients and their family&#xD;
      caregivers. Lack of sensitivity to cultural differences may compromise PC for minority&#xD;
      patients. The purpose of this study is to compare a culturally-based Tele-consult program to&#xD;
      usual hospital care to determine whether a culturally-based PC Tele-consult program leads to&#xD;
      lower symptom burden in hospitalized African American and White older adults with a&#xD;
      life-limiting illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The triple threat of rural geography, racial inequities, and older age hinders access to high&#xD;
      quality PC for a significant proportion of Americans. Rural patients with life-limiting&#xD;
      illness are at very high risk of not receiving appropriate care due to a lack of health&#xD;
      professionals, long distances to treatment centers, and limited PC clinical expertise.&#xD;
      Although culture strongly influences people's response to diagnosis, illness and treatment&#xD;
      preferences, culturally-based care models are not currently available for most seriously-ill&#xD;
      rural patients and their family caregivers. Lack of sensitivity to cultural differences may&#xD;
      compromise PC for minority patients. The two major public health consequences of these&#xD;
      problems are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Access-Rural patients have sub-optimal or no access to PC. Despite significant&#xD;
           nationwide growth, access to PC is grossly inadequate for the 60 million US citizens who&#xD;
           live in rural or non-metropolitan areas. There is low PC use in rural and minority&#xD;
           populations. As a result, rural patients experience significant suffering from&#xD;
           uncontrolled symptoms that PC expertise could alleviate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acceptability-Even when palliative and hospice services are available, African Americans&#xD;
           (AA), compared to Whites (W) are more likely to receive medically-ineffective, poor&#xD;
           quality care due to a culturally-insensitive health care system and mistrust of health&#xD;
           care providers. Making culturally competent PC available for diverse underserved and&#xD;
           rural Americans is a national priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This community-developed, culturally based Teleconsult Intervention specifically targets the&#xD;
      gaps of PC access and acceptability. It was developed by and for rural, Deep South AA and W&#xD;
      patients and providers, and uses state-of-the-art telehealth methods, to provide PC&#xD;
      consultation to hospitalized seriously-ill patients and family. Using National Consensus&#xD;
      Project guidelines, and the culturally-based, community-developed PC Tele-consult&#xD;
      intervention, a remote PC expert conducts a comprehensive PC patient assessment, in&#xD;
      collaboration with local providers. Following interdisciplinary PC team review, the remote&#xD;
      clinician communicates recommendations. Two additional structured follow up contacts at Day 3&#xD;
      and 6 ensure care coordination and smooth transitions that enable patients to receive&#xD;
      guideline concurrent PC in their communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: Determine whether a culturally-based PC Tele-consult program leads to lower&#xD;
      symptom burden in hospitalized AA and W older adults with a life-limiting illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Intervention patient participants receiving a culturally-based PC Tele-consult&#xD;
      program will experience lower symptom burden on Day 7 post-consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: Determine whether a culturally-based PC Tele-consult program results in higher&#xD;
      patient and caregiver quality of life, care satisfaction, and lower caregiver burden at Day 7&#xD;
      post-consultation, and lower resource use (hospital readmission, emergency visits) 30-days&#xD;
      post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Intervention participants and their caregivers receiving a culturally-based PC&#xD;
      Tele-consult program will experience higher patient and caregiver quality of life, care&#xD;
      satisfaction, lower caregiver burden at Day 7 post consultation, and lower resource use (e.g.&#xD;
      hospital admission, emergency visits) at 30 days after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Explore mediators and moderators of patient symptom and caregiver burden&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
