  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE), vancomycin-resistant&#xD;
      enterococci (VRE) and Clostridium difficile have become a major threat to hospitalised&#xD;
      patients worldwide. We hypothesize that receiving inappropriate antibacterial treatment&#xD;
      places patients at high risk of intestinal domination and subsequent infection by these&#xD;
      bacteria. Further analyses will address cost-effectiveness of specific interventions,&#xD;
      behavioural analyses of the decision process leading to inappropriate antibacterial&#xD;
      treatment, and the rate of undetected colonization with EPE/VRE/C. difficile on admission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens has dramatically increased among&#xD;
      hospitalised patients worldwide. While various management strategies have effectively reduced&#xD;
      the burden caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, resistant pathogens with a&#xD;
      preference towards intestinal colonization are currently on the rise. E.g.,&#xD;
      vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (EPE) now constitute a significant threat to hospitalised patients&#xD;
      worldwide, as infections due to these organisms require prolonged treatments and result in&#xD;
      inferior outcomes. Similarly, the burden of disease caused by Clostridium difficile infection&#xD;
      (CDI), the main cause of healthcare-associated infectious diarrhoea, has increased driven by&#xD;
      the emergence of hypervirulent strains such as ribotypes 027 and 078. Molecular studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that increased population-wide exposure to broad-spectrum antibacterials is a&#xD;
      crucial step in the initiation of outbreaks by selection and expansion of resistant C.&#xD;
      difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comprehensive, multinational, multi-centre clinical study aiming to assess the&#xD;
      impact of inappropriate antibacterial prescription on intestinal domination by EPE or VRE or&#xD;
      infection with C. difficile. To achieve this goal, the study will closely follow the&#xD;
      progression from first acquisition of drug-resistant organisms to infection with these&#xD;
      bacteria at an individual patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will establish the sequence and factors involved in acquisition,&#xD;
      colonization, selective pressure, bacterial overgrowth/domination/ and infection for EPE, VRE&#xD;
      and C. difficile. We hypothesize that IC (Infection Control; prevention of pathogen&#xD;
      acquisition) and AMS (Antimicrobial Stewardship; prevention of clonal expansion) measures&#xD;
      leading to a higher share of appropriate anti-infective use are effective strategies to&#xD;
      prevent this development. The study programme will allow an accurate estimation of the&#xD;
      preventable share of healthcare-acquired colonization and infection by VRE, EPE, and C.&#xD;
      difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No direct interventions will be performed with study patients. Instead, study centres will&#xD;
      assess quality indicators for implementation of IC and AMS measures by active observation and&#xD;
      aggregation of data. Patients fulfilling all inclusion- and no exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      asked for their consent to be recruited prospectively into a cohort study. During the&#xD;
      observational phase, participants will be monitored for receipt of antibacterial treatment&#xD;
      and regular stool samples will be obtained and stored. An interdisciplinary, international&#xD;
      AMS Board will comprehensively assess antibiotic treatment via review by a panel of experts.&#xD;
      After the observation is completed, stool samples will be batch-tested for intestinal&#xD;
      domination by the target pathogens of this study. Statistical analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      investigate an association between inappropriate antibiotic use as opposed to appropriate or&#xD;
      no antibiotic use and intestinal domination. If domination is detected, further analyses for&#xD;
      phenotype, quantity, resistance, and molecular biology will be performed. Finally, the&#xD;
      baseline sample will be tested for presence of the dominant species to understand the source&#xD;
      of the pathogen, i.e. nosocomial versus outpatient acquisition.&#xD;
