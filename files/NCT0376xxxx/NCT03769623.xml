      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, blind, parallel and superiority test&#xD;
      study. It is planned to select 206 cases of subjects with small coronary artery vessel&#xD;
      disease who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. They are randomly divide them into&#xD;
      Biolimus release coronary balloon catheter treatment group and plain old balloon angioplasty&#xD;
      catheter (Powerline) treatment group according to the ratio of 1:1. All subjects accept&#xD;
      clinical follow-up after operation, at 30 days, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after&#xD;
      operation. Follow-up with angiography is conducted at 9 months. The late lumen loss in&#xD;
      diseased segment at 9 months after operation is the primary endpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, blind, parallel positive control, and&#xD;
      superiority test study, 206 subjects with small coronary artery disease who met the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled, subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment&#xD;
      group of Biolimus and Powerline at 1:1. All subjects underwent clinical follow-up at 30 days,&#xD;
      6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after surgery, and angiographic follow-up at 9 months. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint was late lumen loss at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 206 subjects. The sample size determination process is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated according to the primary endpoint, late lumen loss (LLL) in&#xD;
      diseased segment at 9 months after operation. Through literature review, a Meta analysis&#xD;
      combined 11 randomized and control study shows that the late lumen loss level of control&#xD;
      group (POBA) in the treatment of small vessel disease is 0.54mm. Another Meta analysis shows&#xD;
      that LLL after PTCA operation is 0.57±0.57mm. Clinical investigators and statisticians,&#xD;
      according to literature and clinical practice, suppose that the LLL level of test group (DCB)&#xD;
      in this study can be lowered to 0.32mm and the combined standard deviation of LLL of the two&#xD;
      groups is estimated to be 0.50mm conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation formula of sample size for parallel design and superiority test is used. In&#xD;
      case of taking 0.025 at singles side for inspection level, taking 80% for power (1-β), and&#xD;
      taking 0 for superiority cut-off, conduct random grouping according to the ratio of 1:1, the&#xD;
      require sample size of each group is calculated to be 82 cases. Considering the maximum&#xD;
      failure rate 20% in angiography follow-up (as well as the early withdrawal and random damage&#xD;
      caused by other reasons), the planned total sample size of both groups is 206 cases finally,&#xD;
      including 103 cases for test group (DCB) and 103 cases for control group.&#xD;
