        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors with measurable lesions per RECIST v1.1&#xD;
             or RANO for primary brain tumors that are considered nonamenable to surgery or other&#xD;
             curative treatments or procedures. Tumor lesions located in a previously irradiated&#xD;
             area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are considered&#xD;
             measurable per RECIST v1.1 if progression has been demonstrated in the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to undergo a tumor biopsy to obtain tumor tissue,Pretreatment and&#xD;
             on-treatment tumor biopsies are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have disease progression after treatment with available therapies that are known&#xD;
             to confer clinical benefit or who are intolerant to or ineligible for standard&#xD;
             treatment. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Part 2 Expansion Cohort 2-A only: Participants with any type of solid tumor that has a&#xD;
             local regulatory approval for an anti-PD-1 therapy. Other tumor types may be enrolled&#xD;
             with medical monitor approval. Participants must have had confirmed disease&#xD;
             progression on a prior anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 2 Expansion Cohort 2-B only: Participants with select solid tumors who are&#xD;
             immunotherapy-naïve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 3 MSI-H or dMMR Expansion Cohort only (Enrolled ex-United States only):&#xD;

             tumor who have received prior standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: HPV-positive status determined by a local laboratory using p16 IHC, polymerase chain&#xD;
        reaction methods, or other locally-available method to detect HPV&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values not within the Protocol-defined range.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Untreated brain or central nervous system (CNS) metastases or brain or CNS metastases&#xD;
             that have progressed. Participants who have previously treated and clinically stable&#xD;
             brain or CNS metastases and have not required steroids for at least 7 days before&#xD;
             study treatment are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline from toxic effects of prior therapy and/or&#xD;
             complications from prior surgical intervention before starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with anticancer medications or investigational drugs within protocol-defined&#xD;
             intervals before the first administration of study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active HBV or HCV infection that requires treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
