    <textblock>
      By means of an observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial, the analgesic efficacy of an&#xD;
      upper-arm Bier's block and a forearm mini-Bier's block will be investigated in patients&#xD;
      undergoing hand surgery. The hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two types&#xD;
      of anesthetic techniques with respect to the analgesic efficacy.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several ways of anesthesia can be used to perform hand surgery, being general anesthesia,&#xD;
      intravenous regional anesthesia as well as locoregional anesthesia. Locoregional anesthesia&#xD;
      and intravenous regional anesthesia are often performed since patients can be discharged from&#xD;
      the hospital more rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A conventional Bier's block is performed using a tourniquet on the upper arm to create a&#xD;
      bloodless field and to contain the anesthetics within the surgical area (1). Complications&#xD;
      are rare but are often linked to a systemic toxicity reaction after releasing the tourniquet&#xD;
      (2). A mini-Bier's block in which the tourniquet is placed on the fore-arm, has been shown to&#xD;
      be a safe and effective way of anesthesia to perform hand surgery. By using this type of&#xD;
      anesthesia, the dose of the anesthetic can be reduced compared to a conventional Bier's block&#xD;
      which reduces the risk of systemic toxicity reactions (3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, studies that made a comparison between the two anesthesia techniques are scarce&#xD;
      and inconsistent. Next to that, those studies also used different types of anesthetics and&#xD;
      dosages. To see which technique is advantageous in clinical practice, the investigators want&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy of the Bier's block and mini-Bier's block in patients that are&#xD;
      planned to undergo hand surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of the Bier's block versus&#xD;
      the mini-Bier's block. The hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two&#xD;
      techniques. A blinded surgeon will determine the analgesic efficacy of these techniques&#xD;
      (graded as &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot;) and divide the efficacy in 4 grades. Grade 1 and grade&#xD;
      2 are considered &quot;complete&quot; blockade, while grade 3 and grade 4 are considered &quot;incomplete&quot;&#xD;
      blockade. Grade 1: complete motor and sensory blockade, grade 2: partial motor blockade but&#xD;
      no pain or deep pressure sensitivity, grade 3: partial motor blockade with mild pain&#xD;
      requiring rescue local or opioid analgesia, grade 4: incomplete motor- and sensory blockade&#xD;
      requiring sedation/conversion to general anesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset time, which is defined as the time from the injection of the local anesthetic&#xD;
           until the complete sensory loss in hand (assessed by the blinded surgeon via &quot;pin&#xD;
           prick&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's pre-, intra- and post-operative pain scores will be measured via an 11-point&#xD;
           Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in which number 0 means &quot;no pain at all&quot;, number 5 means&#xD;
           &quot;moderate pain&quot; and number 10 means &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tourniquet time: the amount of time that the tourniquet is inflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tourniquet tolerance time: the amount of time required for the inflated tourniquet to&#xD;
           cause a painful sensation (NRS &gt; 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction with the surgical field (bloodless field) will be graded by a blinded&#xD;
           surgeon, measured using a 5-point scale (1= extremely dissatisfied until 5= extremely&#xD;
           satisfied).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time spent in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General patient satisfaction will be assessed using a 7-point Likert Scale, in which&#xD;
           number 1 equals &quot;extremely dissatisfied&quot; and number 7 means &quot;extremely satisfied&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this monocentric, investigator-initiated, observer-blinded, prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, non-inferiority trial, 2 anaesthetic procedures will be compared in patients that&#xD;
      undergo hand surgery (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, trigger finger, dequervain tenovaginitis,&#xD;
      disease of Dupuytren, ganglion cyst).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and will be approved by&#xD;
      the ethics committee of the JESSA Hospital, Hasselt, Belgium before the start of the study. A&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained before participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random allocation sequence.&#xD;
      Allocation numbers will be sealed in opaque envelopes, which will be opened in sequence by an&#xD;
      independent anesthesiologist who is not involved in the assessment of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the surgeon and the researcher will be blinded for the used type of anesthesia. Since&#xD;
      the clear difference between an upper arm and forearm tourniquet, all patients will receive a&#xD;
      second tourniquet which will not be inflated. That is, patients receiving the Bier's block&#xD;
      will receive an additional forearm tourniquet which will not be inflated and patients in&#xD;
      group of the mini-Bier's block will receive an additional upperarm tourniquet which will not&#xD;
      be inflated. In this way, a possible de-blinding of the surgeon and researcher is minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will first receive information about this study. Before the start of the study,&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained, after which the patient will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of the 2 treatment groups. Before surgery, all patients will receive an intravenous catheter&#xD;
      in the contralateral arm with infusion of 0.9% Natriumchloride (NaCl), paracetamol 1g and&#xD;
      standard monitoring (non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram and O2 saturation&#xD;
      measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Bier's block group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous catheter will be placed in the dorsal vein of the hand that will undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Afterwards, a tourniquet will be placed on the upper arm and inflated, after which&#xD;
      the anesthetic can be administered via the dorsal vein catheter (40ml Lidocaine 0.5%). The&#xD;
      tourniquet remains inflated for 25 minutes to reduce systemic toxicity reactions&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the mini-Bier's block group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous catheter will be placed in the dorsal vein of the hand that will undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Afterwards, a tourniquet will be placed on the forearm and inflated, after which the&#xD;
      anesthetic can be administered via the dorsal vein catheter (25ml lidocaine 0.5%). The&#xD;
      tourniquet remains inflated for 10 minutes to reduce systemic toxicity reactions&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of the surgery, the blinded surgeon will assess the quality of the block&#xD;
      (primary outcome) using a forceps. The quality of the block will be graded &quot;complete&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;incomplete&quot; as described above. In case of grade 1 or grade 2, the surgical procedure can&#xD;
      start. In case of grade 3, the blockade will be enhanced (local anesthetic or intravenous&#xD;
      opioid administration (alfentanil or sufentanil)). In case of grade 4, sedation/conversion to&#xD;
      general anesthesia will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All secondary outcome measures will be investigated by the blinded researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined for the primary study outcome with the aim to reject the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of the mini-Bier's block. Based on a meta-analysis (unpublished data) we&#xD;
      expect a 98.5% complete blockade in the experimental group (mini-Bier's block) and a 100%&#xD;
      complete blockade in the control group (Bier's block). With a difference of 5% between the 2&#xD;
      groups and a binary outcome (complete/incomplete), we calculated that 135 patients are needed&#xD;
      per group (Î±=0.05, power=0.80). Considering a drop-out rate of 3.5%, the total number of&#xD;
      patients is 140 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be presented as frequencies and percentages of the total amount&#xD;
      of patients for categorical variables, while numerical variables will be presented as mean.&#xD;
      Group comparison will be performed using Chi-square test (or a Fisher's Exact test when&#xD;
      necessary) for frequencies. Depending on normality, a Mann-Whitney U test or a Student's&#xD;
      t-test will be used. Corrections will be applied for multiple measurements of the Numerical&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS) for pain scores. An average difference of 1.3 points or more on the NRS&#xD;
      pain score is considered clinical relevant. A p-value &lt;0.05 is considered statistical&#xD;
      significant, while p&lt;0.10 is considered a tendency.&#xD;

    <description>This study wants to evaluate and compare the analgesic efficacy of the Bier's block with the mini-Bier's block. The blinded surgeon will assess the analgesic effectivity and grade it as either complete (grade 1 and grade 2) or incomplete (grade 3 and grade 4). Grade 1 is defined as complete motor and sensory blockade; grade 2 is defined as partial motor blockade with no pain or deep pressure sensitivity. Grade 3 is defined as partial motor blockade with mild pain and the need for rescue local or opioid analgesia. Grade 4 is defined as incomplete motor and sensory blockade requiring sedation/conversion to general anesthesia.</description>
