      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 1B/2 study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of tabelecleucel in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of subjects&#xD;
      with platinum-pretreated, recurrent/metastatic EBV+ NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tabelecleucel will be selected for each subject from the bank of available tabelecleucel cell&#xD;
      products based on matching ≥ 2 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, at least one of which&#xD;
      is a restricting HLA allele, shared between the tabelecleucel donor and the subject's EBV+&#xD;
      NPC. Sites will provide high resolution HLA typing of the subject and other information as&#xD;
      required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1B will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterize the dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) for tabelecleucel in combination with pembrolizumab in up to 24 subjects. In&#xD;
      the absence of an MTD, the recommended Phase 2 dose will be identified. Phase 2 will evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of the combination in 36 subjects at the recommended dose level from&#xD;
      Phase 1B.&#xD;
