  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canadian men. While the&#xD;
      majority of PCa is slow growing and responds well to first line treatment, a proportion of&#xD;
      cases (10%) progress to metastatic form resulting in more than 4 000 deaths annually in&#xD;
      Canada and 250 000 worldwide. Currently, first line treatment for PCa includes surgery,&#xD;
      radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). A rapid evolution in the understanding of&#xD;
      disease biology, combined with approvals of new therapies including immunotherapy, novel&#xD;
      chemotherapy, hormonal agents and a bone calcium matrix-targeted radionuclide, along with&#xD;
      further drugs in development, have made treatment decisions for metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) increasingly complex and challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase II Study of Cabazitaxel plus prednisone in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The current study is designed to determine if&#xD;
      cabazitaxel will improve progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll patients with mCRPC, who have been previously treated and progressed&#xD;
      under docetaxel or abiraterone regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must meet the study eligibility criteria and must be competent to give informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, national, randomized, open label study, comparing the&#xD;
      efficacy of cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m² plus prednisone (Arm A) over docetaxel at 75mg/m2 plus&#xD;
      prednisone (Arm B) after enzalutamide at 160 mg once daily or abiraterone acetate at 1000 mg&#xD;
      once daily plus prednisone in chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC who have progressed on&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's&#xD;
      refusal of further study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either arm A or B in a 1:1 proportion.&#xD;

             disease must have at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one&#xD;
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be at least 10 mm when&#xD;
             measured by computed tomography (CT) [CT scan thickness no greater than 5 mm] or&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lymph nodes should be ≥ 15 mm in short axis. As&#xD;
             defined by PCWG2, if lymph node metastasis is the only evidence of metastasis, it must&#xD;
             be ≥ 20 mm in diameter when measured by spiral CT or MRI. Previously irradiated&#xD;
             lesions, primary prostate lesion and bone lesions will be considered non-measurable&#xD;

             confirmatory PSA measure is required (2nd beyond the reference level) to be greater&#xD;
             than the second measure and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure.&#xD;
             If this is not the case, a fourth PSA measure is required to be taken and be greater&#xD;
             than the 2nd measure. The third (or the fourth) confirmatory PSA should be taken&#xD;
             within 4 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
