  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers develop in two different ways. First, cancer cells can become invisible to the immune&#xD;
      system by stop having proteins on their surface that are required for the immune system to&#xD;
      recognize them. In this scenario, tumors do not attract any immune cells (e.g. white blood&#xD;
      cells) whatsoever or they do not attract specialized white blood cells against cancer cells,&#xD;
      called lymphocytes. White blood cells are the type of immune cells that attack foreign cells,&#xD;
      such as cancer cells or normal cells infected with viruses or bacteria. Second, cancer cells&#xD;
      can still grow side-to-side with white blood cells but are able to hide from them. As a&#xD;
      result, the white blood cells cannot find and attack the cancer cells. Different types of&#xD;
      cancers have different chance of having immune cells in the tumor. For example, the&#xD;
      possibility that immune cells are within skin melanomas is almost 50% whereas the possibility&#xD;
      in melanoma of the eye is only 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the first goal of this study is to understand whether entinostat can make a&#xD;
      melanoma tumor more visible to the immune system. To see whether entinostat makes tumor more&#xD;
      visible to the immune system, participants will have a mandatory tumor biopsy 3 weeks after&#xD;
      starting entinostat therapy. Tumor tissue collected before and after participating in this&#xD;
      study will be compared to see if there are more immune cells in the tumor after receive&#xD;
      entinostat. The second goal of the study is to see if giving a combination of entinostat and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab can shrink melanoma tumors of patients who did not have immune cells in tumors&#xD;
      prior to treatment. The study will determine how many subjects cancer has become better or&#xD;
      not changed 6 months after subjects have started treatment on the study. We will also&#xD;
      determine what type of side effects occur in subjects receiving entinostat and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      to look at the safety of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also look at any changes in the DNA of melanoma before the study&#xD;
      begins. As a result of these changes in DNA, there are often see differences in the proteins&#xD;
      that work to create other proteins. In addition, the study will look into how entinostat may&#xD;
      make melanoma cells more visible to the immune system by comparing proteins in tumors before&#xD;
      and after treatment. Finally, the study will see if this treatment changes the numbers and&#xD;
      types of immune cells that are found in the blood by comparing blood at different time points&#xD;
      while patients are on the study.&#xD;

      This is an exploratory (n=10-12 evaluable patients), open-label, single-arm, phase II study&#xD;
      in patients with 'non-inflamed' unresectable regional or distant metastatic melanomas&#xD;
      irrespective of prior treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      to assess the incidence of histopathologic conversion of non-inflamed melanomas from patients&#xD;
      with metastatic melanoma to 'inflamed' melanoma following single-agent entinostat &quot;priming&quot;&#xD;
      (entinostat monotherapy). More specifically, patients with metastatic melanomas that have no&#xD;
      evidence of tumor-infiltrating or tumor-associated lymphocytes (TIL/TAL), based on standard&#xD;
      hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of representative tumor sections (non-inflamed&#xD;
      melanomas) will receive weekly entinostat for 3 weeks in cycle 1 (entinostat monotherapy; 5mg&#xD;
      PO, qwk on D1, D8, D15 of cycle 1; cycle length = 21 days). Mandatory tumor tissue biopsies&#xD;
      will be performed in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 21±2 days), immediately&#xD;
      before treatment with concurrent entinostat (once weekly × 3) and pembrolizumab (200 mg&#xD;
      q3wks) in cycles 2-9 (see section 5.2.1 drug dosing schema). Correlative studies will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 21±2 days) to&#xD;
      assess whether: (a) 3 weeks of entinostat monotherapy converts TIL/TAL-absent melanomas to&#xD;
      TIL/TAL-present by histopathologic (H&amp;E stain) analysis, (b) 3 weeks of single-agent&#xD;
      entinostat induces changes in gene expression profiling by assessing distinct signatures as&#xD;
      defined by RNA-sequencing signatures (RNA-seq; 'immune-high', innate anti-PD-1 resistance&#xD;
      [IPRES], and epigenetic 1-3), (c) 3 weeks of single-agent entinostat induces changes in&#xD;
      histone-accessible DNA by performing formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements&#xD;
      (FAIRE)4, (d) conversion of non-inflamed to inflamed melanomas by single-agent entinostat&#xD;
      and/or antitumor response to the entinostat-pembrolizumab combination is associated with a&#xD;
      baseline signature that consists of distinct somatic mutation gene profile, global histone&#xD;
      modification profile in melanoma tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and/or&#xD;
      abundance of entinostat targets in melanoma cells (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 11). Up to 12 evaluable&#xD;
      patients will be treated with entinostat plus pembrolizumab for up to 27 weeks (approximately&#xD;
      6 months) based on clinical benefit. Patients who continue to have clinical benefit at 27&#xD;
      weeks may continue therapy with pembrolizumab or any other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, as per&#xD;
      standard of care.Secondary exploratory endpoints involve: (a) assessment of antitumor&#xD;
      response of entinostat administered concurrently with pembrolizumab at week 9 (or earlier if&#xD;
      patient progresses), based on response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). (b) assessment of the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 27&#xD;
      weeks (approximately 6 months) of the entinostat-pembrolizumab combination. (c) determine the&#xD;
      safety of the entinostat-pembrolizumab combination in patients with metastatic melanoma per&#xD;
      NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). (d) assessment of other&#xD;
      exploratory biomarkers in tumor tissue and peripheral blood.&#xD;

                  and were only recently diagnosed with asymptomatic papillary thyroid cancer and&#xD;
                  their surgery is pending,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) provided patient has isolated lymphocytosis&#xD;
                  (Rai stage 0) and does not require systemic treatment [for &quot;B&quot; symptoms,&#xD;
                  Richter's transformation, lymphocyte doubling time (&lt;6 months), lymphadenopathy&#xD;
                  or hepatosplenomegaly],&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lymphoma, hairy-cell leukemia, or myelodysplasia, provided that patient is not on&#xD;
                  active systemic treatment and is in complete remission, as evidenced by PET/CT&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  History of any other malignancy provided patient has completed therapy and is&#xD;
                  free of disease for ≥ 2 years. If patient had other malignancy within the last 2&#xD;
                  years from which he, or she, may have been completely cured by surgery alone, he&#xD;
                  may be considered to be enrolled on condition that the risk of development of&#xD;
                  distant metastatic disease based on the most recent AJCC staging system is less&#xD;
                  than 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active (i.e. previously untreated) parenchymal central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
             metastases that are symptomatic, and/or more than one lesion with the largest diameter&#xD;
             being &gt; 5-mm and/or require antiepileptic drugs or systemic corticosteroids for&#xD;
             management of intracranial symptoms. Patients with carcinomatous meningitis are also&#xD;
             excluded. Exceptions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with previously treated brain metastases provided they are stable (i.e.&#xD;
                  without evidence of progression by brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or head&#xD;
                  CT with IV contrast) for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of entinostat.&#xD;
                  Any neurologic symptoms must have returned to baseline, and have no evidence of&#xD;
                  new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using ongoing systemic&#xD;
                  corticosteroids for management of intracranial symptoms for at least 7 days prior&#xD;
                  to first dose of entinostat,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with active (i.e. not treated with stereotactic radiosurgery), single,&#xD;
                  asymptomatic, up to 5-mm in largest diameter brain metastases (measured either by&#xD;
                  brain MRI with IV contrast or head CT with IV contrast measuring within 2 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to the first dose of entinostat).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of&#xD;
             an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of the first dose of entinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is receiving prohibited medications or treatments as listed in section 5.5 of&#xD;
             the protocol that cannot be discontinued/replaced by an alternative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with Histone/deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) for their melanoma.&#xD;
