    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase I, first in human (FIH) study consisting of the following parts: Part 1a&#xD;
      (SAD), Part 1b (IV Cohort), Part 2 (Multiple ascending dose (MAD), and Part 3 dry-powder&#xD;
      inhalation (DPI)/ Proof of mechanism (PoM). Part 1a of the study will be a randomized,&#xD;
      single-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD, sequential group design study performed at a single&#xD;
      study center. Part 1b, will be an open-label, single-dose, single-cohort study. It will&#xD;
      follow a 2-stage design in the way that participants from Part 1a will be selected for the IV&#xD;
      Cohort in Part 1b. Part 2 of the study will be a randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, MAD, sequential group design and study performed at 3 study centers. Part&#xD;
      3a/b will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, DPI/PoM study. The expected&#xD;
      duration of each subject in Part 1a of the study is up to 36 days and up to 53 days for&#xD;
      subjects participating in Part 1b. The expected duration of each participant in Part 2 is up&#xD;
      to 52 days and Part 3 is up to 55 days.&#xD;

      This will be a Phase I, consisting of the following parts: Part 1a, Part 1b, Part 2a/b, Part&#xD;
      3a/b. Part 1a of the study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD,&#xD;
      sequential group design study performed at a single study center. Six inhaled dose levels of&#xD;
      AZD0449 nebulized suspension are planned to be investigated in 6 cohorts. Depending on&#xD;
      emerging safety and PK data, up to 3 additional inhaled dose levels (cohorts), within the&#xD;
      pre-specified dose range, may be added at the discretion of the Sponsor. Within each cohort,&#xD;
      6 volunteers will be randomized to receive an inhaled dose of AZD0449 nebulized suspension&#xD;
      and 2 volunteers will be randomized to receive inhaled placebo. Intravenous (IV) dosing in&#xD;
      Part 1b of the study will be initiated after the completion of cohort 6 in Part 1a or (if&#xD;
      Part 1a is completed with less than 6 cohorts) after completion of the last cohort in Part&#xD;
      1a. Part 1b, will be open-label and consist of 2 dose cohorts (IV 0.090 mg and 0.360 mg) and&#xD;
      be conducted in 12 healthy volunteers. Six (6) volunteers will be selected for the first IV&#xD;
      dose cohort in Part 1b following a 2-stage design. If Part 1b cannot be completed with 6&#xD;
      volunteers from Part 1a or if some of the data are considered not evaluable, up to 6&#xD;
      additional naïve volunteers may be enrolled. A second IV dose cohort in Part 1b will be&#xD;
      initiated after the evaluation of the PK and safety results from all cohorts in Part 1a and&#xD;
      completion of the first IV dose cohort in Part 1b. The second IV dose cohort will consist of&#xD;
      6 healthy volunteers who have not previously participated in the study (naïve volunteers).&#xD;
      Part 2a/b of the study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD,&#xD;
      sequential group design study performed at approximately 3 study centers. Part 2a will&#xD;
      include cohorts 1 and 2, each comprising of 9 patients with mild asthma. Within each of these&#xD;
      cohorts 6 patients will be randomized to receive AZD0449 nebulized suspension and 3 patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive placebo. Additional cohorts with 9 patients could be added to study PK,&#xD;
      PD and safety for doses lower than 1.2 mg or up to 5 mg. Part 2b will consist of 1 cohort of&#xD;
      8 healthy volunteers; 6 volunteers will be randomized to receive AZD0449 nebulized suspension&#xD;
      and 2 volunteers will be randomized to receive placebo. Part 3a/b of the study will be&#xD;
      initiated after the completion of Part 2b. Part 3a/b will be a randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, DPI/PoM study. Part 3 will be conducted in up to 36 patients with mild&#xD;
      asthma (Part 3a) and 8 healthy volunteers (Part 3b, optional). Part 3a will consist of 36&#xD;
      patients, where 18 patients will be randomized to AZD0449 DPI and 18 patients to placebo. An&#xD;
      Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when 9 patients on each arm have completed the study&#xD;
      (50% Part 3a). Should new data on the variability of the FeNO measurements emerge at the IA,&#xD;
      the sample size in Part 3a could be changed. If the optional Part 3b is conducted, it will&#xD;
      comprise 8 healthy volunteers; 6 volunteers will be randomized to AZD0449 DPI and 2&#xD;
      volunteers to placebo.&#xD;
