      -  Background: The majority of the burden of HPV-related cervical cancer is in developing&#xD;
           countries while most of the effectiveness reports of HPV vaccination are currently&#xD;
           coming from developed countries. Also, currently many adult women are left without&#xD;
           either HPV vaccination or cervical cancer screening. Effectiveness data of currently&#xD;
           available HPV vaccines among adult women in developing countries are needed for women&#xD;
           and healthcare workers and policy makers to best protect women from cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To determine the effectiveness bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines in reduction of&#xD;
           cervical dysplasia (Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion or worse; LSIL+)&#xD;
           attributable to HPV types 16 or 18 after at least 5 years of vaccination among Thai&#xD;
           women vaccinated at their ages 20-45 years with at least one dose of the HPV vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure the effectiveness of currently available bivalent and quadrivalent HPV&#xD;
                vaccines in reducing the prevalence of HPV 16 or 18&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in reducing any abnormal Pap smear&#xD;
                result (ASC-US+)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare the effectiveness of HPV vaccines according to the number of doses&#xD;
                immunized&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To find out risk factor(s) for HPV 16 or 18-related cervical dysplasia in this&#xD;
                cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the prevalence of other high-risk HPV types in vaccinated and&#xD;
                non-vaccinated group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine direct and/or indirect cost of HPV vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The hypothesis to be tested: At least one dose of vaccination with bi- or quadri-valent&#xD;
           HPV vaccine will reduce the prevalence of LSIL+ attributable to HPV 16/18 by 80% after&#xD;
           at least 5 years of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Materials and Methods: This study will be a retrospective matched cohort study. Data is&#xD;
           to be collected either by from samples for Pap and HPV test and/or HPV 16/18 genotyping&#xD;
           of the recruited participants, or from existing medical records. HPV vaccinated women at&#xD;
           their ages 20-45 years (vaccinated group) and women received Pap smear at their ages&#xD;
           20-45 years without vaccination (control group) will be included in the study. Pap smear&#xD;
           and HPV test and/or HPV 16/18 typing result of 2 groups will be compared after ≥ 5 years&#xD;
           of vaccination or baseline Pap smear. Those who don't have Pap smear results ≥ 5 years&#xD;
           after vaccination or ≥ 5 years after the baseline Pap smear will be offered for a Pap&#xD;
           smear and HPV 16/18 typing&#xD;
