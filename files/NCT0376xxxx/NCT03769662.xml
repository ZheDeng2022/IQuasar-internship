      XT-150-1-0201 Extension: Evaluation of Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of XT-150 for the&#xD;
      Treatment of Osteoarthritic Pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will have been enrolled in the 0201 study and qualify for an&#xD;
      intra-articular injection of XT-150 into the osteoarthritic knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess XT-150 safety, tolerability, and efficacy in participants who received&#xD;
      placebo in the 0201 study, or have a second qualifying knee, or a second injection into the&#xD;
      same knee that was treated in 0201.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Participant elects to have XT-150 administered to the XT-150-untreated knee that&#xD;
                  qualified under XT-150-1-0201 criteria, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Participant had inadequate pain relief and elects to receive a second injection&#xD;
                  to the same knee treated on clinical study XT-150-1-0201&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Sufficiently severe OA of knee to require/have recommended knee replacement surgery or&#xD;
             be unsuitable for knee replacement surgery based on co-morbidities or orthopedic&#xD;
             considerations; be free of local or intra-articular infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptomatic disease because of osteoarthritis, defined as a Verbal Numerical Rating&#xD;
             Scale (VNRS) scores of a worst pain of at least 7 at any time during the preceding&#xD;
             week (based on scale of 0 to 10, with 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as you can&#xD;
             imagine&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stable analgesic regimen during the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inadequate pain relief (minimum ≥ 5 mean on Brief Pain Inventory-Severity Scale)&#xD;
             lasting more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
