      This is a multi-center open-label Phase I/II study investigating orally administered HDM201&#xD;
      in combination with chemotherapy in two populations: subjects with first line AML or subjects&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory AML. This study is conducted in three parts: dose escalation, dose&#xD;
      expansion and DDI study.&#xD;
