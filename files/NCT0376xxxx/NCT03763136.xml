  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure has a high morbidity and mortality because the heart is one of the least&#xD;
      regenerative organs in the human body. Drug treatments for heart failure manage symptoms but&#xD;
      do not restore lost myocytes. Cellular replacement therapy is a potential approach to repair&#xD;
      damaged myocardial tissue, restore cardiac function, which has become a new strategy for the&#xD;
      treatment of heart failure. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility&#xD;
      and efficacy of intramyocardial delivery of cardiomyocytes at the time of coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting in patients with chronic heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure will be treated with allogenic human pluripotent stem&#xD;
      cell-derived cardiomyocytes ( hPSC-CM ) from healthy donors. The cells will be injected&#xD;
      directly into the myocardium at time of coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after cell transplantation for safety, feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
