  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BCMA CART cells in treating&#xD;
      patients with BCMA positive multiple myeloma that have not respond to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Auto-HSCT). B-cell maturation antigen&#xD;
      (BCMA), a cell surface protein expressed on mutiple maloma cells, has emerged as a very&#xD;
      selective antigen to be targeted in novel immunotherpy for MM. Targeting postulated CD19&#xD;
      positive myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells is a novel approach to MM therapy.&#xD;
