  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the influence of genetic and clinical factors on the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of kidney transplant patients with tacrolimus (TAC) based immunosuppression&#xD;
      in Taiwan.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus (TAC) is the most important immunosuppressants for maintenance therapy after&#xD;
      kidney transplantation. Many genetic and clinical factors had been found to have effect on&#xD;
      TAC pharmacokinetics (PK). Whether these factors affect clinical outcomes is still&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective study, investigators will review records of kidney transplant patients&#xD;
      with TAC based immunosuppression recruited from a previous study (IRB approval number:&#xD;
      201512005RINC) to understand the influence of clinical and genetic factors on their 3-years&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, including biopsy-proven acute rejection, patient survival, graft survival&#xD;
      and safety issues of kidney transplant patients.&#xD;
