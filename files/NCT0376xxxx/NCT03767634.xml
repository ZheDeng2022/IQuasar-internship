      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      An essential part of neonatal care is providing nutrition to ensure that babies grow and&#xD;
      develop. Providing this can be difficult in premature babies because their intestines are&#xD;
      underdeveloped. They often have difficulty digesting milk so feeds are introduced gradually.&#xD;
      To help babies grow and develop during this period, additional nutrition may be provided as a&#xD;
      fluid into a vein; this is called &quot;parenteral nutrition&quot; (PN). Unfortunately, PN increases&#xD;
      the risk of serious complications like bloodstream infection (also known as &quot;sepsis&quot;). For&#xD;
      babies who are moderately premature there is little evidence to guide decision making about&#xD;
      which babies will benefit from PN. This group of babies have more reserves of fat and are&#xD;
      less dependent on PN, but are still at risk of sepsis. As a consequence, some doctors use PN&#xD;
      and others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, to describe which babies are given PN during the first postnatal week in neonatal&#xD;
      units in England, Scotland and Wales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, to determine whether in babies born 7-10 weeks preterm (moderately premature),&#xD;
      providing PN in the first week after birth, compared to not to providing PN, improves&#xD;
      survival to discharge from the neonatal unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, to evaluate if the early use of PN in moderately preterm babies affects other&#xD;
      important outcomes in the neonatal core outcomes set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPORTANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will describe the extent of PN use in England, Scotland and Wales. This is&#xD;
      currently unknown. This project will improve understanding of the balance of benefits and&#xD;
      harms of PN use in premature babies and will help doctors and parents make informed treatment&#xD;
      choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) to study all babies&#xD;
      born in England, Scotland and Wales; they will identify which babies were given PN during the&#xD;
      first week, and which were not. The investigators will use the NNRD to identify babies born&#xD;
      7-10 weeks prematurely and compare outcomes in babies that were given and not given PN in the&#xD;
      first week after birth. The investigators will use statistical techniques to identify two&#xD;
      sets of babies in the NNRD who are very similar (in terms of how prematurely they were born,&#xD;
      their birth weight, and so on), the only difference being whether they were given PN or not.&#xD;
      As the two groups will be similar any difference in their outcomes (such as survival) is&#xD;
      likely to be due to whether or not they received PN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature birth abruptly ends the transplacental transmission of nutrients that allows normal&#xD;
      foetal growth and development. Providing adequate nutrition is essential to allow premature&#xD;
      babies to continue to grow and mature. Very preterm infants often have difficulty tolerating&#xD;
      adequate volumes of milk feeds shortly after birth and so are given supplemental parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition (PN). Preterm babies are among the highest PN users of all NHS patients. It has&#xD;
      been estimated that PN is received by around 70% of neonatal unit admissions but it is not&#xD;
      known exactly which babies receive PN. In addition, how PN affects outcomes has never been&#xD;
      tested in a large scale, randomized, placebo controlled neonatal trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that PN carries well established risks, of which the most serious and the most&#xD;
      common is sepsis with estimates of risk ratios varying from 2.2 to 14.6. In addition there is&#xD;
      a growing body of evidence that use of PN within the first seven days of admission to an&#xD;
      intensive care unit is associated with worse outcomes in critically unwell adults and&#xD;
      children. A subgroup analysis of the paediatric intensive care unit population focusing on&#xD;
      neonates showed an increase in infections with early PN use. This suggests that uncertainty&#xD;
      exists over the benefit of giving neonates PN in the early postnatal period. It is generally&#xD;
      accepted that PN is beneficial to extremely preterm neonates, but in moderately preterm&#xD;
      neonates the effect that PN use has on neonatal survival has never been conclusively&#xD;
      demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uncertainty over how PN use affects neonatal outcomes is reflected by the wide variety in&#xD;
      how PN is used in different units with large variation in use, timing and composition of PN.&#xD;
      This is, in part, due to the lack of clear evidence of how PN affects neonatal outcomes like&#xD;
      growth and survival. Neonates are also vulnerable to unanticipated treatment effects which&#xD;
      can occur in different organ systems and so it is important to show that PN is not&#xD;
      detrimental to important neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postmenstrual age at which the nutritional benefits of PN outweigh the risks in&#xD;
      moderately preterm babies (30-33 weeks postmenstrual age) is unknown. It is therefore&#xD;
      unsurprising that their nutritional management is very variable. In moderately preterm&#xD;
      neonates in 2012 and 2013 across England, Scotland and Wales PN was given to 45% of neonates,&#xD;
      suggesting clinician equipoise around the balance of benefit to risk. Identifying whether&#xD;
      moderately preterm neonates benefit from PN would have important implications for practice in&#xD;
      the UK. This work will provide information to guide practice and inform future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, PN is widely used in neonates but it is not known exactly how it is used in the&#xD;
      UK. It is known to have risks and benefits but there is insufficient evidence to guide&#xD;
      practice in moderately preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the use of PN in neonatal units across England, Scotland and Wales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify if use of PN in the first seven postnatal days affects survival in neonates&#xD;
           born between 30 and 33 weeks postmenstrual age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore how PN use in the first seven postnatal days affects other important neonatal&#xD;
           outcomes in neonates born between 30 and 33 weeks postmenstrual age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project A: an epidemiological survey of practice using the National Neonatal Research&#xD;
      Database (NNRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project B: a retrospective cohort study of matched groups of babies using data held in the&#xD;
      NNRD.&#xD;
