&#xD;
          2. Male aged ≥18 years old at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previously received Xiaflex® treatment and had a partial or complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Partial response is defined as receiving ≤ 4 cycles of Xiaflex® and achieving a&#xD;
                  penile curvature of ≥ 15 degrees and &lt; 90 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete response is defined as receiving ≤ 4 cycles of Xiaflex® and achieving a&#xD;
                  penile curvature of &lt; 15 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a diagnosis of Peyronie's disease with a penile curvature of ≥ 30 and ≤ 90 degrees&#xD;
             at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a penile curvature of at ≥ 30 degrees in the dorsal, lateral, or dorsal/lateral&#xD;
             plane at the screening visit. It must be possible to delineate the single plane of&#xD;
             maximal curvature for evaluation during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able and willing to comply with restrictions where intercourse or any other sexual&#xD;
             activity is prohibited during each treatment cycle and for at least 2 weeks after each&#xD;
             injection cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able and willing to perform home modeling sessions between injection cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Is in good health based on medical history evaluation and in the judgment of the&#xD;
             principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a penile curvature of &lt; 30 degrees or &gt; 90 degrees at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous allergic reaction to XIAFLEX®.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has any of the following conditions:&#xD;

               -  Thrombosis of the dorsal penile artery and or vein&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Infiltration by a benign or malignant mass resulting in penile curvature&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Infiltration by an infectious agent, such as lymphogranuloma venereum&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ventral curvature from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of an active sexually transmitted disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known active hepatitis B or C&#xD;

               -  Known human immune deficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has previously undergone surgery for Peyronie's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has an erection which, in the opinion of the investigator, is insufficient to&#xD;
             accurately measure the subject's penile deformity after administration of the&#xD;
             prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), Trimix®, or similar erection inducing agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a calcified plaque that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent proper&#xD;
             administration of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has an isolated hourglass deformity of the penis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a plaque causing a curvature of the penis located proximal to the base of the&#xD;
             penis where injection of local anesthetic would interfere with the injection of&#xD;
             Xiaflex®.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has received intralesional or injection therapy for Peyronie's disease including&#xD;
             interferon, verapamil, or Xiaflex® &lt; 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has used antiplatelet or anti-coagulants (e.g. coumadin, Plavix®, Eliquis®, Effient®)&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to each Xiaflex® injection. Daily aspirin of 81 mg is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has had extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the correction of Peyronie's&#xD;
             disease within the 6 months prior to screening or plans to have ESWT at any time&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has uncontrolled hypertension as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has a recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other significant medical condition&#xD;
             which, in the investigator's opinion, would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a planned surgical procedure during anticipated study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Is unwilling or unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study including&#xD;
             completion of all scheduled study visits.&#xD;
