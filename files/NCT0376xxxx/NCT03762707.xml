    <textblock>
      Kidney biopsy represents the criterion standard to obtain information on diagnosis and&#xD;
      prognosis of renal dysfunctions . Many patients with kidney disease have a predisposition to&#xD;
      bleed, especially when they undergo an invasive procedure such as renal biopsy. The&#xD;
      predominant factor is abnormal platelet function. Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100), a very reliable test to&#xD;
      investigate primary hemostasis, can be useful in predicting the risk of bleeding&#xD;
      complications in patients undergoing renal biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney biopsy frequently is used to investigate the cause of suspected renal parenchymal&#xD;
      disease. Although kidney biopsy may provide important diagnostic information and guide&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions, the benefits must be weighed against the potential harms of biopsy.&#xD;
      Bleeding is one of the most feared risks from a renal biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique has significantly evolved because of the introduction of real-time ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance and use an automated spring-loaded biopsy device. As a consequence, the general&#xD;
      safety and complication rate of the procedure has substantially improved. Post biopsy&#xD;
      bleeding (hematoma and hematuria) is the primary complication of renal biopsies. However,&#xD;
      most of the perirenal hematomas are minor and without clinical significance, and major&#xD;
      complications are infrequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize bleeding risk, we used the following prebiopsy parameters as a guide: prothrombin&#xD;
      time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, age, sex, glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate and blood pressure. Antiaggregant and anticoagulant were stopped for 7 -10&#xD;
      days before biopsy. The Ivy bleeding time (BT) was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although an specific lancet is used to deliver a relatively standardized incision on the&#xD;
      patient's forearm, the Ivy bleeding time technique is patient and operator-dependent. Skin&#xD;
      thickness varies not only with age, but also with a number of other factors, such as&#xD;
      nutritional status. For these reasons was developed the platelet function analyzer, PFA-100.&#xD;
      This test assess primary haemostasis in vitro using citrated whole blood. The device&#xD;
      simulates in vivo haemostatic plug formation under high shear flow by measuring the time&#xD;
      required to occlude (closure time, CT) a collagen/epinephrine (Coll-EPI) or collagen/ADP&#xD;
      (Coll-ADP)-coated aperture inserted in a plastic membrane. PFA-100 is more sensitive than BT&#xD;
      to abnormalities of primary haemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate whether an abnormal PFA-100 can predict&#xD;
      bleeding events after percutaneous kidney biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present cohort includes 250 all adult patients who underwent percutaneous renal biopsy of&#xD;
      native kidney in the Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, the University of&#xD;
      Bari, Italy, from January 2017 to December 2018. Transplant kidney biopsies were excluded&#xD;
      from this study. Three experienced nephrologists performed all the biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation included clinical data collection, serial blood and urine sampling before and&#xD;
      after the procedure. Kidney ultrasound was performed in all patients before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data were collected for all patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables pre-biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  baseline demographics (age, gender);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  indication for renal biopsy [urinary abnormalities (i.e., proteinuria and&#xD;
                haematuria), and/or recurrent macrohaematuria and/or nephrotic syndrome and/or&#xD;
                nephritic syndrome and/or alteration of renal function and/or acute renal failure];&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  which kidney was biopsied;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  baseline serum creatinine, azotaemia and glomerular filtration rate;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  baseline haemoglobin and platelet count;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  baseline coagulation parameters (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time,&#xD;
                bleeding time);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  baseline urinary protein excretion;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables during-biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  administration of DDAVP;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  number of passes;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  number of renal biopsy samples;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the position of the patient during kidney biopsy [prone position or supine&#xD;
                anterolateral position (SALP)];&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables post-biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hemoglobin;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  post-biopsy bleeding complications (gross hematuria, hematoma);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  if was necessary transfusion of blood products or an invasive procedure&#xD;
                (angiography and arterial embolization or surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of kidneys conditions were performed by ultrasound before the procedure in all&#xD;
      patients. Longitudinal and transverse size, corticomedullary differentiation shape, location&#xD;
      and related structures of the kidney were assessed using ultrasound and blood flow of the&#xD;
      kidneys were assessed using a color-flow Doppler signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All biopsies were performed using real-time ultrasound-fixed guidance by a nephrologist with&#xD;
      assistance from an expert in renal ultrasonography. A 16-gauge automated spring-loaded gun&#xD;
      was used for the biopsy. A pathologist promptly examined the biopsy specimen under alight&#xD;
      microscope to confirm that adequate renal tissue was available for further pathological&#xD;
      evaluations. 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) was administered to all patients who&#xD;
      had not contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, patients were invited to rest in bed on their backs for a 24-hour&#xD;
      observation time. Meantime, clinical evaluation (gross haematuria, flank pain, hypotension)&#xD;
      was performed to identify a bleeding complications. Ultrasound evaluation was performed for&#xD;
      all patients after 24 hours from percutaneous renal biopsy to exclude a presence of&#xD;
      complication, as hematoma and arteriovenous fistula Post biopsy bleeding complications were&#xD;
      categorized as either minor or major. Minor bleeding complications included gross haematuria&#xD;
      and/or subcapsular perinephric hematoma (&lt;5cm diameter) that spontaneously resolved without&#xD;
      need for further intervention. Major complications were defined as those that required an&#xD;
      intervention for resolution, either the transfusion of blood products or an invasive&#xD;
      procedure (angiography, surgery), and those that led to acute renal obstruction or failure,&#xD;
      septicaemia, or death. The size of post biopsy hematoma (surface area) was defined as the&#xD;
      product of the longest and the shortest diameters on the two-dimensional sonographic&#xD;
      pictures.&#xD;
