    <textblock>
      Utilizing the osteogenic properties of both platelet rich fibrin matrix and peripheral blood&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells for periodontal regeneration would be novel and may be advantageous&#xD;
      than using Platelet rich fibrin matrix alone. The literature search does not show any human&#xD;
      clinical trial conducted till date to assess the regenerative potential of this new material&#xD;
      i.e. Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs).In this new material because of the addition of a&#xD;
      patented gel the second spin to procure the PRFM has been eliminated and this seems to be an&#xD;
      additional advantage. This study therefore aims at the evaluation of Supercell glue (PRFM and&#xD;
      PBMSCs) as a regenerative material in comparison with PRFM alone in human mandibular&#xD;
      periodontal intraosseous defects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal regeneration involves the formation of alveolar bone, cementum and a new&#xD;
      functional periodontal ligament. Over the recent years the concept of periodontal treatment&#xD;
      has focused towards regeneration with a goal of regaining natural periodontal apparatus.&#xD;
      Numerous procedures have been investigated in the past to try to promote periodontal&#xD;
      regeneration which range from root biomodifications, soft tissue grafts, bone replacement&#xD;
      grafts, guided tissue regeneration to the use of combinations of the same. However the&#xD;
      success of these approaches are highly variable. As a consequence current research trends are&#xD;
      inclined towards the principle of 'biological solutions for biological problem' and thus&#xD;
      attempts are directed towards various approaches like tissue engineering, ERT (endogenous&#xD;
      regenerative technology), application of biologics, cell based techniques, biomimetic&#xD;
      nanoscaffold fabrication and others for periodontal regeneration. Of all known Polypeptide&#xD;
      Growth Factors, Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF&#xD;
      β) which are abundant in α granule of platelets are shown to exert a favourable effect on&#xD;
      periodontal regeneration. Therefore use of platelet concentrates is a convenient approach to&#xD;
      obtain autologous growth factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) is an autologous concentrated platelet-rich thrombin free&#xD;
      fibrin matrix, prepared by two step centrifugation of blood. Platelets isolated, remain&#xD;
      intact and retain their growth factor compliment. This allows a more effective, sustained&#xD;
      release of growth factors to the wound site following PRFM application. During the second&#xD;
      spin, a cross-linking of fibrin takes place, resulting in the formation of a dense fibrin&#xD;
      matrix, within which a concentration of viable platelets can be found. Having an organized&#xD;
      fibrin matrix at the start of healing accelerates the speed of vascular ingress into the&#xD;
      wound compared to non-accelerated healing, which requires a longer time for fibrin formation&#xD;
      and the development of vascularity. The earlier the vascularity is established, faster is the&#xD;
      migration of the bone-forming cells at the wound site and initiation of bone formation.&#xD;
      Therapeutic applications of platelet-rich products have led to improved bone regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a multipotent stromal cells with prominent regenerative&#xD;
      functions. MSCs were first identified and isolated from bone marrow and then found in various&#xD;
      tissues including umbilical cord, adipose tissue and peripheral blood. Among these sources&#xD;
      peripheral blood MSCs draw increasing attention as they share similar biological&#xD;
      characteristics with MSCs derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue. Bone marrow derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells(BMMSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into&#xD;
      osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts, tenocytes, and myoblasts, which are&#xD;
      considered as a cell source for various tissue repair and regenerating bone defects. The&#xD;
      requirements of aspiration of bone marrow from the patient will cause pain and morbidity of&#xD;
      the donor sites. It will be very convenient if peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (PBMSCs) could be harvested and expanded to enough numbers, with their osteogenic capacity&#xD;
      maintained in a clinical permitted period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, utilizing the osteogenic properties of both platelet rich fibrin matrix and peripheral&#xD;
      blood mesenchymal stem cells for periodontal regeneration would be novel and may be&#xD;
      advantageous than using Platelet rich fibrin matrix alone. The literature search does not&#xD;
      show any human clinical trial conducted till date to assess the regenerative potential of&#xD;
      this new material i.e. Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs).In this new material because of the&#xD;
      addition of a patented gel the second spin to procure the PRFM has been eliminated and this&#xD;
      seems to be an additional advantage. This study therefore aims at the evaluation of Supercell&#xD;
      glue (PRFM and PBMSCs) as a regenerative material in comparison with PRFM alone in human&#xD;
      mandibular periodontal intraosseous defects.&#xD;
