    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized study to evaluate the role of NBI for improving&#xD;
      complete resection rate of sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P). The authors will enroll&#xD;
      consecutive patients who underwent colon polypectomy for SSA/P during colonoscopy. The&#xD;
      authors will inspect resection margin of SSA/P using white light endosocpy (WLE) or NBI after&#xD;
      randomization for the evaluation of remnant lesion. Additional resection will be performed&#xD;
      for suspicious of remnant lesion, and then 4 biopsies from 4 quadrants of margin for&#xD;
      evaluation of complete resection.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective randomized multi-center study to evaluate the role of NBI for&#xD;
      improving complete resection rate of sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors will enroll consecutive patients who underwent colon polypectomy for suspicious&#xD;
      SSA/P during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who undergo polypectomy will be enrolled, but excluded as follows; 1. poor bowel&#xD;
      preparation according to Boston bowel preparation scale calculation, 2. inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease, 3. failure of cecal insertion, 4. continuous anti-plate agents or anti-coagulation&#xD;
      agents users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the authors will inspect polyp using the arbitrary endoscopic criteria by inspection&#xD;
      of white light endoscopy (WLE) and if that lesion is satisfied with 3 or more than 3 out of 5&#xD;
      categories (1. located in the right colon, 2. flat shape, 3. covered with mucus cap or&#xD;
      debris, 4. 1 cm or larger than 1 cm in size, 5. varicose superficial vessel was seen on the&#xD;
      surface after submucosal injection), endoscopic resection will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And then, the authors will inspect the resection margin carefully using NBI or WLE by&#xD;
      pre-randomization before endoscopic resection. If the remnant tissue is detected, additional&#xD;
      endoscopic resection will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ed margin as two groups (NBI inspection group and WLE inspection&#xD;
&#xD;
      And then, 4 biopsies from 4 quadrants of margin for evaluation of complete resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point is comparing the rate of additional resection for remnant lesion, the SSA/P&#xD;
      diagnosis rate of the remnant lesions after the additional resection, and the complete&#xD;
      resection rate of the target lesion between two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim is evaluate the accuracy for SSA/P using arbitrary WLE criteria. For evaluation&#xD;
      of the accuracy of arbitrary WLE criteria, the authors will compare the pathologic diagosis&#xD;
      rate of SSA/P for each criterion, and calculate the sensitivity, the specificity, the&#xD;
      positive predictive value, the negative predictive value, and the accuracy with area under&#xD;
      curve of ROC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors hypothesized complete resection rate of SSA/P as 90% in the NBI inspection group&#xD;
      and 70% in the WLE inspection group based on previous studies including CARE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated as 118 (each 59) patients of SSA/P. Study duration will be 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
