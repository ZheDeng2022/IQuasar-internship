    <textblock>
      Ageing is associated with a gradual decline in muscle mass that is detrimental to both&#xD;
      physical function and metabolic health, increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality. The&#xD;
      loss of protein muscle mass with ageing is poorly understood, but it may partly relate to&#xD;
      inactivity/disuse (i.e. during injury or hospitalization). Periods of inactivity/disuse blunt&#xD;
      the ability of muscle to grow (termed anabolic blunting), leading to a loss of muscle mass&#xD;
      and strength. An accumulation of these periods over a lifetime promotes the devastating loss&#xD;
      of muscle protein mass and strength seen with ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disuse-induced muscle loss is underpinned by a blunted muscle anabolic response to protein&#xD;
      nutrition. Supplementing the diet with the amino acid leucine may offer a potential solution&#xD;
      to alleviate muscle mass and strength loss during disuse. In fact, leucine is suggested to&#xD;
      promote muscle protein growth and reduce muscle protein loss during disuse in rats, but this&#xD;
      is yet to be shown in humans. Accordingly, the proposed study will investigate whether&#xD;
      leucine supplementation can offset muscle and strength loss during short-term disuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four healthy (non-obese, non-diabetic, non-smokers) men aged 18-35 years will&#xD;
      initially complete a lower-limb strength assessment and undergo a body composition scan three&#xD;
      days later. The following morning, participants will be randomly assigned to ingest either 5g&#xD;
      of leucine (n=12) or a caloric-matched placebo (n=12) with each meal over a 7 d period of a&#xD;
      single-leg immobilisation. Immediately following immobilisation participants will undergo&#xD;
      another body composition scan. Additionally, a stable isotope infusion will be combined with&#xD;
      serial muscle biopsies from the thigh of each leg to determine the measure rates of muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis in the fasted state and in the 'early' and 'late' phase of feeding. A day&#xD;
      later, the assessment of muscle strength will be repeated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that skeletal muscle mass progressively declines with healthy ageing,&#xD;
      a phenomenon commonly termed sarcopenia. Overtime, this leads to a loss in functional&#xD;
      independence and provides an increased risk of developing a co-morbidity. Recent estimates&#xD;
      suggest that 30% of those aged 75-84 years suffer from sarcopenia. As the 85-and-over&#xD;
      population are rapidly expanding, sarcopenia places a considerable socio-economic burden to&#xD;
      healthcare services. From a physiological perspective, the maintenance of muscle mass is&#xD;
      dependent on a fine balance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and breakdown (MPB) rates.&#xD;
      In old age, the MPS response to nutrition is impaired (termed 'anabolic resistance'), leaving&#xD;
      muscle in a chronic catabolic state and ultimately underpinning the progression of&#xD;
      sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-associated muscle anabolic resistance may stem from an accumulation of periods of&#xD;
      inactivity/disuse, which are strongly associated with a decline in muscle mass (atrophy) in&#xD;
      both the young and old. In fact, the associated loss of muscle mass is the most rapid at the&#xD;
      onset of muscle disuse, with significant declines in muscle mass occurring after just 5 days&#xD;
      of disuse. This is of particular importance since the average length of hospitalization in&#xD;
      older individuals in 5-6 days. Disuse-induced muscle deconditioning is attributed to declines&#xD;
      in MPS in response to nutrition, and potentially an elevated MPB. Therefore, an accumulation&#xD;
      of these periods of disuse over a lifetime may lead to an acceleration in the trajectory of&#xD;
      sarcopenia that is commonly seen with ageing. Consequently, nutritional strategies to&#xD;
      maximize healthy musculoskeletal ageing should focus on alleviating muscle metabolic&#xD;
      dysregulation during short-term disuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to counteract muscle deterioration during short-term disuse is to increase&#xD;
      dietary protein consumption. In fact, adequate protein intake is a necessity for muscle to&#xD;
      remain in a positive net protein balance, with the importance of this nutritional&#xD;
      intervention increasing during periods of disuse. However, this approach is not always&#xD;
      feasible as activity levels are more limited during periods of disuse and individuals are&#xD;
      thus less likely to consume adequate nutritional intake. A more feasible approach may be to&#xD;
      enhance the anabolic potency of sub-optimal protein doses through supplementation with the&#xD;
      amino acid, leucine. Leucine is unique in its ability to increase the protein balance more so&#xD;
      than any other amino acid through stimulation of MPS and suppression of MPB. Leucine provides&#xD;
      a strong anti-catabolic effect during hind limb immobilization in rats, which has yet to be&#xD;
      examined in humans. Therefore, it is clear that leucine represents a viable strategy to&#xD;
      offset the dysregulation of MPS and MPB and preserve musculoskeletal health during short-term&#xD;
      disuse in both young and old individuals and thus warrants further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four healthy (non-obese, non-diabetic, non-smokers) males aged 18-35 years will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in the study. The current study will be a placebo controlled&#xD;
      double-blind study with two intervention groups, in which, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive supplemental leucine (LEU; n=12) or placebo (PLA; n=12) during 7 days of&#xD;
      unilateral leg immobilization. Participants will be active, but athletically untrained (i.e.&#xD;
      exercise ≤3x/week). All study procedures will be clearly explained and participants will&#xD;
      provide written informed consent prior to obtaining baseline measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to the University of Birmingham's School of Sport, Exercise and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Sciences. Upon arrival, a researcher involved in the trial will explain the&#xD;
      study design and interventions to the participant. Participants will be given the opportunity&#xD;
      to ask any questions related to the study and will be given time to decide whether or not to&#xD;
      take part. If the participant is happy to take part the participant will be asked to sign a&#xD;
      consent form and fill in a health questionnaire. When the participant has left, the&#xD;
      participant will be categorized at random to the leucine or placebo group. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to fill in a three-day diet diary to assess habitual dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following explanation of the study and the acquisition of informed consent, participants will&#xD;
      report to the laboratory at 0800-0900h having fasted for 10 hours and refrained from vigorous&#xD;
      exercise and alcohol for 24 hours previously. Participants baseline muscle function will be&#xD;
      acquired through measures of maximal isometric and isokinetic strength of the knee extensor&#xD;
      and flexor muscles using an isokinetic dynamometer. Following strength testing the&#xD;
      investigators will provide individuals with a three-day diet diary and activity monitor.&#xD;
      Three days following the baseline strength measures, participants will once again report to&#xD;
      the laboratory at 0800-0900h following a 10h overnight fast. Participants will be weighed on&#xD;
      a digital scale to the nearest 0.1kg in light clothing. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and&#xD;
      ultrasound scans will be conducted to determine the composition of the thigh (fat and fat&#xD;
      free mass).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immobilization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 0800-0900h on the morning following preliminary assessments, participants will undergo 7&#xD;
      days of unilateral leg immobilization. A single leg will be randomly selected&#xD;
      (counterbalanced left/right) and placed in a full-leg knee brace. Participants will ambulate&#xD;
      using crutches and perform daily ankle exercises to minimize the risk of deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis, as indicated by a qualified physiotherapist. Participants will also be permitted&#xD;
      to remove the knee brace during overnight sleep. A trained physiotherapist will instruct the&#xD;
      participant on the safe use of crutches (i.e climbing stairs). During each main meal in the&#xD;
      immobilization period, participants will consume 5 g of a powdered LEU or PLA supplement with&#xD;
      250-300 ml of water, which is within the safe limits. Dietary intake will be controlled&#xD;
      throughout the immobilization period according to the individuals total calorie intake&#xD;
      (derived from standardized equations), with a macro-nutrient composition of 55% carbohydrate,&#xD;
      30% fat and 15% protein. The total quantity of protein ingestion will equate to 1.0g/kg/day.&#xD;
      Participant's activity levels will be monitored throughout the 7 day period through a&#xD;
      wrist-worn activity monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning marking the end of the 7 d immobilization period participants will report to&#xD;
      the laboratory at 0600-0700h following an overnight fast. Ultrasound and DXA assessments will&#xD;
      be repeated, immediately after which a catheter will be inserted into a forearm vein of both&#xD;
      arms for i) frequent blood sampling at -150, -90, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 180, 240-minutes of&#xD;
      the experimental trial (∼100mL in total) and ii) a continuous infusion of a stable isotope&#xD;
      amino acid tracer (L- [ring] 13C6 phenylalanine). Participants will remain in a supine&#xD;
      position throughout the trial. After 150 min of infusion, a muscle biopsy will be obtained&#xD;
      from the quadriceps muscle of immobilized and non-immobilized legs under local anaesthetic.&#xD;
      Participants will then consume a 20g milk protein beverage. Further biopsies will be obtained&#xD;
      from both legs after 270-min and 390-mins of infusion. Thus, a total of 6 invasive muscle&#xD;
      biopsies will be obtained during the trial (3 from each leg), with each biopsy obtained from&#xD;
      a separate incision spaced ∼3cm apart. This two- stage stable-isotope infusion design allows&#xD;
      efficient assessment of MPS in the transition from post-absorptive (0-120 min) to&#xD;
      postprandial conditions (120-240 min). Leg strength will be reassessed a day following the&#xD;
      stable isotope infusion at 0800-0900h following a 10 hr fast to avoid any interference effect&#xD;
      of prior contraction on muscle protein turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate myofibrillar and mitochondrial protein synthesis, the investigators will adopt&#xD;
      typical sophisticated mass spectrometry techniques to determine isotopic tracer enrichment in&#xD;
      biopsy-isolated muscle proteins and plasma. Intramuscular &quot;anabolic signals&quot; (in the mTORC1&#xD;
      pathway) and &quot;catabolic&quot; signals will be determined via western blot and q-rtPCR analysis.&#xD;
      High resolution respirometry will also be used to assess the mitochondrial function of&#xD;
      biopsy-isolated skeletal muscle tissue in both the control and immobilized limbs.&#xD;
