  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further understand the impact of acute sleep deprivation and recovery sleep on the&#xD;
      processing of emotional information the investigators will address and attempt to answer&#xD;
      three questions, (i) how both undisturbed sleep and sleep deprivation affect the processing&#xD;
      and retrieval of emotional information, (ii) what neural and psychophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      are associated with these behavioral effects, and (iii) to explore the ability of recovery&#xD;
      sleep to reverse the effects of sleep deprivation. Together, these studies will provide a&#xD;
      greater breadth and depth of knowledge concerning sleep's role in emotion processing and&#xD;
      regulation. Given the growing societal tendency to view sleep as unproductive-foregoing it to&#xD;
      lengthen work days and increase social opportunities- such knowledge would be of practical&#xD;
      importance for understanding the role of sleep in healthy emotional functioning, particular&#xD;
      for individuals experiencing periods of increased stress and emotional distress (e.g., new&#xD;
      parents, hospital staff, or combat troops).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goal 1: How does sleep deprivation impact emotion perception and memory processing? The&#xD;
      investigators are interested in how an acute loss of sleep impairs our ability to properly&#xD;
      perceive, consolidate, and retrieve emotional information. There has been research on the&#xD;
      effect of sleep deprivation on broad areas of cognition, such as attention, working memory,&#xD;
      and reasoning ability, but the impact of sleep loss on emotional processing and regulation&#xD;
      remains largely unexplored. The investigators aim to characterize how sleep deprivation&#xD;
      compared to undisturbed sleep affects the ability to accurately perceive emotion, how it&#xD;
      alters the intensity with which emotions are perceived, and the effect that these changes&#xD;
      have on the subsequent consolidation and memory retrieval for emotional compared to neutral&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 2: How are these changes reflected in the neural signal and with psychophysiological&#xD;
      measures? The investigators will utilize fMRI and measures of autonomic reactivity (heart&#xD;
      rate and skin conductance) to characterize the neural and psychophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying these behavioral changes following sleep deprivation compared to a normal night of&#xD;
      sleep. This will allow us to pinpoint the brain regions involved in changes following sleep&#xD;
      deprivation, and associate these changes with effects on downstream physiological responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 3: Can a nap after sleep deprivation restore normal processing of emotional memory and&#xD;
      rescue the neural and autonomic markers of sleep deprivation? The investigators are&#xD;
      interested in determining if a brief period of recovery sleep is enough to combat the&#xD;
      behavioral, neural, and autonomic effects of acute sleep loss, thus a portion of the&#xD;
      sleep-deprived participants will be given a 2-hour nap opportunity to quantify its&#xD;
      restorative effects. Such information would form the foundation for future research extending&#xD;
      and translating these findings into effective sleep-based interventions for healthy and&#xD;
      clinical populations alike.&#xD;

    <measure>Morphed Face Accuracy and Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>1-24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to identify and rate emotional intensity of ambiguous emotional faces (happy, sad, angry) that have been morphed with neutral faces. Scores for each emotional domain will be calculated as (i) accuracy score (number of faces correctly identified over total faces seen), and (ii) average emotional intensity rating. Task will be completed at baseline, post-sleep/sleep deprivation, and post-nap/no nap, and within-subject comparisons will determine how interventions impact emotional perception.</description>

    <measure>Emotional Memory Tradeoff Memory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12-24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Following sleep or sleep deprivation, participants will complete emotional memory tradeoff recognition task at two time points, separated by a nap or wakefulness. Corrected hit rate will be calculated for negative and neutral scene components as the percentage of correctly identified &quot;old&quot; objects/backgrounds minus percentage of false alarms (&quot;new&quot; pictures marked as &quot;old&quot;)</description>
