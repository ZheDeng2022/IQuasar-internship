  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease, belonging to the wide&#xD;
      spectrum of spondyloarthritis, but with the particularity to be associated with personal&#xD;
      psoriasis or familial psoriasis. PsA can be a very disabling disease through progressive and&#xD;
      irreversible joint damage. Long-term functional prognosis of patients with PsA is correlated&#xD;
      with the presence and severity of the radiographic joint lesions of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the proportion of patients who will develop those peripheral joint damages is not&#xD;
      yet known and less over the factors which are associated/involved in such an aggressive&#xD;
      pattern of the disease. Early identification of this subgroup of patients is particularly&#xD;
      important for determining early &quot;intensive&quot; treatment, strict management with a Treat To&#xD;
      Target approach, and identification of new treatments with a stronger structural effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this prospective 10 years cohort is to describe the 5 years structural&#xD;
      (radiographic) severity of recent PsA with recent peripheral arthritis.Some of the secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to describe the 10 years structural severity within those patients, and to&#xD;
      determine the predictive factors of those 5 and 10 years radiographic lesions (genetic,&#xD;
      environmental, clinic, therapeutic factors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      APACHE will provide a unique longitudinal standardized database concerning patients with PsA&#xD;
      with very recent peripheral arthritis. Research projects which will based on those collected&#xD;
      data should allow to identify the mechanisms of aggressive joint damage, to highlight mew&#xD;
      treatments targets, to better describe the burden of the disease, to test previous or develop&#xD;
      new assessments tolls, to develop early diagnostic criteria&#xD;

      Method:APACHE is a prospective national multicentre (26) cohort including and following&#xD;
      during 10 years patients with a first peripheral arthritis in the past year, attributing to a&#xD;
      PsA according to the treating rheumatologist. 425 patients will be included during a 2 years&#xD;
      period before the follow-up. Standardized visits are planned throughout the 10 years&#xD;
      follow-up, permitting the collection of various data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients Reported Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  usual lab parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plasma, serum and urines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline and one year RNA, DNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peripheral X-Rays, Ultrasounds and MRI at different time points Those visits have non&#xD;
           interventional character (no therapeutic decision will be taken) Those collected data&#xD;
           will allow submissions of many research projects to the scientific committee of the&#xD;
           cohort.&#xD;
