  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective data have shown that active sac management, as applied in EVAS, reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of the post-implant syndrome. All-cause and cardiac mortality at one-year seems to&#xD;
      be lower after EVAS when compared to EVAR. Ongoing, low grade, inflammation could differ&#xD;
      between techniques and induce cardiac damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to establish whether EVAS results in a reduced post-operative&#xD;
      inflammatory response during the first year after surgery, compared to EVAR as assessed by&#xD;
      trends in circulating inflammatory cytokine concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: International prospective, comparative, explorative study. Study population:&#xD;
      Patients scheduled to undergo infra-renal EVAR with a polyester endograft or EVAS for an&#xD;
      infrarenal aortic aneurysm. This is an explorative study and therefore only patients who&#xD;
      would normally receive a suitable device as part of standard treatment at the participating&#xD;
      institutes will be recruited. Blood samples will be taken at specified time points before and&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The difference in early post-operative and long term&#xD;
      inflammatory response between EVAS and EVAR, measured by the incidence of the post-implant&#xD;
      syndrome. To investigate the incidence of the post-implant syndrome, the rise in CRP, WBC and&#xD;
      circulating cytokines, at specified time points up to 12 months after surgery and the change&#xD;
      in aortic thrombus volume and its relationship with the inflammatory response, measured by&#xD;
      cytokines' concentrations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endovascular sealing of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAS) is a new technique to treat&#xD;
      infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), which can be performed more expeditiously than&#xD;
      endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The difference with EVAR is that fixation and seal are&#xD;
      provided from polymer filled endobags that are placed in the aneurysmal sac. The&#xD;
      post-implantation syndrome (PIS) is the clinical and biochemical expression of an&#xD;
      inflammatory response following endovascular repair of an aortic aneurysm. More specifically,&#xD;
      the presence of fever (body temperature &gt;38 C for ≥1 day) and leukocytosis (white blood cell&#xD;
      count (WBC) &gt;12.000/mL) with negative blood cultures and is occurring in over 30% cases after&#xD;
      EVAR. It is related to prolonged hospital stay and elevated CRP levels, that in turn increase&#xD;
      the risk on major adverse cardiac events. The literature showed that the magnitude of the&#xD;
      post-operative inflammatory response depends on the type of endoprothesis used for EVAR and&#xD;
      that EVAS is related to a lower post-operative CRP level, lower white blood counts, a lower&#xD;
      temperature and less cardiac complications compared to standard EVAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study was designed to explore the occurence of the post-implant syndrome after&#xD;
      EVAR and EVAS. This study was also designed to unravel the cytokines which are involved in&#xD;
      the post-implant syndrome after EVAR and EVAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this international, prospective, explorative study 60 patients who are scheduled for EVAR&#xD;
      and 60 patients who are scheduled for EVAS will be included. Blood samples (for WBC and&#xD;
      circulating cytokines (TNF-α, Interleukin (IL)-1, 1RA, 6, 10, 18, CRP), Troponin T, HsTnT,&#xD;
      NT-pro-BNP)) will be taken at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before induction of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At wound closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hours after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  48 hours after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 month after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 months after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 months after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are finished with the study after 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
