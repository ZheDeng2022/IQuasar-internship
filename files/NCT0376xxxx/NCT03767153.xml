    <textblock>
      Prospective, single centre, evaluator-blind study of the safety and performance of fractional&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) for the treatment and reduction of acne scarring. The study will evaluate&#xD;
      50 treatment sites in subjects requesting treatment of their acne scarring. The study will&#xD;
      involve three treatments on both sides of the face with 3-5 week intervals between each&#xD;
      treatment. Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after their last treatment. Analysis&#xD;
      will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Acne Scar Improvement Assessed by the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at 12 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the efficacy of overall facial acne scar improvement assessed live by the Investigator and a subject assessment of facial appearance including the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS).&#xD;
The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale is a seven-grade subjective test.&#xD;
Three independent evaluators evaluated before and after photographs and graded them for change.&#xD;
Possible responses were (3) Very Much Improved, (2) Much Improved, (1) Improved, (0) No Change, (-1) Worse, (-2) Much Worse, and (-3) Very Much Worse. For reporting of outcomes, the higher the GAIS value, the greater the improvement (Range -3 to 3).</description>

    <description>Subjects' assessment of satisfaction with the treatment using a 5 point Subject Satisfaction Scale at 6 Weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
The Subject Satisfaction Scale is a five-grade subjective test.&#xD;
Participant were asked their satisfaction level post treatment.&#xD;
Possible responses were (4) Very Satisfied, (3) Satisfied, (2) Having No Opinion, (1) Unsatisfied, and (0) Very Unsatisfied.</description>

The Visual Analog Scale is a scale from 0 cm (no pain) and 10 cm (pain as bad as it can be).&#xD;
Possible responses were of 0 to 0.4 cm can be considered (no pain); 0.5 to 4.4 cm (mild pain), 4.5 to 7.4 cm (moderate pain), and 7.5 to 10 cm (severe pain).</description>

    <description>The Venus Viva™ fractional RF applicator has been shown in clinical studies to improve various skin conditions related to aging and alter collagen structures such as wrinkles, rhytids and scars.&#xD;
Beginning with the Baseline visit (Visit 1), subjects will receive a total of 3 treatments approximately 3-5 weeks apart. The left and right side of the face will be treated and assessed as independent sites, and the same applicator tip configuration will be used to treat both sides at all 3 treatment visits.</description>

The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale is a seven-grade subjective test.&#xD;
Three independent evaluators evaluated before and after photographs and graded them for change.&#xD;
Possible responses were (3) Very Much Improved, (2) Much Improved, (1) Improved, (0) No Change, (-1) Worse, (-2) Much Worse, and (-3) Very Much Worse. For reporting of outcomes, the higher the GAIS value, the greater the improvement (Range -3 to 3).</description>

          <description>Venus Viva: The Venus Viva™ fractional RF applicator has been shown in clinical studies to improve various skin conditions related to aging and alter collagen structures such as wrinkles, rhytids and scars.&#xD;
Beginning with the Baseline visit (Visit 1), subjects will receive a total of 3 treatments approximately 3-5 weeks apart. The left and right side of the face will be treated and assessed as independent sites, and the same applicator tip configuration will be used to treat both sides at all 3 treatment visits.</description>
