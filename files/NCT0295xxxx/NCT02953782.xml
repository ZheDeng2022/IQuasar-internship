    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are: (Phase 1b) to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for magrolimab in&#xD;
      combination with cetuximab; and (Phase 2) to evaluate overall response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      magrolimab in combination with cetuximab in participants with Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral&#xD;
      oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutant and KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer (CRC).&#xD;

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, and/or laboratory or physiological observation that may or may not be related to the investigational medicinal product. A TEAE was defined as AEs worsening or occurring during or after a participant's first exposure to study drug and within 30 days after the last administration of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, and/or laboratory or physiological observation that may or may not be related to the investigational medicinal product. A TEAE was defined as AEs worsening or occurring during or after a participant's first exposure to study drug and within 30 days after the last administration of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first.</description>

        <title>Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by RECIST v1.1</title>
        <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with disease control which consisted of CR+PR+SD. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters measured while on study. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum measured while on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
