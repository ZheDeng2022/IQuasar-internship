  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-facing eHealth technologies, such as online patient portals, connect patients with&#xD;
      the healthcare system, help them access their health information, and support self-management&#xD;
      of health conditions. This study tested an intervention to improve adoption and use of the My&#xD;
      HealtheVet patient portal for diabetes management.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this small scale study is to test the feasibility of engaging Veterans in a&#xD;
      supported adoption intervention to promote effective patient portal use in a sample of&#xD;
      Veterans with uncontrolled Type II diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were eligible for recruitment if they were Veterans age 18-85 who were actively&#xD;
      receiving care at one of the study sites (as determined by having an upcoming scheduled&#xD;
      appointment), had uncontrolled glucose (HbA1c &gt;= 8.5%), and had either never used the VA&#xD;
      patient portal or were inactive registrants who have not used the patient portal in the past&#xD;
      12 months. Participants who met these conditions and did not opt out of the study were&#xD;
      randomized to one of four arms: 1) Encouragement I (brochure + mailed training guide), 2)&#xD;
      Encouragement II (brochure + mailed training guide + invitation to group training), 3)&#xD;
      Encouragement III (brochure + mailed training guide + invitation to group and one-on-one&#xD;
      training), and 4) Comparison (standard patient portal enrollment brochure only). All arms&#xD;
      received the standard My HealtheVet patient portal enrollment brochure along with an&#xD;
      invitation to participate in the study. Those randomized to any of the Encouragement Arms&#xD;
      received a mailed training guide. The My HealtheVet Training Guide for Veterans Living with&#xD;
      Diabetes was designed in conjunction with Veteran co-investigators based on feedback from&#xD;
      patients living with diabetes who were My HealtheVet users. It provided step by step guidance&#xD;
      on how to use the features Veterans living with diabetes find most helpful with specific&#xD;
      examples of use for diabetes self-management. Those in Encouragement Arm II were also invited&#xD;
      to attend one of several group training sessions. Those in Encouragement III were invited to&#xD;
      schedule a one-on one session to learn how to use the patient portal. Those in the comparison&#xD;
      condition were asked during their interview if they would like a Training Guide mailed to&#xD;
      them at the end of the trial, and those interested were mailed a Training Guide.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Portal use within 180 days of initial brochure mailing</time_frame>
    <description>This measure captures any use of MHV within 180 days of the brochure mailing, including use of prescription refills, secure messaging, Blue Button, or any other portal features.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Upgraded to a Premium My HealtheVet Portal Account</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days from brochure mailing</time_frame>
    <description>After registering for the portal, patients must confirm their identity and accept the terms and conditions of the portal in order to upgrade to Premium status which allows access to secure messaging, their VA appointments, and electronic health record extracts such as lab results, medical imaging and reports, clinical notes, and their VA health summary. Patients can access a limited subset of portal features, including online prescription refills, without upgrading to Premium. This measure captures whether a participant upgraded to a Premium account during the trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Online Prescription Refills</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days from brochure mailing</time_frame>
    <description>This measure captures whether the participant used the portal's online prescription refill feature at least once within 180 days of mailing the brochure.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients meeting eligibility criteria were identified from clinical records and mailed an invitation to participate in the study along with a My HealtheVet brochure and an information sheet describing the study. Initial invitations were sent out in June 2019 at Site 1 and in December 2019 at Site 2. Patients who did not opt out were enrolled and randomized into study arms in July 2019 and January 2020, respectively.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>One patient was mistakenly randomized to an arm even though he was deceased shortly prior to enrollment because he met the eligibility criteria according to our databases, including having a future appointment scheduled. Fifteen patients from one site were incorrectly identified as not having used the portal in the 12 months prior to the trial and were excluded from the analyses.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Any My HealtheVet Patient Portal Use</title>

        <time_frame>Portal use within 180 days of initial brochure mailing</time_frame>
        <population>Patients randomized to each arm who had not used My HealtheVet in the 12 months prior to randomization. At the second site, 15 people who should have been excluded were inadvertently included in the sample because the criteria of no secure messaging use in previous 12 months was mistakenly used instead of no patient portal use in the previous 12 months. We did not discover this until after the trial was complete because there were delays in receiving actual portal use data.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, group and one-on-one sessions planned at the second site had to be converted to virtual sessions without a hands-on component. This led to lower participation in training sessions at this second site.&#xD;
At the second site, 15 people who had portal activity in the previous year were inadvertently included. These 15 people were excluded from analysis of outcomes.&#xD;
Only a subset of those enrolled in each arm completed the telephone interview.</limitations_and_caveats>
