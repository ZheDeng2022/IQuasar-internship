  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the dose-escalation part of the trial is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of BI 754091 on the basis of patients with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients&#xD;
      with selected advanced solid malignancies. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by&#xD;
      monitoring the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAE), and laboratory&#xD;
      parameter abnormalities, as well as changes to vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the determination of the PK profile of BI 754091 after single and&#xD;
      multiple doses of BI 754091, and the preliminary assessment of antitumour activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose-expansion part of the trial, the main objectives are to further assess the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy, PK profile, and biomarkers of BI 754091 in tumours with specific tumour&#xD;
      types and/or genetic mutations at the RP2D.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic&#xD;

                  local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram [ECHO], multi-gated&#xD;
                  acquisition scan [MUGA]). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months&#xD;
                  prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that there&#xD;
                  is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in&#xD;
                  the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or both.&#xD;
