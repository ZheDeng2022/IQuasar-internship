  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib open label, single arm, adaptive multicentre trial. Patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM) will be treated with&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide-Bortezomib-Dexamethasone (CyBorD) in combination with Daratumumab (DARA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of daratumumab to date, which does not appear to overlap with those known&#xD;
      for approved agents, combined with its distinct MoA, suggest that the therapeutic profile of&#xD;
      daratumumab combined with various backbone regimens may improve the treatment effect of these&#xD;
      regimens. Additionally, daratumumab as a single agent may prolong the progression free&#xD;
      interval for these patients. Based on the potential for cyclophosphamide to enhance ADCP,&#xD;
      there is a strong rationale to combine DARA with a cyclophosphamide, bortezomib containing&#xD;
      regimen. This will be the first clinical trial to explore the feasibility of combining&#xD;
      daratumumab with a cyclophosphamide containing backbone induction regimen and if successful&#xD;
      will provide the rationale for larger studies exploring the efficacy of this combination in&#xD;
      greater detail.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Screening Phase will extend up to 28 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Treatment Phase will be conducted in 2 parts and will extend from Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
           until treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase, Part 1: Induction/Transplantation/Consolidation Phase. The consolidation&#xD;
      phase of treatment will begin approximately 30-60 days after Autologous Stem Cell&#xD;
      Transplantation (ASCT), when the patient has recovered sufficiently and engraftment is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase, Part 2: Maintenance Phase treatment until a maximum duration of 2 years,&#xD;
      documented disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;

             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Childbearing potential is defined as any woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or&#xD;

             how to achieve adequate birth control. Highly effective contraception is defined in&#xD;
             the study as methods that achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used&#xD;
             consistently and correctly. Such methods include: combined (oestrogen and progestogen&#xD;
             containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,&#xD;

             intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, successfully&#xD;
             vasectomised partner and sexual abstinence. In addition, the use of condoms by&#xD;
             patients or their partners is required unless the woman has had a hysterectomy.&#xD;
             Contraception will start 4 weeks before the start of therapy, will continue during&#xD;
             therapy including dose interruptions and for 4 months after the last dose of any&#xD;
             component of the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy tests&#xD;
             at Screening, first within 10 to 14 days prior to first dose and the second within 24&#xD;
             hours prior to first dose.&#xD;
