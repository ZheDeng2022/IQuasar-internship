  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SATIOSTAT is a composition comprising a specific dietary fibre component (a mixture of&#xD;
      hydrocolloids with excellent safety profiles and a long history of use in humans) and a lipid&#xD;
      component (long-chain fatty acids). The goal of this combination is to achieve long-acting&#xD;
      delivery of long-chain fatty acids to the intestinal lining, triggering the sustained release&#xD;
      of satiety-signals from intestinal cells, and consequently reducing appetite and lowering&#xD;
      food intake in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a period of 6 weeks, volunteers will ingest SATIOSTAT as meal replacement at lunch and&#xD;
      as first course at dinner. Once before and after these 6 weeks the investigators will carry&#xD;
      out an oral glucose challenge, measure satiation hormones and examine faeces (gut&#xD;
      microbiota). Volunteers will fill in a food diary and a questionnaire for gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life. The whole study will take approximately 8-10 weeks.&#xD;
