      The purpose of the study twofold: first, a smartphone-based physical activity application&#xD;
      (app), which will be called Fit&amp;Sober, will be developed and tailored specifically for&#xD;
      patients with alcohol use disorders (AUDs); then, the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      short-term increases in physical activity with the use of the Fit&amp;Sober app will be examined&#xD;
      over the course of a 12-week intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) are highly prevalent and a costly public health problem. AUDs&#xD;
      are the third leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. and are associated with&#xD;
      significant negative physical and psychological health consequences, costing the U.S. economy&#xD;
      an estimated $235 billion dollars per year. While progress has occurred in developing&#xD;
      treatments for AUDs, relapse rates are still extremely high, ranging from 60-95% in first&#xD;
      year following treatment. Given the compelling evidence for the benefits of increased&#xD;
      physical activity for physical health, psychological functioning, and drinking outcomes,&#xD;
      efforts to help patients with AUDs adopt and sustain increased levels of physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) are likely to result in significant public health impact. Capitalizing on the advantages&#xD;
      for scalability and dissemination afforded by the use of technology, the investigators will&#xD;
      develop a smartphone-based physical activity application (app), which will be called&#xD;
      Fit&amp;Sober, tailored specifically for patients with AUDs. Although a number of PA apps exist,&#xD;
      the majority suffer from a lack of theory-based concepts known to influence behavior change.&#xD;
      Grounded in Self Determination Theory (SDT) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), the&#xD;
      investigators will develop and tailor the Fit&amp;Sober app for patients with AUDs by designing&#xD;
      features that will help patients develop intrinsic, value-driven goals (e.g., exercising for&#xD;
      benefits related to sobriety) with a focus on increasing the saliency of immediate rewards&#xD;
      associated with PA (e.g., decreased alcohol urges and improved affect). The investigators&#xD;
      propose that why someone exercises makes a difference for long-term PA. Early recovery from&#xD;
      AUDs, when negative affect is a risk for relapse and urges to drink are common, may be an&#xD;
      opportune time to help patients develop internalized, self-determined motivation through&#xD;
      experientially making connections between exercise and acute improvements in affect and&#xD;
      cravings. Smartphone technology offers unique advantages for self-monitoring these changes in&#xD;
      affect and cravings in relation to physical activity. The aims of the proposed study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: App Development and Open Pilot&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. A Mixed-methods approach will be used to develop a tailored, theoretically-driven&#xD;
      smartphone intervention (Fit&amp;Sober App) to help patients in early recovery from AUDs increase&#xD;
      levels of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a. The principles of agile software development will be used to create a prototype of&#xD;
           the app. Feedback obtained through a series of usability studies and focus groups with&#xD;
           patients with AUDs will iteratively inform subsequent versions of the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct an open pilot trial with 20 patients with AUDs in early recovery to determine&#xD;
           the feasibility, acceptability, and short-term increases in PA with use of the Fit&amp;Sober&#xD;
           app. After 12-weeks of app use:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.a. Through self-report measures and qualitative interviews, feedback will be obtained on&#xD;
      use of the Fit&amp;Sober app as well satisfaction with the app, strengths and weaknesses of the&#xD;
      app, any challenges encountered with the app, suggestions for areas of improvement, and&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.b. Through examination of the Fit&amp;Sober metadata, indicators of the extent of app usage&#xD;
      (e.g., days utilized, time spent on the application, components accessed, etc.) will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.c. Through objectively measured PA, short-term increases in physical activity levels will&#xD;
      be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 -- RCT Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a preliminary, randomized controlled trial of the Fit&amp;Sober App compared to&#xD;
           Brief Advice (BA) for Exercise among 160 patients in early recovery from AUDs. We&#xD;
           hypothesize that, compared to BA, Fit&amp;Sober will be associated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Higher levels of short-term (3-month) and long-term (6-,12-month),&#xD;
                objective-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Higher percent days abstinent (PDA) from alcohol and lower levels of depression and&#xD;
                anxiety symptoms at each follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Higher levels of theoretically-relevant, PA-related mediating variables including:&#xD;
                self-efficacy, positive outcome expectancies, and self-determined motivation at 3-&#xD;
                and 6-month follow-ups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the relationship between usage of app features and levels of physical&#xD;
           activity engagement&#xD;
