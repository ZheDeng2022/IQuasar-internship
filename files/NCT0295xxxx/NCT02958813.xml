      This study has three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial comparing IMARA to a family-based health&#xD;
           program (FUELTM). The investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Randomly assign 300 14-18 year-old AA or black girls and their primary female&#xD;
           caregivers to IMARA (N=150) or FUELTM (N=150). Women and girls will be recruited four&#xD;
           ways: 1) from mental health clinics using clinic liaisons, 2) flyers will be posted in&#xD;
           clinic recruitment sites and other agencies instructing interested families to call our&#xD;
           recruiter, 3) IMARA participants will hand flyers to interested women and girls they&#xD;
           know, and 4) COIP field station staff will pass out flyers and recruit interested women&#xD;
           and girls at the field stations and in the community. Investigators will examine the&#xD;
           effects of IMARA on women and girls' sexual behavior at 6- and 12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the impact of IMARA on theoretical mediators posited by the Theory of Gender&#xD;
           and Power and the Social-Personal framework associated with AA women and girls' risky&#xD;
           sex. Investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assess changes in women and girls' Individual Attributes (HIV/AIDS knowledge,&#xD;
                attitudes, and beliefs, mental health/emotion regulation, ethnic identity); Peer&#xD;
                and Partner Processes (partner characteristics, relationship power dynamics, peer&#xD;
                influences, partner communication); and Family Context (mother-daughter&#xD;
                relationship and communication, parental monitoring) at baseline and follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Evaluate mediation and moderation of theoretical mechanisms on women and girls'&#xD;
                sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the impact of IMARA compared to FUELTM on sexually transmitted infections&#xD;
           (STIs). Investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Test women and girls' urine for three common STIs at baseline and 12-month follow&#xD;
                up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Explore linkages between biological outcomes and targeted mediators and moderators&#xD;
                of change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disproportionate rates of mental illness and HIV/STIs among African Americans (AA) reflect&#xD;
      significant health disparities. AAs account for more HIV/AIDS cases, people living with&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS, and HIV-related deaths than any other racial group in the US. In 2004, HIV was the&#xD;
      3rd leading cause of death among Black women, and in 2006, AA women accounted for 66% of new&#xD;
      AIDS cases among women. AA youth ages 13 - 19 comprise approximately 16% of US teens but 69%&#xD;
      of new AIDS cases. Most infections among AA women and girls occur through sexual activity,&#xD;
      and AA girls report more risky sex, less condom use, and lower perceived HIV risk than AA&#xD;
      boys. Racial disparities also exist for AAs in rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis.&#xD;
      Among 15 - 19 year old AA girls, gonorrhea rates are higher than any other race/age/gender&#xD;
      group, and almost half of AA women have an STI. Important linkages exist between HIV/STIs and&#xD;
      mental health; Mental illness is linked to HIV through greater risk taking, poor health&#xD;
      promotion, and reduced effects of behavioral interventions for teens and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-risk factors extend beyond individual women or girls, yet few family-based,&#xD;
      gender-specific, Afrocentric programs simultaneously address AA women, AA girls, mental&#xD;
      health, and the mother-daughter dyad, thereby missing a critical opportunity to address HIV&#xD;
      in a broader social context. Interventions that are sensitive to gender and culture focus on&#xD;
      women (SISTA) or girls (SiHLE) and lack a mental health and family component. Family-based&#xD;
      HIV prevention programs rarely address gender and culture or the adult family member's HIV&#xD;
      risks (Project STYLE). Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated program --&#xD;
      the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls -- capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers&#xD;
      and daughters, and facilitates mutual reinforcement of prevention attitudes and behavior,&#xD;
      thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMARA (Informed, Motivated, Aware, and Responsible about AIDS) blends gender and ethnic&#xD;
      components of SISTA and SiHLE (gender roles, ethnic pride, relationship power) with family&#xD;
      and mental health components from Project STYLE (affect management, parental monitoring,&#xD;
      adolescent development, parent-child communication) to create a culturally relevant,&#xD;
      multi-level, integrated, family-based, HIV and mental health prevention program that&#xD;
      simultaneously targets AA women and their daughters. Based on the Theory of Gender and Power,&#xD;
      the Social-Personal model of HIV-risk, and findings from the investigator's research, IMARA&#xD;
      emphasizes the interplay of family, peer, partner, and individual mechanisms as mediators of&#xD;
      sexual risk taking for women and girls. Pilot testing (N=22 dyads) revealed strong&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability: &gt;95% consent/assent rates, 96% retention at&#xD;
      2-month follow-up, and very positive feedback. Promising outcome data for mothers and&#xD;
      daughters in targeted mediators (e.g., positive attitudes about HIV/AIDS, greater intentions&#xD;
      to use condoms, increased parental monitoring, more open mother-daughter communication, more&#xD;
      relationship power) and sexual risk outcomes (e.g., increased condom use, fewer partners)&#xD;
      justify a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial comparing IMARA to a family-based health&#xD;
           program (FUELTM). Investigators will:&#xD;

           ways: 1) from mental health clinics using clinic liaisons, 2) flyers will be posted in&#xD;
           clinic recruitment sites and other agencies instructing interested families to call the&#xD;
           study recruiter, 3) IMARA participants will hand flyers to interested women and girls&#xD;
           they know, and 4) COIP field station staff will pass out flyers and recruit interested&#xD;
           women and girls at the field stations and in the community. Investigators will examine&#xD;
           the effects of IMARA on women and girls' sexual behavior at 6- and 12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the impact of IMARA on theoretical mediators posited by the Theory of Gender&#xD;
           and Power and the Social-Personal framework associated with AA women and girls' risky&#xD;
           sex. Investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Assess changes in women and girls' Individual Attributes (HIV/AIDS knowledge,&#xD;
                attitudes, and beliefs, mental health/emotion regulation, ethnic identity); Peer&#xD;
                and Partner Processes (partner characteristics, relationship power dynamics, peer&#xD;
                influences, partner communication); and Family Context (mother-daughter&#xD;
                relationship and communication, parental monitoring) at baseline and follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Evaluate mediation and moderation of theoretical mechanisms on women and girls'&#xD;
                sexual behavior.&#xD;

             2. Explore linkages between biological outcomes and targeted mediators and moderators&#xD;
                of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMARA participants will report less risky sex (fewer partners, more consistent condom use,&#xD;
      and later sexual debut among non-sexually active girls) at 6- and 12-months and have fewer&#xD;
      incident STI infections at 12-months; and (b) IMARA participants will report positive changes&#xD;
      in theoretical mediators: individual attributes (more positive condom attitudes,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, ethnic pride), peer/partner influences (more relationship power, partner&#xD;
      communication, and awareness of partner influences on sexual decision making), mental health&#xD;
      (improved emotion regulation and understanding of the links between mental illness and risky&#xD;
      sex), mother-daughter communication (more open and comfortable), and mother-daughter&#xD;
      relationships (more parental monitoring and warmth, less parental permissiveness).&#xD;

    <description>The AIDS-Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA) is a computer-assisted interview of sexual behavior and drug use. The ARBA was derived from five established measures used in large-scale studies to examine HIV/AIDS-risk in youth and adults. The ARBA assesses substance use, sexual behavior, and needle use. Investigators will assess mothers and daughters' condom use, sex with high-risk partners, sex while using drugs/alcohol, number of partners, sexual debut -- and relative frequency and count-based indicators.</description>

    <description>IMARA blends three programs with the most relevance for AA women (SISTA) and girls (SiHLE) and families in psychiatric care (Project STYLE). Separate mother and daughter groups cover parallel content and run simultaneously, and joint activities enhance mothers' credibility as a resource for HIV/STI prevention, practice new communication skills, negotiate conflict, and strengthen the mother-daughter relationship. Activities reinforce the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, and enhance safe sex knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Woven throughout IMARA is the impact of alcohol and drug use on risk behavior, including condom use while high.</description>

    <description>Morning and afternoon sessions begin with an icebreaker and/or poem to enhance ethnic and gender pride. IMARA's goals and motto are presented to emphasize strong mother-daughter relationships, foster sisterhood, build group cohesion, and increase motivation. Ground rules are reviewed, and each woman and girl signs the IMARA pact to confirm her commitment to the program. At the end of day 1, mothers and daughters receive homework for the week. Woven throughout IMARA is the impact of alcohol and drug use on risk behavior, including condom use while high.</description>
