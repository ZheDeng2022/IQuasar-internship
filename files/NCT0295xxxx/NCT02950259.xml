  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is assess the safety and tolerability of the IRX-2 regimen in patients&#xD;
      with early stage breast cancer (ESBC) and to estimate the pathologic complete response rate&#xD;
      to neoadjuvant anthracycline-based and non-platinum containing chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer who have received the IRX-2 Regimen before chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase Ib study conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of an IRX-2&#xD;
      regimen in ESBC, to be administered pre-operatively before standard-of-care surgical&#xD;
      resection and following standard-of-care diagnostic biopsy. This study will also include&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer patients who will receive the IRX-2 regimen prior to&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will have early stage breast cancer of any receptor sub-type, for which&#xD;
      standard-of-care surgical resection is planned. To be eligible, a minimum of 1 core of&#xD;
      tumor-bearing biopsy material must be available for research analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B will enroll subjects triple negative breast cancer (defined by ER&lt;10%, PR&lt;10%, and&#xD;
      HER2-negative by NCCN guidelines), T1c+ tumors for which neoadjuvant anthracycline-based and&#xD;
      non-platinum containing chemotherapy is planned. The IRX-2 regimen will be administered and&#xD;
      completed preceding chemotherapy. Cohort B subjects must undergo post-IRX-2 Regimen biopsy&#xD;
      (2-3 cores), followed by commencement of chemotherapy preferably within one week after&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IRX-2 regimen will be administered in all enrolled subjects. IRX 2 will be administered&#xD;
      by subcutaneous injection into the periareolar skin of the affected breast.&#xD;
