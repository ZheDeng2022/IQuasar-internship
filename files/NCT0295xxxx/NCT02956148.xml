  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure longitudinally the availability of the PDE10A enzyme in&#xD;
      HDGECs using the radioligand [18F]MNI-659. The study will be a follow-up, examining HDGECs&#xD;
      from the CHDIKI1201/PET-HD-PDE10A (NCT02061722) study from 18 to 28 months after the initial&#xD;
      PET measurement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HDGECs will perform 2 study visits: Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 2 (PET analysis&#xD;
      utilizing the radioligand [18F]MNI-659). There will also be 2 telephone follow ups; one after&#xD;
      Visit 1 (telephone follow-up after screening) and one after Visit 2, (telephone follow-up&#xD;
      after PET). Study visits and telephone follow-ups will take place during a maximum of 97&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will receive a single intravenous dose of the radioligand [18F]MNI-659 (investigational medicinal product [IMP]) and undergo PET imaging.&#xD;
The radioligand [18F]MNI-659 will be administered at a dose of less than 5 micrograms, i.e. within the micro dosing concept, and no pharmacological effects are expected.&#xD;
The injected radioactivity of [18F]MNI-659 will be 185 MBq/70 kg of body weight ± 10%.</description>
