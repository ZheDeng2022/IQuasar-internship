    <textblock>
      This study is a study to evaluate the safety of ZPIV. Three dose levels may be evaluated. The&#xD;
      entire duration of each subject's participation is approximately 14 months including&#xD;
      recruitment and collection of data on the safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccine and&#xD;
      samples for the assessment of immunogenicity. This study is expected to take approximately 30&#xD;
      months to complete from initiation through availability of a final report on the primary&#xD;
      outcomes of safety and the secondary outcomes of humoral immunity to ZIKV. The Primary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to 1. Assess the safety and reactogenicity of a homologous prime&#xD;
      boost regimen of ZPIV given at three different dose levels and 2. Compare the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity profile of ZPIV after each vaccination and between dosage groups.&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of ZPIV administered in a homologous&#xD;
      prime-boost regimen to Flavivirus-naïve healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects.&#xD;
      Three dose levels may be evaluated: 5.0 mcg, 2.5 mcg and 10mcg of ZPIV. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive either placebo or ZPIV administered by intramuscular (IM) injection on Days 1 and 29.&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, a vaccination period in which&#xD;
      subjects will receive a prime dose of vaccine on Day 1 followed by a boost on Day 29, and a&#xD;
      follow-up period of 12 months post boost vaccination. The entire duration of each subject's&#xD;
      participation is approximately 14 months including recruitment and collection of data on the&#xD;
      safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccine and samples for the assessment of&#xD;
      immunogenicity. This study is expected to take approximately 30 months to complete from&#xD;
      initiation through availability of a final report on the primary outcomes of safety and the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes of humoral immunity to ZIKV. The Primary objectives of this study are to&#xD;
      1. Assess the safety and reactogenicity of a homologous prime boost regimen of ZPIV given at&#xD;
      three different dose levels, and 2. Compare the safety and reactogenicity profile of ZPIV&#xD;
      after each vaccination and between dosage groups. The secondary objectives of this study are&#xD;
      to 1. Assess the humoral immune response overall and by dosage group to a homologous&#xD;
      prime-boost regimen of ZPIV as determined by kinetics of the immune responses, seroconversion&#xD;
      rates, and peak Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) and to 2. Assess the durability of the humoral&#xD;
      immune response overall and by dosage group to ZPIV at 6 and 12 months after the second&#xD;
      vaccine administration.&#xD;

                  for the out of range value&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be in good health based on the investigator's clinical judgment when considering&#xD;

&#xD;
        Note 1: Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in the&#xD;
        exclusion criteria in a subject with a normal abbreviated physical exam and vital signs. If&#xD;
        the subject has a preexisting condition not listed in exclusion criteria, it cannot meet&#xD;

        of clinical outcome in last 6 months; or 3) involves need for medication that may pose a&#xD;
        risk to subject's safety or impede assessment of adverse events or immunogenicity if they&#xD;

        that it does not include a genitourinary and rectal exam.&#xD;

        normal-variant by investigator. In the event of an abnormal heart rate or blood pressure&#xD;
        due to physiological variation or activity, the subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet&#xD;
        room, and then blood pressure and/or heart rate may be re-measured. Repeated vital signs&#xD;
        may be used to determine eligibility 8. Women of childbearing potential* must have a&#xD;
        negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test immediately&#xD;
        prior to each vaccination&#xD;

             or successful Essure placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of contraception*&#xD;
             from one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccination until at least 60 days after&#xD;

                  independent of user adherence, including long-acting reversible contraception&#xD;
                  (LARC): progestin-releasing subdermal implants and intrauterine devices (IUD), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use effective contraceptive methods, defined by 5-9% failure rate with typical&#xD;
                  use and &lt;1% failure rate with consistent and correct use, including:&#xD;

        prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, combined pill, progestin-only&#xD;
        pill, hormone-releasing transdermal patch or vaginal ring, and depot medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
        acetate injection (Depo-Provera), OR&#xD;

             subjects must agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) from the start of screening&#xD;
             period until at least 60 days after receiving the last vaccination 11. Subjects must&#xD;
             provide concurrent consent at the time of enrollment and 1st vaccination to future use&#xD;
             of stored blood samples to measure immunity to ZIKV&#xD;
