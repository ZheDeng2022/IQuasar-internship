      The purpose of this study is to assess whether inhalation of 7% hypertonic saline (HS) twice&#xD;
      daily for 48 weeks reduces structural lung disease as assessed by computed tomography (CT) in&#xD;
      comparison with inhalation of 0.9% isotonic saline (IS) in preschool children (ages 3 to 6)&#xD;
      with cystic fibrosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several observational studies have shown that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients less than or&#xD;
      equal to 6 years of age have clinically silent airway damage. There is growing interest in&#xD;
      early initiation of therapies to prevent or delay the progression of this lung disease in CF.&#xD;
      In SHIP-CT, the investigators will evaluate treatment effects of HS relative to IS on&#xD;
      measures of structural lung disease obtained from chest CT using a novel scoring system&#xD;
      sensitive to early lung changes, the Perth-Rotterdam Annotated Grid Morphometric Analysis&#xD;
      method for CF (PRAGMA-CF), that quantifies the volume percentage of diseased airways (%Dis),&#xD;
      bronchiectasis (%Bx), and trapped air (%TA). As a secondary evaluation of structural airway&#xD;
      damage, the investigators will use an image analysis system to measure airway dimensions&#xD;
      relative to adjacent arteries (AA-system). Longitudinal changes in CT measures will also be&#xD;
      compared to changes in lung function measured by the lung clearance index (LCI) obtained by&#xD;
      N2 Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) and to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that HS will reduce structural lung disease as assessed by the&#xD;
      PRAGMA-CF computed tomography score relative to IS during the 48-week treatment period among&#xD;
      preschool children with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHIP-CT is a parallel study to SHIP001 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02378467). The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis of SHIP001, which runs in North America, is that compared to IS, HS will&#xD;
      improve the LCI, a measure of ventilation heterogeneity, during the 48-week treatment period&#xD;
      among preschool children with CF. The SHIP-CT study (SHIP002) will use a nearly identical&#xD;
      study design as the SHIP001 study, with similar eligibility criteria and treatment arms, to&#xD;
      determine whether HS reduces structural lung disease as measured by chest computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT), in addition to stabilizing or improving functional outcomes as measured by LCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group trial assessing&#xD;
      structural lung disease in children with CF ages 3 to 5 at enrollment. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive 7% hypertonic saline (treatment arm) vs. 0.9% isotonic saline&#xD;
      (control arm) administered twice daily via jet nebulizer for 48 weeks. Study visits will&#xD;
      occur at screening, enrollment, and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. Parents or the legal&#xD;
      guardian will be contacted at Weeks 1, 4 and 8 to document changes in health status, adverse&#xD;
      events, concomitant medications/treatments, and encourage study treatment compliance. Parents&#xD;
      or the legal guardian will also be contacted approximately every 6 weeks between visit 3, 4,&#xD;
      5, and 6 to address individual issues or concerns related to study treatment or study&#xD;
      participation, and to document changes in health status, medications and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of participant participation will be up to 53 weeks. As enrollment will occur&#xD;
      over approximately 18 months, total duration of the study is expected to be up to 30 months&#xD;
      (18 months enrollment plus 12 months for the last participants to complete study&#xD;
      participation).&#xD;
