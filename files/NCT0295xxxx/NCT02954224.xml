    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common complication in elderly patients following surgery. Patients who develop&#xD;
      delirium after surgery are at increased risk for serious complications, and even death.This&#xD;
      multi-centre randomized controlled trial will enroll elderly patients scheduled for elective&#xD;
      hip/knee replacement surgery.The objective of this trial is to identify obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea using ApneaLink Air and to determine whether auto-titrating CPAP treatment of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea will decrease the incidence of post-operative delirium in elderly&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute and fluctuating change in cognitive function, characterized by poor&#xD;
      attention and disorganized thinking. Recent studies show that patients with obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA) - a sleep disorder characterized by repeated episodes of complete or partial&#xD;
      blockage of the upper airway - are at greater risk to develop delirium. It is estimated that&#xD;
      43% of men and 27% of women aged 50-70 years old have OSA. Elderly individuals with this&#xD;
      condition are often undiagnosed. Unrecognized OSA may be a treatable cause of postoperative&#xD;
      delirium. However, timely access to polysomnography is usually not possible prior to surgery.&#xD;
      This multi-centre randomized controlled trial will enroll elderly patients scheduled for&#xD;
      elective hip/knee replacement surgery. All participants who have given the consent to&#xD;
      participate will be assessed risks of OSA and comorbidity by 3 basic questionnaires-&#xD;
      STOP-Bang, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Charlson Comorbidity index, Cognitive level assess by&#xD;
      Mini-Cog and baseline delirium assessment by CAM. STOP-Bang questionnaire is the validated&#xD;
      questionnaire to screen the patients for OSA. Score of 3 or higher has sensitivity of&#xD;
      detecting OSA of 93% and 100% for moderate and severe OSA respectively. If participant has&#xD;
      STOP-Bang score 3 or higher will have a home sleep study with the ApneaLink Air and overnight&#xD;
      oximetry. Patients identified to have OSA(AHI â‰¥10/h) will be randomized to 1) Auto-titrating&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied 1-3 nights before surgery (if possible)&#xD;
      and during day/night sleep for 72 hrs after surgery or 2) Control group - routine care. All&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for delirium for 72h after surgery.&#xD;
