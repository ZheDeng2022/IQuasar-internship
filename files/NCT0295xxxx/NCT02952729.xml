  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b trial is an open label, multi-center study of XMT-1522 administered as an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The dose escalation part of the study will&#xD;
      establish the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose for in patients with&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer and either a HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of at least 1+&#xD;
      using a validated IHC assay or with evidence of HER2 amplification. Patients with HER2&#xD;
      positive (by IHC or amplification) gastric cancer or nonsmall cell lung cancer may also be&#xD;
      eligible for participation in dose escalation. Upon completion of dose escalation, the cohort&#xD;
      expansion segment of the study will consist of four parallel cohorts of different patients&#xD;
      groups to confirm the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended Phase 2 dose and estimate the&#xD;
      objective response in each of the patient populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation segment of the study utilizes a 3+3 design. Initially, 3 patients will be&#xD;
      dosed at each dose level. The first 3-week cycle of treatment constitutes the dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) evaluation period. If none of the 3 patients experience a DLT during the&#xD;
      evaluation period and the Safety Review Committee agrees this was a reasonably well tolerated&#xD;
      dose, 3 patients will be enrolled at the next dose level. However, in the event of 1 DLT, 3&#xD;
      additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. Any dose level with 2 or more&#xD;
      DLTs will be considered to have exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and subsequent patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled at lower dose levels. After the first cycle, patients may continue to&#xD;
      receive XMT-1522 until disease progression as long as the drug is well-tolerated and patients&#xD;
      continue to derive clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the dose escalation, the expansion segment will enroll the patients with&#xD;
      the following kinds of cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Advanced breast cancer, HER2 IHC 1+, or HER2 IHC 2+ without HER2 gene&#xD;
           amplification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Advanced breast cancer, HER2-positive, who have received prior ado-trastuzumab&#xD;
           emtansine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Advanced gastric cancer, HER2-positive, who have received prior trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer, HER2 IHC 2+ or 3+, any HER2 gene&#xD;
           amplification or mutation status&#xD;
