  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with&#xD;
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer which has spread to other places in the body.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels measured using cancer personalized&#xD;
      profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) with radiographic tumor assessments using Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 criteria in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate PD-L1 assessment on pre-treatment tumor samples with objective response using&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 criteria in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) using RECIST v1.1 criteria in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST v1.1 in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      treated with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      non-squamous NSCLC.&#xD;
