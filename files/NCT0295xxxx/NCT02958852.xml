      A Clinical Trial to Compare Efficacy and Tolerability of Atorvastatin in Addition to&#xD;
      Endocrine Treatment with Focus on Mechanisms of Resistance to Endocrine Treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, open-labelled, phase II trial in the first and second-line metastatic treatment&#xD;
      setting, comparing standard endocrine treatment (aromatase inhibitor (AI)) with endocrine&#xD;
      treatment plus atorvastatin (1:1). Upon progression in the first line setting, and as part of&#xD;
      the translational studies on mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy, the patients will&#xD;
      receive second line endocrine treatment using fulvestrant. Upon progression to first line&#xD;
      treatment, patients that were receiving atorvastatin will stop this treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women with confirmed ER positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer, including&#xD;
             locally advanced stage IV disease, requiring systemic endocrine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;

          4. Metastatic disease must be radiologically or clinically assessable, by means of at&#xD;
             least one of the following techniques: clinical examination, computerized tomography&#xD;
             (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scintigraphy or positron emission&#xD;
             tomography (PET). Bone metastases alone are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pre-menopausal patients must consent to undergo either surgical or chemical castration&#xD;
             during the duration of the treatment and utilize an effective contraception barrier&#xD;
             method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient not willing to undergo study specific biopsy from the metastatic site should&#xD;
             preferably have enough metastatic tumor sample material archived to perform RNA&#xD;
             extraction from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must be capable and willing to grant signed informed consent prior to any&#xD;
             procedure related with this study as well as to allow access to FFPE biopsies for RNA&#xD;
             extraction and for serial circulating tumor cells capture. Biopsy of the metastatic&#xD;
             site upon progression is not mandatory but desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Signed informed consent according to International Conference on Harmonization /Good&#xD;
             Clinical Practice, and national/local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients currently on first-line treatment with an AI for metastatic breast cancer who&#xD;
             cannot participate on the first part of the treatment (taking lowering cholesterol&#xD;
             drugs, or already on AIs for metastatic disease when study is opened) can be eligible&#xD;
             to enter on the second part to study mechanisms of resistance to fulvestrant once they&#xD;
             have progressed to AI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients that progress while taking AI as adjuvant treatment, have confirmed hormone&#xD;
             receptor+ metastatic breast cancer and are not deemed suitable for first line AI will&#xD;
             also be eligible to enter directly in the second part of the study and be treated with&#xD;
             fulvestrant up-front.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous treatment for metastatic breast cancer (previous systemic treatment for early&#xD;
             breast cancer allowed), unless being considered for direct entry to the second part of&#xD;
             the study with fulvestrant (see inclusion criteria 9 and 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Brain as the only site of metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ongoing treatment with statins (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin,&#xD;
             lovastatin, pravastatin, or rosuvastatin), anion-exchangers (e.g. colestyramin or&#xD;
             colesevelam), fibrates (e.g. gemfibrozil), nicotin-acids (or acipimox) or inhibitors&#xD;
             of intestinal cholesterol uptake (e.g.ezetimibe ) for the first part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of hepatic dysfunction (alanine aminotransferase level more than three times&#xD;
             the upper limit of the normal range) or renal dysfunction (creatine kinase level) more&#xD;
             than three times the upper limit of the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known coagulation disorders or treatment with a 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative is an&#xD;
             exclusion criterion for the fulvestrant treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment with anticoagulants other than 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives or antiplatelet&#xD;
             drugs. Patients in treatment with heparin can interrupt treatment 24h prior to&#xD;
             biopsies and resume treatment 12h after biopsy has been performed. In case of patients&#xD;
             treated with clopidogrel or salicylates, they should be able to interrupt treatment&#xD;
             5-7 days before biopsy and resume 24h after.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of hemorrhagic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Untreated psychiatric disorders that will impair the patient's ability to comply with&#xD;
             study treatment or protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biological composition to either of the study drugs.&#xD;
