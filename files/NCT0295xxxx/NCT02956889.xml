      This is a Fleming-A' Hern, single arm, multicenter, no-profit, phase II study of radiotherapy&#xD;
      and Vismodegib in adult patients with high risk or locally advanced basal cell carcinoma not&#xD;
      amenable to radical surgery cell carcinoma (BCC) (comparator: not applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment period is expected to be approximately 24 months. The trial will consist of a&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline period (Day -28 to -1), a Treatment Period when patients will be treated&#xD;
      with radiotherapy (4 weeks) followed by Vismodegib 150 mg/die continuously for six cycles (24&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end 14 months after start of treatment of the last patient enrolled and&#xD;
      evaluable according to primary end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the activity of the study therapy (radiotherapy followed&#xD;
      by six cycles of Vismodegib 150 mg/d continuously) in terms of proportion of patients&#xD;
      progression free at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are: to evaluate the efficacy of the study therapy in terms of&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); to assess the response in terms of&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR) (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease&#xD;
      (SD), progressive disease (PD)); to assess duration of response (DoR); to assess the safety&#xD;
      in terms of incidence, type, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs) ;to measure the effects of skin disease on quality of life (QoL) of patients under&#xD;
      therapy (Skindex-16)&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Previous radiotherapy on other BCC&#xD;

             upper limit of normal (ULN)Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN or within 3 × ULN for patients&#xD;
             with documented Gilbert syndrome. Adequate renal function, defined by calculated serum&#xD;
             creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum pregnancy test within 7days&#xD;
             prior to commencement of dosing is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Women of child-bearing potential must use two methods of acceptable contraception&#xD;
             including one highly effective method and a barrier method, as directed by their&#xD;
             physician, during treatment and for at least 24 months after completion of study&#xD;
             treatment. Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as those which result&#xD;
             in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly (e.g., implants, injectables, combined oral contraception, or intra-uterine&#xD;
             devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
             may include total abstinence. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, and post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods&#xD;

             being treated with Vismodegib, and for 2 months after completion of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Agreement not to donate blood or blood products during the study and for at least 24&#xD;
             months after completion of study treatment (Vismodegib).&#xD;

             of study treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Concurrent non-protocol-specified anti-tumor therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, other&#xD;
             targeted therapy, photodynamic therapy, including participation in an experimental&#xD;
             drug study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Metastatic BCC&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Gorlin Syndrome or any other contraindication to radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;

             participation in another experimental drug study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Uncontrolled medical illness, including advanced malignancies, at the discretion of&#xD;
             the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or&#xD;
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation&#xD;
             of the results of the study or renders the patient at high risk for treatment&#xD;
