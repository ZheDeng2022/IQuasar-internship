      This study evaluates the immunogenicity of adding inactivated influenza vaccine with southern&#xD;
      hemisphere (SH) formulation to standard once-annual influenza vaccination with northern&#xD;
      hemisphere (NH) formulation in older adults in Hong Kong over 9 years. Half of participants&#xD;
      will receive twice-annual influenza vaccination with NH and SH formulation, while the other&#xD;
      half will receive once-annual influenza vaccination with NH formulation and a placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hong Kong is located in subtropical regions with two seasonal peaks of influenza&#xD;
      transmission. North Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine is usually available for&#xD;
      vaccination by general public starting in October every year before the anticipated winter&#xD;
      peak starting in December in Hong Kong, and it presumably also provides protection against&#xD;
      the same prevailing strains during summer peak starting around July of the next year.&#xD;
      However, influenza vaccines may have poorer efficacy and effectiveness in older adults. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that in a subtropical or tropical location with prolonged&#xD;
      circulation of influenza viruses, including the emergence of new strains at different times&#xD;
      of the year, twice-annual vaccination with the latest available strains could provide the&#xD;
      best protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To test the immune profiles over time of older adults following twice-annual influenza&#xD;
      vaccination against those receiving once-annual influenza vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: An immunogenicity study with a randomized placebo-controlled design&#xD;
      among 400 older adults aged 70-79 years. The investigators will enroll participants from the&#xD;
      general community who attend general outpatient clinics for influenza vaccination or medical&#xD;
      or preventive care visits. Eligible individuals will be randomly allocated in equal&#xD;
      proportions to two intervention groups (I: once-annual standard inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine; II: twice-annual standard inactivated influenza vaccine) consisting of ten rounds of&#xD;
      vaccination as designated by the intervention group before each winter/summer influenza&#xD;
      season and followed throughout the 5 years. *In August 2021 we extended the study for a&#xD;
      further 4 years (9 years in total) through to August 2025, with the same study design.*&#xD;
      Before each summer influenza season those in group II will receive the inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine with the southern hemisphere formulation and the other group will receive saline&#xD;
      placebo. For each round of vaccination (or placebo), blood samples for immunological tests&#xD;
      will be collected before administration and 30 days after administration among all&#xD;
      participants, and at 7, 30 and 91 days after administration in a subset of 25% of the&#xD;
      participants. Acute illnesses among participants will be monitored by active surveillance&#xD;
      during influenza seasons. The vaccine formulations in each round of vaccination will be&#xD;
      updated for each season according to WHO recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: Antibody titres measured by haemagglutination-inhibition assays, which&#xD;
      is an established correlate of protection, in addition to other measurements on humoral and&#xD;
      cell-mediated immune responses in the two intervention groups each round.&#xD;

    <description>The difference in antibody titres of participants measured by haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay, evaluated by (1) the proportion of participants who achieve a target rise in antibody titre against each of the vaccine strains at 30 days, and (2) the geometric mean titre (GMT) ratios between the two groups against each of the vaccine strains at 30 days and 182 days. (The targeted rise in antibody titre is defined as the percentage of subjects with either a pre-vaccination HAI titre &lt;10 and a post-vaccination HAI titre ≥40, or a pre-vaccination HAI titre ≥10 and a minimum four-fold rise in post-vaccination HAI antibody titre.)</description>
