  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the commonest cancer in men in the Western world, with over&#xD;
      40,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United Kingdom (UK). Research studies have&#xD;
      identified several genetic changes that are thought to increase the risk of developing&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Some of these genetic changes occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair&#xD;
      genes. The BARCODE 2 trial is formed of two parts that aim to investigate how having genetic&#xD;
      changes in DNA repair genes can affect response to carboplatin treatment in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In part 1 of the study, the&#xD;
      investigators will invite men with mCRPC who have not had genetic testing before to join the&#xD;
      study by initially undergoing genetic screening within the study. The DNA repair gene&#xD;
      mutation carrier status of enrolled patients will be assessed using a gene panel. If a&#xD;
      pathogenic mutation is confirmed in one of these genes, patients will be given the option to&#xD;
      proceed to part 2 of the study. In part 2 of the study, men with mCRPC who are known to be&#xD;
      carriers of a mutation in DNA repair gene(s) will be assessed for eligibility for treatment&#xD;
      on the study with carboplatin chemotherapy. The aim of the study will be to determine how&#xD;
      patients with mCRPC and a germline mutation in a DNA repair gene(s) respond to platinum&#xD;
      chemotherapy. This study will help researchers to investigate platinum sensitivity of&#xD;
      prostate tumours that have developed due to a germline mutation in a DNA repair gene. This&#xD;
      study will provide data to use in a larger clinical trial of platinum chemotherapy based on&#xD;
      patients' germline genetic signature and/or tumour genetic profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      BARCODE 2 is a single arm, single site phase II trial with the aim to determine the response&#xD;
      rate to two cycles of platinum chemotherapy in patients with mCRPC and a germline mutation in&#xD;
      a DNA repair gene. Response will be measured with prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and&#xD;
      radiological assessment. The study will be divided into two parts. In part 1 of the study,&#xD;
      the DNA repair gene mutation carrier status of enrolled patients will be assessed using a&#xD;
      gene panel. Men who are found to carry a pathogenic mutation or are already known to carry a&#xD;
      germline mutation can enrol in part 2 of the study and be offered treatment with carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility and Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mCRPC which has progressed after docetaxel and abiraterone or enzalutamide may&#xD;
      be assessed for eligibility for study entry. Patients who have completed treatment with or&#xD;
      are currently undergoing cabazitaxel chemotherapy are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will be assessed according to the part 1 and/ or part 2 inclusion&#xD;
      criteria depending on which part of the study they enter initially (see inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria further below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given the latest ethically approved BARCODE 2 participant information&#xD;
      sheet (PIS) for their consideration. Patients will only be asked to consent to the study&#xD;
      after they have had sufficient time to consider the trial, and the opportunity to ask any&#xD;
      further questions. Patients who have not had previous genetic testing will sign the part 1&#xD;
      consent form to undergo genetic profiling for a germline mutation in a DNA repair gene.&#xD;
      Patients who are found to have a pathogenic mutation in part 1 or who are already known to&#xD;
      carry a germline mutation must sign the part 2 consent form prior to undergoing part 2 study&#xD;
      related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to consent to their full name being collected at trial entry in&#xD;
      addition to their date of birth, hospital number, postcode and National Health Service (NHS)&#xD;
      number or equivalent to allow linkage with routinely collected NHS data and ensure accuracy&#xD;
      in handling biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will ensure that all participants' personal identifier information is kept on a&#xD;
      separate log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will retain trial documents in strict confidence. Investigators will maintain&#xD;
      the confidentiality of participants at all times and will not reproduce or disclose any&#xD;
      information to third parties by which participants could be identified (without consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Protection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comply with all applicable data protection laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may discontinue from the trial at any time at their own request, or they may be&#xD;
      discontinued from trial treatment at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI).&#xD;
      Reasons for discontinuation will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical or radiological disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable toxicity (e.g. unresolving grade â‰¥2 neuropathy or neutropenia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other reason deemed appropriate by investigator. Increases in PSA will not be a&#xD;
           criterion for treatment discontinuation in the absence of clinical or radiological&#xD;
           progression. Participants who discontinue treatment should continue to be followed up&#xD;
           until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up data will be collected on all patients entering part 2 of the study until death,&#xD;
      including cause of death. Participants who discontinue treatment should continue to be&#xD;
      followed up until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation from Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient withdraws from further follow-up, a trial deviation form should be submitted to&#xD;
      Oncogenetics Team stating whether the patient has withdrawn consent for information to be&#xD;
      sent to the Oncogenetics Team or whether they simply no longer wish to attend trial follow up&#xD;
      visits. In the very rare event that a patient requests that their data is removed from the&#xD;
      study entirely, the implications of this should be discussed with the patient first to ensure&#xD;
      that this is their intent and, if confirmed, the Oncogenetics Team should be notified in&#xD;
      writing. If this request is received after results have been published the course of action&#xD;
      will be agreed between the Sponsor and Independent Data Monitoring and Steering Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Trial Management Group (TMG) will be set up and will include the Chief Investigator, the&#xD;
      Trial Statistician and Trial Manager. Key study personnel will be invited to join the TMG as&#xD;
      appropriate to ensure representation from a range of professional groups, including a PI from&#xD;
      a Participant Identification Centre (PIC). Membership will include a lay/consumer&#xD;
      representative who will receive support and training as deemed necessary. The TMG will meet&#xD;
      at regular intervals, and at least annually. The TMG have operational responsibility for the&#xD;
      conduct of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Data Monitoring and Steering Committee (IDMSC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A joint Independent Data Monitoring and Steering Committee (IDMSC) will be set up to oversee&#xD;
      the safety of the trial participants, monitor the data produced by the trial, put these data&#xD;
      into overall context and supervise the progress of the trial towards its interim and overall&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication and Data Sharing Policy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, on behalf of all&#xD;
      collaborators. Anonymised data can be applied for via the Data Access Committee.&#xD;
