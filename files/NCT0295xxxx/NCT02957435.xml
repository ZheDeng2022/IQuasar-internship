      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile of the formulation of&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of eplerenone coated tablets of 25mg, 50mg and 100mg (2 coated&#xD;
      tablets of 50mg) in fasting administration. Sample size is 12 subjects, male and female, aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 50 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, unicenter study with three periods, three treatments and one sequence.&#xD;
      Each subject will receive the following treatments at the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period 1: one coated tablet of eplerenone 25mg in fasting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period 2: one coated tablet of eplerenone 50mg in fasting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period 3: two coated tablets of eplerenone 50mg (100mg of eplerenone) in fasting&#xD;
           Formulations will be administered in a single dose, orally in each period. Trial&#xD;
           subjects will be admitted in three different periods of 24 hours each, when&#xD;
           investigational product will be administered and blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
           pre-determined periods of time for pharmacokinetics evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of formulations of eplerenone coated&#xD;
      tablets of 25mg, 50mg and 100mg (two coated tablets of 50mg) in healthy subjects under&#xD;
      fasting condition. As a secondary objective, it will be also evaluated the safe and&#xD;
      tolerability of coated tablets of eplerenone.&#xD;
