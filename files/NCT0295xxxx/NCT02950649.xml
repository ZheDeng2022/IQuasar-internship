  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to assess the impact of pre-operative use of non-invasive&#xD;
      hemodynamic monitoring technologies on improving peri-operative and post-operative care of&#xD;
      moderate to high-risk surgical patients with poor functional status by improving the&#xD;
      detection of reduced cardiovascular function.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the impact of using a non-invasive technology to assess flow&#xD;
      guided parameters (SV,SVR, dp/dt, CO, etc.) on patient care decisions in the preoperative&#xD;
      settings. Patients seen in the preoperative clinic who are undergoing a moderate or high-risk&#xD;
      procedure and have less than 4 metabolic equivalents (METs) will be approached to participate&#xD;
      in the study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented, the device will be placed during the preoperative clinic visit and the data&#xD;
      will be presented to the care team. Surveys will be completed by the health care provider for&#xD;
      each consented patient to determine if the data from the device positively impacted patient&#xD;
      care decisions. Specifically, the survey will evaluate if providing information on the&#xD;
      patient's cardiovascular function (via the device used for this study) facilitated the health&#xD;
      care provider to identify if the patient had reduced cardiovascular function. For the primary&#xD;
      outcome, this study will evaluate if this device can assistant the identification of patients&#xD;
      with reduced cardiovascular function by providing the flow guided parameter listed above.&#xD;
      Secondary markers include the evaluation of perioperative complication rate (composite&#xD;
      outcome ) between those that had the non-invasive HD data displayed to the preoperative team&#xD;
      vs. not. Additional secondary makers will include: frequency of intraoperative hemodynamic&#xD;
      optimization and goal directed fluid therapy administration, health care provider survey&#xD;
      results, patient survey on the level of discomfort from wearing the cuff during the study.&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, length of intensive care stay, readmission to the hospital within 30&#xD;
      days after hospital discharge, and 30-day postoperative mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data will be collected using the electronic medical records database available at the&#xD;
      investigators institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the hope of the investigators that this study will demonstrate that by simply applying&#xD;
      the preoperative use of the non-invasive hemodynamic technologies one can:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. more appropriately identify which patients would benefit from intraoperative hemodynamic&#xD;
           monitoring strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. increase satisfaction of the preoperative assessment by the health care provider&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. further validate the importance of caring for patients with knowledge of their volume&#xD;
           status, contractility, and vascular resistance in other patient care settings.&#xD;
