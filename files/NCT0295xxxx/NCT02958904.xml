      Method: Observational study of 44 men with spinal cord injury, age above 18 years, injury&#xD;
      time more than six months, sexually active and accompanied in Recife referral hospitals. The&#xD;
      degree of neurological impairment was assessed using the revised version in 2011 ASIA&#xD;
      Impairment Scale (AIS), depressive symptoms were detected by the Beck Depression Inventory,&#xD;
      and the evaluation of sexual function was obtained through the Erectile Function of&#xD;
      International Index (IIEF). Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis to assess the&#xD;
      association were applied, with 0,05 significance level.&#xD;
