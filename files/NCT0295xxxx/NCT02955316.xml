  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the overall prevalence of IBS medically&#xD;
      diagnosed and diagnosed using Rome III or IV criteria in GI adult outpatients in China.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, nationwide and cross-sectional study carried out in China, covering 30&#xD;
      sites and 3000 patients totally. As for the ratio of tertiary to secondary general hospitals&#xD;
      is approximately 1:4 in China, 6 tertiary and 24 secondary hospitals will be randomly&#xD;
      selected in this study.To adapt the representativeness of the data with the operational&#xD;
      feasibility, 30 tertiary and 120 secondary hospitals will be randomly selected over the 6&#xD;
      geographic regions (north, northeast, east, south central, southwest and northwest). Among&#xD;
      those, 1 tertiary and 4 secondary hospitals in each region will be further selected based on&#xD;
      GI department setup, willingness to participate in the study, capability and primary&#xD;
      investigator's consideration. Within participated hospitals, subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      consecutively from all the outpatients of GI department to minimize selection bias. 3000&#xD;
      subjects will be allocated to tertiary and secondary hospitals with a ratio of 1:1. In&#xD;
      general, 250 subjects will be enrolled from tertiary hospitals and 250 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled from secondary hospitals for each region. During the subject enrolment, the&#xD;
      investigator will firstly explain the purpose of the study to consecutive GI patients and&#xD;
      written informed consents will be obtained. Then qualified patients will be given a&#xD;
      questionnaire and finish it during waiting time. After receiving questionnaires, IBS&#xD;
      diagnosis will be made by investigators based on Rome III or Rome IV IBS diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified as medically diagnosed with IBS if they have been diagnosed by&#xD;
      their clinicians. And subjects will be classified as IBS sufferers without medical diagnosis&#xD;
      if they satisfy Rome III or Rome IV diagnostic criteria and have not received IBS diagnosis&#xD;
      from physicians. For IBS patients, either medically diagnosed or diagnosed with IBS criteria,&#xD;
      investigators will collect all the information on demographic features, disease&#xD;
      characteristics and current treatment status. For non-IBS patients, only demographic&#xD;
      information will be collected.&#xD;
