      The aim of this study is to compare the ball attachment to the locator attachment regarding&#xD;
      the OHRQoL (oral health related quality of life) for completely edentulous patients retaining&#xD;
      a mandibular overdenture with a midline placed implant&#xD;

      The selected patients will be informed of the nature of the research work and informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained for each one of them. Only motivated patients who showed&#xD;
      co-operation will participate in the study. Patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional upper and lower complete dentures will be constructed before installing the&#xD;
      implant where the lower denture will be duplicated into a radiographic stent. CBCT (cone beam&#xD;
      computerized tomography) with lower radiographic stent in place stabilized with the upper&#xD;
      denture using a rubber base index, will be taken to know the available bone height &amp;width to&#xD;
      determine the optimum implant size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive single implant in symphyseal region of mandible. The surgical procedure&#xD;
      is carried out under local anaesthesia, following premedication with 2 g amoxicillin (or&#xD;
      600mg of clindamycin) and 1 g paracetamol. After two rinses with 0.2% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      gluconate, each lasting 1 min, the labial and lingual mucosa of the anterior mandible is&#xD;
      locally infiltrated with 2.2 ml of mepivacaine 2% with 1 : 100,000 adrenalin. The surgical&#xD;
      guide made from the duplicated mandibular complete denture is used to mark the implant site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A crestal incision will be performed and a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap is raised to&#xD;
      expose the anterior mandible. Deep dissection of this flap lingually exposes the cortical&#xD;
      plate of the mandible and any lingual concavities. Sequential drilling &amp; implant placement&#xD;
      will be the next step. The implant position is adjusted to the midline of the mandible and&#xD;
      optimum labiolingual positioning and bone levelling is performed as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A healing abutment is selected to be 2mm above the mucosa. The mucosa is adjusted and sutured&#xD;
      with interrupted sutures (3-0 silk). Postoperatively, the patient should rinse with 0.2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash for 2 weeks. Immediately following implant surgery,&#xD;
      generous relief of the existing mandibular complete denture is carried out and a tissue&#xD;
      conditioner is applied to the undersurface of the denture. The patient leaves after the&#xD;
      surgical operation wearing both the complete maxillary denture opposed by the&#xD;
      tissue-conditioned mandibular complete denture. A period of 8 weeks will be allowed for&#xD;
      healing and osseointegration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, patients will be recalled for implant loading. The interventional group will receive&#xD;
      locator and the control group will receive a standard Ball attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locator attachment and a ball and socket attachment were randomly assigned to each patient&#xD;
      using a computer generated randomization table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In (Group I) The healing abutment was first removed and the gingival collar irrigated with&#xD;
      0.12% chlorhexidine. The locator attachment was inserted into the implant fixture and torqued&#xD;
      to 30 N cm, leaving the attachment base protruding at least 2 mm above the tissue surface.&#xD;
      The denture surface of the denture was further relieved to increase the spaces surrounding&#xD;
      the attachment assembly and to accommodate the self-curing denture base resin. The denture&#xD;
      was inserted after the relief space was filled with resin, and the patient was guided to&#xD;
      occlude at centric occlusion. The denture was removed after the resin was cured and adjusted&#xD;
      accordingly to assure a comfortable fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In (Group2) Patients will receive a standard ball abutment instead of the locator abutment,&#xD;
      however the procedures are the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size If there is truly no difference between two groups then 22 patients are required&#xD;
      to be 80% sure that the limit of a two sided 90% confidence interval will exclude a&#xD;
      difference in means more than 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was done by Sealed Envelope Ltd. 2012&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fresh Patient attending in the outpatient clinic in faculty of oral and dental medicine&#xD;
           Cairo University will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient from last year records in the outpatient clinic in faculty of oral and dental&#xD;
           medicine Cairo University will be contacted by phone and recalled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another eligibility examination will be made the researcher and Research will be discussed&#xD;
      with all patients and only motivated patient will join the research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sequence generation Is done by computer on the internet by random.org which gives true&#xD;
           random numbers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized: Computer generated allocation sequence, enrollment and assignment of the&#xD;
      participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Outcome assessor will be blinded as well as the data analysts for the primary&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would not be possible to blind the participant or the care provider or the assessor for&#xD;
      the second outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the primary and secondary outcome will be collected at the day of the surgery and&#xD;
      after 3 months on loading of implant and after 6 and 9 months. All data will be saved&#xD;
      digitally twice on two separate computers by researcher and the house officer and revised by&#xD;
      the supervisor at the end of the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant files are to be stored in numerical order and stored in computer of the removable&#xD;
      prosthodontic department&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using IBM (International Business Machines) SPSS advanced statistics&#xD;
      (statistical package for social sciences), version 21 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Numerical data&#xD;
      will be described as mean and standard deviation or median and range. Categorical data will&#xD;
      be described as numbers and percentages. Data will be explored for normality using&#xD;
      kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro Wilk test. Comparison between two groups for normally&#xD;
      distributed numeric variables will be done using the student's t-test while for non normally&#xD;
      distributed numeric variables will be done by Mann-Whitney test. Comparisons between&#xD;
      categorical variables will be performed using the chi square test. A p-value less than or&#xD;
      equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All tests will be two tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring: data monitoring committee is independent from the sponsor &amp; competing&#xD;
      interest. None of the supervisors or the researcher has any conflict of interest with Locator&#xD;
      producing companies and is a member of the speaker panel of any company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harm: Any complication with implant placement will be reported &amp; managed in the usual way.&#xD;
      There is minimal risk of harm associated with the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing: will be independent from the investigator, with every time the data is collected&#xD;
