  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being offered participation in this pirfenidone trial because They have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (FHP), a type of interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease (ILD). This is a disease where scarring of lung tissue occurs as the result of&#xD;
      inhaling substances called antigens. These antigens can be substances such as molds,&#xD;
      chemicals or dust. As a result of this scarring the lungs are is not able to move oxygen into&#xD;
      the bloodstream to reach other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently over 1400 subjects have been treated with pirfenidone in 15 clinical trials. This&#xD;
      drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in Idiopathic&#xD;
      Pulmonary Fibrosis, a different type of ILD, but requires special permission for use in your&#xD;
      condition. The use of pirfenidone has not been approved for the treatment of FHP. It is&#xD;
      considered experimental treatment in this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits and the safety of treatment&#xD;
      with pirfenidone compared to placebo in subjects with FHP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SUMMARY This study will include about 42 subjects at National Jewish Health. This is a&#xD;
      &quot;double-blind study&quot; which means neither the subject nor the study staff will know if the&#xD;
      subject is getting pirfenidone or placebo during the study. This is done to be sure that no&#xD;
      one knows who is getting pirfenidone or placebo and the effects of the treatment can be&#xD;
      measured objectively, without bias. Subject's that enroll in this study will have an equal&#xD;
      chance of getting pirfenidone or placebo. The decision about which treatment the subject will&#xD;
      receive (randomization) is made through a central organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the study will receive either pirfenidone (2403 mg every day) or placebo capsules&#xD;
      (a safe, inactive substance that will look the same as the pirfenidone capsules). Both the&#xD;
      placebo and pirfenidone will be supplied in opaque, hard, white gelatin capsules and will be&#xD;
      taken as 3 capsules by mouth, 3 times a day (a total of 9 capsules per day) and should be&#xD;
      taken with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who participate in this study will be asked to take the capsules as prescribed every&#xD;
      day for 52 weeks (12 months).&#xD;
