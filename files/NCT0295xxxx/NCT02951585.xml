  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections, also known as viscosupplementation, are a&#xD;
      treatment option for knee osteoarthritis that serves to restore the decreasing rheological&#xD;
      properties of synovial fluid. KARTILAGE® CROSS is a visco-elastic gel of highly purified&#xD;
      reticulated hyaluronic acid. It contains mannitol to provide an anti-oxidative action and to&#xD;
      avoid hyaluronic acid depolymerization. Reticulation and mannitol increase the residency time&#xD;
      of the product in the joint cavity then allowing a single injection in painful knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US food and drugs administration (FDA) and European medicine agency (EMA), have recently&#xD;
      published guidelines recommending a higher level of integration of biomarkers in the&#xD;
      development and testing of new drugs to advance decision-making on dosing, time and treatment&#xD;
      effect, trial design, and risk/benefit analysis. Biomarkers can be used not only in the&#xD;
      process of drug development, but also in the future in assessment of individual patient's&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several soluble biomarkers have been identified as potential candidates to predict or monitor&#xD;
      the efficacy of intervention. Coll2-1, a degradation product of type II collagen, and&#xD;
      Coll2-1NO2, a nitrated form of the Coll2-1 peptide have been studied in human osteoarthritis&#xD;
      and entered the qualification process. Evidences demonstrated them to be pertinent and to be&#xD;
      foresee as markers used for the diagnosis, the prognosis, the burden of disease and the&#xD;
      monitoring of a treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to provide with the first kinetic data regarding biomarkers in&#xD;
      painful knee osteoarthritis patients treated with a new reticulated hyaluronic acid. The&#xD;
      effects of the treatment were compared to those of saline solution. The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      a specific osteoarthritis biomarker, Coll2-1. The secondary endpoints were the effects of the&#xD;
      treatment or placebo on other biomarkers of osteoarthritis, its clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerance&#xD;
