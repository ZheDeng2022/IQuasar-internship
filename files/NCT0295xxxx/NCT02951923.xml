  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bovine colostrum is the milk produced by cows immediately after calving. It contains high&#xD;
      levels of proteins that improve immune protection and may act to prevent colds. During&#xD;
      intense training, athletes often have compromised immune function. This may be especially&#xD;
      true in club-level rugby players who abruptly start high intensity training in the spring in&#xD;
      preparation for their competitive season. Our study will assess the effects of supplementing&#xD;
      these players with bovine colostrum during this intense training. Thirty-six players will be&#xD;
      recruited; half will consume colostrum during the 8 weeks of early-season training and half&#xD;
      soy protein. The investigators predict the bovine colostrum supplement will improve health&#xD;
      during the training and increase fitness levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bovine colostrum is the first milk secreted by cows after calving. Colostrum is high in&#xD;
      protein and contains a number of bioactive substances including growth and antimicrobial&#xD;
      factors. Antimicrobial factors in bovine colostrum include immunoglobulin and a variety of&#xD;
      other less specific antimicrobial proteins and peptides. Immunoglobulin and other&#xD;
      antimicrobials are important for immune system function. This is important to athletes&#xD;
      because intense exercise training can compromise the immune system; therefore bovine&#xD;
      colostrum has potential to improve exercise performance by preventing immune system&#xD;
      dysfunction that is common during periods of heavy exercise training .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies of colostrum supplementation show its potential for increasing human&#xD;
      exercise performance. The mechanism through which colostrum acts to benefit performance&#xD;
      remains unclear. Similarly, further studies are required to elucidate colostrum-induced&#xD;
      effects in individuals of different ages and levels/intensity of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main growth factor in bovine colostrum is insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Bovine&#xD;
      colostrum supplementation in young individuals increased IGF-1 levels. Insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor-1 stimulates growth of muscle tissue and is important in maintaining muscle mass and&#xD;
      function in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bovine colostrum supplementation has been shown to increase lean tissue (muscle mass) in&#xD;
      younger individuals. Eight to 12 weeks of bovine colostrum supplementation during a&#xD;
      resistance training program increased lean tissue mass by 1.5 to 2 kg compared to increases&#xD;
      of 0 to 1.2 kg while on whey protein supplementation. We have also recently shown that bovine&#xD;
      colostrum supplementation increases muscular strength compared to similar amounts of&#xD;
      supplementation with whey protein in men and women over 50y.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examining the effects of colostrum in rugby players presents a unique scientific opportunity&#xD;
      because of the nature of their training regime. Rugby players' early season workouts are the&#xD;
      most stressful training sessions of the season (after the winter break they must condition&#xD;
      quickly for the start of the season with few if any pre-season games and their workouts&#xD;
      involve repeated sprint activity in addition to weight training). Rugby players would be most&#xD;
      susceptible to overtraining and immune system depression during this time of the year. Bovine&#xD;
      colostrum with its high levels of anti-microbials and other bioactive factors may be&#xD;
      beneficial to mitigate the deleterious effects of early, high intensity training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed internship study is to determine the effects of 8 weeks of&#xD;
      bovine colostrum supplementation, compared to soy protein supplementation in rugby players&#xD;
      during early season training.&#xD;
