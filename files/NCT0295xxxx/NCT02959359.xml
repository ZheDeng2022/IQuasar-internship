      For early stage of HCC, surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the mainstay&#xD;
      curative treatments. However, recurrence is still a major issue after the surgery or RFA.&#xD;
      Only selected patients are eligible and tolerable to IFN-based treatment after surgical&#xD;
      resection and the sustained virological response varied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harvoni for genotype 1 HCV and sovaldi plus ribavirin for genotype 2 HCV can achieve high SVR&#xD;
      and being recommended by AASLD and EASL. Mixed HCV genotype infection accounts for 10% of CHC&#xD;
      patients in Taiwan. Sovaldi-based treatment plus ribavirin should be as effective as Sovaldi&#xD;
      plus rivavirin in the treatment of genotype 2 HCV, as well as mixed genotype 1 and 2 HCV&#xD;
      infection. As genotype 1 and 2 are the leading HCV genotypes in Taiwan, It can simplify the&#xD;
      regimen of anti-HCV treatment in Taiwan by using Harvoni plus ribavirin, not only for&#xD;
      genotype 1 and 2 HCV but also for mixed genotype 1 and 2 HCV infection. Although an&#xD;
      unexpected high recurrence rate in HCC patients under DAA treatment was reported once.&#xD;
      However, one recent study showed a low risk of HCC recurrence after DAA treatment. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators plan to enroll 130 HCV-HCC patients after confirming curative&#xD;
      treatment for their HCC, either by surgery or RFA. For the cases fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, a 12 weeks Harvoni plus ribavirin treatment will be provided&#xD;
      for all cases (single armed design). The primary objective of the study is annual&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival after curative resection of HCV-HCC for up to 5 years. A&#xD;
      hospital-based cohorts of HCV-related HCC undergoing surgical resection or RFA from Taipei&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC). For early stage of HCC, surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the&#xD;
      mainstay curative treatments. However, recurrence is still a major issue after the surgery or&#xD;
      RFA. According to our previous report, the cumulated recurrence rate for small HCV-HCC was&#xD;
      72.4% at 5 year. PEG-interferon plus RBV treatment is the standard of care for chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C (CHC) in Taiwan. NHIRD data showed that PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment can reduce 12%&#xD;
      of recurrence rate in 5 years (64% vs 52%) after curative resection of HCC. However, only&#xD;
      selected patients are eligible and tolerable to IFN-based treatment after surgical resection&#xD;
      and the sustained virological response varied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harvoni for genotype 1 HCV and sovaldi plus ribavirin for genotype 2 HCV can achieve high SVR&#xD;
      and being recommended by AASLD and EASL. All-oral regimen, being more tolerable and effective&#xD;
      for HCC patients after curative treatment than IFN-based treatment. Mixed HCV genotype&#xD;
      infection accounts for 10% of CHC patients in Taiwan. Sovaldi-based treatment plus ribavirin&#xD;
      should be as effective as Sovaldi plus rivavirin in the treatment of genotype 2 HCV, as well&#xD;
      as mixed genotype 1 and 2 HCV infection. As genotype 1 and 2 are the leading HCV genotypes in&#xD;
      Taiwan, It can simplify the regimen of anti-HCV treatment in Taiwan by using Harvoni plus&#xD;
      ribavirin, not only for genotype 1 and 2 HCV but also for mixed genotype 1 and 2 HCV&#xD;
      infection. Although an unexpected high recurrence rate in HCC patients under DAA treatment&#xD;
      was reported once. However, one recent study showed a low risk of HCC recurrence after DAA&#xD;
      treatment. Harvoni is an all-oral regimen, being more tolerable and effective for HCC&#xD;
      patients after surgery than IFN-based treatment. The all oral regimen would be beneficial in&#xD;
      eradicating HCV viral load and subsequently reduce the risk of recurrence after curative&#xD;
      resection of HCV-HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to enroll 130 HCV-HCC patients after confirming&#xD;
      curative treatment for their HCC, either by surgery or RFA. For the cases fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, a 12 weeks Harvoni plus ribavirin treatment will be provided&#xD;
      for all cases (single armed design). The primary objective of the study is annual&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival after curative resection of HCV-HCC for up to 5 years. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the study are SVR 4/12/24 by DAA, regression of fibrosis, incidence of&#xD;
      liver-related complications (EV bleeding, ascites) after DAA treatment, and overall survival&#xD;
      for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hospital-based cohorts of HCV-related HCC undergoing surgical resection or RFA from Taipei&#xD;
      Veterans General Hospital and Investigated Sites will be recruited as historical controls.&#xD;
      The historical controls include HCV-HCC undergoing curative treatment without Peg-interferon&#xD;
      plus ribavirin treatment (cohort 1) or with Peg-interferon plus ribavirin treatment (cohort&#xD;
      2) after curative treatment (surgical resection or RFA) for HCC.&#xD;
