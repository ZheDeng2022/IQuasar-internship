      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of transthoracic electrical cardioversion&#xD;
      for restoration of sinus rhythm in patients who present with recent onset atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, with regard to new silent cerebral thrombo-embolic lesions and cognitive&#xD;
      function, as well as electrical and functional/structural reverse remodelling, and its&#xD;
      effects on inflammatory changes / specific cardiac biomarkers, vasoactive peptides,&#xD;
      coagulation activity, and active fibrinolysis.&#xD;

      Working plan This study will give information about the incidence of silent cerebral&#xD;
      thrombo-embolic events in patients with recent onset AF, a population which is expected to&#xD;
      consist mostly of paroxysmal AF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than 48 hours and fulfilling inclusion&#xD;
      and not exclusion criteria will be included in the study by a cardiologist on the day of&#xD;
      cardioversion, and study nurse will be notified to plan for the investigations. The patient&#xD;
      will undergo clinical examination, clinical history will be taken and blood sampling. Once 12&#xD;
      lead ECG, echocardiography, questionnaires, telemetry and MR have been done the patient will&#xD;
      be electrically cardioverted After the cardioversion the patient will be subject to&#xD;
      echocardiography of the heart again, blood-sampling, 12 lead ECG, and MR brain. The patient&#xD;
      is discharged but will be studied by echocardiography of the heart and MR brain again on day&#xD;
      7 - 10. Thereafter the patient will be followed for 30 days - see flowchart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of cardioversion is defined as Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;

      ventricular diastolic function (transmitral velocities, E/E' index)53-56 O Echocardiographic&#xD;
      data will be collected and stored in the routinely used database of the department of&#xD;
      Clinical Physiology and as raw images in a separate database dedicated for the study (in the&#xD;
      care of the investigators) for offline review and measurements. The Core lab in Uppsala will&#xD;
      do all analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O Time of collection: prior to cardioversion, within 24 h after cardioversion and at day 7 -&#xD;

&#xD;
      High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (Nt-proBNP) will be measured as sensitive and specific markers of cardiac injury ⁄ strain ⁄&#xD;
      filling pressures and B-type natriuretic peptide levels correlate with AF burden in patients&#xD;
      with lone AF and is a strong predictor of recurrent arrhythmia after ablation. (A stable&#xD;
      fragment of vasoactive peptide, C-terminal -proendothelin-1 will be measured because of its&#xD;
      relation recurrence of AF, which may be a risk factor for embolism and because of its&#xD;
      possible role in the pathogenesis and recurrence of AF, and the association with atrial&#xD;
      dilatation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy, which may contribute to AF persistence and embolism)&#xD;
      C-Reactive protein (CRP) Interleukin-662-65 Routine blood tests: (Hb, Platelets, White blood&#xD;
      cell count, Na, K, Creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), thyroid-stimulating&#xD;

&#xD;
      4. Statistical analysis, sample size, data handling This pilot study will give information&#xD;
      about the incidence of silent cerebral thromboembolic events and associated clinical&#xD;
      variables that may affect the outcome, in patients with recent onset AF who are expected to&#xD;
      mainly suffer from paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous reports of patients undergoing MRI before and after AF ablations, the % of&#xD;
      patients with chronic cerebral lesions detected on MRI at baseline varies widely from 4 to 79&#xD;
      %, with 10 % being the most representative figure for patients with paroxysmal AF. Previous&#xD;
      observations have reported varying frequencies of new silent cerebral lesions on MRI after AF&#xD;
      ablation (4-38 %), coronary angiography (10 %) and retrograde aortic catheterisation of&#xD;
      patients with aortic valve stenosis (22 %). New asymptomatic cerebral ischemic lesions in&#xD;
      patients undergoing AF ablation have been reported after the use of irrigated radiofrequency&#xD;
      (RF) catheters (7-11 %), the most common routine ablation procedure, and even a higher&#xD;
      frequency of lesions (37 %) using a specialized circular RF ablation catheter. Based on these&#xD;
      observations the investigators argued that a 20 % increase in incidence of new asymptomatic&#xD;
      cerebral ischemic lesions in patients undergoing DC cardioversion would be clinically&#xD;
      significant and warrant alternative routines for cardioversions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of sample size Considering a 20% increase (i.e. from 10% at baseline to 30%) in&#xD;
      incidence of silent cerebral lesions following electrical cardioversion, the required number&#xD;
      of patients to reject the null-hypothesis with 90% power and at the 0.05 significance level&#xD;
      (two-sided) is 35. To allow for drop-outs, 40 patients will be included in the study. The&#xD;
      sample size calculations were performed in the software &quot;nQuery Advisor&quot; version 7.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is reasonable to perform a pilot study of 40 patients, in order to get an indication of&#xD;
      the number of silent cerebral events. A total of 70 patients will be screened to ensure that&#xD;
      40 patients will remain in sinus rhythm at least 7 days after cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be reported as counts and percentages, whereas continuous&#xD;
      variables as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges, as&#xD;
      applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between clinical variables (qualifying history duration of AF, AF duration,&#xD;
      CHADS2VASC score, biomarkers, conversion to sinus rhythm, left atrial function and left&#xD;
      atrial volume), confounding variables and incidence of new silent cerebral ischemic lesions&#xD;
      at Day 1 and 7-10 post MR will be tested in a multiple logistic regression model, using a&#xD;
      stepwise selection procedure (p&lt;0.05). The model will be validated using bootstrapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of new silent cerebral ischemic lesions will be modelled as poisson or negative&#xD;
      binomial regression models, as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Median concentrations of the biomarkers will be compared with baseline levels by&#xD;
      nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal- Wallis test when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between biomarker concentrations and new embolic lesion will be evaluated&#xD;
      over a follow up period 7 -10 days. The association between baseline concentration of each&#xD;
      biomarker and new embolic lesion will be assessed by univariable Cox proportional hazards&#xD;
      models. Biomarkers will be modelled as continuous variables (expressed as 1 SD increment) as&#xD;
      linearity of the hazard will be tested by appropriate transformation using restricted cubic&#xD;
      splines to account for possible nonlinear relationships. Cox multivariable models will be&#xD;
      performed to evaluate the independent prognostic value of each biomarker separately;&#xD;
      adjusting for baseline covariates emerged as statistically significant from a stepwise&#xD;
      selection procedure (p &lt; 0.05). The investigators will also investigate whether the addition&#xD;
      of different combinations of the biomarkers improve the discrimination of the model. The&#xD;
      independent prognostic value of each biomarker on new embolic lesion will be assessed by&#xD;
      univariable and multivariable Cox models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each biomarker measured at baseline, Day 1 before and immediately after DCC, at discharge,&#xD;
      after 7 - 10 days, and 1 months will be analysed graphically over time at the patient level&#xD;
      as well as by summary statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All probability values are two-tailed, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated.&#xD;
      Because of the exploratory nature of this study, adjustments for the multiplicity of&#xD;
      statistical analyses will not be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2-sided P-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Clinical Significance It is of paramount importance to assess if electrical cardioversion&#xD;
      performed within 48 hours after AF onset, without preceding oral anticoagulation, results in&#xD;
      silent strokes, as it is the present clinical routine and no scientific data is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 20 % increase in incidence of new asymptomatic cerebral ischemic lesions in patients&#xD;
      undergoing DC cardioversion is in this study defined as clinically significant. If other&#xD;
      cardioversion strategies can be identified that result in 10 % lower incidence of events,&#xD;
      that figure may then be regarded as clinically significant.&#xD;
