  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifetime sexual trauma (ST) (i.e., behaviors that range from unwanted sexual touching to&#xD;
      attempted or completed rape) is a significant social and public health problem among women&#xD;
      Veterans. For women Veterans, lifetime ST can occur prior to, during or after military&#xD;
      service. ST is associated with multiple difficulties and risks, including posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD), intimate partner violence (IPV), and alcohol misuse. Providing an&#xD;
      effective, integrated, and low-cost intervention that targets ST-related risks for women&#xD;
      Veterans with lifetime ST would advance clinical care for these vulnerable women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will develop and assess a computer-delivered intervention (Safety and Health&#xD;
      Experiences Program; SHE) that will provide a screening and brief behavior intervention for&#xD;
      women Veterans with any lifetime ST. More specifically, the intervention, SHE, will address&#xD;
      interrelated health concerns for women Veterans with ST (i.e. alcohol misuse, IPV, and PTSD).&#xD;
      SHE will be designed to provide individualized assessment, feedback, and referrals for women&#xD;
      Veterans with any lifetime ST. SHE will take place within a primary care setting. Primary&#xD;
      care visits are frequent points of health care contact for women Veterans making the visit&#xD;
      itself the ideal, and possibly only, opportunity to provide behavioral interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will lay the groundwork for a larger clinical trial of the SHE program in multiple&#xD;
      VA primary care settings. If effective, the intervention, SHE, represents an innovative and&#xD;
      low cost service for early identification and intervention that could be implemented&#xD;
      nationwide with ease and speed to address the needs of women Veterans with lifetime ST. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of the project is to make a significant impact on advancing health services&#xD;
      research by introducing and testing a novel and potentially powerful service tool that may&#xD;
      improve service delivery to address the co-occurring health concerns for women Veterans with&#xD;
      any lifetime ST.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VA Women's Health Research Agenda underscores the importance of improving the safety and&#xD;
      health outcomes of returning Veteran women. With greater numbers of women joining the&#xD;
      military, the need for gender-specific VA-based interventions is increasingly important.&#xD;
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), intimate partner violence (IPV), and alcohol use are&#xD;
      closely interrelated and significant concerns for women Veterans with a history of sexual&#xD;
      trauma (ST). Given that screening for military sexual trauma (MST) is mandated within VAs, a&#xD;
      computer delivered intervention has the potential to be easily integrated into the standard&#xD;
      of care for women who screen positive for MST and/or other lifetime STs, increasing the&#xD;
      identification of high-risk women Veterans. This intervention will provide a computer-based&#xD;
      intervention on a VA issued laptop that could improve delivery service and fill a healthcare&#xD;
      gap for a vulnerable Veteran population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of the project is to make a significant impact on advancing health&#xD;
      services research by introducing and testing a novel and potentially powerful service tool&#xD;
      that may improve service delivery to address the co-occurring health concerns for VA women&#xD;
      with lifetime ST. The intervention, Safe and Healthy Experiences (SHE), a brief modular,&#xD;
      computer-based intervention, will target interrelated health risks for women Veterans with&#xD;
      lifetime ST (i.e. alcohol misuse, IPV, and PTSD). SHE will provide individualized assessment,&#xD;
      feedback, and referrals for women Veterans with lifetime ST. The intervention is based on&#xD;
      motivational interviewing (MI), a well-defined intervention strategy that has yielded&#xD;
      particularly promising results in a range of clinical issues, including interpersonal&#xD;
      violence, and a range of patient populations, including male and female Veterans. MI is a&#xD;
      collaborative and non-confrontational approach that emphasizes increasing a participant's&#xD;
      awareness of successful steps towards well-being. MI is consistent with an empowerment model,&#xD;
      which is a highly recommended intervention model for victimized women and both MI and an&#xD;
      empowerment model converge on important principles for intervening with victimized women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from the study will provide the necessary groundwork to examine the efficacy of SHE&#xD;
      in a future, large clinical trial. If the SHE intervention is found to be feasible,&#xD;
      acceptable and efficacious in improving outcomes for women Veterans with lifetime ST, the&#xD;
      ultimate goal would be for the program to be integrated into clinical care and widely&#xD;
      disseminated. There are two phases of research directed toward these aims: 1) develop and&#xD;
      refine an integrated screening and behavior intervention for VA women with lifetime ST in a&#xD;
      brief modular computer-based format that can be administered in a VA primary care setting,&#xD;
      and 2) collect data on the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention in improving the health of VA women, and increasing utilization of treatment and&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop the preliminary computer-based intervention, incorporating information gained in&#xD;
           informant interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform a small open trial (n = 20) of SHE to assess feasibility of recruitment of&#xD;
           target population and acceptability of intervention and study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conduct an initial randomized control trial in a sample of 150 women Veterans who screen&#xD;
           positive for lifetime sexual trauma (ST) and have at least one risk factor (i.e., screen&#xD;
           positive for intimate partner violence (IPV), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),&#xD;
           and/or heavy drinking) to demonstrate the feasibility of SHE and the acceptability of&#xD;
           SHE via participant report of ease of use, helpfulness, and overall satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine preliminary evidence for the hypotheses that, relative to the control condition,&#xD;
           screening and referral only (SR), SHE will result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Decreases in the number of risks (i.e., heavy drinking (4+ drinks on one occasion),&#xD;
                screen positive for PTSD, screen positive for IPV) at the 2- and 4-month follow-up&#xD;
                (primary).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Increases in resource and treatment utilization over the 2- and 4-month follow-up&#xD;
                period (secondary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be used to demonstrate whether the effects of the intervention look promising&#xD;
      to support a future large-scale randomized control trial and to suggest, in concert with&#xD;
      results from clinical trials in related fields, the range of effect sizes that would be&#xD;
      reasonable to expect in a future trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-site study. At the Providence, RI based site (Women and Infants Hospital and&#xD;
      Brown University), the specialized computer-based assessment and interactive intervention&#xD;
      sessions will be developed and designed and staff members will also assist with data&#xD;
      management. The Central Texas VA Healthcare System site will be the data collection site and&#xD;
      the main site for participant recruiting, consenting, enrollment, intervention and follow-up.&#xD;
      Staff at the two sites will work collaboratively throughout the project to supervise study&#xD;
      staff, for reporting to the DOD and IRB's and in designing the assessment and intervention&#xD;
      sessions, however, only the study staff at the Central Texas site will have access to&#xD;
      participant PHI.&#xD;
