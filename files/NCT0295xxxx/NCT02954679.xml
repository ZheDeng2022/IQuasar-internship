      This descriptive and declarative study will help to find out consumption rates, all&#xD;
      psychoactive substances taken together, among 18-25 year olds. More specifically, it will&#xD;
      allow assessment of the extent of the cognitive enhancement phenomenon among students in&#xD;

      cognitive performance).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This descriptive and declarative study will help to find out consumption rates, among 18-25&#xD;
      year olds, all psychoactive substances (PAS) taken together. More specifically, it will allow&#xD;
      assessment of the extent of the cognitive enhancement phenomenon among students in France&#xD;
      (including study of misuse of methylphenidate (MPH) and modafinil, two drugs diverted from&#xD;
      their indications for improvement of cognitive performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Faculties of Sciences and Technics of Physical and Sports Activities (UFR STAPS) are&#xD;
      involved in the study, the issue of doping in Sports will also be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this national study will be to assess for two successive academic years the&#xD;
      proportion and motives of consumption of PAS as part of cognitive enhancement among students&#xD;
      in real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims will be: assessing consumption of PAS and desired effects when such&#xD;
      consumption beyond cognitive enhancement (experimental, recreational, abusive or therapeutic&#xD;
      use) but also comparing PAS uses in terms of a variety of characteristics (sex, age, field,&#xD;
      year of study) and finally to consider more broadly the health of students in a doping&#xD;
      behavior (impact of the use of products on health, whether cognitive enhancement is found to&#xD;
      be ethically acceptable or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted during a period of 3 years, between September 2016 and September&#xD;
      2019, according to a standardized methodology identical in every school involved and a&#xD;
      procedure based on an online self-administrated and anonymous survey questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaire, elaborated on Limesurvey®, will be available for two successive academic years&#xD;
      for all students aged more than 18 years old. It is set up and hosted on a secured&#xD;
      high-capacity web server via the website of AP-HP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also search to assess the level of representation of the sample of respondents&#xD;
      regarding the general population of students. Various criteria: the proportion of subjects by&#xD;
      field, the proportion of respondents by study year and the sex ratio will be compared to data&#xD;
      of general statistics from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education. A representative&#xD;
      sample will allow us to assimilate our respondents to the general population of students and&#xD;
      estimate the prevalence of PAS consumption among students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each product, a descriptive analysis of frequency will be done (consumption pattern,&#xD;
      consumer's opinion, feeling of dependency, efficacy of the product). For those most&#xD;
      frequently used, complementary analysis will be done in order to identify particular&#xD;
      profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the statistical level, univariate analysis will be performed using the Chi-square test and&#xD;
      analysis of variance. Then, multivariate analysis will allow us to study independent factors&#xD;
      such as age and study year for instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of respondents expected is approximately 30 000. The sample will also allow us to&#xD;
      identify factors associated with PAS consumption (MPH or modafinil particularly) by&#xD;
      multivariate modeling using a &quot;split&quot; of the sample procedure with one half used for the&#xD;
      construction of the model and the other for its validation.&#xD;
