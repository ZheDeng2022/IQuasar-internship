      Phase I, open label, non-randomized, multicenter, prospective dose escalation study of F16IL2&#xD;
      in combination with very low-dose cytarabine in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia relapse&#xD;
      after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine a recommended dose for F16IL2 in AML relapse after&#xD;
      alloHSCT and investigating the toxicity of the combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled sequentially in cohorts and treated at different dose levels of&#xD;
      F16IL2 and a fixed dose of cytarabine. All patients first receive an initial run-in dose of&#xD;
      30 Mio IU of F16IL2 on day 1 and escalating doses of F16IL2 on day 1, 8, 15 and 22. Patients&#xD;
      will be treated with cytarabine (5 mg twice daily s.c. for 10 days). The following F16IL2&#xD;
      administration will be at the dose of the respective cohort (days 8, 15 and 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RD will be defined following a traditional 3+3 design. The dose escalation will continue&#xD;
      until the MTD is found, that is until at least two patients among a cohort of three to six&#xD;
      patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) (i.e., &gt;33 % of patients with a DLT). The&#xD;
      RD is defined as the dose level just below the MTD level. If the MTD is not found at cohort 5&#xD;
      the RD for this study will be considered equal to the cohort 5 dosage.&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Presence of active and uncontrolled infections or other severe concurrent disease,&#xD;
