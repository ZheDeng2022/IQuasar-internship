    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give pembrolizumab after&#xD;
      radiation therapy in treating patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      uses high energy radiation to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab after radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab administered after radiation&#xD;
      therapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who have not undergone&#xD;
      extrapleural pneumonectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess progression-free and overall survival (progression free survival [PFS] and&#xD;
      overall survival [OS], respectively) in patients receiving pembrolizumab after radiation&#xD;
      therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate biomarkers of interest, including cytokines, measurements of T-cell&#xD;
      activation, and serum exosome micro ribonucleic acid (RNA)s with the delivery of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab after radiation therapy for MPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1: Patients undergo hemithoracic radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2: Patients undergo palliative radiation therapy over 1-3 weeks to only the region of&#xD;
      palliation (a region that does not include the entire side of the chest or thorax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After radiation therapy, both cohorts receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over about 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks for&#xD;
      48 weeks, then every 12 weeks for up to 5 years.&#xD;
