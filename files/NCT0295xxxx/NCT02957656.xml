    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of one dose of H7N9&#xD;
      pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (H7N9 pLAIV) followed by AS03-adjuvanted H7N9&#xD;
      pandemic inactivated influenza vaccine (H7N9 pIIV).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of one dose of H7N9 pandemic live&#xD;
      attenuated influenza vaccine (H7N9 pLAIV) followed by AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 pandemic&#xD;
      inactivated influenza vaccine (H7N9 pIIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults who will choose which study group to join. Participants&#xD;
      in Group 1 will receive one dose of H7N9 pLAIV in an inpatient setting at study entry (Day&#xD;
      0). They will remain in an isolation unit through at least Day 9. They will also receive one&#xD;
      dose of AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV on Day 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 will receive one dose of AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV at study entry&#xD;
      (Day 0) and a second dose of AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV at Day 84. Participants in Group 3&#xD;
      will receive one dose of AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 pIIV at study entry (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend multiple study visits through Day 264. Study visits may include&#xD;
      blood collection, physical examinations, and nasal wash and nasal wick procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These three groups will be compared to two historical control groups who received one dose of&#xD;
      H7N9 pLAIV at study entry (Day 0), one dose of H7N9 pLAIV at Day 28, and one dose of&#xD;
      unadjuvanted H7N9 pIIV at Day 84.&#xD;
