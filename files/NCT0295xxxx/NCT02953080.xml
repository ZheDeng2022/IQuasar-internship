  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current estimates point towards a huge increase in the number of people that are eligible to&#xD;
      start ART in Uganda and globally. As many of the newly eligible patients are largely&#xD;
      asymptomatic, there are concerns about adherence and retention of these individuals and&#xD;
      especially those starting ART with a higher CD4 counts. Urgent information is required to&#xD;
      plan for implementation of most recent WHO and National guidelines in the most cost effective&#xD;
      manner as well as maximizing retention of HIV positive individuals in care and achieving&#xD;
      virological suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to undertake research designed to see if investigators can optimize&#xD;
      adherence, virological outcomes and HIV knowledge, in order to give an overall increased&#xD;
      quality of life in vulnerable populations starting or established on ART in Kampala, Uganda.&#xD;
      The investigators will test implementation of an open source software-based tool to send text&#xD;
      messages and to give access to an interactive voice response system using patients' mobile&#xD;
      phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' aim to undertake an open labelled randomised trial at two sites: the IDI&#xD;
      which is an urban centre of excellence in HIV care, and Kasangati Health Centre, which is a&#xD;
      peri-urban public health care facility. The project aims to enrol HIV positive patients&#xD;
      starting ART, already established on first line ART or switching to second line ART,&#xD;
      including special populations (pregnant women, discordant couples and young people). The&#xD;
      estimated length of the project is 30 months. The technology to be evaluated in this study is&#xD;
      based on CONNECT FOR LIFETM m-health technology (CFL2015.01 or higher), which provides text&#xD;
      messages or Interactive Voice Response (IVR) functionalities, and allows a computer to&#xD;
      interact with humans through the use of voice and tones input via keypad and offers pill&#xD;
      reminders, clinic visit reminders, health tips and support symptom reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective is to determine the effect of the CFL2015.01 tool on quality of life of HIV&#xD;
      patients receiving care at IDI and Kasangati HCIV. At the start of the intervention, all&#xD;
      patients will undergo quality of life assessment, which will be repeated at months 6, 12, 18&#xD;
      and 24 months. The scores will be compared to assess the effect of the tool on quality of&#xD;
      life. The Secondary Objectives are virological outcomes baseline, 6, 12,18 and 24 months,&#xD;
      retention in care, aversion of early treatment failure, disease knowledge, clinic attendance&#xD;
      and cost analysis.&#xD;

      CALL FOR LIFE UGANDATM Janssen Global Public Health Research and Development, in close&#xD;
      collaboration with the Infectious Disease Institute Kampala (IDI), has developed Call for&#xD;
      Life Uganda tailored to the needs of PLHIV in Uganda. Call for Life UgandaTM is based on the&#xD;
      CONNECT FOR LIFETM technology (CFL2015.01 or higher version) and the MOTECH platform, an open&#xD;
      source platform developed by Grameen Foundation and the University of Southern Maine with&#xD;
      financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and was released under the&#xD;
      terms of the MOTECH open source license agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients consenting will; At enrolment receive detailed information from a&#xD;
      nurse/counsellor on the Call for Life UgandaTM system and how it operates Receive calls or&#xD;
      text messages from Call for Life UgandaTM will include recording of self-reported adherence&#xD;
      (soliciting active feedback via keypad) and symptom management triggering alerts for the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES Screening The subjects will be screened and enrolled over a period of 6&#xD;
      months These are the screening procedures oAll consecutive eligible patients will be&#xD;
      approached for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oFor patients interested in participating the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oThe patients will receive information about the study by the study nurse or counselor&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in the study will sign the informed Follow-up Visit The&#xD;
      participants will come to the clinic monthly or 2 monthly to pick up their ART and&#xD;
      concomitant medications (non-study visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will come for their study follow up visits every 6 months Every 6 months The&#xD;
      patients will be assessed by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study doctor will collect General Medical History and perform Physical Examination&#xD;
           and enter it in an electronic CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The counsellor will collect the Quality of life and Knowledge questionnaires and enter&#xD;
           them in an electronic CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, 6, 12,18 and 24 months the following samples will be collected;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Storage plasma (1 aliquot) serum (3 aliquots)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional procedures Resistance testing: It will be done on stored samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Resistance testing will be carried out if subsequent viral failure in order to&#xD;
           investigate transmitted resistant virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological samples will also be stored at 6, 12,18 and 24 months and resistance testing&#xD;
           carried out in case of viral load &gt;1,000 copies/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or&#xD;
      they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety or&#xD;
      behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required&#xD;
      schedule of study visits or procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY ASSESSMENT Safety monitoring for this study will focus on unanticipated problems&#xD;
      involving risks to participants, including unanticipated problems that meet the definition of&#xD;
      a serious adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS Based on a pre and post ART assessment in Burkino Faso and&#xD;
      Uganda, it is anticipated that the quality of life score (MOS-HIV) in ART na√Øve patients will&#xD;
      increase at least by 15 points for physical health summary (PHS) between baseline and 12&#xD;
      months ART use. We estimate there will be an additional 5 points improvement in those&#xD;
      receiving C4LTM which would give 20-point improvement for those on C4LTM and 15 points for&#xD;
      those not on call for Life. In those already on ART, investigators estimate an improvement&#xD;
      for those established on ART with a 5-point improvement for those on C4LTM and nil for those&#xD;
      not accessing C4LTM. We also estimate a 5-point increase in mental health score in those&#xD;
      receiving C4LTM compared to no change in those without C4LTM starting ART, and a lower&#xD;
      improvement of 2 points in mental health score in those already on ART. The study is powered&#xD;
      on the PHS for QOL. For a power of 0.9 and precision of 0.05 we would need a minimum of 273&#xD;
      in each arm (overall 546) patients, if the mean PHS among patients with C4L was 58.2 compared&#xD;
      to 55.2 among patients without C4L. The investigators will include a 10% LTFUP/mortality rate&#xD;
      to give a sample size of 600.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition of the study participants is estimated as 300 patients at Kasangati and 300&#xD;
      patients at IDI. With the proposed sample size, the numbers above depict over 90% power to&#xD;
      test even the smallest differences in mean PHS at 12 months in the group of patients with and&#xD;
      without C4L. The investigators also anticipate that it is possible to detect changes in MHS&#xD;
      QOL with this sample Analysis of Primary Endpoint Scales to measure quality of life For this&#xD;
      study we have chosen to use the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS-HIV) Health Survey which is the&#xD;
      most widely used health related HRQoL measure in PLHIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MOS-HIV scale was chosen because it has been validated in various settings including&#xD;
      Uganda, has a Luganda language version, and was found to be useful in assessing HRQoL in&#xD;
      PLHIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MOS-HIV measures HRQoL in 11 areas: health perceptions, bodily pain, physical function,&#xD;
      role function, social function, mental function, vitality, health distress, cognitive&#xD;
      function, QoL, and health transition. One scores scale in a range from 0-100 with a higher&#xD;
      score implying better health (41). In addition to these subscales, a Physical Health Summary&#xD;
      score (PHS) and Mental Health Summary score (MHS) can be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra patient in QoL scores will be compared using Paired T-tests and overall change will be&#xD;
      investigated. The effect of calendar time on QoL life scores will be accounted for during&#xD;
      analysis. Furthermore, the changes and or effect of the intervention on different sub-groups&#xD;
      of HIV positives patients will be carried. The effect of the intervention will also be&#xD;
      compared between IDI and Kasangati sites. All analysis will be conducted using STATA, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators will assess perceptions and attitudes to the Call for Life UgandaTM tool&#xD;
           thorough focus group discussions and Key informant interviews, targeting each special&#xD;
           population. We will use purposeful sampling and will continue until no new themes&#xD;
           emerge. We will use NVIVO software for coding of themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost analysis along with the study evaluation; appropriate and detailed cost evaluation&#xD;
           will also be performed. It is anticipated that if the intervention is proved effective,&#xD;
           a cost effective analysis would contribute to developing a sustainable scale up strategy&#xD;
           for similar service across Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADOMISATION Patients will randomly be assigned to either one of the two arms, that is, with&#xD;
      and without CFL. To ensure that all patients in each of the arms are represented and equally&#xD;
      balanced out in both arms, the study will use stratified randomization where each of the&#xD;
      categories of patients at the start of the study will form the strata on interest. Within&#xD;
      each stratum, the patients will be randomly assigned to C4L or no C4L. Randomization lists&#xD;
      will be generated by an independent statistician and kept under lock and key in the two&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA PRIVACY Any and all data generated in IDI's use of Call for Life UgandaTM shall be owned&#xD;
      solely by IDI. Therefore, IDI will take all reasonable steps to restrict disclosure of&#xD;
      personal data including patient-identifiable to third parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following Security Measures are in place to protect Patient's privacy when&#xD;
      using Call for Life UgandaTM&#xD;
