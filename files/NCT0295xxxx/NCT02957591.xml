      Recent research demonstrates that the composition of the gut microbiome is a master regulator&#xD;
      of key neurophysiological processes that are affected in depression. Indeed, contemporary&#xD;
      studies showed that faecal microbiota is altered in patients with major depressive disorder&#xD;
      (MDD). Furthermore, it has also been shown that supplementation of probiotics ameliorated&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in unmedicated patients with mild to moderate depression. However, no&#xD;
      study has yet explored the efficacy of a probiotic-based therapy in patients with severe MDD&#xD;
      in addition to a standard antidepressant treatment. As dietary and lifestyle interventions&#xD;
      may be a desirable, effective, pragmatical and non-stigmatizing prevention and adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy (in addition to antidepressant treatment) in depression, this project is aimed at&#xD;
      investigating for the first time if probiotic supplementation compared to a placebo treatment&#xD;
      improves the effect of standard antidepressant medication on depressive symptoms (i.e. better&#xD;
      and faster remission) in patients with severe MDD. Furthermore, this study will further test&#xD;
      if probiotic supplementation modulates immune signalling and inflammatory processes&#xD;
      (macrophage migration inhibitory factor and interleukin 1 beta),&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis responses (saliva cortisol), neurogenesis&#xD;
      (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression), the release of appetite-regulating&#xD;
      hormones (leptin and ghrelin), the composition of gut microbiota (in particular levels of&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae, Alistipes and Faecalibacterium) and brain perfusion, structure and&#xD;
      activation and if these changes are associated with the probiotic-induced effect on&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a recurrent and debilitating mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence&#xD;
      of up to 20% in the general population, among the highest for psychiatric disorders. Its&#xD;
      diagnosis is based upon the presence of persisting affective, cognitive and behavioural&#xD;
      symptoms, with a depressive episode requiring at least five of these symptoms during a period&#xD;
      of at least two weeks. When considering the biological mechanisms that underpin depression,&#xD;
      the most conclusive findings include deficits in the serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission,&#xD;
      alterations in the expression of BDNF, deficient immune activation and neuroinflammation, and&#xD;
      dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Thus, understanding the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD has widespread implications for the development of novel&#xD;
      treatment and prevention strategies. However, despite advancements in the development of&#xD;
      novel therapeutics, current treatment options have not reached optimal efficacy. Treatment&#xD;
      resistant depression occurs in up to 40% of patients and standard antidepressant medication&#xD;
      has a variety of undesirable side effects such as sedation, decrease of blood pressure,&#xD;
      increase of weight, indigestion or sexual dysfunction. This often results in patients' poor&#xD;
      compliance resulting in a break-up of medication with recurrence of depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      increased suicidal risk. As there is an unmet need to develop safer and more effective&#xD;
      treatments in depression, a major topic of future psychiatric care is to focus on different&#xD;
      possible physiologically relevant mechanisms in order to establish alternative, causative and&#xD;
      easy available treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few years, it has become increasingly evident that resident gut bacteria are an&#xD;
      important contributor to healthy metabolism and there is significant evidence linking altered&#xD;
      composition of the gut microbiota and metabolic disorders such as obesity and depression.&#xD;
      Preclinical work in animals have reported associations between alterations of the gut&#xD;
      microbiome (the community of microorganism that live in the human gut) and anxiety-like&#xD;
      behaviour, depressive-like symptoms and stress responsiveness. In line with these preclinical&#xD;
      findings, a recent study found an altered composition of faecal microbiota in patients with&#xD;
      MDD. Most notably, the MDD group had increased levels of Enterobacteriaceae and Alistipes but&#xD;
      reduced levels of Faecalibacterium, which was negatively correlated with the severity of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating evidence suggest that there exits a bi-directional communication system between&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Changes in gut microbiota can influence cognitive&#xD;
      and emotional stress processes through interactions with the brain and altered emotional&#xD;
      states and dysfunction of the gut microbiome-brain axis has been implicated in stress-related&#xD;
      disorders such as depression. Brain-gut interactions could occur in various ways: 1)&#xD;
      microbial compounds communicate via the vagus nerve, which connects the brain and the&#xD;
      digestive tract, and 2) microbially derived metabolites interact with the immune system,&#xD;
      which maintains its own communication with the brain. Although the pathways linking gut&#xD;
      bacteria with the brain are incompletely understood, one of the principal mechanisms proposed&#xD;
      to underlie stress-induced alterations is the &quot;leaky gut&quot; phenomenon. Specifically, increased&#xD;
      translocation of bacterial products, due to a compromised gut barrier has been linked to&#xD;
      activation of the immune system and HPA axis. In line with these findings, human studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a stress-induced increase in bacterial translocation in depression. The&#xD;
      stress-induced interactions between the gut microbiome and the brain are further mediated via&#xD;
      central processes such as neurotransmission and neurogenesis. For instance, there is&#xD;
      substantial evidence to demonstrate a role for the gut commensals in the regulation and&#xD;
      development of the 5-HT system and the expression of BDNF. Virtually all corticolimbic brain&#xD;
      structures that are involved in mood regulation and stress response express 5-HT receptors.&#xD;
      These include the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analyses of fMRI studies support hyperactivation of several of these regions in response&#xD;
      to fearful faces in MDD, which extent correlated positively with the severity of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. Furthermore, during resting state fMRI, MDD patients showed lower connectivity&#xD;
      between the amydgala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, and brainstem, while the connectivity&#xD;
      strength was inversely correlated with general depression. The hippocampus, and its&#xD;
      connection to other limbic, striatal and PFC regions, seems to play a key role in stress&#xD;
      regulation, given that hippocampal neurogenesis mediates antidepressant effects via the&#xD;
      ventral hippocampus' influence on the HPA axis, and mechanisms by which antidepressants may&#xD;
      reverse chronic stress-induced 5-HT and neurogenic changes. Notably, BDNF may contribute to&#xD;
      the modulation of neurogenesis in response to both stress and antidepressants, as hippocampal&#xD;
      BDNF levels decrease in response to chronic stress and increase in response to antidepressant&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides being a fundamental player in eating processes and in hypothalamic regulation of&#xD;
      energy balance, the appetite-regulating hormones leptin and ghrelin had been implicated in&#xD;
      the etiology of mood disorders. Importantly, particular species of bacteria in the gut are&#xD;
      know to affect the levels of leptin and ghrelin. In humans, the onset of depression was&#xD;
      associated with a combination of high leptin levels coupled with high visceral fat, and the&#xD;
      link between leptin levels and severity of depressive symptoms was mediated by adiposity. It&#xD;
      was suggested that leptin might influence depression by acting on leptin receptors present on&#xD;
      5-HT neurons within the raphe nuclei and dopamine neurons in the midbrain and, thus, might&#xD;
      influence reward processes. Consistent with this supposition, when leptin receptors in the&#xD;
      rat hippocampus were genetically deleted, a stressor-induced depressive profile was apparent,&#xD;
      and deletion of leptin receptors on midbrain dopamine neurons in mice elicited elevated&#xD;
      anxiety. Thus, identifying the key brain regions that mediate leptin's antidepressant&#xD;
      activity and dissecting its intracellular signal transduction pathways may provide new&#xD;
      insights into the pathogenesis of depression and facilitate the development of novel&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut peptide ghrelin also plays a fundamental role in eating and energy regulation and&#xD;
      there have been indications that ghrelin functioning might contribute to depressive illness.&#xD;
      Like leptin, ghrelin receptors have been reported in the midbrain and the dorsal raphe&#xD;
      nucleus and have been associated with reward processes, as well as stressor-induced&#xD;
      depressive-like symptoms, such as anhedonia. In line with a role for ghrelin in&#xD;
      stressor-elicited depression, negative events promote an increase of circulating ghrelin&#xD;
      levels and in emotionally reactive individuals the normalization of ghrelin levels after&#xD;
      stress may be attenuated. Moreover, ghrelin was elevated among depressed patients and&#xD;
      declined following pharmacotherapy and among patients who did not respond to treatment,&#xD;
      ghrelin levels were higher than among patients who responded positively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compelling preclinical data demonstrated the beneficial effect of probiotics in normalizing&#xD;
      HPA axis functioning, BDNF levels and 5-HT neurotransmission. In particular, certain&#xD;
      probiotics such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria can reverse psychological stress-induced&#xD;
      HPA axis activation and possess antidepressant or anxiolytic activity in rats. A seminal work&#xD;
      in experimental animals showed that altered stress responsiveness has been partially reversed&#xD;
      by colonization of the gut. Importantly, a recent and innovative study showed that short-term&#xD;
      consumption of mostly animal or mostly plant diet rapidly and reproducibly altered the human&#xD;
      gut microbiome, suggesting that the development of dietary interventions may provide a novel&#xD;
      promising adjuvant therapy in addition to pharmacological antidepressant treatments in MDD.&#xD;
      Indeed, recent reports of trials administrating a combination of probiotics to healthy&#xD;
      subjects demonstrated improvements in depression or anxiety outcome measures. Moreover,&#xD;
      urinary free cortisol levels were significantly reduced by the probiotics, providing a&#xD;
      potential mechanism for the improvement in psychological symptoms observed. Consistent with&#xD;
      this finding, other studies in healthy subjects found that the consumption of a&#xD;
      probiotic-containing yogurt improved mood and that a multispecies probiotic (different&#xD;
      strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts.&#xD;
      Moreover, a pioneer study in healthy subjects revealed by using fMRI that consumption of&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria (including strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) in fermented milk&#xD;
      for 4 weeks modulated brain activation in corticolimbic regions while viewing frightened and&#xD;
      angry facial expressions. Most important, a very recent study demonstrated that&#xD;
      administration of probiotics, a mixture of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, ameliorated&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in unmedicated patients with mild to moderate depression. These studies&#xD;
      together suggest that restoring disturbed gut microbiome-brain interactions via probiotic&#xD;
      bacteria might be a desirable treatment strategy for depression, especially as most of the&#xD;
      clinically depressed patients additionally suffer from obesity, weight loss or gain, appetite&#xD;
      disturbances and constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is aimed at investigating for the first time if probiotic supplementation&#xD;
      improves the effect of antidepressants on depressive symptoms (i.e. better and faster&#xD;
      remission) in patients with severe MDD. Furthermore, this study will also test if probiotic&#xD;
      supplementation modulates immune signalling and inflammatory processes, HPA axis responses,&#xD;
      neurogenesis, the release of appetite-regulating hormones, the composition of gut microbiota&#xD;
      and brain perfusion, structure and activation and if these changes are associated with the&#xD;
      probiotic-induced effect on depressive symptoms.&#xD;
