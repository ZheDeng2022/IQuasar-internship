      This study investigates the possible differences in images obtained in patients with lumbar&#xD;
      spondylolisthesis when positioned in an upright weight bearing position compared with&#xD;
      traditional supine positioning for lumbar MRI.&#xD;

      Detailed Description Spondylolisthesis is a spinal condition in which one vertebral body has&#xD;
      slid forward in relation to the vertebrae below and is sometimes associated with spinal&#xD;
      instability. Lumbar spondylolisthesis is a relatively common problem and is generally&#xD;
      diagnosed from radiographs. MRI is often used to evaluate the condition further and to&#xD;
      determine if there is nerve root compression involved. One potential disadvantage with&#xD;
      traditional MRI to evaluate spondylolisthesis is imaging is performed with the patient lying&#xD;
      supine in the scanner. This creates a potential for the superior vertebra to slide&#xD;
      posteriorly so that the extent of the slip may not be fully appreciated, if seen at all. Use&#xD;
      of upright weight bearing MRI provides the opportunity to image the spine in the position&#xD;
      that patients are most likely to experience symptoms and is similar to standing radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Acquisition: Each patient will undergo MRI scanning in the supine and weight bearing&#xD;
      positions during the same imaging session. If it is determined that a patient who has&#xD;
      consented to participate in the study should not have an MRI made due to safety concerns&#xD;
      (such as metallic implant or other contraindication to MRI not identified during recruiting),&#xD;
      they will be discontinued from the study and another patient recruited to fulfill the planned&#xD;
      number of images available for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI procedure will be standard lumbar spine scanning protocol using the Esaote G-scan, an&#xD;
      open unit. Patients will be scanned supine and then the unit rotated to 81 degrees from&#xD;
      horizontal for the weight bearing scan. Immediately after each scan, the patient will&#xD;
      complete visual analog scales (VAS) assessing back and leg pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher(s) performing image assessments will be blinded to the position in which scans&#xD;
      were made. Data to be recorded for each image is the Meyerding scale (1-4 scale rating the&#xD;
      severity of the spondylolisthesis), amount of slip (mm), anterior and posterior disc space&#xD;
      height (mm), foraminal area, anteroposterior (AP) distance at the most narrow part of the&#xD;
      foramen, and disc space angulation. Area of the spinal canal and AP distance across the canal&#xD;
      will be measured from axial images. The facet fluid sign, associated with spinal instability,&#xD;
      will be assessed from axial MRI views using a 3-point scale with &quot;none&quot; indicating no&#xD;
      evidence of fluid in the left or right facet joints; &quot;possible&quot; if there is some suggestion&#xD;
      of fluid in the joints; or &quot;definite&quot; if there is at least a 2 mm wide layer of&#xD;
      hyperintensity within either joint bilaterally at the level evaluated. Additionally, the&#xD;
      width of the fluid fill of the facet joint taken perpendicular to the apparent joint line,&#xD;
      and the largest value recorded as effusion size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments: VAS separately assessing back and leg pain will be completed&#xD;
      immediately after the supine scanning and again immediately after weight bearing scanning.&#xD;
      Analysis will be conducted to determine if differences in pain correlate with changes in&#xD;
      images taken in the two positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: Parametric measures will be compared for the two imaging positions using&#xD;
      paired t-tests. Pairwise categorical data will be analyzed using McNemar analysis. In the&#xD;
      secondary study dealing with facet fluid sign, mean values for translation, disc height,&#xD;
      foraminal area, and AP distance will be compared across the three facet fluid sign categories&#xD;
      using ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in back and leg pain will be analyzed to determine if there is a relationship between&#xD;
      these changes and changes noted on the positional MRI. It is not anticipated that this&#xD;
      section of the study will produce statistically significant results, but will hopefully&#xD;
      provide guidance for possibly investigating these parameters in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From routine clinical lateral flexion/extension radiographs, change in translation between&#xD;
      the two positions will be measured. If a lateral neutral radiograph is available, translation&#xD;
      as well as anterior and posterior disc height will be measured. All measurements will be made&#xD;
      using the same methods as described for the MRIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: At least 25 patients, but no more than 60 patients will be included. After 25&#xD;
      patients are imaged, data will be analyzed to determine an appropriate sample size to&#xD;
      determine a statistically significant difference between measurements made from the supine&#xD;
      and upright weight bearing images.&#xD;
