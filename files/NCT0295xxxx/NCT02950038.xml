      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Imbruvica (ibrutinib) alone and then&#xD;
      in combination with Opdivo (nivolumab) can control NSCLC in patients who have received&#xD;
      previous chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle will be 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, during Cycle 1, you will take&#xD;
      ibrutinib alone. Ibrutinib should be taken by mouth 1 time each day with a glass of water.&#xD;
      You should take the study drug at the same time every day. You may take your dose of&#xD;
      ibrutinib with or without food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal&#xD;
      schedule the following day. You should not take any extra doses on the following day to make&#xD;
      up for any forgotten doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning with Cycle 2, you will receive nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 15&#xD;
      of every cycle. You will continue to take ibrutinib as you did during Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a pill diary to complete. You should record in the diary each dose of&#xD;
      medication you take and when you took it. You should bring this diary with you to each study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (+/- 7 days) of all cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between Days 21 and 28 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a tumor biopsy for biomarker testing and to check your immune system's&#xD;
           response to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for cytokine/chemokine testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of Cycle 1 only, you will have a CT of the neck and chest to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 (+/- 7 days) of Cycle 1 and then every 8 weeks after that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your thyroid function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you can become pregnant, you may have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
      at any time the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive ibrutinib for up to 2 years. You may receive nivolumab for as long as the&#xD;
      study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study&#xD;
      drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after the last dose of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months for up to 2 years after your first dose of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). It is&#xD;
      considered investigational to use this drug to treat NSCLC. Nivolumab is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. The study doctor can explain how&#xD;
      the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 25 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
