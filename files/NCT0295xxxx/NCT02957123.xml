  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed an innovative proof-of-concept trial designed to provide data&#xD;
      as to whether the treatment/rehabilitation efficacy and functional outcome of patients with&#xD;
      organic brain syndrome are improved with intranasal inhalations of bioactive factors (BF),&#xD;
      produced by autologous M2 macrophages (auto-M2-BFs). The rationale for this approach is the&#xD;
      ability of central nervous system to repair and the important role of macrophages in the&#xD;
      regulation of this process. It was found that type 2 macrophages have anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      reparative potential, whereas M1 cells possess pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic effects.&#xD;
      Action of M2 macrophages is largely realized through the production a wide variety of&#xD;
      bioactive factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, neuropeptides, microvesicles etc)&#xD;
      that inhibit inflammation, protect neurons from apoptosis, stimulate neurogenesis, the growth&#xD;
      and remyelination of axons, the formation of new synapses and activate angiogenesis. This&#xD;
      study uses auto-M2-BFs, as therapeutic agents and intranasal administration focusing on nose&#xD;
      to brain transport, as a mode of delivery. Expected clinical effects in treated subjects:&#xD;
      improvement of cognitive functions (memory, language, attention); correction of focal&#xD;
      neurological deficit (paresis, spasticity, sensory disorders); reduction vestibular/ataxic&#xD;
      disorders (vertigo, unsteadiness when walking); reduction of headaches; reduction of asthenia&#xD;
      (weakness, fatigue); correction of emotional disorders (anxiety, depression).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following injury to the central nervous system (CNS), immune-mediated inflammation profoundly&#xD;
      affects the ability of neural cells to survive and to regenerate. The role of inflammation&#xD;
      comprises mostly of macrophages, is controversial, since macrophages can both induce neuronal&#xD;
      and glial toxicity and promote tissue repair. The opposite effects of macrophages may be&#xD;
      conditioned by their functional heterogeneity. Thus, classical pro-inflammatory macrophages&#xD;
      (M1) are tissue-destructive, while anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages mediate tissue repair.&#xD;
      In addition, M2 macrophages predominantly induce the Th2 response, which is particularly&#xD;
      beneficial in CNS repair. Using low serum conditions the investigators have generated M2-like&#xD;
      macrophages and evaluated their phenotypic and functional features [1, 2]. Our data indicate&#xD;
      that M2 macrophages, in contrast to pro-inflammatory M1 cells, produced significantly lower&#xD;
      levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-18, IL-12),&#xD;
      chemokines (IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-1) and Th1/Th2-cytokines (interferon-γ,&#xD;
      IL-2, IL-4) coupled with a higher IL-10 level. M2 macrophages were capable of producing&#xD;
      neurotrophic- (brain-derived neurotrophic factor,insulin-like growth factor-1), angiogenic-&#xD;
      (vascular endothelial growth factor), and other growth factors (erythropoietin,&#xD;
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor , basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor) with neuroprotective and regenerative activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our pilot clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and clinical efficacy of intrathecal&#xD;
      administration of M2 macrophages in children with severe cerebral palsy [3] and in non-acute&#xD;
      stroke patients [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since cell-free culture medium of M2 macrophages contains a wide variety of neurotrophic,&#xD;
      immunoregulatory and pro-angiogenic factors, the investigators expect that intranasal&#xD;
      administration of these auto-M2-BFs will improve the treatment/rehabilitation efficacy and&#xD;
      functional outcome of patients with organic brain syndrome. Of note, intranasal&#xD;
      administration of M2-macrophage soluble factors allow to delivery bioactive agents to brain&#xD;
      through the olfactory and trigeminal ways across brain-blood barrier.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Assessment of Clinical Symptoms (SACS) is a 5-point rating scale with standardized criteria (0 - no; 1 - mild; 2 - moderate; 3 - severe; 4 - intensive) subjective assessment of the severity of fifteen clinical symptoms most characteristic of neurological disorders (headache, dizziness, gait disturbance, speech, visual impairment, tremor et al). Minimum SACS &quot;total&quot; score is 0, and maximum SACS &quot;total&quot; score is 60. Neurological improvements are assessed by SACS &quot;total&quot; score as &gt; 6 points' reduction from baseline.</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is used to diagnose anxiety/depression symptoms (absence - 0~7 points; subclinical form - 8~10 points; clinical form - 11 points or more). Minimum HADS &quot;total&quot; score (anxiety + depression subscale) is 0, and maximum HADS &quot;total&quot; score is 42. Improvements in patients with anxiety/depression symptoms are assessed by HADS &quot;total&quot; score as &gt; 4 points reduction from baseline.</description>

    <description>Functional Mobility Assessment (FMA) iscale is designed to evaluate parameters characterizing stability (0~24 points) and gait (0~16 points).&#xD;
The maximum FMA &quot;total&quot; score on stability and gait subscales is 39-40 and corresponds to the norm, minimum FMA &quot;total&quot; score is 0 and corresponds to the gross impairment. The degree of impairment of &quot;total&quot; score is divided into significant (0~20 points), moderate (21~33 points), and light (34~38 points), whereas 39~40 points indicate no impairments. Improved mobility is assessed as FMA &quot;total&quot; score enhancement &gt; 4 points from baseline.</description>
