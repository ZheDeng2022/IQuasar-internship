  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating Whole Body MRI as a possible screening tool to diagnose cancer for&#xD;
      people with LFS and other inherited cancer predisposition syndromes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who carry the TP53 mutation have a higher risk of developing different types of&#xD;
      cancer over their lifetimes. This gene has been associated with Li Fraumeni syndrome in some&#xD;
      families, but not all families that have cancer histories consistent with Li Fraumeni&#xD;
      syndrome will have the mutation. Currently, there is no standard method of monitoring LFS&#xD;
      carriers, family members, or others individuals with cancer predisposition syndromes to&#xD;
      detect cancers in the early stages, when they may be more easily treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to test a relatively new medical technology called Whole Body&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in patients with these syndromes, to see if cancers can be&#xD;
      detected at an early stage which may, in turn, allow for more effective treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators have chosen Whole Body MRI scanning because this scan allows doctors to look at&#xD;
      the entire body in one examination. By using this technology, participants are not exposed to&#xD;
      radiation, which is of particular importance for individuals who have a higher cancer risk&#xD;
      due to a diagnosis of LFS.&#xD;
