  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial in which participants will receive either&#xD;
      the Livongo Health system or iHealth glucose meter for measuring their blood glucose. The&#xD;
      study hypothesizes the use of the Livongo Health system results in a greater improvement in&#xD;
      A1c compared to standard blood glucose monitoring, as demonstrated by the iHealth&#xD;
      Bluetooth-enabled glucose meter.&#xD;

      Participants in this study will partake in study surveys, daily blood glucose monitor&#xD;
      measurements, and blood sampling for the duration of their participation. The study intends&#xD;
      to recruit and randomize 300 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surveys and Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
           All study participants may complete surveys via their personal iOS smartphone device on:&#xD;
           study qualification (intake survey/eligibility screener), diabetes status (initial&#xD;
           diabetes survey), physical activity (iPAQ), quality of life (SF-12), vitals,&#xD;
           demographics hospitalizations and interaction with health care provider (attached), and&#xD;
           diabetes distress. Most survey data will be collected at 1, 3, and 6 months. There will&#xD;
           also be Weekly Engagement surveys which will be two simple questions each week. At the&#xD;
           end of the study, a Feedback survey will ask participants about their study experiences.&#xD;
           Surveys will each have a simple description to introduce participants to the survey they&#xD;
           are being asked to take. These surveys will be administered through the Eureka mHealth&#xD;
           Research Platform, the study's main tool for data collection, data storage, and study&#xD;
           management. Specific usability assessments that are native to the Livongo or iHealth&#xD;
           platform may also be shown through the device to the participants in order to gather&#xD;
           user feedback information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After qualifying and providing consent to participate in the study, participants will be&#xD;
           referred to a convenient lab or receive a mail-in lab test kit for establishing&#xD;
           hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels and lipid panel levels. A1c tests will be collected at&#xD;
           months 1 (baseline), 3, and 6 (closeout). For each A1c test performed in the lab, 1mL&#xD;
           (milliliter) of blood will be drawn. Lipid panels (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and&#xD;
           triglycerides) will be collected at months 1 (baseline) and 6 (closeout). For each lipid&#xD;
           panel, 1mL of blood will be drawn. If participants elect to use a mail-in lab test kit,&#xD;
           for each A1c test or lipid panel, 35 microliters of blood will be collected and mailed&#xD;
           in for testing (total 75 microliters at months 1 and 6, and 30 microliters at month 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization Once the baseline A1c value is obtained, the patient will be randomized&#xD;
           (block randomization by diabetes type).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Device Usage After randomization, participants will receive either the Livongo Health&#xD;
           system or the iHealth glucose meter by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a participant is randomized to the iHealth treatment group, participants will&#xD;
           download the iHealth iOS application and receive an iHealth blood glucose meter in the&#xD;
           mail. Participants will link the iHealth application with a mobile version of the Eureka&#xD;
           mHealth Research Platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a participant is randomized to the Livongo system treatment group, the participant&#xD;
           will receive the Livongo blood glucose meter device in the mail, create a Livongo&#xD;
           account, and link their Livongo account with the Eureka mHealth Research Platform.&#xD;
           Livongo- or iHealth-specific instructions will be provided with each meter and a study&#xD;
           coordinator will be available to answer study participant questions about using the BG&#xD;
           meters. Participants may be referred to Livongo or iHealth customer service for&#xD;
           technical support, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will not be given specific instructions on how often to check their BG, or&#xD;
           how often they should use the Livongo system or iHealth glucose meter as a part of this&#xD;
           study. This is done in order to determine the uptake of the intervention and resulting&#xD;
           behavior without outside prompting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will either use the Livongo system or the iHealth glucose meter for 6&#xD;
           months from the time of enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Messaging/Reminders Participants who have been mailed a BG (Blood Glucose) meter but are&#xD;
           not using the device after two weeks will be contacted by in-app push notifications,&#xD;
           text messages, email or a phone call for device setup and/or assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also receive reminders to complete study activities via in-app push&#xD;
      notifications, text messages, email or a phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks prior to the end of the study period, participants will be contacted by email&#xD;
      and/or receive in-app push notifications to remind them to complete their A1c measurement and&#xD;
      closeout surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Participation in this research study will not affect individual participants' standard&#xD;
      clinical care for diabetes. Participants will remain under the care of their current health&#xD;
      care provider and will be able to continue receiving all usual care from that provider. The&#xD;
      health care provider will continue to provide recommendations for the number of times the&#xD;
      participant should check their blood glucose. Although the participant wil be asked to use a&#xD;
      different glucose meter for this study, the number of times they use it will still be&#xD;
      determined by their health care provider. The same information that they received from their&#xD;
      existing glucose meter will be available from the study glucose meter. During the study, they&#xD;
      will be provided with glucose meter strips at no charge, to ensure that an insufficient&#xD;
      number of strips will not interfere with their standard of care.&#xD;
