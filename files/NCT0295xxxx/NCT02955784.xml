    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a prospective one-arm cohort study testing the feasibility of&#xD;
      a game designed to improve symptoms in adults with mild levels of stress, depression, and&#xD;
      anxiety. The study will take place at Madigan Army Medical Center. Primary outcomes include&#xD;
      usage data including time, frequency and duration of app use, participant satisfaction with&#xD;
      the game, and comments and suggestions regarding participants' experiences using the&#xD;
      Sinasprite game over a 12-week period. Participants will download Litesprite's game,&#xD;
      Sinasprite, onto their personal smartphone. Elements of cognitive-behavioral therapies like&#xD;
      cognitive strategies, diaphragmatic breathing, and visualization are embedded in the game&#xD;
      enabling participants to learn to achieve the desired healthy habits. The game's goal is to&#xD;
      help Socks the Fox become a Zen Master. Over six weeks, players help Socks to progress by&#xD;
      describing and categorizing their concerns, entrusting Socks to &quot;hold&quot; these concerns, and&#xD;
      engaging in bonding activities with Socks, such as fishing and meditation. The investigators&#xD;
      currently have a prototype and have been told by insurance firms, providers, and self-funded&#xD;
      employers that they need to see validated results from a pilot study that shows feasibility&#xD;
      with subjects in the target audience before they can consider a commercial roll out.&#xD;
      Participants will complete questions related to mood, stress, and well-being at baseline, 6&#xD;
      weeks, and 12 weeks. Data will be evaluated in real-time and reports of participant progress&#xD;
      will be provided to the participant's provider, with the participant's consent. Data and&#xD;
      feedback from this pilot study will be used to update the design and inform the technical&#xD;
      development team to further refine the game experience in preparation for a larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of Sinasprite.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S. anxiety disorders cost over $55 billion, and major depression is second only to&#xD;
      back and neck pain for having the greatest impact on disability days at 386.6 million&#xD;
      days/year. Primary care providers (PCPs) are overwhelmingly responsible for screening and&#xD;
      treating their patients for behavioral health conditions such as depression and anxiety, and&#xD;
      approximately 70-80% of antidepressants are prescribed in primary care. Nearly 17% of the&#xD;
      population will experience depression at some point in their lifetime, but of those treated&#xD;
      for depression in the primary care setting, only 20-40% show substantial improvement over 12&#xD;
      months. Insurance companies spend $1 trillion annually on behavioral health conditions. $250&#xD;
      billion is spent on our target segment - those with high stress or mild to moderate&#xD;
      depression/anxiety, but no serious mental illness requiring intensive or inpatient treatment.&#xD;
      These populations have significantly adopted and use mobile technologies for health purposes.&#xD;
      Current solutions, like AppsRx, ORCAS, or SuperBetter, are clinically-focused or, at best,&#xD;
      use game elements as opposed to a full gaming experience and do not target payers or&#xD;
      hospitals. LinkedWellness has a true gaming experience for anxiety/depression, but their&#xD;
      target audience is solely focused on teens. None of these incorporate the player's social&#xD;
      networks, biosensors, collect information from the phone, or provide predictive insights.&#xD;
      Therefore, tools to enhance management of these patients in a primary care setting, such as&#xD;
      the casual health-related game Sinasprite, may improve treatment of difficult-to-manage&#xD;
      behavioral health conditions. The investigators are proposing a prospective one-arm cohort&#xD;
      study testing the feasibility of a game designed to improve symptoms in adults with mild&#xD;
      levels of stress, depression, and anxiety. The study will take place at Madigan Army Medical&#xD;
      Center. Primary outcomes include usage data including time, frequency and duration of app&#xD;
      use, participant satisfaction with the game, and comments and suggestions regarding&#xD;
      participants' experiences using the Sinasprite game over a 12-week period. Participants will&#xD;
      download Litesprite's game, Sinasprite, onto their personal smartphone. Elements of&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapies like cognitive strategies, diaphragmatic breathing, and&#xD;
      visualization are embedded in the game enabling players to learn to achieve the desired&#xD;
      healthy habits. The game's goal is to help Socks the Fox become a Zen Master. Over six weeks,&#xD;
      players help Socks to progress by describing and categorizing their concerns, entrusting&#xD;
      Socks to &quot;hold&quot; these concerns, and engaging in bonding activities with Socks, such as&#xD;
      fishing and meditation. The investigators currently have a prototype and have been told by&#xD;

      can consider a commercial roll out. Participants will complete questions related to mood,&#xD;

      with the participant's consent. Data and feedback from this pilot study will be used to&#xD;
      update the design and inform the technical development team to further refine the game&#xD;
      experience in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial evaluating the&#xD;
