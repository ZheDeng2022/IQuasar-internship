      No previous studies have compared the association between muscle thickness (MT) and muscle&#xD;
      cross-sectional area (CSA) in healthy volunteers. The main aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the validity of ultrasound in assessing the muscle thickness of hamstrings&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional-validity study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      University&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      X football players of an amateur football team (X healthy volunteers and X patients with a&#xD;
      previous hamstring injury).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X healthy volunteers, from an amateur football team, and X football players with previous&#xD;
      history of hamstring injury from an orthopaedic clinic, comprised the subjects in this study.&#xD;
      Hamstring muscle injury was defined as &quot;a traumatic distraction or overuse injury to the&#xD;
      hamstring muscle leading to a player being unable to fully participate in training or match&#xD;
      play&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Group (CG) were healthy, had neither surgery/trauma in their lower extremities,&#xD;
      nor history of hamstring injury, and there were no abnormal findings in their physical&#xD;
      examination. The exclusion criteria included participants who: (1) had metal implants or pace&#xD;
      makers, (2) weighted more than 200 kg (MRI table limitations), and (3) were unable to&#xD;
      complete testing. In the Injured Group, patients were also excluded if their previous injury&#xD;
      was originated from a non-muscular source (e.g., inguinal or femoral hernia, nerve&#xD;
      entrapment, lumbosacral pathology), or if still had symptoms, had not returned to practice&#xD;
      and had not been participating in track and field since their last injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Group (SG) had history and diagnosis of hamstring injury assessment with diagnosis&#xD;
      image technique (ultrasound or MRI), and at least 2 of the next criteria: 1. When the injury&#xD;
      happened disability to practise with the team at least one week; 2. Lost at least one match;&#xD;
      3. Felt pain when trying to kick the ball or run fast; 4. Receive specific treatment (medical&#xD;
      or physiotherapy) for the injury; 5. Needed a period plan to return to play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were screened for contraindications to MRI before ultrasound assessment and an&#xD;
      MRI scan of the hamstring muscles of both legs were performed. MRI was performed within 24 h&#xD;
      of the ultrasound scan. The subjects were instructed not to consume alcohol or perform any&#xD;
      moderate to heavy exercise for 24 hours prior to each imaging session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle thickness was defined as the distance between the bone-muscle interface and the&#xD;
      adipose tissue-muscle interface. The measurement was made from the most superficial edge of&#xD;
      the bright line representing the interface of the bony cortex and the muscle to the most&#xD;
      superficial edge of the bright line representing the interface of the outer fascial layer of&#xD;
      the muscle and the subcutaneous adipose tissue. When the bone was not in contact of the&#xD;
      muscle the two fascial layer were used.&#xD;
