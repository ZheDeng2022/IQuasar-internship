      the aim in this prospective in vivo randomized clinical trial to evaluate the influence of&#xD;
      instrumentation technique ( reciprocation single file (wave one ) versus rotation single file&#xD;
      (neolix) ) on post operative pain ( incidence ,degree and duration ) after endodontic&#xD;
      treatment in single rooted lower premolars with symptomatic irreversible pulpits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the inclusion criteria the patients enrolled in the study and allocated randomly&#xD;
      into two groups either Wave One (group A) or Neolix ( group B) the endodontic treatment is&#xD;
      done at single visit. firstly the patient's medical and dental history is taken .the patient&#xD;
      assign on informed consent. and then,anaesthetized and access cavity performed and root canal&#xD;
      preparation is done by either two systems and then irrigation and obturation is done. the&#xD;
      patient record the post operative pain in sheet with NRS after 6,12,24,48hr and the operator&#xD;
      will recall the patient to check the records and follow up the patient.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medical and dental history: diagnostic charts will be collected in a case report form by the&#xD;
      investigators and confirmed for eligibility with the assistant supervisor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic examination : preoperative radiographs will be taken to examine the tooth&#xD;
      structure,caries detection , periapical status .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination : intraoral examination include visual examination for caries ,&#xD;
      restoration ,swelling ,fistula . mobility, percussion were done .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria for symptomatic irreversible pulpitis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient marks moderate to severe pain on the numerical rating scale (NRS) . a&#xD;
           horizontal line of 11 marks and 10 intervals each takes numbers from 0 to 10 where 0 =&#xD;
           no pain , 1-3 =mild pain , 4-6 = moderate pain , 7-10 = severe pain (recording the&#xD;
           baseline degree of pain preoperatively before initiating the endodontic treatment ) all&#xD;
           the steps done by the same operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient shows severe pain which lasts long after thermal testing which is done by&#xD;
           applying hot compound stick on the tooth after coating it with a lubricant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient responds to electric pulp tester at a lower level than the contralateral&#xD;
           tooth or the adjacent tooth if the contralateral one is missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty four patients will included and they will be randomly divided into two groups A =root&#xD;
      canal preparation with single reciprocating file (Wave One ® Dentsply , Switzerland) and B =&#xD;
      Root canal preparation with single full rotation file (Neolix ® Neolix ,France) each group&#xD;
      consisted from 22 patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure steps :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients are asked to rate their pain level on numerical rating scale before the&#xD;
           anesthesia injection and the start of the preparation to get the baseline record for the&#xD;
           pain preoperatively .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient will receive inferior alveolar nerve block injections ( 1.8 ml mepivacaine&#xD;
           hydrochloride 2% ( 1: 100,000 epinephrine ) using a side loading aspirating syringe and&#xD;
           27-gauge long needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 15-minutes post injection, access cavity is performed using round bur size 4 and&#xD;
           endo-z bur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Tooth is then isolated using rubber dam to prevent introduction of saliva and Bactria&#xD;
           from the oral cavity .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Checking the patency of the canal with K- file (Mani Inc., Japan). size 10 taper 0.02,&#xD;
           extirpation of pulp with H-file (Mani Inc., Japan). size 15 taper 0.02 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. An electronic apex locator ( Morita Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) will be used to determine&#xD;
           working length, and then working length will be confirmed radiographically to be&#xD;
           adjusted 1mm shorter that the root apex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Each patient has equal chance to enter either the intervention groups A or B group as&#xD;
           each patient takes number in excel sheet divided into two groups A and B chosen by&#xD;
           assistant supervisor who determine which system will be used with this patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Comparator group: If the system to by used is Wave One the canal preparation is done by&#xD;
           primary file size 25 taper 8% in narrow or curved canals if size 10 K file (Mani Inc.,&#xD;
           Japan) is passively fit in the canal ( most of canals ) , but in case of K-file (Mani&#xD;
           Inc., Japan) size 20 loose in the canal so we choose large large file size 40 taper 8%&#xD;
           either of them to the full working length with pre programmed motor (X-Smart Plus&#xD;
           (Dentsply) with reducing hand piece 6:1 more anticlockwise angle than clock wise one .&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Experimental group : If the Neolix systems will be used ,then the first file used is C1&#xD;
           file size 25 taper 12% as orifice opener and for coronal flaring for 2/3 of canal length&#xD;
           the A1 file size 25 taper 8% in narrow or curved canals if size 10 K file (Mani Inc.,&#xD;
           Japan). is passively fit in the canal (most of the canals) , but in case of K-file (Mani&#xD;
           Inc., Japan) size 20 loose in the canal so we choose large file size 40 taper 4% either&#xD;
           of them to the full working length to the full working length with X-Smart Plus motor&#xD;
           with speed 300-500 rpm and torque 1.5 N.cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Irrigation is made between each file using 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and MD-ChelCream19%&#xD;
           ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid cream (METABIOMED company , Korea).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The canals are then dried with paper points and obturated with gutta percha and ADSEAL&#xD;
           resin sealer(METABIOMED company, Korea) by selection of a master cone corresponding to&#xD;
           the size of master apical file, then spreader will be selected to provide auxiliary&#xD;
           cones using cold lateral compaction technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Access cavity is then sealed with temporary filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. then rating of post operative pain after the treatment is recorded by numerical rating&#xD;
           scale ( NRS) in sheet given to the patient to record the degree of pain after 6 hrs ,12&#xD;
           hrs ,24 hrs ,48 hrs together with recalling the patient to check the record then the&#xD;
           patient return the sheet to the operator and then the collected sheets presented to&#xD;
           assistant supervisor.&#xD;
