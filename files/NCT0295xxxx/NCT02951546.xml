    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated to obesity, metabolic syndrome and&#xD;
      genetic predisposition: specific variants of the genes PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 are the most&#xD;
      involved. Also biochemical mechanisms that affect the &quot;metabolic flexibility&quot; need to be&#xD;
      better clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that a dietary intervention, accompanied by a physical personalized training,&#xD;
      reduce either the hepatic fat content either insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate &quot;metabolic flexibility&quot; in obese NAFLD&#xD;
      subjects taking in account the presence or absence of PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphism and the&#xD;
      histopathological diagnosis of either simple steatosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
      (NASH). The composition of gut microbiota will be also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, two distinct healthy dietary profiles accompanied by a personalized physical&#xD;
      training, will be tested to comprehend whether and how &quot;healthy diets&quot; could operate in the&#xD;
      clinical treatment of NAFLD and related conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is frequently associated to obesity and metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. In NAFLD, a heritable component to disease susceptibility has been demonstrated:&#xD;
      the variants of the genes PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 are the most involved genetic determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, biochemical mechanisms that affect the &quot;metabolic flexibility&quot; in obese NAFLD&#xD;
      subjects, in presence or absence of genetic susceptibility, need to be better clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different studies demonstrated that a dietary intervention, accompanied by a physical&#xD;
      personalized training, significantly reduce either the hepatic fat content either insulin&#xD;
      resistance in overweight and obese subjects, independently of weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On these bases, the aim of the study is to evaluate &quot;metabolic flexibility&quot; in obese NAFLD&#xD;
      subjects taking in account their genetics (presence or absence of PNPLA3 and TM6SF2&#xD;
      polymorphisms) and the histopathological diagnosis of either simple steatosis or nonalcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH). In addition, the composition of gut microbiota will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in this study, two distinct healthy dietary profiles accompanied by a personalized&#xD;
      physical training, will be tested in order to comprehend whether and how &quot;healthy diets&quot;&#xD;
      could be effective not only in the prevention, but also in the clinical treatment of NAFLD&#xD;
      and other related conditions.&#xD;
