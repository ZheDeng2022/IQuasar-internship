  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cleft Palate is a condition which affects up to 1 in 500 live births. Current treatment is&#xD;
      surgery to correct the underlying anomaly. Children born with cleft palate typically undergo&#xD;
      surgery at age 12 months. Standard ways to stop surgical bleeding include direct pressure and&#xD;
      the use of electrocautery (burning of the tissue). Other products are available to help&#xD;
      lessen blood loss. One of these includes a fibrin sealant. Fibrin is the key component of a&#xD;
      blood clot. When a fibrin sealant is applied there are a variety of potential benefits other&#xD;
      than bleeding control. One of these is decreased pain post operatively It is the&#xD;
      investigators belief that the use of a fibrin sealant, Tisseel, in cleft palate surgery will&#xD;
      decrease pain and enhance the recovery of children who undergo cleft palate repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will randomly select children undergoing cleft palate repair to have&#xD;
      tisseel used on the incision. Through statistical tests 40 children will be recruited (20 to&#xD;
      have tisseel used and 20 with no tisseel). The use of tisseel will be known to the surgeon&#xD;
      but not to the recovery room or ward nursing staff. Post operatively, the FLACC pain scale&#xD;
      will be used to score the pain of the children throughout their admission to the Stollery&#xD;
      children's hospital. The amount of pain controlling medication required as well as time to&#xD;
      discharge will also be recorded. Statistical analysis of the data will be performed using&#xD;
      accepted methods. Overall, the investigators hope to show that fibrin sealant, tisseel, will&#xD;
      less the amount of post operative pain experienced by children undergoing cleft palate&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cleft palate is a condition which affects up to 1:500 births. Current practice is that&#xD;
      children are enrolled in a multidisciplinary care team and undergo primary cleft palate&#xD;
      repair at 12 months of age. These children are admitted to hospital overnight for observation&#xD;
      of airway compromise, bleeding and analgesics. The use of fibrin sealant is gaining&#xD;
      popularity and its use in pediatric surgery is becoming more commonplace. It acts as both a&#xD;
      hemostatic agent as well as an adhesive. A review of the current literature on fibrin sealant&#xD;
      has shown that in adults and children it may decrease post operative inflammation and pain.&#xD;
      In 1994 Moralee et al published that the use of fibrin sealant in tonsillectomy patients in&#xD;
      lieu of diathermy resulted in decreased pain in the early post operative period and that it&#xD;
      was equally effective as a hemostatic method. Another study published in 2005 by healy et al&#xD;
      showed that when fibrin sealant was applied to the donor site from a thigh split thickness&#xD;
      skin graft patients experienced significantly less pain over a 14 day study period. Tisseel&#xD;
      is a safe product when used appropriately. It is contraindicated for injection&#xD;
      intra-arterially and in those with allergy. It is derived from plasma however viral&#xD;
      transmission has not been shown to occur in this product. A full product monograph is&#xD;
      available. It is the investigators hypothesis that the use of tisseel in pediatric patients&#xD;
      undergoing cleft palate repair will result in decreased post operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a prospective randomized control trial. The control group will have&#xD;
      electrocautery as the primary method of hemostasis control and the treatment group will have&#xD;
      tisseel applied to the incision. The primary outcome of the study is post operative pain.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be the amount of analgesics required during the hospital admission,&#xD;
      time to discharge, time to first feeding, minor complication rates- infection, dehiscence,&#xD;
      respiratory compromise, and long term sequelae- oronasal fistula formation, need for&#xD;
      revision, velopharyngeal insufficiency. Statistical calculations for sample size have&#xD;
      determined that 16 patients will be needed in each group. This was calculated based on an&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05 and power(beta) of 0.8. Statistical significance will be set as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be directed at parents/guardians of patients to undergo cleft palate repair.&#xD;
      Details of the study will be explained to parents pre-operatively. Currently the pediatric&#xD;
      plastic surgeons at the Stollery Children's Hospital use tisseel in their repair techniques&#xD;
      however the investigators do not have concrete data suggesting it has a clear benefit for&#xD;
      this procedure. Two surgeons will be enrolling patients and performing surgeries&#xD;
      independently with or without the assistance of residents and/or medical students. After&#xD;
      informed consent by the primary decision maker, the patient will be randomized, via concealed&#xD;
      envelop, to have Tisseel used or have electrocautery used as a hemostatic mechanism. The&#xD;
      parents/guardians will be blinded to the randomization. The operating room staff will know&#xD;
      the results of the randomization and will need to prepare the Tisseel product. All other&#xD;
      health care providers caring for the patient in the recovery period will be blinded to the&#xD;
      randomization. Post-operative pain scores will be determined using the FLACC (Face, Legs,&#xD;
      Activity, Cry, Consolability) scoring system. This system is a validated objective pain&#xD;
      scoring system used in young children post procedure. Patients will be assessed in the&#xD;
      standard fashion. Pain scores and analgesic medications given will be recorded as per current&#xD;
      nursing policy as well as on the study record which will be placed in the patient's chart.&#xD;
      Parents will be shown how to assess FLACC scores and if patient is discharged prior to 72&#xD;
      hours, the parent or guardian will be asked to record the FLACC score at certain time points.&#xD;
      The record of time to first feeding will be recorded on the study record form. Patients will&#xD;
      be discharged from hospital when current criteria for safe discharge are met. Clinic follow&#xD;
      up will be conducted in the current standard method at the surgeon's discretion. It will be&#xD;
      noted on the patient's hospital chart that they were enrolled in this study in order to track&#xD;
      long-term outcomes listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student t-test will be used to compare the outcome data. Demographic parameters will be&#xD;
      collected to validate the randomization of the study groups. Age at time of surgery,&#xD;
      associated congenital malformations including cleft lip and prior orthodontic&#xD;
      surgery/interventions will be recorded and stored in a password protected data storage&#xD;
      device. Results of the study will be made available to the parent/guardians of the study&#xD;
      patients. It is estimated that the study will require one year of recruitment and data&#xD;
      collection for the primary outcome.&#xD;
