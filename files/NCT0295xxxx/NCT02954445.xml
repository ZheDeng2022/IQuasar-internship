  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of BCMA-targeted&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of B-cell derived malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B-cell maturation antigen(BCMA) is preferentially expressed in mature B lymphocytes as well&#xD;
      as in B-cell derived leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. Despite of the fact that&#xD;
      CD19-targeted CAR-T can re-induce remissions for many patients with relapsed and refractory B&#xD;
      cell malignancies, a part of those patients will relapse with CD19-negative malignancies. To&#xD;
      explore a rescue for those with CD19-negative B cell malignancies, this trial is designed and&#xD;
      conducted to test the safety and effect of BCMA-targeted CAR-T.&#xD;

    <description>The trial will be conducted in a manner of simon two-stage design with Anti-BCMA-CAR-transduced T cells, beginning in the first stage with the aim of over 30% reaction rate among 15 patients with B cell malignancies. Only when the expected reaction rate is achieved the 30 patients left can be recruited.</description>

    <description>The first 3 enrolled patients will receive autologous-derived BCMA-targeted CAR-T cells on day 1, 2 and 3 with respective 10%, 30% and 60% of the total expected dosage after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy. If the 3 patients don't display severe toxicity, the next patients enrolled will get infused in 2 days with respective 40% and 60% total dosage.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. BCMA-expressing B cell malignancy must be assured and must be relapsed or refractory&#xD;
             disease. According to current traditional therapies, there must be no available&#xD;
             alternative curative therapies and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic&#xD;
             stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits&#xD;
             SCT at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. BCMA expression of the malignant cells must be detected by immunohistochemistry or by&#xD;
             flow cytometry. In general immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies,&#xD;
             flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Gender is not limited, age from 14 years to 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which&#xD;
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by&#xD;
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients are expected to survive for more than 3 months by their physicians at the&#xD;
             time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell&#xD;
             dose based on dosage cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic&#xD;

             WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts, or &gt; 5/uL WBCs but negative by&#xD;
             Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3 with marrow disease who has failed salvage systemic&#xD;
             and intensive IT chemotherapy (and therefore not eligible for radiation)&#xD;
