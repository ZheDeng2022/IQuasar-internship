    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of micro- and macrovascular&#xD;
      changes on the cardiac function in relation to left ventricular function and coronary&#xD;
      arteries during one year in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most frequent heart disease in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the&#xD;
      premature development of coronary atherosclerosis, which often leads to overt ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease (IHD). T2DM can lead to both cardiac dysfunction due to IHD or to diabetic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is defined as an impairment of left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      function without overt obstructive coronary vessel disease. Diabetic cardiomyopathy has been&#xD;
      associated with microvascular dysfunction, which leads to the inability of the heart to&#xD;
      circulate blood effectively. The microvascular atherosclerotic changes are well known in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes, such as impaired vision, kidney function and sensibility. The&#xD;
      macrovascular atherosclerotic changes such as plaques in the coronary arteries are strongly&#xD;
      associated with reduced left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the relationship between micro- and macrovascular atherosclerotic changes and the&#xD;
      impact on cardiac function is less certain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of cardiac function includes: Left Atrial (LA) Strain, LA Strain Rate (SR), LA&#xD;
      Emptying Function (LAEF), LV Ejection Fraction (EF), Fractional Shortening (FS), Global&#xD;
      Longitudinal Strain (GLS), Circumferential Strain (CS) and Radial Strain (RS), Strain Rate&#xD;
      (SR), Peak Systolic Strain, Post Systolic Strain, Early mitral filling velocity (E), late&#xD;
      mitral filling velocity (A), E/A ratio, Deceleration Time (DCT) of early mitral filling&#xD;
      velocity, medial and lateral mitral velocities using tissue doppler (e' , a' and s'), E/e'&#xD;
      ratio, Isovolumetric Relaxation Time (IVRT), Isovolumetric Closing Time (IVCT), Ejection Time&#xD;
      (ET), Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) and Myocardial Work Index (MWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be consisting of non-diabetic subjects and patients with&#xD;
      diabetes type 1 + 2. All of the participants have no history of myocardial infarction, heart&#xD;
      failure and current symptoms of cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will undergo following examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Urine- and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurements of anthropometric data and vital parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recording of medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 2D transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) with adenosine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Free fractional reserve computed tomography (FFR-CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examinations will be repeated at follow-up (however non-diabetic subjects will only have&#xD;
      1 CCTA performed at baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-invasive FFR-CT will only be performed once in a subgroup of diabetic patients and&#xD;
      non-diabetic subjects from November 2016 until May 2017.&#xD;
