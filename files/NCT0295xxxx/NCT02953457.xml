  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib when give together&#xD;
      with durvalumab and tremelimumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic mutation&#xD;
      that has come back or has not responded to treatment. Drugs, such as olaparib, may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and kill tumors&#xD;
      cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and&#xD;
      tremelimumab, may help stimulate the immune system in different ways to attack and stop tumor&#xD;
      cells from growing. Giving olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of the combination of PARP inhibitor olaparib with&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and anti-CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab. (Phase I) II. To assess&#xD;
      the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on progression&#xD;
      free survival (PFS) rates. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune responses in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive or resistant or&#xD;
      refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who carry a&#xD;
      germline and/or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and/or a homologous recombination deficiency&#xD;
      (HRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on&#xD;
      PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive or resistant or&#xD;
      refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who carry a&#xD;
      germline and/or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and/or a HRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of olaparib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), and tremelimumab intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment with olaparib continues for up&#xD;
      to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with&#xD;
      tremelimumab repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses and treatment with durvalumab repeats&#xD;
      every 4 weeks for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, and every 2&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
