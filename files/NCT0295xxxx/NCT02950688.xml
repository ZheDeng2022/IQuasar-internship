    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response produced by a seasonal live&#xD;
      attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) when compared to placebo. The initial vaccination will be&#xD;
      followed 2 months later by an inpatient trial evaluating safety, infectivity, clinical&#xD;
      response, and viral shedding after exposure to the wild-type A/California/2009-like influenza&#xD;
      challenge virus.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the immune response produced by a seasonal LAIV. The initial&#xD;
      vaccination will be followed 2 months later by an open-label inpatient trial evaluating the&#xD;
      subsequent response (safety, infectivity, clinical response, and viral shedding) following&#xD;
      administration of the wild-type A/California/2009-like influenza challenge virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult participants will be randomized into two groups. On Day 0, Group 1 will receive&#xD;
      a single dose of an intranasal LAIV. Group 2 will receive a single dose of intranasal&#xD;
      placebo. Study visits will occur on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 54, participants will be admitted to the isolation unit for the inpatient portion of&#xD;
      the study, and both groups will receive an intranasal dose of wild-type&#xD;
      A/California/2009-like influenza challenge virus on Day 56. On Day 65, participants who are&#xD;
      no longer shedding virus will be discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up study visits will occur after discharge from the isolation unit on Days 70, 84,&#xD;
      112, and 180. Study visits during either the inpatient or outpatient portions of the trial&#xD;
      may include physical examinations, collection of blood and urine samples, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), nasal washes and swabs, and nasal mucus weighing.&#xD;
