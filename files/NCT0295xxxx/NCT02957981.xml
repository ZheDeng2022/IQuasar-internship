  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this research is to develop and test a web-based genetic&#xD;
      education/counseling intervention. This intervention is designed to educate men from&#xD;
      hereditary cancer families about the personal relevance of genetic testing in order to help&#xD;
      them make decisions about whether to pursue genetic testing. The investigators will test this&#xD;
      intervention against standard care for men from hereditary cancer families. The web-based&#xD;
      educational intervention includes all of the information typically covered during genetic&#xD;
      counseling. As a result, after completing the education intervention participants can proceed&#xD;
      directly to genetic testing if they choose. The investigators will conduct a survey prior to&#xD;
      randomization and then follow-up surveys at 1-month and 6-months post-randomization. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be uptake of genetic testing. Secondary outcomes will be completion of&#xD;
      genetic counseling and decision satisfaction.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Develop a web-based intervention to increase genetic counseling/testing uptake in men&#xD;
      at high risk for carrying a BRCA mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the web-based intervention (WI) vs. usual care (UC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Examine the behavioral and psychosocial impact of BRCA testing in men from BRCA&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and Recruitment of Subjects. Participants will be recruited via the Lombardi&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Center's Familial Cancer Registry and the Non-therapeutic Subject&#xD;
      Registry Shared Resource. These registries contain over 800 female BRCA1/2 positive&#xD;
      participants. In addition, the investigators will recontact participants from prior trials&#xD;
      who have consented to be recontacted for future research and will accept self-referred index&#xD;
      cases who contact the study about participation. Female index cases will be identified based&#xD;
      on vital status, recency of contact, and availability of test reports documenting their&#xD;
      positive BRCA1/2 status. Where available, pedigrees will also be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect the privacy of study participants, participants will be recruited through their&#xD;
      female BRCA mutation carrier relatives (index patients) who will provide their contact&#xD;
      information. The investigators will identify adult female mutation carriers who are enrolled&#xD;
      in the Non-therapeutic Subject Registry Shared Resource, Familial Cancer Registry, who&#xD;
      received a positive test result as a participant in IRB 2004-133 and provided consent to be&#xD;
      contacted about future research studies or who contact the study directly about enrollment.&#xD;
      The study staff will mail a study invitation to potentially eligible index cases. This&#xD;
      mailing will include: an introductory letter; an informed consent document; a HIPAA&#xD;
      Authorization form; study brochures for distribution to male relatives if desired; and a&#xD;
      family contact form requesting contact information and current ages for potentially eligible&#xD;
      male relatives. The investigators will request that index patients return the Family Contact&#xD;
      Form in a self-addressed stamped envelope or complete an electronic version of the form.&#xD;
      Consistent with prior research and Institutional Review Board guidance, the letter and Family&#xD;
      Contact Form will reiterate that index patients should request permission from their&#xD;
      potentially eligible male relative(s) prior to providing contact information to us, and the&#xD;
      index patient's signature on the Family Contact Form will attest to this. The packet will&#xD;
      also contain information on how women may decline participation (an opt-out post card). If,&#xD;
      after 2-3 weeks, individuals do not decline participation, a research assistant will call to&#xD;
      determine interest in the study and request completion of the Family Contact Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon receiving returned Family Contact Forms, the research team we will contact potentially&#xD;
      eligible male relatives by mail. The study packet that is sent will include: an introductory&#xD;
      letter; informed consent document; study brochure, and opt-out postcard. On the opt-out&#xD;
      contacts, men can also indicate if they are ineligible for the study due to a cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis or prior genetic counseling/testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline survey. The baseline survey can be completed via telephone or electronically. Two&#xD;
      weeks following the mailing, the researchers will contact eligible men who have not opted out&#xD;
      by email or telephone. For email contact, the investigators will send an email link to an&#xD;
      electronic study consent and baseline survey. If no email address is provided, a research&#xD;
      assistant will contact the participant by telephone. If the participant has already returned&#xD;
      the print informed consent document, the research assistant will answer any questions about&#xD;
      the study and proceed with the baseline survey. If the participant has not returned an&#xD;
      informed consent document, the research assistant will complete a verbal consent process and&#xD;
      administer the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Following completion of the baseline survey, a research assistant will&#xD;
      randomize participants to either the Web Intervention or Usual Care. Randomization will be&#xD;
      achieved via computer generated random numbers (blocks of 8). Family members will be assigned&#xD;
      to the same intervention to avoid contamination. Men who complete the baseline survey online&#xD;
      will be notified of their randomization assignment via email. Men who complete the baseline&#xD;
      survey by telephone will be notified of their randomization status at the end of the baseline&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care Group. Men who are randomized to the Usual Care arm will receive an email and&#xD;
      letter informing them of their group assignment. These contacts will include a list of&#xD;
      resources for men from hereditary cancer families and for those who have not previously&#xD;
      completed the print or electronic consent form, another copy of the print consent and a link&#xD;
      to the electronic consent will also be provided. At this time, Usual Care participants will&#xD;
      be informed that if they are interested in genetic counseling and testing, they can contact&#xD;
      the study team (via a toll-free number provided to them in the letter) to schedule a&#xD;
      telephone genetic counseling session (free of charge) or the study team can provide a local&#xD;
      referral for in-person genetic counseling. All participants will be required to complete the&#xD;
      print or electronic study consent form prior to study-provided genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web Intervention Group. Men randomized to the Web Intervention will receive an email and&#xD;
      letter (sent through US Mail) with the web address, and an individualized code. When&#xD;
      participants access the website, they will be asked to enter their email address and their&#xD;
      code, and then choose a password for future log-ins. Participants who forget their passwords&#xD;
      can request a new log-in code at any time. The investigators will provide participants with a&#xD;
      toll-free support number to call if they have any questions. Participants who have not&#xD;
      completed the print or electronic informed consent document will be required to complete the&#xD;
      electronic consent prior to viewing the Web Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the Web Intervention, participants will be provided with the following&#xD;
      options for pursuing genetic testing for their familial BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation: 1) they can&#xD;
      indicate that they are not interested in pursuing genetic testing; 2) they can indicate that&#xD;
      they have questions about genetic testing, in which case an RA will follow-up, answer any&#xD;
      process-related questions, and determine if a genetic counselor consultation is required; 3)&#xD;
      they can schedule an individual genetic counseling session (with a LCCC genetic counselor or&#xD;
      with a genetic counselor of their choice); 4) they can proceed directly to genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Test Genetic counseling. All participants have multiple options for pre-test genetic&#xD;
      counseling. Since the Web Intervention provides participants with content that is comparable&#xD;
      to that of standard pre-test genetic counseling, Web Intervention participants have the&#xD;
      option to proceed directly to genetic testing after viewing the intervention. However, since&#xD;
      we expect that some participants may prefer traditional genetic counseling, participants will&#xD;
      have the option of free pre-test telephone genetic counseling provided through the study by a&#xD;
      board-certified genetic counselor at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. In contrast,&#xD;
      because Usual Care participants will not receive electronic genetic education/counseling,&#xD;
      they will not have the option to proceed directly to genetic testing. Usual Care participants&#xD;
      who are interested in pursuing genetic counseling will have the option to receive free&#xD;
      pre-test telephone genetic counseling through the study by a board certified genetic&#xD;
      counselor at Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. After completing genetic counseling,&#xD;
      participants will be provided with the opportunity to proceed to genetic testing. This arm is&#xD;
      designed to replicate standard care in which individual genetic counseling often proceeds&#xD;
      genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men in either group who prefer in-person genetic counseling, will be provided with a referral&#xD;
      to a local counselor and informed that those costs are not covered by the study. Men whose&#xD;
      insurance company requires them to be seen by a genetic counselor within a specified&#xD;
      organization before testing is ordered will be informed of that requirement if they proceed&#xD;
      to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing. Genetic testing is not required as part of this study. Any participants&#xD;
      interested in proceeding with genetic testing will receive standard clinical genetic testing&#xD;
      from a certified commercial laboratory. All testing will be provided under standard clinical&#xD;
      protocols and laboratory consents. The standard of care for relatives of BRCA1 or BRCA2&#xD;
      carriers is to test only for the specific familial mutation. The familial mutation will be&#xD;
      known to study staff because documentation of test reports must be available for female&#xD;
      cases, from whom eligible participants for the study are recruited. Men who have Ashkenazi&#xD;
      Jewish background will be offered testing for the three BRCA mutations common in this ethnic&#xD;
      group, as is also standard clinical practice. Men will have the option to go through their&#xD;
      insurance company or pay out of pocket for genetic testing. In either case, the fees&#xD;
      associated with testing will be paid directly to the clinical laboratory that performs the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coordination of genetic testing. All participants who indicate that they are interested in&#xD;
      genetic testing will be contacted by a research assistant to obtain information needed for&#xD;
      insurance billing, pre-verification and the completion of laboratory test requisition forms.&#xD;
      The research assistant will provide a laboratory consent form and laboratory requisition form&#xD;
      to participants who are interested in completing genetic testing. After these completed and&#xD;
      signed forms are returned to us, the research assistant will send the participant a kit to&#xD;
      collect saliva (DNA). The participant is then responsible for mailing the postage paid DNA&#xD;
      kit and required forms directly to the testing laboratory. Billing and payment arrangements&#xD;
      for testing will be handled between the testing lab and the participant. Georgetown&#xD;
      University will not bill patients for genetic testing services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-test genetic counseling. All participants who receive genetic testing through the study&#xD;
      will receive individual post-test genetic counseling by telephone from a board-certified&#xD;
      genetic counselor. In general, DNA testing results are available within 2 weeks. Results will&#xD;
      be sent directly to a study genetic counselor. The genetic counselor will call the&#xD;
      participant to review the test results, including cancer risks, management&#xD;
      options/guidelines, implications to family members, and emotional response to testing.&#xD;
      Questions and concerns will be addressed, and referrals for follow-up will be provided as&#xD;
      needed, including (if appropriate), genetic counseling referrals for relatives. If&#xD;
      participants did not undergo pre-test genetic counseling, a brief medical and family history&#xD;
      will be taken at this time, so that risk and management information can be individualized.&#xD;
      This session is expected to take between 10 to 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the post-test session, the genetic counselor will mail a copy of the laboratory's&#xD;
      genetic testing report and a brief genetic counseling summary letter that the participant can&#xD;
      share with his health care providers and family members if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Survey. Participants will be contacted for follow-up surveys at 1-month and&#xD;
      6-months post-randomization. These surveys will be similar to (but shorter than) the baseline&#xD;
      survey. As for the baseline survey, these follow-up surveys will be conducted electronically&#xD;
      or via telephone. Participants who have provided verbal consent at the time of the baseline&#xD;
      but who have not completed written or electronic consent (and therefore have not proceeded to&#xD;
      genetic counseling) will remain eligible to complete the follow-up surveys.&#xD;
