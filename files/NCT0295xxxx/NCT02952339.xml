    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      single dose of a recombinant live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in&#xD;
      RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a companion study to IMPAACT 2011.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of&#xD;
      a recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine, RSV LID ΔM2-2 1030s, in RSV-seronegative infants 6&#xD;
      to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV LID ΔM2-2 1030s&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo (administered as nose drops) at study entry (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 31, outside of the RSV&#xD;
      season, and will remain on study until they complete the post-RSV season visit between April&#xD;
      1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Total study duration is between 6&#xD;
      to 13 months, depending on when participants enroll in the study. Participants will attend&#xD;
      several study visits throughout the study, and the visits may include blood collection, nasal&#xD;
      washes, and physical examinations. Participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by&#xD;
      study staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.&#xD;
