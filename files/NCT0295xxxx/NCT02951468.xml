      Background Treatment of clavicular non- and malunion is still challenging. Current surgical&#xD;
      procedures often result in partially frustrating functional outcome along with high-grade&#xD;
      subjective impairment and increased rates of revision surgery. However, the combination of&#xD;
      vital bone graft and a biomechanically sufficient fixation system seems to be a promising&#xD;
      concept of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods In this retrospective study, 14 patients with a mean age of 44 years (26-67 years)&#xD;
      suffering from non-union (n=11) and/or malunion (n=4) of the clavicle were enrolled. All&#xD;
      patients were surgically treated using an anatomical precontoured locking compression plate&#xD;
      (LCP) and autologous iliac crest bone graft. Functional outcome was assessed using the age-&#xD;
      and sex-specific relative Constant Score.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who were treated for clavicular non- or malunion with a locking compression&#xD;
      plate and an iliac crest bone graft between January 2010 and December 2014 were included in&#xD;
      this retrospective study. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee&#xD;
      (71/15 S).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative symptoms included pain (n=12), limited range of motion (n=2), pain when&#xD;
      sleeping on the affected side (n=2), skin irritation caused by dislocated screws (n=1),&#xD;
      feeling of weakness of the arm (n=1) and crepitation (n=1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard radiographs of the affected clavicle (anterior-posterior path of rays perpendicular&#xD;
      to radiographic cassette, anterior-posterior path of rays 30° tilted cephalad) were performed&#xD;
      at the time of the initial presentation of the patient as well as during the routine&#xD;
      follow-up examinations in our outpatient clinic. Preoperative planning included the&#xD;
      performance of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to estimate the non-vital parts of&#xD;
      bone to be resected as well as the performance of a computed tomography (CT) scan of both&#xD;
      clavicles to measure the original clavicle length to be able to adequately decide if a bone&#xD;
      graft would be required. A tricortical iliac crest bone graft was used in all cases with bony&#xD;
      defects larger than 15 mm due to the risk of abnormal shoulder biomechanics following&#xD;
      clavicular shortening possibly resulting in pain, shoulder motion impairment and loss of&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Constant Score was used to assess the shoulder function and activity preoperatively as&#xD;
      well as during the routine follow-up examinations in our outpatient clinic. Subsequently the&#xD;
      original Constant Score values were converted according to Gerber et al. to receive a&#xD;
      normative age- and sex-specific Constant Score (relative Constant Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implant&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LCP (locking compression plate) superior anterior clavicle plate with lateral extension&#xD;
      (Depuy) is an anatomically precontoured fixation system with three to eight medial shaft&#xD;
      holes for 3.5 mm locking or 3.5 mm cortex screws and six lateral 2.7 mm divergent locking or&#xD;
      2.4 mm cortex screws. This implant was used for treatment of all enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique and rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent surgery placed in a beachchair position with the affected arm in a&#xD;
      mobile position. A longitudinal skin incision was set below the clavicle with subsequent&#xD;
      incision through the clavi-pectoral fascia also in longitudinal direction to allow for a&#xD;
      later closure to ensure sufficient soft tissue coverage. After exposure of the non- or&#xD;
      malunion a complex multidimensional osteotomy of the clavicle with medial and lateral axial&#xD;
      correction up to vital bone was performed. Vital bone was verified by local blood&#xD;
      extravasation resulting from drilling the previously osteotomized bone segments. The&#xD;
      tricortical iliac crest bone graft was harvested according to the size assessed in the&#xD;
      preoperative CT scan, consecutively adapted to the intraoperative measured size of the bony&#xD;
      defect. After implantation of the bone graft the LCP was centered onto the clavicular shaft.&#xD;
      At least three screws should be placed medially and laterally to the bone graft to ensure&#xD;
      sufficient biomechanical stability. Before drilling the screw holes the plate position was&#xD;
      controlled by fluoroscopy. If necessary the iliac crest bone graft should additionally be&#xD;
      fixed by a suture cerclage (Fiber- Wire, Arthrex). After a final radiographical examination&#xD;
      the wound was closed layer by layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding postoperative rehabilitation primarily the affected arm was immobilized in a sling&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. Patients started physiotherapy on the first postoperative day following a&#xD;
      standard rehabilitation protocol: abduction and flexion were restricted to 30° for the first&#xD;
      two weeks, to 60° for the week three and four postoperative and to 90° for week five and six&#xD;
      postoperative. Full weight bearing was not allowed before week 12 postoperative. 3, 6, 12 and&#xD;
      24 weeks postoperatively radiographs were performed to evaluate bone healing.&#xD;
