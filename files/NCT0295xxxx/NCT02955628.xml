  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label, phase II study of ibrutinib 560 mg in combination with&#xD;
      R-ICE for treatment of transplant-eligible relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive R-ICE therapy for 2 cycles followed by PET-CT assessment (PET-2).&#xD;
      Ibrutinib 560 mg will be added to the RICE regimen based on results of PET-2 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in CR will continue with 2 more cycles of R-ICE and proceed onto ASCT. These&#xD;
           patients will not receive ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with stable disease or achieving a response that is less than CR, ibrutinib&#xD;
           560 mg will be added. The combination of ibrutinib-RICE will be given for 2 cycles and&#xD;
           will be followed by PET-CT assessment (PET-4). Patients who achieve ≥ PR at this point&#xD;
           will proceed onto ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have disease progression will be removed from the trial. Hematopoietic stem&#xD;
           cell harvesting can be performed following count recovery at any cycle of R-ICE, but&#xD;
           preferably cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant conditioning regimen will be with standard BEAM chemotherapy (carmustine,&#xD;
      etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ASCT, ibrutinib will be given as maintenance therapy for patients who did not&#xD;
      achieve a CR at the time of PET-2 assessment. This will be continued for up to 1 year after&#xD;
      ASCT.&#xD;
