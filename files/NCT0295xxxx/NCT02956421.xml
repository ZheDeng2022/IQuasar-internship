    <textblock>
      Phase II clinical study for an investigational PIKA(Polyinosinic Polycytidylic Acid Based&#xD;
      Adjuvant) rabies vaccine comprising Inactivated and Purified Rabies Virus (IPRV) and the PIKA&#xD;
      adjuvant. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile&#xD;
      of the vaccine composition in healthy adult volunteers under the accelerated regimen. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to achieve higher seroconversion of the vaccine under accelerated&#xD;
      regimen at Day 7.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A multi-center, open labelled, randomized study in healthy naïve adult subjects. Subjects&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to groups A (60) and B (60). Group A as a control arm of the study,&#xD;
      had received a commercially available rabies vaccine, RABIPUR®. Group B had received doses of&#xD;
      the investigational PIKA rabies vaccine in an accelerated regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A followed the vaccine regimen of (1-1-1-1),one injection on days 0, 3, 7 and 14 was&#xD;
      administered respectively. Group B received the accelerated regimen (2-2-1), two injections&#xD;
      on both days 0 and 3 were administered in different arms; and only one injection was&#xD;
      administered on day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each vaccine dose comprise 1.0 ml of PIKA rabies vaccine for Group B and 1.0 ml of RABIPUR®&#xD;
      for Group A after reconstitution. The route of administration is intramuscular injection,&#xD;
      given in the deltoid region of the arm.&#xD;
