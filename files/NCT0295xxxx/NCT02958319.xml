      Clinical follow-up of Anti-Carbamylated Antibody Status in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients at&#xD;
      6, 12 and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concept&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with positive antibodies against carbamylated&#xD;
      proteins (anti-CarP) have a more severe clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune based pathophysiology of RA is one of the most studied. We already know that the&#xD;
      citrullinated peptide antigen inducing antibody formation and subsequent anti-cyclic&#xD;
      citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. In some patients can explain the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations. However it is also apparent that some groups of patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis who do not have anti-CCP antibodies. It is possible then the presence of a variety&#xD;
      of antigens exposed during the disease, and perhaps different clinical presentations&#xD;
      associated with each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of anti-CCP antibodies has been included in the classification criteria of RA&#xD;
      developed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 2010 and generated the presence of&#xD;
      two sub-groups of patients with RA, the positive and negative for anti-CCP. It is very&#xD;
      important to study the presence of anti-CCP antibodies in RA population because it influences&#xD;
      the clinical behavior and response to treatment. In very early or undifferentiated arthritis,&#xD;
      the presence of anti-CCP antibodies can predict the presence of erosions in the course of the&#xD;
      disease. On the other hand, patients with negative anti-CCP antibodies tend to have better&#xD;
      responses to treatment with methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially it was thought that the obvious pathophysiological link between RA and&#xD;
      citrullinated peptides leading to formation of antibodies was the apparent cause of the&#xD;
      clinical manifestations, but soon it was demonstrated that there were groups of patients with&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of RA that did not had anti-CCP antibodies so its genesis was not&#xD;
      explained by citrullination. Then it is possible a diversity of antigens exposed during the&#xD;
      illness and perhaps different clinical presentations associated with each one or its&#xD;
      combinations. So actually, some studies are attempting to show other possible antigens&#xD;
      involved in RA and one of them uses homocitrulline as an antigenic basis to RA&#xD;
      pathophysiology. The carbamylation or homocitrullination is a posttranslational modification&#xD;
      of proteins that occurs when the amino acid lysine reacts with cyanate in a&#xD;
      non-enzyme-mediated process generating homocitrulline. Mydel, Bokarewa and cols. demonstrated&#xD;
      that immunization of mice with homocitrulline- and citrulline-containing peptides leads to&#xD;
      development of erosive arthritis following intra-articular injection of&#xD;
      homocitrulline-containing peptides and proposed that homocitrulline induced activation of T&#xD;
      cells is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis as it serves as an&#xD;
      initial triggering event for neo-epitope recognition of citrulline containing peptides.&#xD;
      Recently It has been shown that rheumatoid arthritis patients has homocitrullinated proteins&#xD;
      in his joints which can trigger an inflammatory response with formation of antibodies against&#xD;
      homocitrulline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shi et al. showed in a study of 571 RA patients and 350 healthy subjects the following&#xD;
      statements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anti-carbamylated peptide (Anti-CarP) antibodies are different from Anti-CCP&#xD;
           antibodies and they do not cross-react.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Anti-CarP antibodies are present in sera of patients with RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-CarP antibodies are found in sera of patients without anti-CCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Anti-CarP antibodies are associated with increased progression to radiographic&#xD;
           damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, autoantibodies recognizing anti-CarP are a promising new serological marker for anti&#xD;
      CCP antibodies negative RA and are associated with a more severe clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with RA with positive antibodies against anti-CarP have a more severe clinical&#xD;
      course and elevated cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a parallel study for clinical follow-up , observational.&#xD;

      median with standard deviation (SD) and interquartile range (IQR) as corresponds,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary end point, chi square test the percentage of DAS28-ESR remission by group&#xD;
