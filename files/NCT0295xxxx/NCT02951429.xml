    <textblock>
      This Phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international study will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sildenafil or placebo added to pirfenidone&#xD;
      (Esbriet) treatment in participants with advanced IPF and intermediate or high probability of&#xD;
      Group 3 pulmonary hypertension (PH) who are on a stable dose of pirfenidone with demonstrated&#xD;
      tolerability. Participants will be randomized to receive 1 year of treatment with either oral&#xD;
      sildenafil or matching placebo while continuing to take pirfenidone.&#xD;

    <description>The World Health Organisation (WHO) functional class system defines the severity of an participant's symptoms.&#xD;
Class II - Participants with Pulmonary Hypertension resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue breathlessness, fatigue (tiredness), or activities that can cause chest pain, dizziness or even black outs.&#xD;
Class III - Participants with Pulmonary Hypertension resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue breathlessness, fatigue (tiredness), or activities that can cause chest pain, dizziness or even black outs.&#xD;
Class IV - participants with pulmonary hypertension with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These participants manifest signs of right heart failure, breathlessness and /or fatigue, which may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</description>

    <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in participants with diseases of airways obstruction. Three component scores are calculated, where the higher the component result the worse the condition:&#xD;
Symptoms concerned with the effect of respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity (range: 0-16.61) Activity concerned with activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness (range: 0-30.31) Impacts covers a range of aspects concerned with social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease (range: 0- 53.08) Total score summaries the impact of disease on overall health status. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and 0 indicates best possible health status.</description>

    <description>The UCSD-SOBQ is a respiratory questionnaire and it assesses dyspnea associated with activities of daily living (ADL). Participants indicate severity of SOB on a 6-point scale in 21 ADL. Three additional questions ask about fear of harm from overexertion, limitations and fear caused by SOB. A total score ranges from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating greater impairment.</description>

        <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in participants with diseases of airways obstruction. Three component scores are calculated, where the higher the component result the worse the condition:&#xD;
Symptoms concerned with the effect of respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity (range: 0-16.61) Activity concerned with activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness (range: 0-30.31) Impacts covers a range of aspects concerned with social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airway disease (range: 0- 53.08) Total score summaries the impact of disease on overall health status. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and 0 indicates best possible health status.</description>

        <title>University of California, San Diego-Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ) Changes From Baseline at Week 52</title>
        <description>The UCSD-SOBQ is a respiratory questionnaire and it assesses dyspnea associated with activities of daily living (ADL). Participants indicate severity of SOB on a 6-point scale in 21 ADL. Three additional questions ask about fear of harm from overexertion, limitations and fear caused by SOB. A total score ranges from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating greater impairment.</description>
