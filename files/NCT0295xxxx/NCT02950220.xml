  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib when given together&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Given pembrolizumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients with non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the&#xD;
      combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression-free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival of the combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the relationship between prognostic parameters including ki-67 staining, PD-1&#xD;
      staining and cell of origin (activated B-cell or ABC versus germinal center B-cell or GCB)&#xD;
      with ORR to the combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine relationship between gene mutations and resistance to therapy with the&#xD;
      combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL (BTK, PLC&#xD;
      gamma 2, PD-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate and monitor effects on B-, T-, and natural killer (NK)-cell function with&#xD;
      the combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ibrutinib followed by a phase Ib study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years and every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
