      The purpose of the research study is to test new methods that could improve diagnosis and&#xD;
      assessment of brain tumors. One of these methods is a new MR (magnetic resonance) imaging&#xD;
      technique called magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), which allows for rapidly scanning&#xD;
      the patient and provides quantitative information on tumor tissue. The investigators will&#xD;
      compare the data gathered from MR Fingerprinting with other imaging tests, clinical&#xD;
      information, treatment details and biopsy results to evaluate the accuracy of this new&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the utility of quantitative MRI imaging&#xD;
      including 3D-MRF in differentiating among different brain tumors and differentiating&#xD;
      recurrent brain tumor (TR) from treatment effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluating the correlation between quantitative MRI imaging with&#xD;
      histopathological characteristics and genetic markers in pre-therapy setting and with&#xD;
      treatment response and clinical outcomes in post treatment setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: All patients with newly diagnosed intra-axial brain neoplasms undergo volumetric MRI&#xD;
      study with contrast for surgical planning or clinical diagnosis. Diffusion, diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging and perfusion imaging are often performed as a part of standard clinical imaging. In&#xD;
      addition to these acquisitions, the research 3D-MRF acquisition through the entire tumor will&#xD;
      be acquired. The imaging parameters will be correlated individually and in combination with&#xD;
      biopsy/ resection outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2: All patients with brain tumors who present at post therapy follow up with imaging&#xD;
      progression undergo serial imaging as a part of clinical care. The research 3D-MRF&#xD;
      acquisitions will be added to these clinical scans. All the quantitative parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated individually and in combination to differentiate post treatment changes from tumor&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;

    <description>Non-contrast MRF acquisition will be acquired through the region of tumor in all patients. For patients receiving intravenous gadolinium based contrast, a post contrast MRF acquisition will also be acquired. This acquisition will be skipped in patients who do not receive or are not eligible for receiving IV contrast as a part of their clinical scan. The research scan will take approximately 10-15 minutes</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of intra-axial brain tumor at initial diagnosis or patients with known&#xD;
             treated brain tumors on follow-up with concern for imaging progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document,&#xD;
             or, in cases where the patient may have cognitive impairment, consent by a legal&#xD;
             authorized representative or power of attorney&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ferromagnetic or otherwise non-MRI compatible aneurysm clips.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of an implanted pacemaker or implanted defibrillator device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with contraindications for MRI due to embedded foreign metallic objects.&#xD;
             Bullets, shrapnel, metalwork fragments, or other metallic material adds unnecessary&#xD;
             risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. Regular clinical practice already excludes pregnant patients from&#xD;
             gadolinium contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted medical device not described above that is not MRI-compatible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of severe claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners and members of other vulnerable populations will be excluded from this&#xD;
             study. The subject selection population will not regularly include prisoners and other&#xD;
             vulnerable population members as these populations will not provide any additional&#xD;
             unique information to or uniquely benefit from the study. Non-English speaking&#xD;
             population will be excluded from the study due to lack of sufficient resources to pay&#xD;
             for translator and interpreter services.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minors will be excluded.&#xD;
