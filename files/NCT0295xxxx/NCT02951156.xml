      Study B9991011 is a multi-center, international, randomized, open label, 2 component (Phase&#xD;
      1b followed by Phase 3), parallel-arm study of avelumab in combination with various agents&#xD;
      for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The target study population of this Phase 1b/3 registrational study is patients with R/R&#xD;
      DLBCL who have completed at least 2 (but not more than 4) lines of prior rituximab-containing&#xD;
      multi-agent chemotherapy, and/or in whom autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has failed,&#xD;
      or who are not candidates for ASCT or who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Patients who are ineligible for intensive second line chemotherapy must have received at&#xD;
      least one prior rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy regimen. The study will assess&#xD;
      the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity of the 3 avelumab-based&#xD;
      combination regimens tested, and collect patient reported outcome (PRO) data.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study included participants with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after completion of at least 2 and not more than 4 lines of rituximab-containing multi-agent chemotherapy (prior to this study), and/or in whom autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has failed, or who were not candidates for ASCT or who were not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was planned to be conducted into two phases: Phase 1b and Phase 3. Phase 3 of the study was never conducted due to early termination of study because of Phase 1b enrollment closure.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Avelumab 10 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenous (IV) infusion was administered every 2 weeks on Day 2 and Day 16 of Cycles 1 and 2, if well tolerated then continued on Day 1 and Day 15 in Cycle 3 and all subsequent cycles, until the participant no longer received clinical benefit. Rituximab 375 milligram per meter square (mg/m^2) IV infusion was administered on Day 1 of each treatment cycle (maximum of 8 cycles), along with fixed dose of 100 mg IV infusion of utomilumab on Day 2 of each treatment cycle in Cycles 1 and 2. If the dose of utomilumab was well tolerated, then it was administered on Day 1 of Cycle 3 and all subsequent cycles until the participant no longer received clinical benefit.

        <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by investigator per lugano response classification criteria. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake less than or equal to [&lt;=] mediastinum), or 3 (uptake less than [&lt;] mediastinum but &lt;=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-point scale (5-PS), for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow. PR was defined as &gt;=50% decrease in SPD of up to six of the largest dominant lymph nodes, no increase in size of other nodes, liver, or spleen volume, a &gt;=50% decrease in sum of products of diameters (SPD) of hepatic and splenic nodules, absence of other organ involvement, and no new sites of disease.</description>

        <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. As per NCI-CTCAE version 4.03,severity was graded as Grade 1:asymptomatic/mild symptoms,clinical/diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2:moderate, minimal, local/noninvasive intervention indicated,limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life (ADL); Grade 3:severe/medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4:life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5:death related to AE. TEAE was defined as events which occurred during on-treatment period beginning with first dose of study treatment through minimum (30 days + last dose of study treatment or start of new anti-cancer drug therapy). In this outcome measure participant with any TEAE of Grade 3 or above are reported.</description>

Disease Control (DC) was defined as the best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). CR: score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake &lt;= mediastinum), or 3 (uptake less than &lt;mediastinum but &lt;=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow. PR: &gt;=50% decrease in SPD of up to six of the largest dominant lymph nodes, no increase in size of other nodes, liver, or spleen volume, a &gt;=50% decrease in SPD of hepatic and splenic nodules, absence of other organ involvement, and no new sites of disease. SD: &lt;50% decrease in SDP of up to 6 dominant, measurable nodes and extranodal sites; no criteria for progressive disease met. To qualify as a best overall response of SD, at least one SD assessment must be observed &gt;=6 weeks after start date and before disease progression.</description>

        <description>Investigator assessed PFS was defined as time (in months) from date of randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. PFS data was censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment for participants who had no an event (PD or death), for participants who start a new anti-cancer therapy prior to an event or for participants with an event after 2 or more missing or inadequate post-baseline tumor assessment. Participants without an adequate baseline or post-baseline tumor assessment were censored on the date of randomization unless death occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment in which case the death was considered as an event.</description>
