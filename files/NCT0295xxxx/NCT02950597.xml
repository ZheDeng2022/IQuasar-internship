      Study Details&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the study design? (eg, randomized, double-blind) Observational Prospective Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the overall objectives of the study? This project is designed to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of using a non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring device in heart failure outpatient&#xD;
      clinics. There will be no alteration to patient management for this study. Rather this study&#xD;
      seeks to assess the utility of the device by evaluating for the parameters obtained from the&#xD;
      device to hospital admission.&#xD;

      B. BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nearly five million Americans experience heart failure (HF) and greater than 250,000 die&#xD;
      annually. 1 The prevalence has continued to increase with the aging of the US population and&#xD;
      HF is now the leading cause of hospitalization among adults &gt;65 in the United states. Despite&#xD;
      remarkable improvements in medical therapy, the prognosis of patients with myocardial failure&#xD;
      remains poor, with almost 20% of patients dying within 1 year of initial diagnosis and &gt; 80%&#xD;
      8-year mortality. 2 In addition patients who are admitted to the hospital for heart failure&#xD;
      have over a 50% readmission rate within six months of discharge. 3,4 These patients require&#xD;
      routine clinical care and often require diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. This project&#xD;
      seeks to assess if the use of hemodynamic (HD) monitoring technologies (ClearSight/Nexfin)&#xD;
      that are currently used in the intraoperative and critical care settings can provide utility&#xD;
      by demonstrating associations between alterations in a patients HD values to the likelihood&#xD;
      of hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-invasive HD device utilized (Nexfin, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) provided&#xD;
      flow-guided cardiovascular parameters that were captured for each clinic visit for up to 24&#xD;
      months. Analysis was performed between the most recent prior clinic visits for patients who&#xD;
      were hospitalized for HF exacerbation to those who were not hospitalized. HD data was not&#xD;
      used to guide clinical care. A Cox hazard model using a log transformation of HD variables as&#xD;
      the covariates, was applied to describe hospital admission.&#xD;
