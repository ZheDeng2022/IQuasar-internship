  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have suggested that consumers who can choose what to eat could find food&#xD;
      more pleasant, and consume more of that food, than when in absence of choice. However&#xD;
      cognitive mechanisms that could explain the effect of choice have not been investigated. The&#xD;
      study consists in a fMRI experiment intended to observe the effect of the presence of choice&#xD;
      on brain activity following consumption of a fruit-flavored drink, compared to the brain&#xD;
      activity when the same drink is consumed without choice. It is suggested that consumers will&#xD;
      appreciate drinks they chose better, and that the activity in gustatory and reward regions&#xD;
      will change accordingly to changes in declared food pleasure.&#xD;

      The study will include one inclusion session (S1), one out-of-the-magnet tasting session&#xD;
      (S2), and one fMRI session (S3). For all sessions, study drinks used are fruit-flavored&#xD;
      drinks and fruit juices available on the French market. All subjects will undergo the same&#xD;
      protocol, except for the choice of the three study drinks that will be done individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S1. After the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been verified, the subjects will perform&#xD;
      tests to verify their gustatory/olfactory functions (four basic tastes testing and ETOC&#xD;
      test). They will then taste study drinks, blindly, and rate perceived pleasantness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S2. The out-of-the-magnet tasting session will include three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      S2.1 - familiarization with the study procedures. Subjects will be placed in conditions&#xD;
      mimicking the fMRI session: they will be asked to lie in supine position, head placed in a&#xD;
      false head coil, with the gustometer fixed above their mouth and a video screen visible to&#xD;
      them to deliver instructions (visual paradigm created using E-Prime). They also will be given&#xD;
      a rolling wheel to collect feedback. The rest of the session will be spent in this position.&#xD;
      Subjects will then taste the whole range of study drinks (each drink twice, in a randomized&#xD;
      order) and rate their pleasantness on visual analog scales (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      S2.2. - learning picture-drink associations. Three drinks will be chosen based on the ratings&#xD;
      given during the first part of the session (three equally appreciated, well-liked (VAS score&#xD;
      &gt;50) drinks). Subjects will then taste these three drinks repeatedly while observing abstract&#xD;
      pictures. The objective of this sequence is to learn 3 picture-drink pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S2.3 - associative learning verification. Subjects will taste each of the three drinks and&#xD;
      choose the picture to which each drink has been associated. If they fail once, the S2.2 and&#xD;
      S2.3 sequences will be repeated. If they fail to learn associations at the second&#xD;
      verification, they will be excluded form the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S3. The fMRI session's objective is to study cognitive correlates of choice. Subjects will be&#xD;
      placed in a 3Tesla fMRI scanner, with the gustometer, visual screen and rolling wheel&#xD;
      available as in the S2. The functional fMRI scan will be done using high-resolution protocol&#xD;
      (1,5*1,5*1,8mm) covering prefrontal, subcortical and occipital brain areas. Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo 80 tastings. In 50% of tastings, they will view the three previously learned pictures&#xD;
      and freely choose one of them, then receive 1ml of the drink associated with that picture. In&#xD;
      the other 50% of tastings, the picture-drink pair will be received without the possibility to&#xD;
      choose. The &quot;no choice&quot; tastings will be computed according to the results of &quot;choice&quot;&#xD;
      tastings so that each drink will be consumed the same amount of times in &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;no&#xD;
      choice&quot; context.&#xD;
