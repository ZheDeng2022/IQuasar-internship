      This project aims to evaluate, in recent post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients on&#xD;
      dual antiplatelet therapy, the impact of regular exercise training on platelet aggregability&#xD;
      and the correlation between the level of platelet aggregability and muscle sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      activity (MSNA).&#xD;

      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Platelet reactivity is closely involved in the pathophysiology of acute coronary&#xD;
           syndromes (ACS). However, despite the development of newer and more effective&#xD;
           antiplatelet drugs (among other therapeutic interventions), the risk of ischemic events&#xD;
           recurrence after an episode of ACS is still high.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the other hand, acute and strenuous exercise, a known trigger of ACS, when performed&#xD;
           by untrained individuals, leads to sympathetic hyperactivity and increased platelet&#xD;
           aggregability. Contrary to these findings, regular supervised exercise training leads to&#xD;
           regulation of the autonomic system with consequent decrease in the incidence of ACS, as&#xD;
           shown in previous studies. However, the relationship between regular supervised exercise&#xD;
           training on platelet activity in patients post-AMI on dual antiplatelet therapy, has not&#xD;
           been previously studied and is the main goal of the present project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This project aims to evaluate, in recent post-AMI patients on dual antiplatelet therapy,&#xD;
           the impact of regular exercise training on platelet aggregability, analyzed by&#xD;
           VerifyNowP2Y12® test. Secondary exploratory analysis includes: 1) the influence of acute&#xD;
           and strenuous exercise on platelet aggregability measured immediately after the two&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) that patients will be submitted; 2) the&#xD;
           correlation between the level of platelet aggregability and MSNA in trained and control&#xD;
           groups; 3) the influence of exercise training on platelet aggregability measured by&#xD;
           Multiplate® adenosine diphosphate (ADP) test and Multiplate® aspirin (ASPI) test; 4) the&#xD;
           influence of exercise training on the mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet count; 5)&#xD;
           the influence of exercise training in other laboratorial parameters as lipids, blood&#xD;
           glucose and inflammatory activity; 6) finally, the primary endpoint of the study will be&#xD;
           evaluated in different prespecified subgroups such as diabetics, elderly, obese and&#xD;
           patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Primary endpoint of the study: Evaluate the influence of regular supervised&#xD;
           exercise training for 3 months on platelet aggregability, analyzed by VerifyNowP2Y12®&#xD;
           test, in patients with recent AMI utilizing dual antiplatelet therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Main secondary analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Evaluate platelet aggregability immediately after acute exercise before and after the&#xD;
           exercise training period; for this propose, blood sample will be drawn immediately after&#xD;
           the first and second cardiopulmonary exercise testings, in trained and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Correlate the platelet aggregability level, evaluated by VerifyNowP2Y12®,&#xD;
           Multiplate-ADP®, Multiplate-ASPI®, with the level of MSNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3. Other exploratory analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Evaluate the primary endpoint of the study utilizing Multiplate-ASPI® and&#xD;
           Multiplate-ADP®;&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Evaluate the MPV in trained and control groups, and its correlation with platelet&#xD;
           aggregability;&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Analyze, in trained and control groups, the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Platelet count; LDL-cholesterol; HDL-cholesterol; Triglycerides; Lipid transference for&#xD;
           HDL; Fasting glucose; Glycated hemoglobin; C-reactive protein (CRP) ultrasensitive;&#xD;
           B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP); Troponin and Creatine Kinase MB-mass peak obtained&#xD;
           during hospitalization; Genetic polymorphisms; Heart rate variability and spontaneous&#xD;
           baroreflex control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. Analyze the primary endpoint within the following subgroups, taking into account the&#xD;
           parameters obtained during hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sex (male / female); ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-STEMI;&#xD;
           Basal heart rate (&lt;70 or ≥ 70 bpm); History of arterial hypertension (presence or&#xD;
           absence); LDL levels (&lt;100 or ≥ 100 mg/dL); Age ≥65 years and &lt;65 years; Body Mass Index&#xD;
           &lt;30 or ≥ 30 kg / m2; Creatinine clearance (MDRD) &lt;60ml / min / m2 or ≥ 60 ml / min / m2;&#xD;
           Current or not smoking; History of diabetes (present or absent); HbA1c &lt;6.5 or ≥ 6.5%;&#xD;
           GRACE risk score ≥140 and &lt;140; Beta-blocker use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized study. Patients with stable AMI admitted to a Coronary Care&#xD;
      Unit, eligible to participate, will be randomized to a supervised exercise training program&#xD;
      for three months at a rehabilitation unit or to a control group not formally trained.&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate will be included after the necessary explanations and the&#xD;
      signature of the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.a. Sample size calculation: To perform the sample calculation, previously published data&#xD;
      wich showed platelet agreeability average of 32.9 ± 16 P2Y12 reactions units (PRU) in&#xD;
      post-AMI patients on ticagrelor was utilizes. For an expected 35% decrease in platelet&#xD;
      aggregability at trained group, and taking into account power of 80% and alpha index of 0.05,&#xD;
      including 31 patients in each group is required. Admitting a percentage of losses of 40%&#xD;
      given the difficulties inherent in the assessment of the sympathetic activity and adherence&#xD;
      to the training program, the initial plan contemplates the inclusion of 90 patients in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study design: Prospective study in which eligible patients with uncomplicated AMI admitted&#xD;
      to a Coronary Care Unit will be randomized to performing a exercise training program by three&#xD;
      months or for an untrained control group, at a 1:1 or 1:2 rate, in order to adjust for more&#xD;
      frequent early follow-up interruptions in exercise training group. All patients included&#xD;
      after the necessary explanations and after signing the informed consent form. The patients&#xD;
      will be submitted to the collection of material for laboratory evaluation including platelet&#xD;
      aggregability tests, the assessment of a CPET in 01 and 04 months of the follow-up (end of&#xD;
      treatment). The MSNA will be performed at the end of followup.&#xD;
