      The aim of this study is to compare three different regimens for continuation of induction of&#xD;
      labor after no spontaneous or artificial rupture of membranes could be achieved after first&#xD;
      24 hours post-insertion of Dinoprostone&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized study will be carried out at delivery suite in Warwick Hospital after&#xD;
      eligible women have been informed of the study when booked for induction of labor and&#xD;
      provided with the study information leaflet&#xD;
&#xD;
      When attending for induction of labor on delivery suite, an informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      then all women will have a cardiotocogram (CTG) performed initially and will be assessed by&#xD;
      vaginal examination and Bishop score recorded at insertion of first slow-release pessary&#xD;
      (Propess®10 mg Dinoprostone; CTS, UK), which will be inserted high into the posterior vaginal&#xD;
      fornix. Assessment and insertion of pessary will be done by an experienced obstetrician or a&#xD;
      senior midwife&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will be given the required care and support as per the local protocols and&#xD;
      guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be excluded from the study within the first 24 hours of induction of labor in the&#xD;
      following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with abnormal or non-reassuring CTG needing intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women needing tocolytic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women needing removal of the Dinoprostone pessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women needing emergency Caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If spontaneous rupture of membranes occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If artificial rupture of membranes is achievable after the first 24 hours of induction&#xD;
           of labor (Bishop score 5 or more)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If woman withdraws her consent to continue as a part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 24 hours from insertion of the first Dinoprostone pessary, women will be reassessed and&#xD;
      a total of 330 women with Bishop score less than 7, will be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      intervention groups by a pre-formed computer-generated random list and randomization put in&#xD;
      sealed opaque envelopes kept in a locked secure area on delivery suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention groups will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (110 women):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will have the initial slow-release Dinoprostone pessary left in place for six more&#xD;
      hours (total of 30 hours in place) then removed followed by vaginal assessment 48 hours after&#xD;
      the start of labour induction and insertion of a second slow-release pessary if required&#xD;
      (Currently Propess® is not licensed to be repeated as a second dose. However, there is a&#xD;
      consensus that, the dose may be repeated after a consultant review and an informed verbal&#xD;
      consent as per SWH 00190 Induction and Augmentation of the First and Second Stage of Labour&#xD;
      Management Guideline, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (110 women):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will have the initial slow-release Dinoprostone pessary removed followed by insertion&#xD;
      of quick-release Dinoprostone tablet (Prostin® 3 mg Dinoprostone vaginal tablet; Pfizer, UK)&#xD;
      high in the posterior vaginal fornix immediately after removal of the slow-release pessary.&#xD;
      The tablet will be left for 6 hours followed by vaginal reassessment and insertion of a&#xD;
      second tablet if ARM is still not achievable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 (110 women):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will have the initial slow-release Dinoprostone pessary removed followed by insertion&#xD;
      of 1-5 Osmotic cervical rods (Dilapan-S® Aquacryl hydrogel rod; HPSRx Enterprises, USA) by a&#xD;
      senior obstetrician or a midwife into the cervical canal, immediately after removal of the&#xD;
      slow-release pessary using a vaginal speculum and a holder. The rods will be left for 12-24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, after achieving spontaneous or artificial rupture of membranes, the&#xD;
      local protocol for intrapartum care will be followed and after delivery, the women will be&#xD;
      asked to fill in a patient's satisfaction questionnaire about the process of induction, care&#xD;
      given and being a part of the study&#xD;
