      The purpose of this Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) study is to collect initial&#xD;
      data regarding biodistribution, reproducibility, and dosimetry for the radiotracer Ga-68&#xD;
      PSMA-HBED-CC, an agent which may be useful for the early detection of metastatic prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Investigators will use a test and re-test design in all patients to determine&#xD;
      reproducibility of lesion detection and signal intensity, and will include dynamic imaging in&#xD;
      some patients for the purposes of dosimetry. Patients with known metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
      will be recruited and imaged on two occasions within the course of 15 days.&#xD;

      Prostate cancer (PCa) represents the most common noncutaneous cancer and second most common&#xD;
      cause of cancer related death among men in the United States and worldwide. Individual PCa&#xD;
      tumor behavior is variable. Some tumors show slow indolent growth patterns and may never&#xD;
      become clinically significant while others are aggressive and lead to metastases and death.&#xD;
      PCa most commonly metastasizes to bone and lymph nodes. Lungs, liver, and adrenal glands are&#xD;
      less frequent metastatic sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate staging and risk stratification is essential to optimal management. Pelvic lymph&#xD;
      node dissection (PLND) which is performed along with radical prostatectomy is the gold&#xD;
      standard for detection of occult nodal metastases but is invasive and has associated&#xD;
      morbidity. PLND offers an additional therapeutic benefit in some patients, but is also&#xD;
      associated with potential complications and can still underestimate the extent of nodal&#xD;
      metastases as 40-50% fall outside the traditional dissection zones [6]. Furthermore, fewer&#xD;
      patients are presenting with nodal metastases at initial presentation due to stage migration,&#xD;
      so more PLNDs need to be performed to benefit one patient. Therefore there is a clear need&#xD;
      for noninvasive imaging options to assist with early and accurate detection of nodal&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC is a urea-based small molecular inhibitor that targets an enzymatic site on&#xD;
      the extracellular domain of the PSMA membrane protein. Based on strong preclinical evidence,&#xD;
      a number of clinical studies of 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT have been performed. Afshar-Oromieh&#xD;
      et al. showed detection of lesions suspicious for PCa metastases in 84% of a cohort of&#xD;
      patients (n=37) being investigated for biochemical relapse, clarification of suspicious&#xD;
      findings on other modalities, or evaluation for possible 131I PSMA ligands. In a larger&#xD;
      retrospective study (n=319) Afshar-Oromieh et al. showed that 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT&#xD;
      detected PCa in 83% of patients with suspected recurrence. In another study Afshar-Oromieh et&#xD;
      al compared 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT to 18F fluoromethylcholine (FCH) PET/CT. At least one&#xD;
      PCa lesion was detected in 87% of patients with 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC versus 70% of patients with&#xD;
      18F FCH. Among patients in whom PSA values were &lt;2.82 ng/ml at least one lesion could be&#xD;
      detected in 69% of patients with 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC and 44% patients with 18F FCH.&#xD;
      Tumor-to-background ratios were higher for 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC. In the aforementioned studies&#xD;
      by Afshar-Oromieh et al. 49 patients with positive scans were further evaluated by biopsy or&#xD;
      surgery and were confirmed as PCa with no false positives. Morigi et al. also showed the&#xD;
      superiority of 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC over 18F FCH in PET/CT. Detection rates 68Ga&#xD;
      PSMA-HBED-CCPET/CT in multiple studies are higher than for rates reported in the literature&#xD;
      for 11C Choline, 18F Choline, and 11C Acetate [20]. Most importantly the detection rates 68Ga&#xD;
      PSMA-HBED-CCPET/CT in patients with low PSA (&lt;0.5 ng/ml) are more favorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus preclinical and clinical studies show that 68Ga PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT is a promising&#xD;
      radiotracer for the early detection of metastatic or recurrent PCa even with low serum PSA&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
