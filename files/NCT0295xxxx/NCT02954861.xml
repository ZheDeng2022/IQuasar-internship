  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      'Post perfusion syndrome' was a term historically associated to cardiac surgery in view of&#xD;
      the transient neuro-cognitive deficits attributed to cardio pulmonary bypass pump. During&#xD;
      their recovery period, a significant number of patients experience delirium, a clinical&#xD;
      syndrome of acute onset and fluctuant course.Though these deficits are often known to be&#xD;
      transient without any permanent physical or neurological impairment, the experience can still&#xD;
      psycho-socially affect these patients for a longer length of time even after discharge. The&#xD;
      presence of delirium puts excessive, undesired strain on the patient, their families, health&#xD;
      care providers and hospital resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSS is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. It&#xD;
      is known to either develop immediately after the disturbing event or weeks and months later.&#xD;
      The actual symptoms can be varied but are categorized in three sections: i.e.:&#xD;
      re-experiencing, avoidance and emotional numbing and hyperarousal (feeling 'on edge').&#xD;
&#xD;
      A problem that has such an impact on any patient is worth investigating and understood&#xD;
      better. Being in such a unique professional position, as a Clinical nurse practitioner, the&#xD;
      investigator is ideally placed to conduct this study. In this study, the researcher will be&#xD;
      focusing on the pre-operative risk factors in developing delirium, actual incidence of&#xD;
      delirium and follow the patients post operatively to evaluate the after effects of delirium&#xD;
      in the form of PTSS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is acute onset of fluctuant cognitive state. Post operative delirium is a&#xD;
      historically known complication after cardiac surgery. In 2013, almost 900 heart operations&#xD;
      were performed in a South East, Scottish Cardio Thoracic unit. and audit data shows that 45%&#xD;
      of these patients developed post operative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple pre, post &amp; intra operative factors have been attributed to the development of&#xD;
      delirium. Whatever the precipitating factors, delirium not only causes psychological distress&#xD;
      to the patient but also their loved ones. In some cases this psychological upset continues to&#xD;
      affect the patient even after discharge from the hospital referred to as post traumatic&#xD;
      stress symptoms (PTSS). This study therefore aims to look at the extent and experience of&#xD;
      post operative delirium in cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to recruit patients at a pre admission clinic where patient's baseline&#xD;
      clinical data will be collected. They will also be provided with questionnaires to complete&#xD;
      before the end of the clinic. This is to evaluate the participant's pre operative mood,&#xD;
      cognitive status and social orientation. During their hospital stay following surgery the&#xD;
      participants will be assessed routinely for delirium. If they are known to have suffered from&#xD;
      delirium, they will be enrolled to phase 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consented patients will be seen at 6 week follow up clinic where they will be provided&#xD;
      with a questionnaire to identify PTSS and also participate in a semi structured interview.&#xD;
      Three months later the same will be repeated on telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will help understand and explore this unfortunate patient experience.&#xD;

        Following discussion with statisticians and viewing the sample sizes of previous related&#xD;
        studies, it was suggested that minimum 200 patients will be required for phase I. This was&#xD;
        based on the availability of data in a similar aspects of the study. But incidentally there&#xD;
        has been no known study looking specifically at delirium and post traumatic stress symptoms&#xD;
        in cardiac surgery patients. So the researcher aims to enrol at least 400 patients but may&#xD;
        not be able to achieve this number by the end of data collection phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II will only have patients who develop delirium and convenient sampling will be&#xD;
        applied for the interview section.&#xD;
