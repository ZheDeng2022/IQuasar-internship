      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of pre-operative administration of&#xD;
      gabapentin 900 mg in management of acute post-operative pain in patients undergoing oral and&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgical procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain after surgery is a significant acute clinical symptom. It is associated with quality of&#xD;
      post-operative recovery, time spent in the hospital, post-discharge care and readmissions,&#xD;
      morbidity, psychosocial distress, and cost of care. The management of acute postsurgical pain&#xD;
      primarily consists of a multimodal approach consisting of opioids, non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and local anesthetics. The associated&#xD;
      adverse effects often limit the use of such multimodal pharmacotherapy. Opioids have&#xD;
      excellent analgesic properties, however are associated with poor adverse-effects profile.&#xD;
      They have been associated with nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and urinary retention. Such&#xD;
      adverse-effects may decrease the quality of post-operative recovery, increase patient&#xD;
      post-surgical management, and overall cost of care. Moreover, in patients undergoing oral and&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgical procedures, such adverse-effects may be further potentiated due to&#xD;
      placement of reconstructive plates, screws, and maxillomandibular fixation. In order to&#xD;
      improve post-surgical quality of care, researchers have been looking for alternative&#xD;
      modalities for the management of acute post-surgical pain. One of such modalities has been&#xD;
      use of preemptive analgesic therapy. Preemptive analgesia is defined as a treatment modality&#xD;
      that is initiated before a traumatic event, such as, surgical incision or tissue manipulation&#xD;
      is introduced. Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug that has been used in the management of&#xD;
      painful neuropathies, such as, diabetic poly-neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and&#xD;
      trigeminal neuropathy. Gabapentin has antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic properties with only&#xD;
      a minor effect on normal nociception. It reduces the hyperexcitability of dorsal horn neuron&#xD;
      induced by tissue injury, as well as, central sensitization induced after trauma and surgery.&#xD;
      Gabapentin has been studied extensively as a preemptive analgesic in various non-craniofacial&#xD;
      surgeries. In a systemic review and meta-analysis on the pre-operative administration of&#xD;
      gabapentin during various surgical procedures, Tiippana et al reported the opioid-sparing&#xD;
      effect during the first 24 h after a single dose of gabapentin 300-1200 mg, administered 1-2&#xD;
      h preoperatively, ranged from 20% to 62%. Authors further concluded that the combined effect&#xD;
      of a single dose of gabapentin was a reduction of opioid consumption equivalent to 30 +/- 4&#xD;
      mg of morphine (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) during the first 24 h after surgery. In&#xD;
      another meta-regression analysis authors reported that gabapentin reduced opioid related&#xD;
      adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention (Numbers needed to treat&#xD;
      (NNT) 25, 6, and 7, respectively). In a systematic review and meta-analysis, consisting of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials of women who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, under&#xD;
      general anesthesia, it was concluded that preemptive administration of gabapentin was&#xD;
      effective in decreasing postsurgical pain scores, narcotic consumption, and nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting episodes. Similar reduction in postsurgical pain scores, narcotic consumption, and&#xD;
      adverse effects were seen after other surgical procedures, such as, breast surgery, spinal&#xD;
      surgery, orthopedic surgical procedures, and amputation surgery. However, no such data is&#xD;
      available for major oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary aims are as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the difference in the intensity of pain, post-operatively, at 6 hours, 12&#xD;
           hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours between participants pre-operatively administered&#xD;
           gabapentin versus those pre-operatively administered a placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the difference in the total opioid consumption at 24 and 72 hours&#xD;
           post-operatively, among participants pre-operatively administered gabapentin versus&#xD;
           those pre-operatively administered a placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the difference in the time to first rescue analgesic post-operatively, among&#xD;
           participants pre-operatively administered gabapentin versus those pre-operatively&#xD;
           administered a placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the difference in the incidence of adverse effects within first 24 hours&#xD;
           and 72 hours post-operatively between participants pre-operatively administered&#xD;
           gabapentin versus those pre-operatively administered a placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the difference in the incidence and the intensity of pain at 1 month&#xD;
           post-operatively, among participants pre-operatively administered gabapentin versus&#xD;
           those pre-operatively administered a placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the differences in post-operative hospital-stay among participants&#xD;
           pre-operatively administered gabapentin versus those pre-operatively administered a&#xD;
           placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the influence of a history of a chronic pain disorder on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The association between intensity of pain and pre-emptive use of gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The association between opioid consumption and pre-emptive use of gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The difference in the time to first rescue analgesic post-operatively, among&#xD;
                participants pre-operatively administered gabapentin versus those pre-operatively&#xD;
                administered a placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants receiving gabapentin 900 mg PO 3h pre-operatively will have significantly&#xD;
           less pain at 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours post-operatively compared to&#xD;
           those receiving placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants receiving gabapentin 900 mg 3h pre-operatively will have significantly less&#xD;
           total opioid consumption at 24 and 72 hours post-operatively than those receiving&#xD;
           placebo medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be significantly fewer incidences of adverse events associated with opioid&#xD;
           consumption in participants with pre-emptive use of gabapentin medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The gabapentin group will have significantly longer time to first rescue medication&#xD;
           compared to the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment will be carried out in the department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery&#xD;
      (OMFS), Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. Relevant patients are going to&#xD;
      be identified and offered to participate in the study. This will take place during the&#xD;
      history and physical examination visit, which is conducted prior to any surgical procedure in&#xD;
      the department of OMFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a double-blind investigation, randomized, placebo-controlled drug trial.&#xD;
      Randomization of treatment group will be carried out by the hospital pharmacy using a&#xD;
      computer generated randomization template. Both investigator and participant will be blind to&#xD;
      the group allotment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation is primarily divided into two sections, the medication phase and the&#xD;
      surgical phase. In the medication phase of the investigation, treatment group will receive a&#xD;
      single dose of Gabapentin 900mg 2-3h before commencement of surgery (initial incision).&#xD;
      Placebo group will receive a single dose of placebo medication 2-3h pre-operatively (before&#xD;
      commencement of surgery). Both gabapentin and placebo medication will look similar in shape,&#xD;
      color, and size. Hospital pharmacy will be recruited to provide the placebo and gabapentin&#xD;
      medications. Hospital pharmacy will be responsible for delivering the medication to the&#xD;
      participant prior to the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgical phase of the study, all of the participants will undergo respective oral&#xD;
      and maxillofacial surgical procedure, under general anesthesia. The surgical part of this&#xD;
      investigation will not, in any way or form, be different than the usual standard of care&#xD;
      followed by the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery department, at Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital. Peri-operative and post-operative analgesic regimens will also be&#xD;
      standardized as per departmental guidelines for the respective surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that will be collected consists of following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to undergoing surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age, gender, past medical history, medical illnesses, past surgical history, past&#xD;
           hospitalization history, psychosocial history, current medications, allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Graded chronic pain scale - 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. McGill Pain-short questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgical characteristics such as, type of surgery, surgeon who performed the surgery,&#xD;
           complications during surgery, duration of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain score on an 11-point likert-type visual analog scale at 6h, 12h, 24h, 72h, 1 month&#xD;
           post-surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Opioid consumption at 24h and 72h post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vomiting/Nausea score on an 11-point likert-type visual analog scale at 6h, 12h, 24h,&#xD;
           and 72h post-surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Opioid-related symptom distress scale at 24h and 72h, post-surgically&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Duration of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Analgesic medication regimen after 1 month post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the data will be collected over 7 data collection points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit. Interested participant will undergo screening and evaluation. Participants&#xD;
      will be explained the study and consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants willing to participate will also fill out following questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graded Chronic Pain Scale 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  McGill pain questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit. Participants will be administered either a single tablet of gabapentin 900 mg&#xD;
      or a placebo medication, 2-3 hours before undergoing surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up 1. It will be carried out 6 hours post-surgically. Participant will be asked to&#xD;
      rate the level of pain, and intensity of nausea and vomiting on an 11-point likert type 0 to&#xD;
      10 scale, where 0 is indicative of no symptom and 10 is indicative of worst symptom ever. In&#xD;
      addition, information from the medical record regarding the characteristics of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure (type, surgeon, duration, complications) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up 2, 3, and 4. Follow-up 2, 3, and 4 will be carried out post-operatively, after 12&#xD;
      hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours, respectively. Participant will be asked same questions as in&#xD;
      step 3. In addition participants use of analgesic medication and stay in hospital will be&#xD;
      recorded. Further more, during follow-up 3 and 4 (24 and 72 hours post-operative,&#xD;
      respectively) participants will fill out opioid-related symptom distress scale and data on&#xD;
      type, dosage, and quantity of opioid medications consumed will be collected. If participant&#xD;
      leaves hospital prior to any of the follow-up visits, they will be contact via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up 5. These will be carried out over the phone, at 1 month post-surgically. Following&#xD;
      data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be asked questions from McGill pain-short questionnaire and&#xD;
           opioid-related symptom distress scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intensity of nausea and/or vomiting on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 is indicative of no&#xD;
           nausea and/or vomiting and 10 is indicative of worst nausea/vomiting ever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. List of analgesic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All types of opioid medications used during the investigation period for management of pain&#xD;
      will be converted to morphine sulphate PO equivalent at 0 % cross-reactivity resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 participants are going to be recruited for the present investigation. This&#xD;
      number was calculated using either effect size of 25% less consumption of opioid medications,&#xD;
      or 25% less pain score at 6h post-operatively, and alpha value of 0.05 and power of 0.95.&#xD;
      However, if 100 participants are not recruited by 12 months, recruitment process will be&#xD;
      terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multistep analytic approach will be carried out. In the first step, participants'&#xD;
      demographics, and clinical characteristics are going to be compared among participants of the&#xD;
      treatment and the placebo group, using t-tests (or non-parametric equivalent) and Chi-squared&#xD;
      (or Fisher exact) tests where appropriate. Next, using univariate and multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression analyses are going to be used to determine the efficacy of the drug.&#xD;
