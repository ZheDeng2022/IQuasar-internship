      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic ablative body radiation (SAbR) prolongs progression-free survival for patients&#xD;
      with oligometastatic kidney cancer (RCC) and delays the initiation of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the delay in time to start of systemic therapy (TTST) as a surrogate of&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first day of SAbR to start of&#xD;
      systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the modified progression-free survival (mPFS) for patients with&#xD;
           oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma who are treated with SAbR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cancer specific survival (CSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the local control rate of irradiated lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the health-related quality of life (HRQOL).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective single institution phase II single-arm open-label trial evaluating&#xD;
      SAbR in patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Statements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can local therapy (SAbR) safely delay the start of systemic therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safely delaying the start of systemic therapy can have significant quality of life&#xD;
           benefits for patients since systemic therapy has significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can SAbR be curative in truly oligometastatic RCC patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Time to start of systemic therapy (TTST) defined as the time from the first day of SAbR to&#xD;
      start of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified progression-free survival (mPFS) is defined as the survival interval without&#xD;
           development of &gt;3 sites of new metastasis, new sites of metastases that are not amenable&#xD;
           to SAbR treatment, a total of &gt;6 sites of metastasis that required SAbR, local failure&#xD;
           at SAbR-treated site, or development of brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRQOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 23 Patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Time to event will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach along&#xD;
      with the 95% confidence interval.&#xD;

Other treatment related toxicity attributed to the therapy will be captured, recorded and the consequences of should all be graded 1-5 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).
