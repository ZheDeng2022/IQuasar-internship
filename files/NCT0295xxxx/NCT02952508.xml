  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part A of this study evaluates CLR 131 in patients with select B-cell malignancies (multiple&#xD;
      myeloma( MM), indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL),&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), marginal zone lymphoma&#xD;
      (MZL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and central nervous&#xD;
      system lymphoma (CNSL) who have been previously treated with standard therapy for their&#xD;
      underlying malignancy. Part B (CLOVER-WaM) is a pivotal efficacy study evaluating IV&#xD;
      administration of CLR 131 in patients with WM that have received at least two prior lines of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B-cell malignancies represent a diverse collection of diseases and, taken together, make up&#xD;
      the majority of hematologic malignancies. B-cell lymphomas represent the largest percentage&#xD;
      of these neoplasms, and the relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphomas have proven very&#xD;
      difficult to treat. Patients that have failed prior therapy, including WM patients, represent&#xD;
      a very challenging patient population with significantly reduced life-expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLR 131 is a targeted radiotherapeutic that exploits the selective uptake and retention of&#xD;
      Cellectar's proprietary phospholipid ethers (PLEs) by malignant cells. Cellectar Biosciences'&#xD;
      novel cancer-targeted small-molecule compound is radiolabeled with the radioisotope&#xD;
      iodine-131 (I-131) which has previously been used approved for use in select tumors. CLR 131&#xD;
      has been evaluated in over 80 xenograft and spontaneous (transgenic) tumor models where it&#xD;
      was demonstrated to be effective in eliminating tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the critical unmet medical need for effective agents with novel mechanisms of action&#xD;
      in B-cell malignancies, Cellectar Biosciences has chosen to expand this ongoing study to&#xD;
      assess CLR 131 in a pivotal expansion cohort in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia patients that&#xD;
      have received at least two prior lines of therapy.&#xD;
