      This research study is evaluating a new type of Kidney Cancer vaccine called &quot;Personalized&#xD;
      NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine&quot;as a possible treatment for Kidney Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following intervention will be involved in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personalized Neoantigen Vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      kidney cancer vaccine and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      kidney cancer vaccine to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the kidney&#xD;
      cancer vaccine, in this case the Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine, is being studied. It&#xD;
      also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the&#xD;
      Personalized Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly-ICLC (also called Hiltonol) is an experimental &quot;viral mimic&quot; and an activator of&#xD;
      immunity. Poly-ICLC is an investigational drug, meaning the FDA has not approved it as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine: The purpose of this study is to determine if it is&#xD;
      possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against kidney cancer by using information&#xD;
      gained from specific characteristics of the participant's own kidney cancer. It is known that&#xD;
      kidney cancers have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an&#xD;
      individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins&#xD;
      that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used&#xD;
      in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight&#xD;
      any tumor cells that could cause the kidney cancer to come back in the future. The study will&#xD;
      examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will&#xD;
      examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab (Yervoy™) is an antibody that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine combined with Ipilimumab as well as the body's immune&#xD;
      response to the vaccine. Ipilimumab will be delivered as an injection given underneath the&#xD;
      skin rather than injected in the vein in proximity to each vaccination site in order to 1)&#xD;
      direct anti-CTLA4 activity to the vaccine-draining lymph nodes and 2) limit potential toxic&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
