  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children undergoing anesthesia are often very frightened by the experience. This can lead to&#xD;
      bed wetting, nightmares and stranger anxiety that can last for weeks. Moreover, this can&#xD;
      influence their future experiences with anesthesia and surgery. The investigators believe the&#xD;
      presence of a parent via video might work better as parental fear is not transferred to the&#xD;
      child. The investigators also believe that parents who are coached on how to assist their&#xD;
      child during anesthesia will have a better impact. As such the investigators are carrying out&#xD;
      this study to assess whether parents who are coached and are present in either video or&#xD;
      physical form will be more effective in reducing anxiety at induction of anesthesia.&#xD;

      The investigators' goal in this study is to investigate the effects of virtual parental&#xD;
      presence and coaching of parents on anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is virtual parental presence during induction of anesthesia is superior to&#xD;
      physical parental presence during induction of anesthesia in reducing anxiety in children at&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia. The secondary hypothesis is that the coaching of parents modulates&#xD;
      the effect of physical or video parental presence at induction anesthesia on children's&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
