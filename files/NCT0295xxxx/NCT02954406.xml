    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 when administered in combination with bendamustine,&#xD;
      bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine, lenalidomide, or ibrutinib.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will determine the MTD or RP2D for&#xD;
      TAK-659 in combination with bendamustine, bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, and ibrutinib. The study will enroll approximately 96 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of the 5 combination cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort A: TAK-659 + Bendamustine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort B: TAK-659 + Bendamustine + Rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort C: TAK-659 + Gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort D: TAK-659 + Lenalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort E: TAK-659 + Ibrutinib This study comprises 2 phases: a&#xD;
           dose escalation phase and a safety expansion phase. Participants in all 5 cohorts&#xD;
           (Cohorts A-E) will participate in the dose escalation phase of the study. Approximately&#xD;
           12 additional participants with advanced FL or MZL will be added to Cohort B, in the&#xD;
           safety expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will make multiple visits&#xD;
      to the clinic and will be followed up for safety for 28 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female participants aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the dose escalation phase, histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
             advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of any histology (with the exception of&#xD;
             participants with Waldenström macroglobulinemia [WM] and chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
             [CLL]). In the safety expansion phase for Cohort B, only participants with advanced FL&#xD;
             or MZL will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Radiographically or clinically measurable disease with at least 1 target lesion per&#xD;
             International Working Group (IWG) criteria for malignant lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In the dose escalation phase, participants who are refractory or relapsed after at&#xD;
             least 1 prior line of therapy due to progression, intolerance, or physician/patient&#xD;
             decision and for whom no effective standard therapy is available per the&#xD;
             investigator's assessment. In the safety expansion phase for Cohort B in participants&#xD;
             with FL or MZL, the prior line of therapy is limited to &lt;=1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Either treatment naive to, relapsed/refractory to, or experienced treatment&#xD;
                  failure due to other reasons with ibrutinib, idelalisib, or any other&#xD;
                  investigational B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors not directly targeting&#xD;
                  spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pre induction salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)&#xD;
                  should be considered 1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any consolidation/maintenance therapy after a chemotherapy regimen (without&#xD;
                  intervening relapse) should be considered 1 line of therapy with the preceding&#xD;
                  combination therapy. Maintenance antibody therapy should not be considered a line&#xD;
                  of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For aggressive NHL (ie, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]), single-agent&#xD;
                  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy should not be considered a line of therapy.&#xD;
                  Antibody therapy in patients with indolent NHL (ie, FL) given as a single agent&#xD;
                  after disease progression from a prior treatment should be considered a line of&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For participants with DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma, any treatment&#xD;
                  received for the indolent disease before the transformation to DLBCL will, in&#xD;
                  general, not count toward the 2 to 3 prior lines of therapy required for DLBCL in&#xD;
                  this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior treatment with a regimen that includes the combination drug will not&#xD;
                  necessarily exclude a participant from that cohort if the investigator views&#xD;
                  treatment with that agent as appropriate. However, a participant who has a&#xD;
                  contraindication for a particular combination agent or who has been discontinued&#xD;
                  from prior therapy with a particular agent for toxicity will not be eligible for&#xD;
                  inclusion in that particular cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1 and life&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hepatic: total bilirubin less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1.5*the upper limit of the&#xD;

                  (AST) &lt;=2.5*ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal: serum creatinine &gt;=60 milliliter per minute (mL/min) as estimated by the&#xD;
