      Rationale : Persons with epilepsy have a greater risk of incurring accidental injury and a&#xD;
      higher mortality risk than the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to understand life experience of the disease or risks&#xD;
      associated with epilepsy in patients with epilepsy, relatives of patients and bereaved&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Qualitative study (study based on interviews) Population: Three groups will be&#xD;
      interviewed: bereaved families, patients with epilepsy and relatives of patient. Bereaved&#xD;
      family: relatives who contact the French sentinel network &quot;Réseau Sentinelle Mortalité&#xD;
      Epilepsie&quot; (RSME) notifying an epilepsy-related death (regardless the cause of the death and&#xD;
      the timeframe between death and interview). Patients with epilepsy: patients having a secure&#xD;
      diagnostic of epilepsy from 15 years old to 65 years old. Relatives of patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy: spouse/husband or parents invited by a patient with epilepsy to participate to the&#xD;
      interview who consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Semi structured in-depth interviews will be conducted by an experienced qualitative&#xD;
      psychologist in face to face, at home, at the hospital or at any other place (depending on&#xD;
      the choice of the participants). The interview topic guide will be centered on&#xD;
      participants'personal experience. Interviews will be digitally recorded and will be&#xD;
      transcribed by a secretary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will be integrated in educational therapeutic programs regarding&#xD;
      prevention of risks related to epilepsy.&#xD;

      Rationale: Persons with epilepsy have a greater risk of incurring accidental injury and a&#xD;
      higher mortality risk than the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective : To understand life experience of the disease and risks associated with&#xD;
      epilepsy in patients with epilepsy, relatives of patients with epilepsy and bereaved&#xD;
      families.The results of this study will be integrated in educational therapeutic programs&#xD;
      regarding risks related to epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design : Qualitative study with a phenomenological approach and semiopragmatic&#xD;
      analysis. Three different groups will be interviewed: bereaved families, patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy and relatives of patients with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recrutement procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of bereaved families will be based on the French sentinel network &quot;Réseau&#xD;
      Sentinelle Mortalité Epilepsie&quot; (RSME). This network was initially established by the French&#xD;
      League Against Epilepsy (LFCE) under the leadership of bereaved families in 2010 and&#xD;
      supported by the French Foundation for Epilepsy Research (FFRE). The primary aim of the RSME&#xD;
      is to detail the causes and circumstances of epilepsy-related deaths in France. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate the expectations and needs of bereaved families and create a&#xD;
      national database for future research programs. Epilepsy-related deaths are reported by&#xD;
      physicians but also by bereaved families. The interview will be proposed at this moment.&#xD;
      Moreover the RSME includes a national network of bereaved families. The interview will be&#xD;
      also proposed to the participants of this network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with epilepsy will be recruited from tertiary epilepsy units, private neurologists&#xD;
      or general practitioners and thanks from patients associations. Patients living in the&#xD;
      Languedoc Roussillon area and referred to the epilepsy unit of the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Montpellier (CHRU Montpellier) will be preferentially invited to participate to the&#xD;
      interview. The interview will be also proposed to relatives of patients (parents or&#xD;
      spouse/husband) who consent to participate. The study could be proposed to patients included&#xD;
      in the PRERIES study (Risk Factors in Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy: A matched&#xD;
      case-control study, coordinated by the coordination unit of the RSME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method :The characteristics of this methodology are based on COREQ criteria (consolidated&#xD;
      criteria for reporting qualitative research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative study with phenomenological approach will be used. The aim of this approach is&#xD;
      to collect participants 'life-experiences in their own real and personal situation.&#xD;
      Semistructured interviews with an in-depth questioning will be conducted by a psychologist&#xD;
      who received specific patient-centered interview training. The interview topic guide using&#xD;
      open questions will be centered on participants' personal experience.The same topic guide&#xD;
      will be used for the first group (epileptic patients) and the second group (relatives group).&#xD;
      However, for the third group (bereaved families), the interview guide will be adapted,&#xD;
      looking at life experience before death: focusing circumstances, particular events, behaviors&#xD;
      or clinical signs which could give alarm. This interview is more difficult because of a&#xD;
      frequent sense of guilt and requires an experienced qualitative interviewer.The&#xD;
      phenomenological questions will be asked on a temporal prospect.The first part, concern the&#xD;
      disclosure of the disease. The questions invite participants to relive this moment,&#xD;
      remembering when they were told about epilepsy and what happened after that: how they felt,&#xD;
      what they thought? Behaviors and how the risks of epilepsy were be told by doctors.Secondly,&#xD;
      participants will be invited to describe the current disease influence on the way of life.The&#xD;
      key topics guide focused on epilepsy influence on body, relation to others or to relatives,&#xD;
      employment, lifestyle and personal identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The saturation point will be determined when no more new information pertaining to the matter&#xD;
      of research emerge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be conducted in face to face at home, at the hospital or in any other&#xD;
      place (depending on the choice of the participants). The different conditions in which the&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted will be all clearly identified and included in each recording:&#xD;
      time, place, positioning of the actors, and context (family presence, disturbing&#xD;
      environment). Interviews will be digitally recorded and will be transcribed by a secretary.&#xD;
      According to that comprehensive approach, categories will be not identified in advance but&#xD;
      derived from the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data collected : Sociodemographic data (gender, age, current occupation, education&#xD;
      level, leasure, physical activity, driving and lifestyle) will be collected from a&#xD;
      questionnaire filled in by the participants before the interviews. Clinical characteristics&#xD;
      (duration of epilepsy, age at onset, syndrome and etiology, seizure type, seizures frequency)&#xD;
      will be completed by the physicians in charge of the patients. For bereaved families, the&#xD;
      cause of death will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size : In qualitative studies, the sample size cannot be determined previously.&#xD;
      Patients or relatives who satisfy the inclusion criteria will be invited for the study&#xD;
      participation until a saturation point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The saturation point is determined as the point at which further collection of data does not&#xD;
      result in uncovering any new information pertaining to the topic under investigation. We&#xD;
      estimate that approximately 30 interviews would be sufficient to reach data saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcripts analysis : The analysis will be conducted using a grounded theory approach&#xD;
      incorporating the pragmatism of Peirce. A semiopragmatic analysis according to CS Peirce's&#xD;
      theories (semiopragmatical approach) guarantees a clearly and precise analysis and limits the&#xD;
      biases or errors of interpretation. So, conceptual categories will not be identified not in&#xD;
      advance but will be derived from the data by constant comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcripts will be analyzed by two qualitative methodologists following these&#xD;
      steps:Transcribing the recordings word for word (verbatim), Floating reading then focused&#xD;
      reading, Breaking the text down into units of meaning and themes, Identifing all the&#xD;
      semiotic, textual and contextual elements to let the category emerge through constant&#xD;
      comparison (empirical category), Characterizing the empirical categories obtained according&#xD;
      to the theory of classes of Signs (semiotics) (Quality, Fact, Law), Setting the categories in&#xD;
      hierarchical order according to relationships between them in which law presuppose fact who&#xD;
      presuppose quality, econstructing the meaning in the form of a synthetic generalizing&#xD;
      proposition to restore the meaning of studied phenomenon Verbatim extract will be presented&#xD;
      to illustrate the obtained categories with a number in order to identify them anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis: Descriptive statistics on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      will be performed using SAS® version 9.1. (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Intergroup differences&#xD;
      will be examined using chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical course Study procedures and visits Informed consent procedures :The participant or&#xD;
      participant's parent(s) / legal representative(s) must be informed by the interviewer about&#xD;
      all aspects of the study that are relevant to decide to participate in particular concerning&#xD;
      the personal data collection, and must have sufficient time and opportunity to ask any&#xD;
      questions. Prior to the interviews, the written Informed Consent form must be signed and&#xD;
      personally dated by the participant or participant's parent(s) / legal representative(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of data: This interview will be conducted by a psychologist using the interview&#xD;
      topic guide and a standardized form for sociodemographic data and clinical data.&#xD;
