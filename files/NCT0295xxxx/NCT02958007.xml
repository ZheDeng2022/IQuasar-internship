  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with psychotic disorders experience a dual set of challenges: those related to&#xD;
      serious mental illness, and those related to aging. They have medical, cognitive,&#xD;
      psychological and social difficulties; as a result they have an almost four times greater&#xD;
      likelihood of early institutionalization in nursing homes. These challenges make it difficult&#xD;
      for this group to engage in health behaviors, such as exercise. This is unfortunate, since&#xD;
      participation in health-promoting activities is essential for maintaining functional&#xD;
      independence with age. This study aims to develop and pilot test a peer coaching intervention&#xD;
      for older Veterans with psychotic disorders, in which VA Peer Specialists, who are Veterans&#xD;
      in recovery from mental illness, will provide intensive coaching to older Veterans with&#xD;
      psychotic disorders to promote their participation in exercise and physical activity. Results&#xD;
      from this study will inform us as to whether this intervention is acceptable to Veterans,&#xD;
      feasible to implement, and effective in increasing exercise, physical activity, and physical&#xD;
      fitness/function.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Older Veterans with psychotic disorders face&#xD;
      unique barriers to engagement in health-promoting activities, including prototypical features&#xD;
      of psychosis (e.g., negative symptoms, medication side effects) and exacerbating features of&#xD;
      the aging process (e.g., increased medical comorbidity, declines in musculoskeletal health).&#xD;
      It is critical to develop strategies to empower this group to overcome these barriers and&#xD;
      engage in health behaviors that can improve their functioning and quality of life. Peer&#xD;
      interventions, or interventions delivered by individuals who are similar to a patient&#xD;
      population on some characteristic such as age or diagnosis, effectively promote engagement in&#xD;
      health behaviors in a range of populations. Despite the promise of peer support and urgent&#xD;
      needs of older adults with psychosis, there are no well-specified peer support interventions&#xD;
      that promote participation in health behaviors and are tailored to the needs of this group.&#xD;
      The present study will yield a well-specified group-based peer coaching intervention, to be&#xD;
      delivered by VA Peer Specialists (Veterans in recovery from mental illness), targeted to&#xD;
      empower older Veterans with psychosis to overcome barriers, increase exercise/physical&#xD;
      activity, and improve functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Background: Over the next two decades, Veterans with psychotic disorders (i.e.,&#xD;
      schizophrenia spectrum disorders and affective psychoses) will age into older adulthood in&#xD;
      unprecedented numbers. The challenges of treating this growing population and associated high&#xD;
      costs will have profound implications for VHA. Older adults with psychotic disorders exhibit&#xD;
      diminished physical and psychosocial functioning and are at increased risk for rapid&#xD;
      functional decline and early institutionalization in nursing homes. Participation in&#xD;
      structured exercise delays functional disability in older adults; however, older adults with&#xD;
      psychosis exhibit low exercise participation. While peer-delivered exercise interventions for&#xD;
      older adults promote initiation and maintenance of exercise and physical activity, there are&#xD;
      no peer-delivered exercise interventions tailored to the unique needs of older adults with&#xD;
      psychosis. The present study aims to fill this critical gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Objectives: This study will develop and pilot test a well-specified, group-based peer&#xD;
      coaching intervention tailored to the unique needs of older Veterans with psychotic&#xD;
      disorders: Peer Education on Exercise for Recovery (PEER). PEER will provide intensive&#xD;
      coaching from a VA Peer Specialist to promote participation in a supervised fitness training&#xD;
      program for older Veterans. To develop the intervention, materials from existing&#xD;
      peer-delivered wellness interventions for Veterans with serious mental illness will be&#xD;
      tailored for older Veterans with psychosis, through an iterative process synthesizing the&#xD;
      extant literature and pilot data, developing draft materials, and obtaining feedback from a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary panel of expert mentors/consultants and Peer Specialists/Veteran consumers.&#xD;
      A small open trial of PEER will be conducted with 6 older Veterans with psychotic disorders&#xD;
      (ages 50 and up); qualitative interviews will explore participants' perceptions of PEER.&#xD;
      Finally, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PEER will be conducted. Older Veterans&#xD;
      with psychotic disorders (ages 50 and up, n=50) will be enrolled in supervised fitness&#xD;
      training and randomized to receive group-based peer coaching (the PEER condition) or&#xD;
      individual support from non-peer staff (the enhanced supervised fitness training (ESFT)&#xD;
      condition). Feasibility of PEER (rates of recruitment, intervention engagement, and peer&#xD;
      coach fidelity) will be measured. The impact of PEER versus ESFT on attendance of exercise&#xD;
      sessions, levels of physical activity, and physical functioning will be examined.&#xD;
      Additionally, the PI will engage in training activities to develop expertise in the&#xD;
      functional rehabilitation of older adults with psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Methods: This project will include developing intervention materials for PEER,&#xD;
      conducting an open trial of PEER in a small sample, and completing a small RCT. The&#xD;
      investigators will monitor acceptability and feasibility; study Veterans' experiences; and&#xD;
      measure exercise/physical activity behaviors and functional outcomes.&#xD;
