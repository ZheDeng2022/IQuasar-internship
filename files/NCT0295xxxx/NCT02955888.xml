  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of PBI-4050, and its effects on the pancreatic, pulmonary functions&#xD;
      and on various biomarkers in Cystic Fibrosis patients with abnormal glucose tolerance.&#xD;
      Patients with abnormal glucose tolerance have elevated glucose level either at 1 hour or 2&#xD;
      hour during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). The Main study will include 24 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with PBI-4050 or matching placebo. At the end of the treatment period, patients&#xD;
      will have the option of participating in a 24-week Extension study.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of PBI-4050, and its effects on the pancreatic, pulmonary functions&#xD;
      and on various biomarkers in Cystic Fibrosis patients with abnormal glucose tolerance.&#xD;
      Patients with abnormal glucose tolerance have elevated glucose level either at 1 hour or 2&#xD;
      hour during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients will be enrolled for study participation. A Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Board (DSMB) will continually review individual patients safety data obtained from the 90&#xD;
      patients. When the first 15 patients have completed at least 1 month of study treatment, the&#xD;
      DSMB will meet formally to determine whether additional patients may be enrolled, the study&#xD;
      should continue with changes or if the study should be stopped. In addition, the DSMB will&#xD;
      review the PK data and may recommend dose adjustment based on the PK results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of study participation for each patient is at least 32 weeks, including up&#xD;
      to 4 weeks of a screening period, 24 weeks of study treatment and 4 weeks of safety&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who choose to participate in the open label extension will be in the study for an&#xD;
      additional 24 weeks of study treatment and 4 weeks of safety follow-up (for a total of 56&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
