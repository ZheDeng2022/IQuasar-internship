  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age remains the single most significant risk factor for developing dementia, particularly&#xD;
      Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Given the rate at which Canada's population is aging, the quest to&#xD;
      determine modifiable risk factors, whether by prevention, earlier detection, or an ability to&#xD;
      slow the rate of decline, is a key priority in health care. Primary care is likely to play a&#xD;
      pivotal role in this initiative. Collaborative mental health care between primary care&#xD;
      providers and mental health clinicians has been demonstrated to be effective at the patient&#xD;
      and system levels. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to assess impact and feasibility&#xD;
      of implementing a collaborative care evidence-based Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) in&#xD;
      addressing three potentially reversible risk factors at high risk for developing AD: anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 150 participants overall (CAMH and McMaster). Seventy-five will&#xD;
      be cases who will be enrolled into the ICP arm of the study and these will be patients born&#xD;
      in the calendar year 1951, 1953 or 1955. The investigators will enroll an additional 75&#xD;
      controls that were born in the calendar year 1950, 1952 or 1956.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of general practitioners being seen at primary healthcare clinics in the Greater&#xD;
      Toronto Area and in Hamilton, who were born in the calendar year 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953,&#xD;
      1955, or 1956 will be consented and screened for anxiety, depression, and Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients born in 1951, 1953 and 1955 reach a threshold level of anxiety, depression, or&#xD;
      MCI symptom burden and have a confirmed diagnosis, rather than receive treatment as usual,&#xD;
      the participants will be enrolled into an Integrated Care Pathway (ICP), which offers&#xD;
      evidence-informed treatment for the management of these syndromes in a routine, algorithmic&#xD;
      fashion. All enrolled cases entered in the study will be provided with general interventions&#xD;
      that address lifestyle and medical factors that both contribute to these syndromes and are&#xD;
      thought to predispose patients to develop dementia. If the symptom burden is severe enough,&#xD;
      based on standardized assessments, evidence-based psychopharmacology (a trial of sertraline&#xD;
      and/or venlafaxine) will also be offered, with a standardized titration schedule.&#xD;
      Collaboration will be built into the ICP - a psychiatrist will be present at the clinic and&#xD;
      in contact with primary care providers to provide patient- and physician-level support,&#xD;
      consultation, and episodes of care as necessary. Rates of anxiety, depression, and MCI&#xD;
      diagnosis/detection, time to treatment initiation, and improvement in symptom burden will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients born in 1950, 1952 and 1956 reach a threshold level of anxiety, depression, or&#xD;
      MCI symptom burden, these individuals will form our comparison group and will receive&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;
