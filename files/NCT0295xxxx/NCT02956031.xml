  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 8 000 new cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in South Africa per year; many are still&#xD;
      undiagnosed and about 50% of diagnosed cases succumb per year. Although the current&#xD;
      prevalence of pre-cancer cervical disease is largely unknown, data from local studies suggest&#xD;
      regional differences and an increase in the prevalence of cytological abnormalities when&#xD;
      compared with historical data. Low frequency in cytology screening is the primary factor&#xD;
      attributable to development of invasive cervical cancer and almost one-third of all cervical&#xD;
      cancer patients had previous negative cytology. Due to the low sensitivity of cytology it can&#xD;
      be assumed that the true prevalence of pre-cancer disease is underestimated by all available&#xD;
      data. One round of optimal cervical cytology will detect around 50% of existing pre-cancer&#xD;
      cervical disease as identified and proven using colposcopy and directed biopsy. It is now&#xD;
      widely accepted that primary screening with a human papilloma virus (HPV) test can improve&#xD;
      the sensitivity of screening and that even a single round of HPV screening can rapidly reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of invasive cervical cancer and related mortality within a few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      South Africa has a high prevalence of HIV infection and a delay in or failure to initiate&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). These facts, together with the largely unscreened status of the&#xD;
      female population and the high incidence of cervical cancer all suggest that HPV infection&#xD;
      and precursors to cervical cancer are both unusually common among South African women.&#xD;
      Accurate current knowledge of the performance of newer generation HPV based screening tests&#xD;
      in HIV-infected and general female population are essential for cost-analysis and planning&#xD;
      for national prevention and screening programs. This study will aim to demonstrate the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of new generation HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based screening&#xD;
      assays in a South African setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that HPV testing followed by normal and special cytology tests&#xD;
      will be a successful screening model for a South African population.&#xD;
