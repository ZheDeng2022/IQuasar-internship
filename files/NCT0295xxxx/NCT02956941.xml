      A cluster randomized controlled trial was chosen to exploit the robustness of this design to&#xD;
      help ascertain the efficacy of the BCC intervention compared to the routine dietary practice.&#xD;
      This protocol was developed according to the guidelines of the Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement extension for cluster randomized trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is aims to evaluate the effect of improving micronutrient intake through&#xD;
      behavior change communication intervention on nutritional status and academic performance of&#xD;
      school age children. Moreover, it may help to prevent or mitigate malnutrition. However to&#xD;
      the best knowledge of the authors, BCC intervention using posters, and lecture for school&#xD;
      teachers and students have not yet been empirically tested generally in Ethiopia,&#xD;
      specifically in the study area context. The present intervention is unique in combining the&#xD;
      use of conventional BCC intervention tools, that is, lecture and posters as reminder for&#xD;
      intervention reinforcement.&#xD;

      Background: School age children (SAC) are vulnerable to malnutrition which can have adverse&#xD;
      effects on their academic performance at school. Micronutrient deficiency affects as many as&#xD;
      two billion people in the world. About 250 million people out of this suffer from&#xD;
      deficiencies of iron, vitamin A, zinc and iodine are children. Malnutrition or micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies lead to lower enrolment and completion rates. A nutrition behavior change&#xD;
      strategy provides individuals with the necessary resources, knowledge, skills, motivation and&#xD;
      reinforcement needed to encourage positive change in health behavior. So far, there are no&#xD;
      any studies in the context of the study area in particular and in the country in general on&#xD;
      the effect of behavior change communication (BCC) on improving the nutritional status,&#xD;
      micronutrient intake and academic performance of school age children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study protocol is to evaluate the effects of the behavior change&#xD;
      communication (BCC) on nutritional status and academic performance of school age children in&#xD;
      South Ethiopia. The hypotheses are that the children in the intervention arm will increase&#xD;
      their academic performance and improve their nutritional status and micronutrient intake more&#xD;
      than the children in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be carried out to achieve the above&#xD;
      mentioned objectives, so that the findings will be used as an input for policies and&#xD;
      strategies that will be designed to mitigate the problem. A twelve-month cluster randomized&#xD;
      control trial will be conducted in 8 schools of 370 students with ten to fifteen years old.&#xD;
      The school intervention will be included BCC for students and science teachers on essential&#xD;
      nutrition and hygiene actions (ENHAs) will be provided by background of Health education with&#xD;
      Nutritionist. Demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude &amp; practices (KAP) of&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies prevention, micronutrient intake, anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      (height &amp; weight), and academic performance assessment will be during baseline, mid line and&#xD;
      end line assessment. The academic performance of children will be assessed by using end term&#xD;
      semester results obtain for English and Mathematics subjects and for the overall subject&#xD;
      average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial (n= 376) have two randomly assigned arms: a control cluster schools (CC) and&#xD;
      intervention cluster schools (IC) according to their cluster. The IC will be received 12&#xD;
      months on nutrition behavior change communication intervention using two modes (lecture, and&#xD;
      posters) while CC receive routine dietary practices. The primary outcomes of this study are&#xD;
      stunting, micronutrient intake, dietary diversity score, and academic performance of the&#xD;
      children; assess using questionnaires, KAP of micronutrient deficiencies prevention, and&#xD;
      anthropometry measurements. Secondary outcomes include thinness, underweight, overweight and&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to identify independent predictors&#xD;
      of nutritional status and academic performance of school age children after controlling for&#xD;
      confounding variables. The effect of BCC on nutritional status and academic performance will&#xD;
      be determined using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and or linear mixed effects&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the primary outcomes, stunting, micronutrient intake, dietary diversity score,&#xD;
      and academic performance of children, the difference in mean change at follow-up between&#xD;
      intervention and control arms will be compared. The hypotheses will be tested under the&#xD;
      intent-to-treat principle using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) that will account for&#xD;
      the correlation induced by the clustering of children within schools. To further explore the&#xD;
      effect of the intervention, GLMMs will be fit that (1) adjust for baseline covariates of&#xD;
      interest, consider a priori, relevant to change in nutritional status, KAP of micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies prevention, micronutrient intake and dietary diversity score; (2) adjust for&#xD;
      baseline variables distribute differently between intervention groups; (3) test interaction&#xD;
      terms between treatment group and other covariates; and (4) examine completers only.&#xD;
      Differences in the secondary outcomes, underweight and obesity will be analyzed in a parallel&#xD;
      fashion. Mediating and moderating effects of the factors mentioned above will also be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Results of the trial will provide evidence of the effectiveness of the nutrition&#xD;
      BCC innovation in school settings of Meskan district. They will provide recommendations for&#xD;
      strengthening the nutrition component of behavior change communication in child health&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
