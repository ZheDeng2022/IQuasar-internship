  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out the side effects (unwanted effects) that are caused in&#xD;
      patients with cancers who are given SGN-2FF. This study will also attempt to find the most&#xD;
      suitable dose in the disease or condition being studied and look at other effects of SGN2FF,&#xD;
      including its effect on cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has several different parts. Part A will try to find the highest safe dose. Part B&#xD;
      will enroll more patients to be treated at the highest safe dose or a lower dose to better&#xD;
      understand how well SGN-2FF is tolerated. Part C will try to find the highest safe dose of&#xD;
      SGN-2FF when it is given combined with pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is a standard treatment&#xD;
      for cancer. Part D will enroll more patients to be treated at the highest safe dose of&#xD;
      SGN-2FF combined with pembrolizumab or a lower dose of SGN-2FF to better understand how well&#xD;
      SGN-2FF is tolerated when it is given with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study that will examine the&#xD;
      safety profile of SGN-2FF given orally to patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary&#xD;
      goal of the study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or optimal biological dose&#xD;
      (OBD) that does not exceed the MTD. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of&#xD;
      SGN-2FF will also be evaluated. In this study, SGN-2FF will be evaluated as monotherapy and&#xD;
      as combination therapy with the standard approved dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monotherapy portion of the study will be conducted in 2 sequential parts (Part A and Part&#xD;
      B). Part A will enroll patients for dose escalation to estimate the MTD /OBD and help&#xD;
      determine the dosing regimen that will be tested in Part B. The OBD will be evaluated by&#xD;
      assessing the activity of SGN-2FF, including pharmacodynamics, PK, and other observations in&#xD;
      dose escalation. Part B will explore the recommended dose/regimen in up to 3 focused&#xD;
      expansion cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination therapy portion of the study will be conducted in 2 sequential parts (Part C&#xD;
      and Part D). SGN-2FF will be administered orally according to the dose and schedule assigned,&#xD;
      with a lead-in period of 2 weeks prior to pembrolizumab administration. The lead-in period&#xD;
      may be discontinued based on emerging nonclinical and/or clinical data. Part C will enroll&#xD;
      patients for dose escalation to estimate the MTD /OBD and the dosing regimen that will be&#xD;
      tested in Part D. Part D will explore the recommended dose/regimen in up to 3 focused&#xD;
      expansion cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout the trial by the safety monitoring committee which will&#xD;
      meet frequently to review the emerging safety data and make dose-escalation and&#xD;
      dosing-interval recommendations. Antitumor activity will be assessed by radiographic imaging.&#xD;
      Patients may continue treatment until progression of their disease or intolerable side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment with SGN-2FF monotherapy or with SGN-2FF and pembrolizumab combination therapy is&#xD;
      permitted with medical monitor approval for patients who achieve stable disease, a complete&#xD;
      response, or partial response on study and then experience disease progression after&#xD;
      discontinuing prior treatment with SGN 2FF.&#xD;
