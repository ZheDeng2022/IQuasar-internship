      This study aims to assess the survival benefit from an early switch approach from sunitinib&#xD;
      or pazopanib (10-12 weeks of 1st-line therapy) to nivolumab (anti-angiogenic to immunotherapy&#xD;
      switch).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase II trial. Patients with advanced or metastatic renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (RCC) will be randomized into two arms either receiving Nivolumab or&#xD;
      continuation of the Tyrosin Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) treatment that they have received as&#xD;
      1st-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have received first line therapy with a VEGFR-TKI (Sunitinib or Pazopanib)&#xD;
      prior to study inclusion for 10-12 weeks with documented disease control (PR/SD) according to&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 at time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 either in the Nivolumab or in the TKI arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage of Nivolumab: 240 mg i.v. on D1 of every cycle (Q2W) for 16 weeks. After 16 weeks 480&#xD;
      mg i.v. on D1 of every cycle (Q4W) until disease progress, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent or end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage of Sunitinib: According to Standard of Care (SOC). Recommended dose is 50 mg p.o. once&#xD;
      daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest period (schedule 4/2) to comprise a&#xD;
      complete cycle of 6 weeks (until disease progress, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent or end of study.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage of Pazopanib: According to Standard of Care (SOC). Recommended dose is 800 mg p.o.&#xD;
      daily continuously (until disease progress, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or&#xD;
      end of study.).&#xD;
