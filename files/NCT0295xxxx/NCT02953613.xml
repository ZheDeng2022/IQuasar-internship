      The goal of this study is to correlate both plaque and % lipid core content assessed by&#xD;
      NIRS-IVUS (Imaging technique) to plaque burden and % lipid core content in coronary&#xD;
      computerized tomographic angiography (CCTA) completed at 1 week in non-culprit coronary&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center study that will enroll 200 patients undergoing clinically&#xD;
      indicated cardiac catheterization for stable ischemic heart disease or unstable chest pain,&#xD;
      who are also undergoing NIRS-IVUS direct coronary imaging of a culprit lesion based on&#xD;
      routine clinical indications. The NIRS/IVUS catheter uses near-infrared light (red laser&#xD;
      light) and intravascular ultrasound (sound waves) to identify fatty plaques in the coronary&#xD;
      artery. Standard angiography, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
      (IVUS) are three widely used clinical methods to image narrowing within the coronary arteries&#xD;
      at the time of cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independently from this study, patients have agreed to a cardiac catheterization (angiogram -&#xD;
      an x-ray picture of the heart) and possible angioplasty procedure and/or stenting as part of&#xD;
      clinical care. During the cardiac catheterization if the blockage is bad enough an inflatable&#xD;
      balloon attached to the end of a thin tube (called a catheter) is positioned in the narrowed&#xD;
      part of the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated, which opens the artery so that&#xD;
      blood can flow more easily. After the balloon angioplasty procedure, a stent may be placed in&#xD;
      the coronary artery. A stent is an expandable metal tube that helps to hold the artery open&#xD;
      so that blood can continue to flow through the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor determines that there are other blockages of indeterminate severity (≥20%-≤70%&#xD;
      blockage) that require NIRS/IVUS assessment to better assess the severity of the blockage or&#xD;
      that angioplasty and/or stenting is necessary the NIRS/IVUS catheter will be used. If severe&#xD;
      non-culprit blockages are incidentally identified, they may be treated at the discretion of&#xD;
      the operator. After the invasive coronary catheterization patients will follow Beaumonts&#xD;
      standard post procedureal treatment guidlines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between one day and one week after the invasive catheterization patients will return for a&#xD;
      research related non-invasive coronary Cat scan. A coronary Cat scan will be repeated at 24&#xD;
      months (2 years) to assess any of the blockages of indeterminate severity that were&#xD;
      identified during your initial invasive cardiac catheterization. Upon arrival for Cat scan a&#xD;
      nurse will ask the patient a few questions, insert a small tube in one of the patients arm&#xD;
      veins. Blood will be drawn from the small tub and kidney function will be assessed. All Cat&#xD;
      scans will be completed under Beaumont Hospital Institutional guidelines for coronary Cat&#xD;
      scans. If significant blockages are identified, the patient may be notified to complete&#xD;
      additional testing, which may include a stress test or a coronary angiogram. If other&#xD;
      non-cardiac incidental findings are noted that require additional clinical or imaging follow&#xD;
      up, the patient and the primary care physician will be notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study doctor, nurse, or research coordinator will follow-up with each patient by phone six&#xD;
      times over five years while participating in the registry. Phone calls will be performed at&#xD;
      the following intervals from the date of the index procedure: 6 months (± 14 days); 12 months&#xD;
      (± 30 days); 24 months (± 60 days); 36 months (± 60 days); 48 months (± 60 days); and 60&#xD;
      months (± 60 days) to ask patients how they are doing and to collect any major adverse&#xD;
      cardiac events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Plan is for an enrollment period of two years.&#xD;
