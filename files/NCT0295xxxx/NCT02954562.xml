      In this study, people will be undergoing brain scans with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      while they perform an emotional regulation task that involves observing either neutral images&#xD;
      or images known to induce negative emotions, with instructions either to view passively or&#xD;
      attempt to reduce the negative affect associated with the images. Resting state brain scans&#xD;
      (with no explicit task) will also be acquired. Heart rate variability will be measured during&#xD;
      these resting state scans. While in the scanner, subjects will also listen to prerecorded&#xD;
      audio scripts about life stresses for themselves and for another person with instructions to&#xD;
      practice compassion for themselves or for others. In yet another task, they will respond to&#xD;
      pictures known to produce positive and negative emotions and perform an attention related&#xD;
      task. The scans will take place once before and at least once after undergoing sessions of&#xD;
      methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) assisted psychotherapy. Brain scans will happen three&#xD;
      times: an initial scan before placebo or MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, a second scan after&#xD;
      either two placebo or two MDMA sessions (depending on whether the subject was in the placebo&#xD;
      or MDMA group), and one final scan after the conclusion of three active MDMA sessions.&#xD;

      Diagnosis of, and living with a life-threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to&#xD;
      those seen in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and these symptoms may persist even if&#xD;
      the individual recovers, or their illness goes into remission. These symptoms may include&#xD;
      emotional avoidance and numbing, difficulty relating to or connecting with friends or loved&#xD;
      ones, difficulty sleeping, a sense of foreshortened future, and intrusive thoughts or&#xD;
      memories related to the illness. These symptoms are an additional burden for the individual&#xD;
      experiencing them and for their caretakers, and reduces quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy is an experimental treatment for&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, and initial findings suggest that it holds promise for treatment of PTSD.&#xD;
      This study will examine brain activity in participants enrolled in an investigation of the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with anxiety stemming from&#xD;
      diagnosis with a life-threatening illness to see whether MDMA-assisted psychotherapy alters&#xD;
      emotional reactivity to anxiety-provoking material, including positive and negative images.&#xD;
      The study will also examine brain activity related to the experience of&#xD;
      self-compassion/empathy in response to personalized audio scripts, and whether that response&#xD;
      is altered by MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Brain imaging may offer a measure of neural&#xD;
      markers of anxiety and self-compassion that do not rely on self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of participants in the study &quot;Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2&#xD;
      Pilot Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated with a Life-Threatening&#xD;
      Illness&quot; (NCT02427568) without any contraindicating factors for brain imaging will undergo&#xD;
      three fMRI scans as part of this observational study. The first scan will occur prior to&#xD;
      experimental sessions and a second scan will occur after two experimental sessions of MDMA or&#xD;
      placebo-assisted psychotherapy. Participants will then be scanned a third time after they&#xD;
      have completed a total of three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (this includes both&#xD;
      subjects that are originally in the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy group, as well as the&#xD;
      subjects in the placebo group who will cross over and complete three active MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy sessions subsequent to their placebo-assisted psychotherapy. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be the scan after the second session of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each scanning session, participants will be undergoing brain scans with functional&#xD;
      magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they perform an emotional regulation task that involves&#xD;
      observing images possessing negative emotional valence. These images are drawn from, and have&#xD;
      their emotional valence validated by, the International Affective Picture System (IAPS).&#xD;
      Participants are instructed either to view passively or attempt to reduce the negative affect&#xD;
      associated with the images. In addition, resting state brain scans will also be acquired&#xD;
      while subjects fixate on a central cross with no explicit task. Heart rate variability will&#xD;
      be measured during these resting state scans. The comparison of changes in brain activity&#xD;
      during execution of the emotional regulation task (as compared to baseline scans) after&#xD;
      receiving psychotherapy with MDMA or placebo, as well as comparison of changes in resting&#xD;
      state functional connectivity, are the primary outcome measures. Study observations are&#xD;
      intended to assess changes in response to emotion-provoking material at several levels, most&#xD;
      notably brain activity in response to anxiety producing images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in the scanner, subjects will also listen to prerecorded audio scripts about life&#xD;
      stresses for themselves and for another person with instructions to practice compassion for&#xD;
      themselves or for others. In yet another task, subjects will perform an attentional bias task&#xD;
      where they respond to a dot-probe that appears following a brief presentation of paired&#xD;
      images known to produce positive and negative emotions as their brain activity is measured&#xD;
      and their reaction times are recorded&#xD;
