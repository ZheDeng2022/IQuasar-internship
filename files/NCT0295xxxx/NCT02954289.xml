    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in Canada, with 24,000 new&#xD;
      cases estimated for 2015. Prostate cancer patients often live with uncomfortable side effects&#xD;
      of treatment, such as a decrease in bone health, weight gain, and challenges to their&#xD;
      interpersonal relationships. Nutrition can improve outcomes for PCa survivors; however,&#xD;
      dietary interventions for prostate cancer patients are limited. Therefore, this is a&#xD;
      feasibility study that tests the impact of an innovative intervention to promote healthy&#xD;
      nutrition and weight control for prostate cancer survivors and their partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to assess the feasibility of the intervention, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accrual, retention and adherence, and participant satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Candidate measures for primary outcomes in future studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent is to evaluate how well the classes work and identify ways to make them more&#xD;
      successful. At the end of the study, the investigators will know if this approach shows merit&#xD;
      to be tested further through a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly-diagnosed invasive cancer in Canada, with 24,000&#xD;
      new cases predicted for 2015. The large majority of men (96%) will survive five or more years&#xD;
      post-diagnosis. However, many PCa survivors live with side effects of the disease and&#xD;
      treatment and may develop chronic conditions due to aging and/or cancer therapy. The&#xD;
      PCa-related side effects can also impact men's interpersonal relationships. Effective&#xD;
      interventions to promote health and well-being for PCa survivors are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence shows that nutrition can improve outcomes for PCa survivors; however, dietary&#xD;
      interventions for prostate cancer patients are limited. Furthermore, all PCa-related&#xD;
      interventions reported thus far are limited in one important way: they focus only on the&#xD;
      patient/survivor. Yet, the impact of prostate cancer extends to the spouse as well. When it&#xD;
      comes to lifestyle interventions, responsibility for health behaviours and food preparation&#xD;
      typically falls on the wife, particularly in today's cohort of PCa patients. As such,&#xD;
      engaging the partner is crucial to ensure success for the survivor, and provide benefits for&#xD;
      the wife as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this is a feasibility study that tests the impact of an innovative intervention to&#xD;
      promote healthy nutrition and weight control for PCa survivors and their partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to assess the feasibility of the intervention, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accrual, retention and adherence, and participant satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Candidate measures for primary outcomes in future studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study draws on Interdependence Theory and features of successful cooking class&#xD;
      intervention research in other populations. Specifically, it uses hands-on cooking&#xD;
      experience, combined with increased cooking skills and nutrition knowledge to build skills&#xD;
      and self-efficacy; to be culturally appropriate and use simple affordable ingredients; and to&#xD;
      involve the spouses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary intervention will be offered to a total of 24 couples (48 individuals). The&#xD;
      intervention includes 6 cooking and nutrition-related classes, that are held weekly in a&#xD;
      university classroom kitchen with interactive demo and cooking components. Classes focus on&#xD;
      learning through preparing theme-based recipes, with themes organized around prostate health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes are assessed throughout. Questionnaire-based outcomes are assessed pre-&#xD;
      and post-intervention, anthropometric outcomes at first and last intervention session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main intent is to evaluate how well the classes work and identify ways to make them more&#xD;
      successful. At the end of the study, the investigators will know if this approach shows merit&#xD;
      to be tested further through a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
