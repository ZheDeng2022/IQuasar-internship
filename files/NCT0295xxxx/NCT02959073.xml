  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decades the prevalence of allergies has reached epidemic proportions. 10 to 15%&#xD;
      of the population suffers from cat allergy. Investigators perform this study in order to&#xD;
      further investigate symptom records and their evaluation in cat allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators primarily aim to better standardize the symptom recording of cat allergic&#xD;
      persons under real-life conditions and to evaluate the effect of hypoallergenic cats on&#xD;
      symptom strength.&#xD;
