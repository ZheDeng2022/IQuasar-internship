      The aims of this clinical study conducted at a dental specialty clinic in Drammen, Norway are&#xD;
      to assess the clinical outcomes of patients with an edentate upper jaw having been treated&#xD;
      with a removable full prosthesis supported by 3 implants to restore function and aesthetics.&#xD;
      Clinical variables beyond implant dimensions and intraoral location, such as recall routines,&#xD;
      maintenance needs, patient satisfaction and quality of life, will also be appraised and&#xD;
      contrasted with an aim to elucidate their association with clinical outcomes. Specific&#xD;
      evaluation will be done with regard to the following outcome criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  crestal bone levels and periodontal conditions around implants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence rates of biological, technical, traumatic failures / complications related to&#xD;
           implants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence rates of biological, technical, mechanical, esthetic failures/complications&#xD;
           with prosthesis and prosthetic components A secondary objective is to identify the&#xD;
           different risk factors for biological failures / complications, including the influence&#xD;
           of medical conditions and tobacco use.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods The protocol is submitted to the Research Ethics Board of the Northern&#xD;
      Norway in order to obtain ethics approval prior to commencing the study. All patients will&#xD;
      obtain an invitation letter detailing the objectives of the study and requested to sign a&#xD;
      consent letter prior to clinical examinations according to principles for good research&#xD;
      practice. All patients will be offered a free implant hygiene session and prosthesis&#xD;
      cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population All patients treated in a private dental clinic in Drammen, Norway having&#xD;
      received a maxillary removable full prosthesis supported on 3 dental implants will be invited&#xD;
      to attend evaluations of their intra-oral status annually after implant installation and&#xD;
      solicited about treatment satisfaction and daily oral functions. These patients were&#xD;
      initially not offered maintenance care at the completion of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implants that have been used are made from titanium with a microrough surface (Astra Tech&#xD;
      Implant System, Dentsply Implants, Mølndal, Sweden). All implants have been placed according&#xD;
      to the manufacturer's instructions&#xD;
      (http://www.dentsplyimplants.no/nb-NO/Implantatsystem/Prosedyrer/Treatment-planning) and&#xD;
      fitted with precision attachments (Locator, ZEST Anchors, Escondido, CA, USA. The removable&#xD;
      prostheses were made from heat cured poly-methyl-metacrylate (PMMA) incorporating three&#xD;
      active matrices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recall Procedure Each patient will be invited by letter followed up by a phone call to attend&#xD;
      an examination visit. The patients will complete a questionnaire related to changes in&#xD;
      general health aspects, their experiences and satisfaction with the reconstructions and&#xD;
      eventual need for repair sessions during the last year. Specifically, the medical history and&#xD;
      the smoking history (e.g. pack/years) will be assessed. Recordings will be made of general&#xD;
      and local factors which may affect the prognosis of the implants and prosthesis. This&#xD;
      includes the occurrence of systemic disease since implant placement, regular medication used&#xD;
      by patients, smoking status, dental treatment received since implant placement, recall&#xD;
      frequency at the dental hygienist and the last dental examination appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Data from Patients' Charts&#xD;
&#xD;
      General information will be gathered from the patients' charts. Patients' age, self-reported&#xD;
      smoking habits and the number of cigarettes per day, medical history, medication intake,&#xD;
      reason for tooth loss and the date of prosthesis insertion will be recorded in &quot;patient's&#xD;
      summary forms&quot;. Type and distribution of implants will be retrieved from patients' charts.&#xD;
      Cases with a chart documentation of an incidence of biological or mechanical complications&#xD;
      during the follow-up period will be closely reviewed and recorded as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of implant loss (Biological complication):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Period of service before failure is traced in months for each lost implant. Lost&#xD;
           implants will be categorized in three groups: 1) &quot;Early Failure&quot; which refers to&#xD;
           implants lost before the insertion of the definite prosthesis. 2) &quot;One-year Failure&quot;&#xD;
           addressing implants failed within the first year of loading. 3) &quot;Late Failure&quot; including&#xD;
           implants lost more than one year following the insertion of the final prosthesis&#xD;
           (Roos-Jansåker et al 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History of peri-implant mucositis or peri-implantitis (biological complication):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any recorded incidence of inflammation and suppuration related to the gingival tissue&#xD;
           surrounding implants in patients' charts will be gathered and transferred to &quot;patients'&#xD;
           summary forms&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. History of various technical problems encountered following the insertion of the&#xD;
           removable prosthesis (mechanical complications):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any history of mechanical complications such as attachment loosening/fracture and incidences&#xD;
      of cracks, chippings and fractures in resin teeth, acrylic body and prosthesis will be&#xD;
      recorded in &quot;patients' summary forms&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operation peri-apical radiographs, taken at the day of &quot;stage-one&quot; surgery, will be&#xD;
      retrieved from patient's charts and used as the reference point of supporting bone level for&#xD;
      each implant. Reference bone levels on mesial and distal sides are determined by measuring&#xD;
      the distance between implant platform and the most apical point of the alveolar crestal bone&#xD;
      surrounding implant. A mean value between the mesial and distal sides is used for each&#xD;
      implant as the reference marginal bone level.&#xD;
