      This study is being done to compare two different Temporary Abdominal Closure methods that&#xD;
      could be used in cases like yours. The methods being compared are the Barker's vacuum packing&#xD;
      technique (BVPT) and the Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System (ABThera).&#xD;

      This study is being done to compare two different Temporary Abdominal Closure methods that&#xD;
      could be used in cases of open abdomen. The methods being compared are the Barker's vacuum&#xD;
      packing technique (BVPT) and the Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System (ABThera). The&#xD;
      BVPT will be made up by an internal plastic layer to cover abdominal viscera, a second layer&#xD;
      with surgical sponges and a suction drain and will be covered by an adhesive plastic layer.&#xD;
      Then the dressing will be connected to the hospital's vacuum system. The ABThera dressing is&#xD;
      available commercially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants Enrollment will happen at the operating room&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator will include in this study patients who have the following indications to&#xD;
      laparostomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Damage control surgery in trauma patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with abdominal compartment syndrome,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Septic shock patients requiring short surgery and inability to close the abdominal&#xD;
           cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signing the consent form will be held in order of preference by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Legal representative&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Doctor appointed by the hospital that does not participate in the study(only in cases&#xD;
           where the urgency of the surgery do not allow contact with the representatives).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the latter case the signature of the term should be applied to the legal&#xD;
           representative as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Criteria for inclusion and exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Patients with indication of an open abdomen According to the Attending physician&#xD;
           (above criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chronic renal impairment,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Child-Pugh C,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body index over 40 kg / m2,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Uncontrolled bleeding during laparotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients progressing to death within the first 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
           Allocation Concealment and Randomization Randomization will be performed by central&#xD;
           online dedicated site in the ratio of 1: 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When a patient is eligible, a surgeon will access the Web site, enter patient's&#xD;
           information to know the assigned allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Variable block size randomization will be utilized stratified by study center&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assuming a closure rate of 75% in the Abthera arm and 35% in the Control arm, a study&#xD;
           with 36 patients in each treatment arm (72 total) would have 90% power to detect such a&#xD;
           difference at the 0.05 significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to evaluate closure for 36 patients in each arm, with an estimated loss of 30%&#xD;
           either by withdraw or death prior to 48h. So the study will enroll 94 patients (47 in&#xD;
           each treatment group) After surgery, patients will be referred to the intensive care&#xD;
           unit (ICU). In patients' Barker Group a fenestrated plastic will be used and that will&#xD;
           be in contact with viscera followed by four pads with a suction drain and an adhesive&#xD;
           finishing layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In ABThera group technique the dressing will be done according to the description and&#xD;
           the manufacturer's instructions (Acelity, San Antonio, TX).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Fascial closure in 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic variables (gender, age, comorbidities, mechanism of injury or disease),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Indication of laparostomy,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systolic blood pressure,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Amount of fluid drained by the healing of laparostomy,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Amount of crystalloid,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Amount of hemoconcentrated,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  APACHE II ICU admission,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Length of stay in the ICU,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Length of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Length of hospital stay,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to closure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In trauma patients the score Revised Trauma (RTS) and the Injury Severity Score (ISS)&#xD;
           will be calculated&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Descriptive variables will be summarized as frequencies and percentages. Continuous&#xD;
           variable data will be presented as means and standard deviations or medians and ranges,&#xD;
           depending on the distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The analysis of the qualitative variables will be done through measures of association&#xD;
           (chi-square or Fisher 's exact test). The analysis of quantitative variables will be&#xD;
           made by means of different tests (parametric and nonparametric) depending on the outcome&#xD;
           of the applied normality test&#xD;
