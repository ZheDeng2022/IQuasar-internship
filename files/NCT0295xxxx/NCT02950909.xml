      The primary aim of this study therefore is to investigate the effects on pain and disability&#xD;
      of an emphasized exercise program targeting the deep neck extensor semispinalis cervicis and&#xD;
      a general exercise program for all neck extensor muscles in patients with chronic neck pain.&#xD;
      As a secondary aim , pain intensity (VAS), cervical ROM, pressure pain threshold (PPT),&#xD;
      cervical and thoracic posture and self-perceived benefit of treatment (GROC) were measured.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that both exercise programs would have similar effects on pain&#xD;
      alleviation and pain related disability, but that the emphasized exercise program for the&#xD;
      deep semispinalis cervicis would improve its activation more compared to the general exercise&#xD;
      program. The results of this study will be relevant for designing effective&#xD;
      rehabilitation/training programs for patients with chronic neck pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An independent group, repeated-measures study design was adopted to investigate the immediate&#xD;
      effect of two different kinds of intervention: Emphasized exercises targeting the deep&#xD;
      cervical extensors and general exercises targeting all neck extensors. Subjects were&#xD;
      randomized into two exercise groups: the emphasized exercise group in which patients&#xD;
      performed muscle contractions against resistance directly at the neck and the general&#xD;
      exercise group in which the resistance was applied at the head. Sealed opaque envelopes were&#xD;
      used to conceal allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise regimes was of 6-weeks duration and started within one week of the initial&#xD;
      assessment. All subjects received personal instruction and supervision by one experienced&#xD;
      physiotherapist, once a week, for the duration of the whole program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects received an exercise diary and were requested to practice their respective regime&#xD;
      twice per day for the six-week duration of the trial, without provoking neck pain and with&#xD;
      attention to correct performance of the exercises. Exercises at home occurred for a period of&#xD;
      no longer than 15 to 20 minutes twice per day. Subjects were asked not to seek other&#xD;
      interventions for neck pain during the duration of the study, although usual medication was&#xD;
      not withheld.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients performed two static exercises and one dynamic exercise. The only difference&#xD;
      between both groups was the location of the resistance, which was in the lower cervical spine&#xD;
      approximately at level C4 for the emphasized exercise group and at the occiput for the&#xD;
      general exercise group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients in the emphasized exercise group performed exercises emphasizing the deep&#xD;
           cervical extensor muscles applying a resistance at the level of the vertebral arch of C4&#xD;
           either therapeutically with the therapist's fingers or as a home exercise with the aid&#xD;
           of a towel or belt. These exercises were performed in sitting and standing in front of a&#xD;
           table propped up on both forearms. In the latter position, a dynamic exercise was added&#xD;
           moving the head from maximal flexion to maximal extension keeping the gaze fixed at an&#xD;
           object lying between both elbows hoping to activate more the extensors in the lower&#xD;
           cervical spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients in the general exercise group performed exercises targeting all cervical&#xD;
           extensor muscles including the superficial ones applying resistance at the head pushing&#xD;
           against a wall or the therapist's hand or as a home exercise with the aid of a towel. As&#xD;
           in the other group, these exercises were performed in sitting and standing in front of a&#xD;
           table propped up on both forearms. In the latter position, the same dynamic exercise was&#xD;
           added as in the other group with the only difference that the gaze was fixed at an&#xD;
           object lying between both hands hoping to activate all cervical extensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage for both exercise regimes required maximal muscle activation of the patient&#xD;
      because it was shown that at this dosage the emphasized exercise results in muscle activation&#xD;
      of about 20% to 25% MVC (Maximum Voluntary Contraction) and the general exercise of about 50%&#xD;
      MVC (Schomacher et al., 2015). Patients were asked therefore to perform the exercises at&#xD;
      their individual maximal force for a short time without provoking any pain neither during nor&#xD;
      after the exercise. That is, submaximal effort without evoking pain during and after the&#xD;
      exercises was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exercises were repeated each for 3 sets with a break of 1-2 minutes between the sets. The&#xD;
      two static exercises consisted of 6 repetitions of 6 seconds hold in each position with 6&#xD;
      seconds rest between each contraction. The dynamic exercise was performed with 6 repetitions&#xD;
      through the whole range of motion with 2-3 seconds for each repetition without any rest&#xD;
      between the repetitions. A break between the repetitions was added if necessary to avoid pain&#xD;
      (Table 1). Patients repeated the exercise session one time per week under supervision of a&#xD;
      physiotherapist, during 6 weeks. In addition, patients performed the exercise session twice&#xD;
      per day seven days per week at home. Each exercise session lasted about 20 - 25 minutes.&#xD;
