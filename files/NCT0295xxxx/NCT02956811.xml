    <textblock>
      Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is common in people with type 2 diabetes (70%) and is the&#xD;
      strongest independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality that&#xD;
      there is. It is worse than triple vessel coronary disease. LVH often occurs in patients with&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; blood pressures (BP). Apart from BP, the other three main factors causing LVH are&#xD;
      insulin resistance, obesity and cardiac preload. Dapagliflozin reduces ALL four factors known&#xD;
      to promote LVH i.e. Dapagliflozin reduces weight, glycaemia, preload and blood pressure and&#xD;
      is therefore the ideal agent to reduce LVH since it uniquely attacks all four known mediators&#xD;
      of LVH. This trial will investigate the ability of dapagliflozin to regress LVH in 64&#xD;
      participants with normotensive diabetes. This will be done by seeing if dapagliflozin reduces&#xD;
      left ventricular mass as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This trial may&#xD;
      identify a novel way to reduce the strong independent risk factor of LVH which often persists&#xD;
      despite optimum medical therapy in patients with diabetes. If dapagliflozin does reduce LVH,&#xD;
      this would be a key sign of which subgroup of patients with diabetes (those with LVH) should&#xD;
      be especially targeted with dapagliflozin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      64 participants with type 2 diabetes and LVH will be recruited through the Scottish Diabetes&#xD;
      Research Network (SDRN), Scottish Primary Care Research Network (SPCRN) and other routes, in&#xD;
      this single centre study. Participants will be randomised to receive either 10mg&#xD;
      dapagliflozin or placebo daily for 12 months. Cardiac MRI will be performed at baseline and&#xD;
      at 12 months, this will be assessed for the primary outcome of change in left ventricular&#xD;
      mass. Secondary outcomes will examine change in 24 hour blood pressure and weight.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is present in the majority of patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, since it affects 70%. It is a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular deaths&#xD;
      and events and is even worse than triple vessel coronary disease. The reason why LVH is so&#xD;
      adverse is because it predates so many different cardiovascular events i.e. LVH is&#xD;
      intrinsically arrhythmogenic and causes sudden death, it impedes left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      filling and leads to diastolic heart failure, it reduces coronary perfusion reserve and&#xD;
      causes ischaemia and it causes left atrial enlargement, atrial fibrillation (AF), and&#xD;
      cardio-embolic strokes. Controlling blood pressure (BP) and using a drug that blocks the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are the standard approaches to the management of LVH but this&#xD;
      approach is only partially effective since 44% of all patients with type 2 diabetes are&#xD;
      normotensive patients with LVH. Thus &quot;normotensive LVH&quot; is very common. Indeed, BP only&#xD;
      contributes 25% to the variability in LV mass seen in a population. (This is important since&#xD;
      LVH is the same thing as a high level of LV mass). Despite a &quot;normal&quot; BP, normotensive LVH is&#xD;
      just as risky as is hypertensive LVH. Nevertheless, we do know that regressing LVH&#xD;
      irrespective of BP changes is an effective way to reduce the incidence of all major&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) events including specifically sudden deaths, heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalisations, new onset AF and strokes. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction&#xD;
      in hypertension study (LIFE) provides conclusive proof that in diabetes, LVH regression per&#xD;
      se reduces future cardiovascular events (by 24%), reduces CV deaths (by 37%) and reduces&#xD;
      total deaths (by 41%) irrespective of BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since controlling BP and using an angiotensin enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blocker is only partially effective at regressing LVH, additional ways of regressing LVH are&#xD;
      now required. Insulin resistance is another mediator of LVH. The literature is awash with&#xD;
      observational studies linking insulin resistance to LVH. Pub Med identifies 67 such papers, 5&#xD;
      of which are inconclusive. In the remaining 62 papers, 46 identify a significant relationship&#xD;
      between LVH and some measure of insulin resistance while 16 found no such relationship. The&#xD;
      large studies are mostly positive which includes Framingham, the Whitehall trial, the Strong&#xD;
      Heart trial and the Women's Health Initiative trial while the Hypertension Genetic&#xD;
      Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) trial is the one large negative trial. There are a multitude&#xD;
      of mechanisms whereby hyperinsulinaemia should produce LVH e.g. through signalling pathways&#xD;
      such as Akt, transforming growth factor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors,&#xD;
      through increased myocardial free fatty acid oxidation and through RAS activation causing&#xD;
      sodium retention and thus increased cardiac preload. Therefore, it is likely that glycaemia&#xD;
      contributes to LVH. However, reducing glycaemia per se appears to be insufficient to reduce&#xD;
      CV events and key ancillary properties of each anti-glycaemic drug will be necessary to&#xD;
      deliver the CV benefits we so badly need in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate albeit related factor mediating LVH is obesity. Importantly, dapagliflozin has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce weight. Thus the ideal treatment to regress LVH might be one that not&#xD;
      only improves glycaemia but one that also aids weight loss. Dapagliflozin is the obvious&#xD;
      option here since it has been shown to reduce both glycaemia and weight. Metformin is the&#xD;
      only other anti-glycaemic which reduces both glycaemia and weight. Indeed the reason&#xD;
      metformin reduces CV events in diabetes while other anti-glycaemic agents do not could well&#xD;
      be in part because metformin reduces both glycaemia and weight which then reduce LVH (in fact&#xD;
      we already have a separate British Heart Foundation grant to see if metformin really does&#xD;
      reduce LV mass).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However dapagliflozin has other unique effects on the CV system which will impact on LVH.&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin reduces blood pressure (LV afterload) and this by itself should also further&#xD;
      reduce LVH. Further reducing BP even in normotensive patients has been shown to definitely&#xD;
      regress LVH. Dapagliflozin also has diuretic effects which should reduce preload on the heart&#xD;
      (this will be measured preload in this trial by MRI assessed end diastolic volume). The fact&#xD;
      that dapagliflozin reduces both preload and afterload on the heart makes it uniquely&#xD;
      promising as a way to reducing future CV events in patients with diabetes and, here, in&#xD;
      reducing LV hypertrophy. Thus, dapagliflozin should regress LVH in patients with diabetes&#xD;
      because it is unique in reducing the four main causes of LVH: glycaemia/insulin resistance,&#xD;
      weight, preload and blood pressure. No other anti-diabetic medication alters even three of&#xD;
      these. Even metformin only alters two since it does not change blood pressure. All other&#xD;
      diabetic medications only reduce one (glycaemia) of these mediators of LVH. This may be why&#xD;
      other new anti-glycaemic agents have failed to reduce CV events. In this trial, it is&#xD;
      proposed to trial whether dapagliflozin causes regression of the independent cardiac risk&#xD;
      factor of LVH in diabetic participants on optimal current evidence based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Original Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin will regress LVH in normotensive participants with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI will be used to assess whether Dapagliflozin regresses LV mass more than placebo&#xD;
      does over a one year treatment period. If it does, this would strongly suggest that&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin will reduce CV events especially in the 44% of patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      who have LVH despite a controlled blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All studies examining LVH regression require to be parallel group studies as effects on LV&#xD;
      mass take 6-12 months to occur. Hence this is a parallel group, one year trial of the active&#xD;
      drug vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The issue of what dapagliflozin does to CV events in diabetes is a hot topic. Most new&#xD;
      antidiabetic drugs have been neutral or harmful but, judging by its pharmacological effects,&#xD;
      it is quite possible that dapagliflozin might reduce CV events. A large ongoing trial&#xD;
      (Dapagliflozin Effect on CardiovascuLAR Events - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction&#xD;
      (DECLARE - TIMI)) is just beginning to look at this. Why therefore do we also need to trial&#xD;
      the effects of dapagliflozin on LV mass in those with LVH? If DECLARE-TIMI shows clearly that&#xD;
      dapagliflozin reduces CV events, then our trial will have revealed a possible contributing&#xD;
      mechanism to the reduced CV events i.e. LVH regression (patients in DECLARE-TIMI will not&#xD;
      receive echocardiography so that subgroup analysis will not be able to answer this question&#xD;
      and electrocardiograms are useless at identifying LVH. Furthermore, the accuracy of MRI over&#xD;
      echo is so great that echo studies of LVH regression should no longer be considered&#xD;
      reliable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other words, large mega-trials like DECLARE-TIMI are very valuable, but parallel smaller&#xD;
      mechanistic studies like this can enhance their value by helping to explain the mechanisms&#xD;
      producing the mega-trial results and/or helping to identify a subgroup who get a particular&#xD;
      benefit meaning that the drug becomes more cost effective in that subgroup. Overall, this&#xD;
      trial might, in conjunction with a mega-trial, help decide the course of future research&#xD;
      (should LVH be a favoured target?) and help decide how to apply the results of a mega-trial&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;
