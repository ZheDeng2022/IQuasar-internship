  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if a combination therapy of tacrolimus and vedolizumab is&#xD;
      superior to vedolizumab monotherapy for induction of remission in moderate to severe UC, and&#xD;
      its effect on long and short-term outcomes including colectomy rate. Secondary aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety of tacrolimus as an induction agent in patients with UC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase III studies have shown that patients with UC who received vedolizumab had a higher rate&#xD;
      of clinical response, clinical remission and mucosal healing when compared to placebo3.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, while clinical response rate was almost 50%, the rate of clinical remission at&#xD;
      6 weeks was only 16.9. In comparison, in the ACT trials almost 40% of patients achieved&#xD;
      remission at week 84. The delayed onset of action of vedolizumab monotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      UC may lead to a higher colectomy rate and limit the use of vedolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      active disease who require rapid induction of remission. Corticosteroids are used as a&#xD;
      bridging agent to rapidly induce remission. However, steroid refractory or dependent disease&#xD;
      and steroid intolerance are common. Furthermore, steroids have devastating side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tacrolimus inhibits the complexion of calcineurin with its respective cytoplasmic receptors&#xD;
      cyclophilin and FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP-12), both of which regulate a calmodulin&#xD;
      dependent-phosphatase. Tacrolimus has been found to be efficacious in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe UC. Unfortunately, because of the safety profile with long&#xD;
      term use, the drug is mostly used as an induction agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While switching to vedolizumab from another drug that has not been efficacious or has lost&#xD;
      effectiveness (or starting vedolizumab as a first agent) can be beneficious in the long term,&#xD;
      patients need an induction agent in order to achieve remission in a short period of time.&#xD;
      Tacrolimus is a widely used drug to prevent implant rejection after a transplant. Randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials have shown that is highly effective with good response rates even after 2&#xD;
      weeks of therapy. In order to avoid side effects, tacrolimus is usually used for a limited&#xD;
      amount of time (12-14 weeks), which is sufficient time to induce remission of disease.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, as other inflammatory bowel diseases, UC recurs and patients also require a&#xD;
      maintenance therapy. While tacrolimus has been used with good results as a long term agent,&#xD;
      the ideal scenario is to avoid its long term use as there is still a potential for side&#xD;
      effects and a need for a very strict close monitoring. This is why a long term maintenance&#xD;
      agent is needed to keep the patient in remission. Until recently, no ideal agent was&#xD;
      available for this purpose, as while anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (infliximab and&#xD;
      adalimumab) have been approved for ulcerative colitis, its combination with another agent&#xD;
      that induces systemic immunosuppression (in this case, tacrolimus) could potentially increase&#xD;
      the risk of infections and/or malignancies. Because vedolizumab is gut selective, does not&#xD;
      affect the entire immune system and post-marketing studies have confirmed its safety profile.&#xD;
      This makes it a perfect combination agent to tacrolimus, theoretically decreasing the&#xD;
      potential side effect while increasing its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the addition of tacrolimus as an induction agent to a standard regimen&#xD;
      of vedolizumab increases the efficacy of the drug, decreasing the rate of need for colectomy&#xD;
      and other complications while quickly improving the patients' quality of life without&#xD;
      significantly increasing the risk of adverse events.&#xD;
