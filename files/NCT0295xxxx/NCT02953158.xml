      This study will compare two energy reduced diets; one diet will include one Haas avocado/day&#xD;
      while the other diet will follow the usual American dietary pattern. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive a dietary plan that reduces their usual intake by 500kcal/day with the same&#xD;
      percentage of fat, protein and carbohydrates. The results from this study may help to explain&#xD;
      if eating one Haas avocado/day can achieve at least equivalent weight loss when compared to&#xD;
      the usual American diet.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity in the United States and other industrialized countries represents a&#xD;
      significant and growing health problem. Individuals who are overweight or obese increase&#xD;
      their risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes (T2D), and the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
      Obesity affects both genders and every ethnicity in the United States. The prevalence of&#xD;
      obesity in the United States is currently 32.2% in adult men and 35.5% in adult women. The&#xD;
      most recent evidence indicates that 33.8% of adults, over 66 million American adults, are&#xD;
      obese (30 million men and 36 million women) while an additional 74 million (42 million men&#xD;
      and 32 million women) are overweight. The prevalence of obesity has grown a shocking 40% over&#xD;
      the last 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These problems are truly global in nature. In European countries obesity ranges from 20-30%&#xD;
      of the population and is even higher in Australia, South America, and Polynesia. The World&#xD;
      Health Organization estimates that there will be over 1.5 billion obese individuals worldwide&#xD;
      by 2020 if current trends continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calorie controlled diets have routinely been demonstrated to help in both short and long-term&#xD;
      weight reduction in individuals who are overweight or obese. In particular, hypocaloric&#xD;
      diets, with a calorie reduction of 500 kcals per day have been shown in numerous studies to&#xD;
      result in safe and effective weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important for individuals who are following weight loss programs to maintain healthy&#xD;
      nutritional patterns, to maintain or improve their dietary quality. Haas avocados can play a&#xD;
      significant role as part of a healthy weight loss program and help individuals not only&#xD;
      improve their dietary quality, but also lower their risk of chronic diseases such as CHD,&#xD;
      T2D, and the metabolic syndrome. Avocados are high in monounsaturated fat, dietary fiber, and&#xD;
      a variety of other important phytochemicals such as lutein, vitamin E, niacin and folate.&#xD;
      Despite these multiple nutritional benefits, myths exist that avocados may be fattening due&#xD;
      to their fat and calorie content and therefore, should be avoided by people trying to lose&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research trial is designed to compare two energy reduced (hypocaloric) diets. One&#xD;
      diet will include one Hass avocado/day, while achieving a 500 kcal/day energy reduction. The&#xD;
      other diet will follow a usual American diet pattern, but will also include an energy&#xD;
      restriction of 500 kcals/day. Parameters to be explored include weight loss, satiety, dietary&#xD;
      quality, changes in body composition and risk factors for chronic disease.&#xD;
