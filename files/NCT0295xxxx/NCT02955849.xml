      Aims and Objectives (Quantitative) Aim: To compare the effectiveness of selective laser&#xD;
      trabeculoplasty with trabeculoplasty in lowering the intraocular pressure in patients with&#xD;
      medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma in rural China, taking into account the impact of&#xD;
      patient acceptance of each type of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Mean intraocular pressure after treatment with selective laser trabeculoplasty&#xD;
      will be lower than with surgery due to higher acceptance rates among patients randomized to&#xD;
      receive this treatment and therefore treatment provided at an earlier stage of disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the three leading causes of blindness in China. Although this condition&#xD;
      can be controlled with medication to lower intraocular pressure , such treatment must&#xD;
      continue over a patient's lifetime. This is not practical in resource-poor settings due to&#xD;
      cost and inconvenience for patients. Trabeculectomy is the standard treatment offered in&#xD;
      rural China but is rarely used because of the following issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. need for hospitalization, which increases patient expense and inconvenience&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. high refusal rates by patients for all ocular surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. high rates of infection due to poor quality instruments and material&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. need for multiple follow-up visits post-surgery (our earlier work shows a return rate of&#xD;
           only 30% 1 month post-surgery among rural patients in China).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A viable alternative for patients in rural China is selective laser trabeculoplasty , based&#xD;
      on the following advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. simplicity (done as a 5-minute out-patient procedure requiring only topical anaesthesia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. effectiveness (18-32% reduction in intraocular pressure, which is comparable to&#xD;
           medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. safety (complications are rare and do not include serious infectious as with&#xD;
           trabeculotemy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. convenience (minimal follow-up, with one visit within 6 weeks post-surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. cost-effectiveness (compared to other glaucoma therapies in many settings)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. acceptability to patients (due to low-cost out-patient care with easy follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design (Quantitative) This phase of the proposed China Laser and Surgery Study research&#xD;
      project is a multi-centre open-label pragmatic randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolment: 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data analysis: 4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population and Setting: Patients presenting with glaucoma at rural hospitals (n=4) in&#xD;
      Guangdong province, China, all of whom are currently capable of performing trabeculectomy&#xD;
      surgery, and have been provided an selective laser trabeculoplasty machine and training in&#xD;
      its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: One hundred ninety patients (95 in each group) will be needed to obtain a power&#xD;
      of 0.90, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Patients are the unit of randomization. Expected IOP&#xD;
      difference between groups of 3.0 mm Hg + 4.0 mmg HG, and a correlation of 0.30 between&#xD;
      baseline and final intraocular pressure, allowing for loss to follow up of 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      aseline data (to be collected prior to determination of eligibility and randomization but&#xD;
      after obtaining informed consent) include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence or absence of relevant pre-existing health conditions (i.e., hypertension,&#xD;
           diabetes, cardiovascular disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ophthamologic test results&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Best corrected visual acuity and presenting visual acuity in both eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intraocular pressure in both eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cup to disk ratio in both eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  presence or absence of visually significant cataract in both eyes; if cataract&#xD;
                present in study eye, whether cataract surgery has already been performed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  degrees of visible Trabecular Meshwork in the study eye on gonioscopy without&#xD;
                &quot;dynamic gonioscopy&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  score on glaucoma knowledge test using a simple, previously validated questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  date of birth or self-reported age in years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact information&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Address&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mobile phone number where can be reached (own or neighbours, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socioeconomic status&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  completed education in years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  wealth, as measured by ownership of items on a pre-determined list of 13 common&#xD;
                household devices in China&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  job title/description&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of difficulty traveling to hospital with eye clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  distance traveled&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time spent traveling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  direct or out-of-pocket costs for travel, meals, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following requirements for intention-to-treat analyses, we will measure mean intraocular&#xD;
           pressure at 12 months comparing the two groups and adjusting for baseline intraocular&#xD;
           pressure, including all subjects who accepted and refused treatment (primary analysis,&#xD;
           unadjusted). We will also measure intraocular pressure as above, adjusting for cataract&#xD;
           surgery, age, gender, prior use of medication, degrees of open angle in study eye at&#xD;
           baseline, and severity of glaucoma (Cup to disk ratio) in study eye at baseline (primary&#xD;
           analysis, adjusted). Both of the above analyses will be repeated using a per protocol&#xD;
           approach (including only patients who accepted their assigned therapy, or secondary&#xD;
           analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will test for differences in baseline characteristics by study group with t-tests&#xD;
           (for continuous variables) and Chi-square tests (for categorical variables). We will use&#xD;
           generalized linear models with Poisson regression (for variables with binary outcomes)&#xD;
           and linear regression (for variables with continuous outcomes) to estimate the relative&#xD;
           risk for the intervention arm. Multiple imputation in Stata 13.1 (StataCorp, College&#xD;
           Station, TX, USA) will be used to address missing data. All statistical analysis will be&#xD;
           performed using Stata 13.1. A two-tailed P-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
           statistically significant.&#xD;
