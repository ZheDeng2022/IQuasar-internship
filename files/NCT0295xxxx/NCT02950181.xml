    <textblock>
      This study involves looking at Cerebral oximetry measurements in pediatric and neonatal&#xD;
      patients who are experiencing a critical illness. Such as Altered mental status, seizures,&#xD;
      trauma, sepsis, etc.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) Pediatric Emergency Department (PED), NIRS cerebral&#xD;
      tissue oxygenation rSO2 monitoring has become an adjunct noninvasive monitoring assessment&#xD;
      tool along with Pulse Oximetry and End-Tidal CO2 in the critically ill and injured neonatal&#xD;
      and pediatric patients' resuscitation endeavors or management. This has become a standard&#xD;
      monitoring tool for patients who require medical (possible strokes, diabetic ketoacidosis,&#xD;
      increased intracranial pressure, altered mental status, sepsis, drowning, shock, rapid&#xD;
      sequence intubations, seizures, altered mental status, strokes, possible shunt malfunctions)&#xD;
      or trauma (non-accidental trauma, Level One or Two Trauma with altered mental status,&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, altered mental status with trauma history, vascular compromise)&#xD;
      resuscitation efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected as a retrospective and prospective chart review from the electronic&#xD;
      medical record of patients that were treated in the pediatric emergency department of&#xD;
      Arkansas Children's Hospital from 10-1-13 who require medical (possible strokes, diabetic&#xD;
      ketoacidosis, increased intracranial pressure, altered mental status, sepsis, drowning,&#xD;
      shock, rapid sequence intubations, seizures, altered mental status, strokes, possible shunt&#xD;
      malfunctions) or trauma (non-accidental trauma, Level One or Two Trauma with altered mental&#xD;
      status, traumatic brain injury, altered mental status with trauma history, vascular&#xD;
      compromise) resuscitation efforts. This study will be based on the patient information&#xD;
      recorded in these records, such as age, medications delivered, vital signs, interventions and&#xD;
      outcomes and compared to their PED NIRS cerebral tissue oxygenation rSO2 data. All study&#xD;
      subject materials will be assigned a unique identifying code or number. The cerebral NIRS&#xD;
      rSO2 data will be collected/graphed and de-identified.&#xD;

    <description>All study data will be obtained from the physical or electronic medical records obtained at Arkansas Children's Hospital. Patient's NIRS and vital signs data will be in an excel format with de-identified patient information which will be age, interventions, and etiology as denoted as Medical vs. Trauma (see study population for inclusion criteria). This is a data review with de-identified patient chart analysis for age, weight, past medical histories, co-morbidities, medical or surgical interventions, medications, seizures, duration of events, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, intubations, and outcomes. All relevant information will be entered into a Redcap database. All study subject materials will be assigned a unique identifying code or number.</description>
