      The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of a pressure-detecting shoe improve&#xD;
      can enhance favorable loading conditions at the knee.&#xD;

      This is a randomized longitudinal proof-of-concept study. After a telephone prescreening, an&#xD;
      in-person visit will screen for inclusion and exclusion criteria, requiring a clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic assessment. A total of 40 subjects with symptomatic and radiographic medial knee&#xD;
      OA will be enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. A total of three study&#xD;
      visits will occur at the following time points: baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. At all three&#xD;
      visits, the following outcome variables will be acquired: (1) joint loads during gait using&#xD;
      3D motion analysis and (2) knee symptoms, stiffness, pain, daily function, recreational&#xD;
      function, and quality of life using the validated questionnaires. At the baseline visit,&#xD;
      every participant will receive a standardized shoe and a pressure-detecting shoe insole.&#xD;
      Randomly assigned to one of two groups, participants assigned to group A (n=25) will train&#xD;
      for 3 weeks in the mobility shoe with active pressure-based feedback from the shoe insole,&#xD;
      and group B (n=15) will train for three weeks in the mobility shoe with a passive shoe&#xD;
      insole. All subjects will be encouraged to wear the study shoes containing the shoe insoles&#xD;
      as their primary form of footwear and for a minimum of 6 hours/day, 6 days/week. They will be&#xD;
      given a diary to record the daily time spent wearing the shoe/insole, daily analgesic&#xD;
      history, and adverse events. These diaries will be reviewed at the 3 and 6 week study visits.&#xD;
      After completing the third visit, subjects will have completed the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to give informed consent and comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic OA of the knee greater than 3 months, as defined by the American College&#xD;
             of Rheumatology's Clinical Criteria for Classification and Reporting of OA of the&#xD;
             Knee. If symptoms are bilateral, then the knee identified as more symptomatic will&#xD;
             serve as the index knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ambulatory knee pain, defined as the presence of greater than 30 mm of pain while&#xD;
             walking on a flat surface (corresponding to question 1 of the visual analog format of&#xD;
             the WOMAC).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Predominant lateral compartment OA, defined as narrowing of the lateral joint space in&#xD;
             excess of the narrowing of the medial joint space in either knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent systemic inflammatory arthropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior knee or hip arthroplasty, or surgical arthroscopy within the previous 3 months.&#xD;
