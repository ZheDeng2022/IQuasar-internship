  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-center, 4-period, 6-sequence study in healthy subjects to&#xD;
      compare the PK of GED 0301 after a single oral dose in the fed and fasted state, and after co&#xD;
      administration with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline phase, four treatment periods, and a&#xD;
      follow up phone call five days (± 1 day) after discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be consented and screened within 21 days of dosing. They will undergo routine&#xD;
      screening procedures including physical examinations (PE), 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs),&#xD;
      vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory safety tests (clinical chemistry, haematology,&#xD;
      urinalysis), pregnancy tests for females, and serology/drug/alcohol screens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will return to the clinic site on Day -1 for baseline safety assessments.&#xD;
      After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will be assigned randomly to one of&#xD;
      six treatment sequences which will determine fasting status and the order in which treatments&#xD;
      will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the fasted arm will receive either a single 160 mg tablet of GED 0301 or four 40&#xD;
      mg tablets of GED 0301, with approximately 240 mL of room temperature, non-carbonated water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the fed arm will be required to fast overnight for at least 10 hours. On the&#xD;
      morning of dosing, these subjects will be served a high-fat meal. The meal should be entirely&#xD;
      consumed within 20 minutes of being served. Dosing of a single160 mg tablet of GED 0301 will&#xD;
      occur within 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) after the start of the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the fourth period, subjects will receive once daily oral doses of 40 mg omeprazole for&#xD;
      6 days (Days 10 through 16). Subjects will fast on the evening of the fourth day for at least&#xD;
      10 hours prior to receiving the last treatment, which is a single dose of 160 mg GED 0301&#xD;
      together with one 40 mg oral dose of omeprazole (Day 15). On Day 16, subjects will take the&#xD;
      last dose of omeprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood sampling for the determination of GED 0301 levels in plasma will be performed&#xD;
      during each period for 48 hours post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be domiciled at the clinic site from Day 1 of Period 1 until Day 17. All&#xD;
      subjects will be discharged from the clinic site on Day 17 when all required safety and PK&#xD;
      procedures have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow up phone call will occur five days (± 1 day) after discharge from the clinic center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in&#xD;
      International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the&#xD;
      general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive&#xD;
      approval from an EC prior to commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this&#xD;
      study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent&#xD;
      regulatory authorities.&#xD;
