    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, open-label, non-randomized, single arm study to evaluate the safety, and&#xD;
      efficacy of HBI-8000 40 mg BIW in patients with relapsed or refractory ATL (R/R ATL). HBI&#xD;
      8000 will be administered orally approximately 30 minutes after any regular meal twice a&#xD;
      week. There will be 3 to 4 days between dosing. A treatment cycle is defined as 28&#xD;
      consecutive days. HBI-8000 administration will be continued until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities are observed despite appropriate dose reduction or treatment&#xD;
      interruption.&#xD;

             by the presence of at least 1 of the following: serum albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL, lactic&#xD;
             dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;300 U/L, or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &gt;25 mg/dL. The patient must&#xD;
