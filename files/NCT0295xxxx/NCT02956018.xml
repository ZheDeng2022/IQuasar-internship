    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant thrombosis (loss of blood flow) is responsible for up to 35% transplant&#xD;
      failures in children. Detection of kidney transplant thrombosis currently relies on&#xD;
      recognition of deterioration in parameters such as urine output and blood creatinine levels,&#xD;
      which change relatively slowly. Confirmation is then required with an ultrasound scan. There&#xD;
      is inherent delay in the above process, during which time some or all of the transplant&#xD;
      kidney tissue can die, which can result in failure of the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique used in continuous monitoring&#xD;
      of oxygen levels in several organ systems including the brain, muscles, gut, liver and native&#xD;
      kidneys. We hypothesise that NIRS can be applied to monitor kidney transplant blood flow in&#xD;
      real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to test the use of NIRS in detecting blood flow in established kidney transplants in&#xD;
      children, and to compare it with ultrasound, the current gold standard measurement. Existing&#xD;
      NIRS equipment would be used within its CE marked purpose measuring oxygen levels; this&#xD;
      mechanistic study would extrapolate measured oxygen levels to determine blood flow.&#xD;
      Participating children attending outpatient clinic for routine transplant ultrasound scans&#xD;
      will have NIRs monitoring for a 10 minute period. NIRs data will be compared to a validated&#xD;
      perfusion score from ultrasound images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study is successful, NIRS could provide continuous monitoring of kidney transplant&#xD;
      blood flow in the postoperative period, thus allowing immediate detection of blood flow&#xD;
      problems. This has potential to reduce kidney transplant failures from thrombosis.&#xD;

      The purpose of this mechanistic pilot study is to determine whether existing NIRS equipment,&#xD;
      used within its intended CE marked purpose measuring tissue oxygenation, can reliably&#xD;
      determine blood flow in established kidney transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare NIRS to the current gold standard measure of kidney transplant perfusion,&#xD;
           Doppler ultrasound, in established kidney transplants in children&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the practicality of using NIRS to measure perfusion in children with&#xD;
           established kidney transplants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Primary Outcome • Correlation of NIRs perfusion data with Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      perfusion parameters assessed using a validated scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Quality of NIRS data obtained (assessed by proportion of valid readings vs lost readings)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design For participating patients undergoing routine clinical outpatient renal&#xD;
      transplant ultrasound examinations, NIRS data will be recorded on the same day. Ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations will be undertaken by an experienced member of the radiology team following a&#xD;
      standard protocol. NIRS data will be recorded by a member of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound operator will perform doppler ultrasound assessment of graft parenchymal&#xD;
      perfusion, and mark on the skin positions of the transplant upper, inter and lower poles. The&#xD;
      ultrasound assessment will include a measurement of the distance from skin to the&#xD;
      corticomedullary junction of the upper, inter and lower poles of the kidney transplant. NIRS&#xD;
      data will then be recorded for 2 minutes with two NIRS sensors placed over the transplant mid&#xD;
      and lower poles as per markings from ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection NIRS data will be stored electronically on a password protected NHS computer&#xD;
      and identified via an individual study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oximetry readings will be exported to a password protected NHS computer for analysis.&#xD;
      Continuous sampling data will be transformed to area under the curve (AUC) for time periods&#xD;
      of 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Doppler perfusion data will be recorded on data collection sheets labelled with&#xD;
      the participant's study number. Data recorded will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resistive index&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Global assessment of graft perfusion as per validated scale outlined below&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Doppler waveform characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Transplant parenchymal abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal allograft Doppler perfusion scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score Doppler ultrasound assessment 0 Unidentifiable vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Few vessels in the vicinity of the hilum&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hilar and interlobar vessels in most of the renal parenchyma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Renal vessels identifiable until the arcuate arteries in the entire field of view&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Protection Data will be collected and retained in accordance with the Data Protection&#xD;
      Act 1998.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For identification purposes, patients' study numbers, name and hospital numbers will be&#xD;
      stored on a single password protected NHS computer in a password protected database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage of records Study documents (paper and electronic) will be retained in a secure&#xD;
      location during and after the trial has finished. All source documents will be retained for a&#xD;
      period of five years following the end of the study. Where trial related information is&#xD;
      documented in the medical records - those records will be identified by a 'Do not destroy&#xD;
      before dd/mm/yyyy' label where date is five years after the last patient last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS perfusion data at the time of each Doppler ultrasound will be interrogated. Continuous&#xD;
      sampling data will be transformed to area under the curve (AUC) for time periods of 15&#xD;
      seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS AUC data will be compared to Doppler ultrasound perfusion data using Spearman's&#xD;
      correlation. Accounting for the repeated measurements within patients, mixed effects logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis will be conducted and reciever operating characteristic curves will be&#xD;
      determined for each NIRS AUC interval (i.e. 15 sec, 30 sec, 1,5 and 10 min), using the&#xD;
      dichotomous Doppler ultrasound outcome as the gold standard. NIRs AUC data for perfused and&#xD;
      non-perfused allograft poles will be compared using mixed effects regression analysis.&#xD;
      Distributional assumptions will be investigated and where appropriate suitable&#xD;
      transformations will be used.&#xD;
