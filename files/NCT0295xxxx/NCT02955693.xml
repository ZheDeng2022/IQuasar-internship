  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the organism affects MMF (metabolite of&#xD;
      dimethyl fumarate [DMF]) after single oral dose administration of LAS41008 120 mg&#xD;
      gastroresistant tablet and Fumaderm® 120 mg gastro-resistant tablet under fasting and fed&#xD;
      conditions. The study also aims to assess the safety of the study treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be conducted to further investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      LAS41008 (containing DMF) after single oral dose administrations of a 120 mg gastro-resistant&#xD;
      tablet under fed and fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two previous Phase 1 studies allowed exploring the PK of LAS41008 30 mg and 120 mg separately&#xD;
      after multiple dosing. In the current study, an improved bioanalytical method will allow the&#xD;
      detection of lower MMF concentrations, and thus the same gastro-resistant tablet formulation&#xD;
      (LAS41008) as used in the previous Phase 1 study will be investigated, but on a larger&#xD;
      population and after single oral dose administration. Only the higher LAS41008 dose (120 mg)&#xD;
      will be tested, as this is the formulation to be most frequently used during a standard&#xD;
      treatment course for psoriasis with LAS41008. Similarly, single oral doses of Fumaderm® 120&#xD;
      mg (defined mixture of DMF and calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and zinc (Zn) salts of&#xD;
      ethylhydrogenfumarate (EHF, mono-ethyl fumarate (MEF)) will be tested in order to provide&#xD;
      better comparative PK data. The comparison of LAS41008 and Fumaderm® PK will be evaluated in&#xD;
      an exploratory manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to a randomised, open-label, four-way complete&#xD;
      crossover, single dose design in 32 healthy male and female subjects. Up to 4 discontinued&#xD;
      subjects may be replaced in case of early dropouts or a dropout rate greater than 15% (5 or&#xD;
      more subjects). Gender balance will also be taken into consideration to ensure that roughly&#xD;
      the same number of males and females are randomised. Upon inclusion into the treatment phase,&#xD;
      each subject will be randomly allocated to one of four treatment sequences in a 4x4 Williams&#xD;
      design. On Day 1 of each treatment period subjects will receive a single oral dose of either&#xD;
      LAS41008 120 mg gastro-resistant tablet or Fumaderm® 120 mg gastro-resistant tablet under&#xD;
      fasting or fed conditions. The drug administrations will be separated by a wash-out-phase of&#xD;
      7 ± 3 days. Blood sampling for PK will be performed until 24 hours after each study drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be signed before any study activity, including the&#xD;
      withdrawal of any concomitant medication (at least 2 weeks before this screening visit) if&#xD;
      required for study participation. The Screening Visit will take place within 28 days before&#xD;
      randomisation and after signing of the ICF to check subjects' eligibility. In each period,&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted to the study centre from the morning of Day -1 until discharge in&#xD;
      the morning of Day 2 (after collection of last blood sampling for PK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of study participation for each subject from Visit 1 (Screening) to the&#xD;
      Follow-up Visit 7 ± 3 days after the last study drug administration is estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately 7 to 10 weeks considering study visits time-window allowance.&#xD;
