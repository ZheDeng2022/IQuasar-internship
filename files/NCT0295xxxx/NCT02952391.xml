  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although PD is considered predominantly as a motor disease caused by loss of dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurons, multiple studies indicate that cholinergic dysfunction already starts in early PD&#xD;
      and is crucial for the development of dementia in addition to motor symptoms.Because of its&#xD;
      crucial role in CNS functioning and neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, it is of great&#xD;
      importance to get a better understanding of the cholinergic functioning in the brain.&#xD;
      Pathways of acetylcholine synthesis, transport and release provide possible targets for in&#xD;
      vivo imaging of the cholinergic system. However,previous approaches are considered as&#xD;
      indirect biomarkers of cholinergic terminal integrity because they measure both pre- and&#xD;
      post-synaptic expressions. The novel vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) tracer&#xD;
      [18F]Fluoroethoxy-Benzovesamicol ([18F]FEOBV) provides a more direct measurement of&#xD;
      presynaptic cholinergic function. The use of [18F]FEOBV as a Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
      (PET) imaging marker of cholinergic innervations has, however, only been studied in healthy&#xD;
      human volunteers and no data is available on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study the differences in cholinergic function between PD patients and healthy&#xD;
      aged-matched volunteers will be quantified. In addition the test-retest variability will be&#xD;
      determined&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholinergic neurons play an important role in neurotransmission within the central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS). They are involved in complex functions like memory, learning, recognition,&#xD;
      attention, consciousness, regulation of sleep-wake cycles and maintenance of posture and&#xD;
      gait. Cholinergic neuron degeneration in the neocortex and hippocampus of the CNS, is an&#xD;
      important neurochemical change observed in several neurodegenerative diseases, including&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, assessment of the vesicular&#xD;
      acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) as an important molecular target in the cholinergic&#xD;
      circuit, has sparked interest in the development of radiotracers for studying this target in&#xD;
      vivo. Preclinical studies show the VAChT tracer (-)-5- [18F]Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol&#xD;
      ([18F]FEOBV) to be potentially useful in detecting cholinergic lesions in vivo. A previous&#xD;
      [18F]FEOBV PET study confirms that the tracer binds to VAChT with the expected in vivo human&#xD;
      brain distribution. The use of [18F]FEOBV as a PET imaging marker of cholinergic innervations&#xD;
      has, however, only been studied in healthy human volunteers and no data is available on&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the differences in [18F]FEOBV binding between&#xD;
      PD patients and healthy control subjects, in order to evaluate the clinical feasibility of&#xD;
      [18F]FEOBV as a cholinergic imaging ligand in PD. Secondary objectives are the assessment of&#xD;
      test-retest variability and confirming previous findings on [18F]FEOBV validation. Both&#xD;
      secondary objectives are prerequisites for the main objective. In addition, an explorative&#xD;
      analysis of the relationship between neuropsychological performance and cholinergic&#xD;
      innervation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: In order to establish the difference in [18F]FEOBV binding between PD patients&#xD;
      and healthy control subjects, the study will be conducted in three parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first part of the study is to establish [18F]FEOBV as a PET tracer for application&#xD;
           in clinical research by confirming previous findings on [18F]FEOBV validation. This will&#xD;
           include dynamic scanning of 3 healthy control subjects in 3 imaging sessions (0-120,&#xD;
           150-180, 210-240 min after injection of [18F]FEOBV). From this part of the study, the&#xD;
           optimal short static scan period will be determined by comparing relative uptake values&#xD;
           with the results of kinetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 of the study is to evaluate differences in [18F]FEOBV in Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
           healthy controls. For this, the three dynamic scans of part 1 will be used and an&#xD;
           additional 7 healthy control subjects and 10 PD patients will be included for a simple&#xD;
           static scan (period determined after part 1 of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In part 3, test-retest variability is evaluated in both groups. Of each group, 5&#xD;
           patients will undergo a short second static scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be screened within 30 days before the PET scan for demographic information&#xD;
      and detailed clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 10 PD patients and 10 age matched control subjects will be included in the study,&#xD;
      all between the ages of 45-65 years. Of the 10 control subjects, 3 will undergo full dynamic&#xD;
      scanning, all other subjects included will undergo simple static scanning. A total of 10&#xD;
      subjects, 5 from each group, will undergo a second static scan. The patient group includes&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease with a disease duration of at least 3 years and maximum 10&#xD;
      years. All subjects will undergo a neuropsychological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint of this study is the difference in VAChT brain binding on a [18F]FEOBV&#xD;
      PET-scan between PD patients and healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are test-retest variability in both patients and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects, and neuropsychological performance in both groups.&#xD;
