    <time_frame>Mean scores averaged over 2 weeks pre-medication compared to 3 weeks post-medication.</time_frame>
    <description>The Group Questionnaire is a self-report measure with three sub-scales that measure Positive Bonding, Positive Working and Negative Relationship dimensions of the relationships at 3 levels: between group members, between group members and group therapists, and between group members and the group as a whole. Each subscale score is calculated by summation of the ratings across all three levels for each subscale. Positive Bonding scores range from 13 to 91 with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Positive Working scores range 8 to 56 with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Negative Relationship scores range 9 to 63 with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change in Average Score on Subscales of Group Questionnaire Pre-drug vs Post-drug</title>
        <description>The Group Questionnaire is a self-report measure with three sub-scales that measure Positive Bonding, Positive Working and Negative Relationship dimensions of the relationships at 3 levels: between group members, between group members and group therapists, and between group members and the group as a whole. Each subscale score is calculated by summation of the ratings across all three levels for each subscale. Positive Bonding scores range from 13 to 91 with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Positive Working scores range 8 to 56 with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Negative Relationship scores range 9 to 63 with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>
        <time_frame>Mean scores averaged over 2 weeks pre-medication compared to 3 weeks post-medication.</time_frame>

          <title>Change in Average Score on Subscales of Group Questionnaire Pre-drug vs Post-drug</title>
          <description>The Group Questionnaire is a self-report measure with three sub-scales that measure Positive Bonding, Positive Working and Negative Relationship dimensions of the relationships at 3 levels: between group members, between group members and group therapists, and between group members and the group as a whole. Each subscale score is calculated by summation of the ratings across all three levels for each subscale. Positive Bonding scores range from 13 to 91 with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Positive Working scores range 8 to 56 with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Negative Relationship scores range 9 to 63 with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>
