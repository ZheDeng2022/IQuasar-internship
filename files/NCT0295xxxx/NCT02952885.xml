  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acromegaly is a rare, chronic, and debilitating disease, usually caused by a benign tumor on&#xD;
      the pituitary gland, which leads to excessive production of growth hormone (GH). GH excess in&#xD;
      turn causes overproduction of another hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).&#xD;
      IGF-1 levels are currently the most widely accepted measure of disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, medical therapy with a type of medicine called &quot;somatostatin analogues&quot; (SSA),&#xD;
      such as octreotide and lanreotide, is recommended for treatment of acromegaly. However,&#xD;
      studies have shown that a significant number of patients who take SSA medications alone&#xD;
      remain with elevated levels of IGF-1 in their blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another medication that is used to treat acromegaly is pegvisomant (PEGV), and the&#xD;
      investigators plan to study whether strict control of IGF-1, by adding or optimizing the use&#xD;
      of PEGV, results in a significant health benefits to patients who still have modestly high&#xD;
      levels of IGF-1 in their blood.&#xD;

    <description>Study medications will be prescribed as per clinical practice with PEGV being added, or optimally dosed, at the Month 0 visit. Subjects who are naïve to PEGV should start their injections from 10 mg twice a week to 10 mg daily if used as combination therapy or 10 to 20 mg daily if used as monotherapy. Maximum dosing should not exceed 40mg/day. Dosing of PEGV can be adjusted as per clinical judgement to meet the normalization of IGF-1 levels (&lt;1.0 ULN) in increments of 5-10mg/day. In the event of a reduction in IGF-1 below the LLN, the dose of PEGV could be decreased by 5-10 mg/day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients (at least 18 years old) with confirmed acromegaly whose IGF-I levels&#xD;
             are persistently but modestly (1.0 ULN &lt; [IGF-1 serum level] &lt; 1.5 ULN) elevated&#xD;
