      This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cannabinoids mix&#xD;
      [cannabidiol (CBD), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a 20:1 ratio, BOL Pharma, Israel] for&#xD;
      behavioral problems in children and youth with ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disruptive behaviors are very common in children and youth with autism spectrum disorder&#xD;
      (ASD). Behavioral problems increase social impairment in children with ASD, make&#xD;
      interventions more difficult and place considerable strain on families and caregivers.&#xD;
      Current treatment is based on behavioral interventions combined with atypical antipsychotics&#xD;
      which often have low tolerability and questionable efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis exerts profound effects on human social behavior. Research using animal models of&#xD;
      ASD indicate a possible dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system, and stress that it may&#xD;
      be a novel target for pharmacological interventions. Anecdotal evidence suggest efficacy of&#xD;
      various phytocannabinoids in resistant behavioral problems. However controlled human studies&#xD;
      are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of cannabinoids mix [cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a 20:1 ratio, BOL Pharma, Israel] for behavioral&#xD;
      problems in children and youth with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with crossover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: One hundred and fifty participants, ages 5-21 years, with ASD and moderate to severe&#xD;
      refractory behavioral problems will be randomized to receive 1 out of 3 treatments for&#xD;
      12-weeks and cross-over to another treatment in a second 12 weeks period. Treatment options&#xD;
      are: (1) oral placebo (2) cannabis extract, contains cannabidiol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol&#xD;
      in a 20:1 ratio, at a cannabidiol dose of 10 mg/kg/d and (3) pure cannabidiol and&#xD;
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the same ratio and dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and measures: Two co-primary endpoints will compare the whole plant extract&#xD;
      treatment to the placebo treatment on a within subject design. 1) The change from baseline&#xD;
      Home Situations Questionnaire-ASD score after 3 months of treatment (HSQ-ASD; a parent rated&#xD;
      assessment of disruptive behavior). 2) The Clinical Global Impression- improvement (CGI-I; a&#xD;
      clinician rated assessment of improvement in disruptive behavior following treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy outcomes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within subject differences between the placebo condition and the pure cannabinoids&#xD;
           condition and between the whole plant extract condition and the pure cannabinoids&#xD;
           condition in the change from baseline HSQ-ASD score after 3 months of treatment and in&#xD;
           the CGI-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within subject differences between each pair of the 3 conditions in the Clinical Global&#xD;
           Impression- drug effect (CGI-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within subject differences between each pair of the 3 conditions in the change from&#xD;
           baseline after 3 months of treatment in: Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) parent and&#xD;
           teacher rated, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and autism parenting stress index (APSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints will include the proportion of patients with adverse events measured by the&#xD;
      investigators and the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile (modified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory measures are: markers of the endocannabinoid system in the patients' blood and&#xD;
      possible correlation to phytocannabinoids bioavailability and treatment response, change from&#xD;
      baseline at the end of treatment in BMI and Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)&#xD;
      score and quality of parent- child interaction during the study (Emotional Availability- EA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term safety, tolerability and efficacy of cannabidiol-rich medical cannabis will be&#xD;
      assessed after 12 and 24 months of open treatment, in a subgroup of patients who will apply&#xD;
      for medical license to use cannabis after completing the study.&#xD;
