      Recruitment for prevention, and early detection among health disparities populations&#xD;
      represents a major challenge in chronic disease control. This effect is magnified for&#xD;
      individuals at high risk for conditions such as genetic breast cancer or chronic hepatitis.&#xD;
      Costs are typically high, particularly given the common practice of developing a single&#xD;
      outreach channel to address each disease or condition. In a randomized delayed intervention&#xD;
      control trial, the investigators tested a strategy to identify low-income women at high risk&#xD;
      for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) outside the clinical setting and refer them&#xD;
      to free genetic counseling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses a disparity in services related to the rare but serious condition of&#xD;
      HBOC. In a randomized delayed intervention control trial, the investigators were able to&#xD;
      identify high-risk but predominantly unaffected women among callers seeking referrals to free&#xD;
      cancer screening. The investigators compared an immediate offer of a genetic counseling&#xD;
      appointment to information on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer sent by mail. Our study&#xD;
      demonstrated that when a diverse population of low-income women calls a trusted information&#xD;
      and referral source, it is possible to both engage them on a topic that is different from the&#xD;
      purpose for their call and to recruit them for participation in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our intervention was designed to fit as seamlessly as possible with two end user&#xD;
      organizations. Existing staff (Information Specialists) of the state's phone service&#xD;
      administered a simple family history screener similar to their usual procedure for assessing&#xD;
      eligibility for free mammography. Cancer Risk Program Genetic Counseling Assistants followed&#xD;
      up with an outcall, just as they do normally in response to family history screeners filled&#xD;
      out in the hospital's mammography clinic. Our results not only showed a significantly larger&#xD;
      effect on use of genetic counseling with the call and appointment offer compared with a&#xD;
      mailed brochure, it was clear from calls made to women in both arms after the intervention&#xD;
      period that calling is not only effective but essential to encourage use of genetic&#xD;
      counseling in this population. The number of women counseled in the intervention group was&#xD;
      initially much higher than the control group, and additional intervention group members&#xD;
      obtained counseling when called again after the two month intervention period. The addition&#xD;
      of genetic counseling by phone enabled a substantial number of women to obtain counseling who&#xD;
      would not have done so otherwise. Our study demonstrated that, for the complex and highly&#xD;
      personal issue of HBOC, multiple attempts over a period of months are needed and justified.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residence within one of six local counties (for ease of access to our sites offering&#xD;
             free genetic counseling and testing), age 25+, and English- or Spanish-speaking (the&#xD;
             languages in which genetic counseling was conducted at risk program sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander will not be&#xD;
             included since very few call EWC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children (individuals under 25 years of age) will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The rationale for this exclusion is that the research topic is not relevant to&#xD;
             children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The EWC does not target children, whose medical care is typically under the control of&#xD;
             their parents or guardians.&#xD;
