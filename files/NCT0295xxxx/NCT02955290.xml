      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant human&#xD;
      EGF-rP64K/montanide ISA 51 vaccine (CIMAvax) and nivolumab and to see how well they work in&#xD;
      treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer or squamous head and neck cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body. Vaccine therapy, such as CIMAvax vaccine may help slow&#xD;
      down and stop tumor growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving CIMAvax vaccine together with nivolumab&#xD;
      or pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer or&#xD;
      squamous head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the maximum dose of CIMAvax in combination with nivolumab based on dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      version 4.03 (CTCAE version [v] 4.03). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the 12-month overall&#xD;
      survival of CIMAvax combined with nivolumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). (Phase II-Study A) III. To evaluate the 6-month progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) of CIMAvax combined with nivolumab in patients with advanced recurrent squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck. (Phase II-Study B) IV. To evaluate the objective response&#xD;
      rate of pembrolizumab in combination with CIMAvax as first-line therapy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC (PD-L1 expression &gt;= 50%). (Phase II-Study C) V. To evaluate the 12-month PFS&#xD;
      of pembrolizumab in combination with CIMAvax as maintenance therapy in patients with advanced&#xD;
      squamous NSCLC (PD-L1 expression &lt; 50%) (Phase II-Study D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To assess the toxicity of CIMAvax combined with nivolumab using the&#xD;
      Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03). (Phase I) II. Determine the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination of anti-PD1 therapy with CIMAvax. (Phase I) III. To evaluate&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) for the combination of CIMAvax and nivolumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC. (Phase II-Study A) IV. To evaluate the 12-month overall survival of patients&#xD;
      with advanced recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who received nivolumab&#xD;
      in combination with CIMAvax. (Phase II-Study B) V. To evaluate the PFS and 12-month overall&#xD;
      survival of CIMAvax in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line therapy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC (PD-L1 expression &gt;= 50%). (Phase II-Study C) VI. To assess the toxicity of&#xD;
      CIMAvax combined with nivolumab or pembrolizumab using the CTEP NCI Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct correlative studies comparing blood EGF levels, platelet levels, markers of&#xD;
      immune response and functionality of antibody response. (Phase I) II. To examine the&#xD;
      association of EGFR (total and activated), PD-1 and PD-L1 expression and mutations in tumor&#xD;
      tissue with biomarkers of genetic and immune response. (Phase I and II) III. Comparison of&#xD;
      response assessment criteria for a prospective analysis (immune-related [ir] Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] response assessment versus [vs.] immune-related&#xD;
      Response Criteria [irRC] vs. RECIST 1.1). (Phase I and II) IV. To characterize the blood EGF&#xD;
      levels and other blood-based biomarkers of patients censored from the trial because of low&#xD;
      titer response. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of CIMAvax followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOADING PHASE I: Patients receive CIMAvax intramuscularly (IM) and nivolumab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 4 doses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 4 weeks after the 4th dose,&#xD;
      patients receive CIMAvax IM at the same time as the next nivolumab dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE I: Patients who do not experience a DLT receive CIMAvax every 4 weeks and&#xD;
      nivolumab every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II STUDY A and B: Patients receive CIMAvax IM and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes.&#xD;
      Treatment with CIMAvax repeats every 2 weeks for 4 doses during the loading phase and every 4&#xD;
      weeks during the maintenance phase in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Courses for nivolumab repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients in Study A with antibody titer &gt;= 1:4000 at the end of the&#xD;
      loading phase may receive CIMAvax IM every 8 or 12 weeks during the maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II STUDY C: Patients with PD-L1expression &gt;= 50% receive CIMAvax IM and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      IV over 30 minutes. Treatment with CIMAvax repeats every 2 weeks for 4 doses during the&#xD;
      loading phase and every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Courses for pembrolizumab repeat every 2 weeks for 2&#xD;
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II STUDY D: Patients with PD-L1 expression &lt; 50% after 4 cycles of induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy with pembrolizumab, receive CIMAvax IM and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 120 days.&#xD;
