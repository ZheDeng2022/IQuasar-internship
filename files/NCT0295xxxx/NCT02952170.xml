  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of weight loss surgery (WLS) on non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease (NAFLD) in adolescents as well as the interaction between NAFLD and cardiometabolic&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the impact of WLS has been studied in adults, little is known about NAFLD in&#xD;
      adolescents undergoing WLS. At present, only a small number of adolescents undergo WLS each&#xD;
      year and thus this area has not been well studied. However, as the prevalence of severe&#xD;
      obesity continues to rise the investigators anticipate that so will WLS in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will establish the impact of WLS on NAFLD in adolescents. Currently, it is assumed&#xD;
      that adolescents with NAFLD diagnosed at the time of WLS have universal resolution of their&#xD;
      disease with appropriate weight loss, and no further evaluation is conducted. Our group has&#xD;
      shown that up to 40% of adolescents who undergo WLS have persistently abnormal&#xD;
      aminotransferase levels, suggesting that many may have persistent NASH and are at risk of&#xD;
      progressive liver disease. The study will elucidate the history of NAFLD following WLS. Such&#xD;
      data have not been previously published and will represent a significant contribution to this&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
