  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different approaches to cardio-neuroablation (CNA) to treat neurally mediated syncope, sinus&#xD;
      node dysfunction, and functional atrioventricular block have been published. Investigators&#xD;
      have developed a more limited and specific approach of CNA, called cardio-neuromodulation&#xD;
      (CardNM). This treatment is based on a tailored vagolysis of the sinoatrial node through&#xD;
      partial ablation of the anterior right ganglionated plexus (ARGP); it is also based on an&#xD;
      innovative anatomic strategy. The feasibility of CardNM has already been tested in our center&#xD;
      in a limited first study in humans (CardNMH1), with a favorable outcome for the patients&#xD;
      involved. The results of CardNMH1 have been submitted for publication. The purpose of this&#xD;
      second study of CardNM in humans (CardNMH2) is to collect more procedural and clinical data&#xD;
      in well-defined patient groups.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II A prospective, interventional study. All patients will undergo CardNM. The&#xD;
      study will involve eight different steps, from the screening procedure through study&#xD;
      completion: screening, enrollment, pharmacological testing, group allocation, preprocedural&#xD;
      assessment, procedure, follow-up, study completion.The dedicated study nurse and the PI are&#xD;
      responsible for recording all data from the trial on the case report forms (CRFs) and&#xD;
      completing the study database. A dedicated independent physician will be responsible for the&#xD;
      safety monitoring. The PI will permit inspection of the trial files and the database by&#xD;
      national or international official controlling scientific authorities, if required. The PI&#xD;
      will review and monitor completed CRFs and the database at regular intervals throughout the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will undergo a tailored 'radio-frequency ablation' of the ARGP with the Smart Touch™ catheter or with the nMARQ™ catheter. Radiofrequency applications will be interrupted if no significant P-P interval shortening is observed after 30 seconds or if P-P interval is ≤ 550 ms during ablation.&#xD;
The ablation procedure is considered complete when one of the following conditions is fulfilled:&#xD;
P-P interval &lt; 70% baseline procedural P-P interval after 5minute of waiting time; P-P interval &lt; 600 ms after 5 minute of waiting time; 5 radiofrequency applications &gt; 30 seconds have been delivered with the nMARQ™ catheter or 10 applications with the Smart Touch catheter.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates must meet all of the inclusion criteria required for inclusion in one of the two&#xD;
        groups (summarized in Table 2). All of the patients need to have a positive P wave of &gt; 0.5&#xD;
        mm in lead 2. Patients must have had ≥ 1 syncope during the 6 months preceding enrollment&#xD;
        and ≥ 2 syncopes in their lifetime except if the last syncope was complicated by an injury&#xD;
        or an accident, in which case further waiting for CardNM may be less desirable. Patients &lt;&#xD;
        18 years must have least 3 syncopes with an interval exceeding 1 month unless 1 syncope was&#xD;
        complicated by an injury or an accident.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a significant rate drop (&gt; 15%) is noted during head-up tilt test (HUT), either isolated&#xD;
        or combined with vasoplegia, and associated with syncope or severe presyncope, patients&#xD;
        will be eligible for inclusion in group A. If the HUT is negative and a pause &gt; 3 seconds&#xD;
        has been documented, patients will be assigned to group B. If both conditions are present,&#xD;
        patients will be eligible for inclusion in either group but will be preferentially assigned&#xD;
        to group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates will be excluded if ANY of the following criteria apply (detailed in Table 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &lt; 14 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronotropic negative medications (excepted in patients with a previous history of&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4 g amiodarone intake during the 2 months preceding enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alternating right bundle branch block (RBBB) and left bundle branch block (LBBB), HV&#xD;
             interval &gt; 70 ms;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LBBB, bifascicular block (RBBB + left anterior hemiblock [LAHB], RBBB + left posterior&#xD;
             hemiblock [LPHB]);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PR interval permanently &gt; 240 ms;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Permanent AF, PAF or electrical cardioversion during the last 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Valvular or subvalvular aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any unstable medical condition, life expectancy &lt; 12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Syncopes due a non-cardiac disease (excepted NMS) or advanced neuropathy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with transient atrioventricular conduction disturbances and normal&#xD;
        atrioventricular conduction during an exercise test and normal QRS complexes are eligible&#xD;
        for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a high risk of bleeding are eligible, but clopidogrel (75 mg daily, 1 month&#xD;
        of treatment) will then be preferred to oral anticoagulants.&#xD;
