  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves the use of a common breast imaging modality (magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging, 'MRI') and is investigating its role in evaluating surgical decision making for&#xD;
      breast cancer when it is performed with the patient in a new position (lying on one's back)&#xD;
      as opposed to in the standard position (lying on one's stomach).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The procedure involved is called a supine breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators are evaluating the value of supine MRI in surgical decision making&#xD;
      for women with breast cancer either undergoing upfront surgery or for those anticipating&#xD;
      surgery after receiving neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the value of supine breast MRI as a new imaging method&#xD;
      to assist in surgical treatment planning. It is possible that the use of supine breast MRI&#xD;
      will help your doctor see the size and location of tumors more accurately&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a pre-operative standard mammogram with or without ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have biopsy confirmed and clinical stage I, stage II, or stage III&#xD;
             non-inflammatory breast carcinoma. If biopsy was done at an outside hospital,&#xD;
             pathology will be reviewed at (BWH, BWFH)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must meet standard MRI guidelines and be able and willing to undergo MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be candidates for definitive local therapy with breast conserving&#xD;
             therapy or deemed as potential candidates following NAT (this takes into account tumor&#xD;
             to breast size ratio appropriate for BCT, and the ability to undergo standard&#xD;
             radiation therapy post-operatively).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participants will be restricted to those aged â‰¥18 and &lt;70 years old. This age&#xD;
             group is selected because it encompasses the majority of women likely to receive&#xD;
             neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known BRCA 1 or 2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known Li-Fraumeni or Cowden's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with prior mantle radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with inflammatory breast cancer or multi-centric disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are already enrolled in a conflicting investigational trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known active collagen vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with prior history of ipsilateral breast carcinoma treated with BCS and&#xD;
             radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have biopsy confirmed multi-centric disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are unable to undergo MRI because of documented contra-indications&#xD;
             for contrast-enhanced MRI, including but not limited to renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who exceed the weight limit for the operative surgical table, 350 lbs or&#xD;
             who will not fit into the 60 cm diameter bore of the MRI scanner.&#xD;
