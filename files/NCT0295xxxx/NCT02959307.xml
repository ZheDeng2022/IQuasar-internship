  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Light Therapy involves non-invasive and invisible beams of light that increase&#xD;
      energy metabolism in the brain. Transcranial light therapy has been found to promote brain&#xD;
      metabolism which may help people with depression. The research team proposes a novel approach&#xD;
      to treating depression by using transcranial light therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During study visits a clinician applies transcranial light therapy to both sides of a&#xD;
      participant's forehead for about 30 minutes. The study involves, 1 screening visit which may&#xD;
      last up to the 3 hours, 24 transcranial light therapy treatment visits, and 1 post-treatment&#xD;
      visit (26 total visits to the Massachusetts General Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant qualifies for the study, we assign the participant by chance to receive&#xD;
      either active transcranial light therapy or sham transcranial light therapy treatment. During&#xD;
      sham transcranial light therapy visits, the transcranial light therapy device will not&#xD;
      produce near infrared waves (e.g., light energy that cannot penetrate the skin and cranium).&#xD;
      Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to the active transcranial light therapy&#xD;
      or the sham transcranial light therapy when first randomized. Neither the participant, nor&#xD;
      the clinician, nor any research staff will know which study group the participant belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized a second time after 6-weeks in the study. If the participant were&#xD;
      in the sham group the first 6-weeks, that participant may receive the active transcranial&#xD;
      light therapy treatment after re-randomization. If the participant were already in the active&#xD;
      transcranial light therapy group during the first 6-weeks the participant continues receiving&#xD;
      the active treatment. All in all, participants have a 1 in 3 chance of receiving the active&#xD;
      transcranial light therapy treatment at some point during the study.&#xD;

          <description>assessment of the patient's depressive symptoms, using a structured interview and defined anchor points. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale aims to quantify the degree of depression in patients who already have a diagnosis of major depression. Score ranges from 0-52. Higher score indicates greater severity of depression.</description>

      <desc>Our participants flow differs for the following reasons: Per the SPCD design, subjects within the Sham group in Phase 1 are re-randomized in Phase 2 to receive either Sham or TLT treatment. Therefore, TLT group accounts for participants receiving TLT in the first phase as well as those re-randomized to TLT in their second phase. Participants in Sham account for all subjects randomized to sham in Phase 1, regardless of whether they were re-randomized to Sham or TLT in Phase 2.</desc>
