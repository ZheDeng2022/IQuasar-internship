  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm abnormality. Its incidence&#xD;
      is increasing partly due to the ageing population and it has been referred to as a growing&#xD;
      epidemic. AF results in irregular contractions of the heart causing unpleasant symptoms of&#xD;
      palpitations and increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure and death. Percutaneous&#xD;
      catheter ablation is a safe treatment option in symptomatic patients with AF. The success&#xD;
      rate of these procedures have improved with time due to our better understanding of AF,&#xD;
      development of new techniques and technology, and greater physician experience. However, the&#xD;
      success rate of these procedures still only remains around 70%. This is contributed to our&#xD;
      limited ability to find the areas that drive the AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAR mapping is a novel mapping system that has been developed with a view of better&#xD;
      identifying the sites that drive AF, through taking into account the mechanisms of AF that&#xD;
      have already been demonstrated. Data from this study will be used to refine the&#xD;
      identification of drivers in the fibrillation left atrium with enormous potential to simplify&#xD;
      ablation and improve success rates and thereby reducing the need for further procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better validate this mapping system the investigators also aim to use it in participants&#xD;
      with atrial tachycardia (AT), which is a heart rhythm abnormality of which the mechanism can&#xD;
      be readily identified with the existing mapping systems used in clinical practice. The&#xD;
      investigators will demonstrate that the STAR mapping algorithm can effectively map AT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain further understanding of the changes that occur in the left upper chamber of the&#xD;
      heart in the context of AF half of the participants with AF will undergo cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging to assess for the presence of scar. This will enhance our understanding of&#xD;
      how atrial remodelling promotes AF, which may point to ways of modifying this process and&#xD;
      preventing AF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AF catheter ablation success rates are still limited to around 70% with a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients requiring to have further procedures to remain in normal heart rhythm. The current&#xD;
      strategies that are used in catheter ablation of AF involve targeting the pulmonary veins&#xD;
      that enter the left sided upper chamber of the heart. The supportive evidence in targeting&#xD;
      other areas beyond the pulmonary veins remains mixed. Thereby with the existing mapping&#xD;
      systems other sites that potentially drive AF have not been effectively identified. Further&#xD;
      to this, it has also been suggested that these sites are intermittent and mobile in nature&#xD;
      making it more difficult to effectively map. With this in mind the investigators have&#xD;
      developed STAR mapping, a novel mapping system that takes these factors into account. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to use this mapping system prospectively to effectively map and&#xD;
      ablate drivers of AF as identified by termination and/or slowing of AF during the catheter&#xD;
      ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that have documented AF that has been present all the time for less than 24&#xD;
      months i.e. early persistent AF and that have been referred for catheter ablation for AF by&#xD;
      an Electrophysiologist will be recruited into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo consenting for the procedure and their involvement in the research&#xD;
      study. The procedures will be conducted either under local anaesthetic/sedation or general&#xD;
      anaesthetic depending on the clinical needs of the patient. During the procedure tubes will&#xD;
      be passed into the left upper chamber of the heart through the groin. Through these tubes&#xD;
      catheters will be used to create a geometry of the heart chamber. Following this, in half of&#xD;
      the participants a basket catheter with 64 electrodes will be positioned in the upper chamber&#xD;
      whilst conventional catheters will be used in the other half of the participants. This is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that this mapping system can effectively be used with a variety of mapping&#xD;
      catheters. The signals collected will then be used in the novel mapping system to identify&#xD;
      sites as potential drivers of AF. These sites will then be targeted and the response to&#xD;
      ablation will be recorded particularly looking at slowing and/or termination of the AF, which&#xD;
      will support these sites identified as drivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the validation phase of the study participants that have been scheduled for a&#xD;
      catheter ablation for AT by their Electrophysiologist will be enrolled into the study. The&#xD;
      STAR maps generated in these cases will be compared to the maps generated by the conventional&#xD;
      system. This will enable validation of the STAR mapping system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mapping system used for this study will be CARTOFINDER (CARTO, Biosense Webster, Inc,&#xD;
      CA). Analyses using this mapping system will allow a sub-study on identifying mechanisms of&#xD;
      AT and drivers in AF using the CARTOFINDER system.&#xD;
