      Displaced femoral neck fractures are one group of hip fracture patients that are commonly&#xD;
      treated with cemented hemiarthroplasty (HA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). In the elective&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty population, the direct anterior approach (DAA) has shown to be effective in&#xD;
      helping patients to quickly obtain high postoperative function. This approach has also been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in arthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fractures in a few studies.&#xD;
      However, the only studies that directly compare two approaches for hip arthroplasty for&#xD;
      femoral neck fractures utilize the anterolateral approach (ALA) versus posterior approach&#xD;
      (PA) or DAA versus PA. No studies of which we are aware directly compare the DAA to the ALA.&#xD;
      The DAA and ALA are the two most popular approaches for bipolar hemiarthroplasty at our&#xD;
      institution, so we are setting out to determine the differences between them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Displaced femoral neck fractures are one group of hip fracture patients that are commonly&#xD;
      treated with cemented hemiarthroplasty (HA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). Compared to&#xD;
      those who receive a THA, recipients of HA tend to be less active, more debilitated, and more&#xD;
      dependent on gait aids and the care of others. In this population, the increased stability&#xD;
      and decreased operating time associated with HA is thought to be more important than the&#xD;
      minimal increase in function this population could achieve with THA. Additionally, cemented&#xD;
      femoral stems in HA are thought to result in less pain, increased function, and less&#xD;
      periprosthetic fracture risk when compared to cementless stems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the relative pre-injury debility of the femoral neck fracture population, especially&#xD;
      those receiving HA, it is important to optimize all aspects of patient care to allow them to&#xD;
      participate in therapy and return them to their preoperative functional level as quickly as&#xD;
      possible. Furthermore, any intervention in this population should minimize the physiologic&#xD;
      insult of surgery as much as possible. In the elective hip arthroplasty population, the&#xD;
      direct anterior approach (DAA) has shown to be effective in helping patients to quickly&#xD;
      obtain high postoperative function. This approach has also been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      arthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fractures in a few studies. However, the only studies&#xD;
      that directly compare two approaches for hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures utilize&#xD;
      the anterolateral approach (ALA) versus posterior approach (PA) or DAA versus PA. No studies&#xD;
      of which we are aware directly compare the DAA to the ALA. The DAA and ALA are the two most&#xD;
      popular approaches for bipolar hemiarthroplasty at our institution, so investigators are&#xD;
      setting out to determine the differences between them.&#xD;

    <description>All patients receiving a hip hemiarthroplasty through a Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) will have their surgeries performed with the aid of fluoroscopy on an OSI Hana table that allows the operative limb to be manipulated through range of motion and traction while keeping the pelvis stabilized. This table also has a radiolucent platform about the pelvis, enabling the surgery to be fluoroscopically assisted. The incision for the DAA will extend from a proximal point about 2 cm distal and 2 cm lateral to the ASIS to a point 8-12 cm distal and slightly lateral to this.</description>

    <description>All patients receiving a hip hemiarthroplasty through an the Anterolateral Approach (ALA) will have their surgeries performed on a standard OR table in a contralateral lateral decubitus position. With the leg in the position of sleep, a straight 8-12 cm incision will be made, centered over the greater trochanter and femoral shaft with 1/3 of the incision extending superior to the tip of the greater trochanter.</description>
