    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the conversion of OP to OC in individual X and the&#xD;
      family member of individual X. The investigators hypothesize that one or more of the single&#xD;
      nucleoprotein polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CES1 gene represent a clinically important&#xD;
      functional polymorphism.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oseltamivir is beneficial in the treatment of mild influenza. When given by mouth,&#xD;
      oseltamivir phosphate (OP), the parent drug, is rapidly absorbed and rapidly converted to&#xD;
      oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) by carboxylesterase enzymes (CES1) in the gut, plasma and liver.&#xD;
      The mean time to maximum concentration of OP is 2 hours and OC is about 4. Plasma protein&#xD;
      binding is ~42% for OP and &lt;3% for OC. The latter has a volume of distribution at steady&#xD;
      state after an IV dose of 23 to 26 L which is similar to extracellular water, consistent with&#xD;
      its polar nature and low protein binding. OC and OP are renally excreted via glomerular&#xD;
      filtration and active secretion via the organic anion transporter in the proximal renal&#xD;
      tubules. In healthy subjects, oseltamivir carboxylate has a half life of 6-11 hours, achieves&#xD;
      steady-state within 3 days (bd dosing) and has a higher AUC on Day 7 compared to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oseltamivir was associated with bizarre behaviour and acute confusion. Since these reports,&#xD;
      similar events have also been associated with inhaled zanamivir, suggesting that the&#xD;
      influenza rather than the drugs were responsible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because OP is more lipophilic than OC, it should cross the blood brain barrier more easily&#xD;
      than OC. However, plasma to CSF ratios in 4 healthy volunteers were low for both substances,&#xD;
      just over two and just under 3.5% for OP and OC, respectively. The low OP ratio is probably&#xD;
      due to the actively export of OC from the brain by P-glycoprotein pump. In vitro and mice&#xD;
      studies demonstrate that OP but not OC is a substrate for the glycoprotein P (P-gp)&#xD;
      transporter and that the brain distribution of OC is affected by P-gp activity. PK&#xD;
      simulations predict levels of OP that would be within the range of exposures observed in&#xD;
      clinical studies without neuropsychiatric adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One individual subject (individual X) from SEA004 &quot;Long Term Influenza Prophylaxis with&#xD;
      Inhaled Zanamivir or Oral Oseltamivir&quot; had carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) gene mutation which may&#xD;
      affect oseltamivir phosphate conversion. This means that the conversion of OP to OC in this&#xD;
      subject can be substantially lower than the normal population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a very important finding relevant both to antiviral efficacy and also potentially to&#xD;
      toxicity because OP has no antiviral activity and may play a role in toxicity as a&#xD;
      potentially neuroexcitatory compound. On the basis of in vitro data, the risk of cardiac&#xD;
      toxicity should be not existent at therapeutic doses. OP had a variable effect on the hERG&#xD;
      (human ether a go go K+ channel in cardiac muscle) but only at concentrations far in excess&#xD;
      of those achieved with therapeutic doses; OC has no proarrhythmic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that OP penetrates the blood brain barrier and is pumped out by P-glycoprotein, high&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of OP could result in increased CNS concentrations in individuals with&#xD;
      either reduced carboxylesterase activity, such as infants and the volunteer in this study&#xD;
      and/or reduced P-glycoprotein activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) polymorphisms CES1 is a member of a multigene family of&#xD;
      serine esterases that is involved in drug metabolism and activation as well as in other&#xD;
      biological processes. The study from Shi et al reported the correlation between oseltamivir&#xD;
      hydrolysis from OP to OC and the concentration of CES1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene encoding CES1 is on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q13-22.1), and consists of 14&#xD;
      exons spanning 30kb. Several studies have identified the CES1 gene polymorphisms in the&#xD;
      promoter and coding region and have tried to relate these polymorphisms with variation in the&#xD;
      hydrolysis activity of this protein. A study from Zhu HJ et al presented potentially 2&#xD;
      functional polymorphisms locating in exon 4 (Gly143Glu) and 6 (Asp260fs) that can impair the&#xD;
      CES1 hydrolytic activity to methylphenidate in vitro. However, some CES1 variants (V21I, and&#xD;
      R182H) have a higher rate of oseltamivir metabolism compared to wild-type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects from these reports were recruited from Japanese and European populations.&#xD;
      Therefore, it would be important to investigate the CES1 gene in the Thai population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oseltamivir efficacy may well be compromised in individuals who do not convert OP to OC but&#xD;
      there are no data on the prevalence of this mutation/polymorphism and, therefore, the number&#xD;
      of individuals who may not benefit form oseltamivir is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be important to study further the carboxylesterase gene in order to characterise its&#xD;
      inheritance in the family of individual X and then to conduct prevalent studies in e.g.&#xD;
      stored serum banks and as part of PK studies of oseltamivir in patients.&#xD;
