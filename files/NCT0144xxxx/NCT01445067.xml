        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with migraine with or without aura who are otherwise healthy as determined by&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory evaluations and 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG), will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or women [women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or Women of non childbearing&#xD;
             potential (WONCBP)] ages 18-55 years inclusive, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0&#xD;
             to 32.0 kg/m2 with not more than 8 migraines a month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has at least 1 year history of migraines (with or without aura) including the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Meet the diagnostic criteria for migraine with history of at least 1 year (with&#xD;
                  or without aura) at the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Migraine attacks with the age of onset prior to 55 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Migraine attacks, on average, lasts about 4-72 hours if untreated in the 3 months&#xD;
                  prior to screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2-8 moderate or severe migraine attacks per month in the 3 months prior to screening&#xD;
             visit. The migraine, for which the patient receives treatment during the study, must&#xD;
             have at least one of the associated symptoms: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, or&#xD;
             migraine with aura&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient is pregnant/breast-feeding (or is a female expecting to conceive during&#xD;

             history of congenital heart disease or arrhythmia, known suspected infection,&#xD;
             hepatitis B or C, or cancer) that, in the investigator's opinion, would expose them to&#xD;
             undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE) or interfere with assessments of safety&#xD;
             or efficacy during the course of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has basilar migraine and hemiplegic migraine&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uses an opiate as first line acute treatment for migraine attacks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ergotamine, any acute therapy or triptan intake on greater than/equal 10&#xD;
             days per month on a regular basis for greater than/equal 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of simple analgesic intake on greater than/equal 10 days per month for greater&#xD;
             than/equal 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of use of opioid or combination medication intake or butalbital containing&#xD;
             analgesic greater than 5 days per month for greater than/equal to 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do not receive migraine relief from a triptan migraine treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of renal impairment - calculated creatinine clearance &lt;60ml/min or clinically&#xD;
