      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not an illness to have an ostomy, even though it is an indication of previous serious&#xD;
      illness, such as cancer, which is the reason for approximately 80% of all ostomy operations.&#xD;
      Ostomies can be divided into three categories: colostomy (large intestine), ileostomy (small&#xD;
      intestine) and urostomy (urinary tract). All require surgical redirection of the intestine or&#xD;
      urinary tract, allowing for elimination of urine and faeces by means of an opening in the&#xD;
      abdominal wall. For the population included in this study, subject with an ileostomy, colitis&#xD;
      ulcerosa is the main cause for an ileostomy where a surgical removal of the colon and rectum&#xD;
      resulting in an ileostomy in theory cures the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be very challenging to live with an ostomy and modern ostomy products should make life&#xD;
      as easy as possible for people with ostomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leakage and peristomal skin problems have been found to have a negative effect on the quality&#xD;
      of life for people with ostomies. The skin problems are the reason for one out of three&#xD;
      visits to ostomy nurses and occur much more frequently in people who have had ileostomies&#xD;
      than in those who have had colostomies. It has been observed that the prevalence of&#xD;
      peristomal skin problems is 21-60% among people who have ileostomies, 13-35% among those who&#xD;
      have colostomies and 21-48% among those who have urostomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leakage from ostomies that comes into contact with the skin is thought to predispose the&#xD;
      patient to peristomal skin problems. One investigation of peristomal skin problems found that&#xD;
      77% of cases were related to contact with faeces or urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several reasons why leakage from an ostomy occurs, such as uneven peristomal area,&#xD;
      improper handling of the ostomy product or a problematic ostomy (its formation, its location,&#xD;
      retraction, prolapse or hernia). The ostomy may also change size with time, which can lead to&#xD;
      leakage, if the ostomy products are not adapted accordingly. As a general rule, a check-up of&#xD;
      the ostomy by an ostomy nurse or a doctor together with educational support can reduce these&#xD;
      problems. Modern ostomy products should, however, also be constantly developed in order to&#xD;
      lessen to the greatest extent possible the risk of leakage and associated inconveniences.&#xD;
