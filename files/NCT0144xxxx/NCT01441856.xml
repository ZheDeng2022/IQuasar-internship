      The added value of the laparoscopic hemihepatectomy compared to the open hemihepatectomy has&#xD;
      never been studied in a randomized controlled setting. Therefore, the multicenter&#xD;
      international ORANGE II PLUS - trial has been constructed and will provide evidence on the&#xD;
      merits of laparoscopic versus open hemihepatectomy in terms of time to functional recovery,&#xD;
      hospital length of stay, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, resection margin, time to&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy initiation, readmission percentage, (liver-specific) morbidity, quality&#xD;
      of life, body image, reasons for delay of discharge after functional recovery, long term&#xD;
      incidence of incisional hernias, hospital and societal costs during one year and overall&#xD;
      five-year survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liver resection for colorectal metastasis is the only potentially curative therapy and has&#xD;
      become the standard of care in appropriately staged patients, offering 5-year survival rates&#xD;
      of approximately 35-40%. Also for symptomatic benign lesions and those of uncertain nature or&#xD;
      large size, liver resection is a widely accepted treatment. Open hepatectomy (OH) is the&#xD;
      current standard of care for the management of primary and secondary malignancies. Although&#xD;
      the feasibility of laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) has been established, only select centres&#xD;
      have used this technique as their primary modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic liver resection was first reported in 1991. Over the last decade the method has&#xD;
      gained wide acceptance for various liver resection procedures. Multiple retrospective case&#xD;
      series and reviews comparing open with laparoscopic liver resection indicate that&#xD;
      laparoscopic liver resection can be applied safely for both malignant and benign liver&#xD;
      lesions. Laparoscopic liver resection has been associated with shorter hospital length of&#xD;
      stay, reduced intraoperative blood loss, less postoperative pain, earlier recovery and better&#xD;
      quality of life. Initially the left lateral segments of the liver were chosen for anatomic&#xD;
      laparoscopic resection with good results. Many liver centres worldwide are currently adopting&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery for resection of anterior segments, but relatively low volumes to&#xD;
      operate on, a significant learning curve and lack of evidence restrict the majority of liver&#xD;
      surgeons to further adopt and disseminate this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, indications for resectability have been broadened by new (neo)adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapies and (radio)embolisation techniques. A new impulse for the laparoscopic&#xD;
      management of liver lesions came after the first reports of laparoscopic hemihepatectomies.&#xD;
      Major hepatic resections can be technically demanding and hold an increased risk for&#xD;
      morbidity. It was demonstrated that in expert hands major anatomical laparoscopic liver&#xD;
      resections were feasible with good efficacy and safety. Expert liver centers are already&#xD;
      performing laparoscopic (extended) hemihepatectomies. Currently, in European centers, a&#xD;
      median hospital length of stay of 6.0 to 13.1 and 3.5 to 10.0 days is observed after&#xD;
      respectively open and laparoscopic hepatic resection. In expert hands median duration of&#xD;
      admission after major hepatic resection varies between 6 - 12.5 for open and 4 - 8.2 for&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery. However, reports are scarce and level 1 evidence on this matter is&#xD;
      still to be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the framework of optimising postoperative recovery, broader indications for resection&#xD;
      and further adoption of laparoscopic liver surgery there is a need for a randomized&#xD;
      trial.Regarding postoperative care, enthusiasm has arisen for the Enhanced Recovery After&#xD;
      Surgery (ERAS®) program. This multimodal program, derived from Kehlet's 1990's pioneer work&#xD;
      in the multimodal surgical care field, involves optimization of several aspects of the&#xD;
      perioperative management of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. In patients&#xD;
      undergoing segmental colectomy, the ERAS® -program enabled earlier recovery and consequently&#xD;
      shorter hospital length of stay. Furthermore, a reduction of postoperative morbidity in&#xD;
      patients undergoing intestinal resection was reported. These results stimulated liver&#xD;
      surgeons of the ERAS® group (Maastricht, Edinburgh and Tromsö) to adapt the ERAS®-program to&#xD;
      patients undergoing open liver resection. Van Dam et al. found a significantly reduced&#xD;
      hospital length of stay after open liver resection when patients were managed within a&#xD;
      multimodal ERAS®-program. Besides a reduction of median total hospital length of stay from 8&#xD;
      to 6 days (25%), the data also suggested that a further reduction of stay could be possible&#xD;
      as there was a delay between recovery and actual discharge of the patients. Moreover, Stoot&#xD;
      et al. showed - retrospectively - a further reduction in length of stay from 7 days to 5 days&#xD;
      when patients were operated laparoscopically and managed within an ERAS®-program. In this&#xD;
      study there was also a delay between recovery and actual discharge of the patients. Earlier,&#xD;
      Maessen et al. reported a median delay to discharge of 2 days after patients had functionally&#xD;
      recovered from colonic surgery managed within an ERAS®-program. This delay is often linked to&#xD;
      social problems, problems in homecare support or logistic problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The added value of the laparoscopic hemihepatectomy compared to the open hemihepatectomy has&#xD;
      never been studied in a randomized controlled setting. Therefore, the multicenter&#xD;
      international ORANGE II PLUS - trial has been constructed and will provide evidence on the&#xD;
      merits of laparoscopic versus open hemihepatectomy.&#xD;
