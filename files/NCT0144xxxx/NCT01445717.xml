      This study evaluates the use of a new method of growing and detecting Group B streptococcus&#xD;
      in pregnant women. This new method utilizes sandwiched-membrane petri technology and has the&#xD;
      advantage of detecting GBS in less than 6 hours, with less cost, and the potential of&#xD;
      allowing antibiotic sensitivities to be performed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intrapartum infection with group B streptococci (GBS) may lead to untoward neonatal sequelae&#xD;
      such as pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that&#xD;
      the use of intrapartum intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis (with penicillin being the agent of&#xD;
      choice due to a narrower spectrum of antimicrobial activity) is highly effective to prevent&#xD;
      early-onset neonatal GBS infections. It has been estimated that 10% to 30% of all pregnant&#xD;
      women are GBS carriers, and it is likely that GBS colonizes virtually every female at some&#xD;
      point. Consensus guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),&#xD;
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics, recommend prenatal screening at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation and chemoprophylaxis&#xD;
      at delivery based upon this culture result. The CDC-recommended method for detecting GBS&#xD;
      colonization involves collecting a combined vaginal and rectal specimen and culturing the&#xD;
      organism in a selective broth medium, followed be subculturing onto blood agar plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this traditional method of culture takes up to 72 hours for results to be available.&#xD;
      With 12.8% of patients experiencing a preterm delivery prior to when a GBS screening occurs,&#xD;
      and up to 15% of term pregnancies not having routine GBS screening performed, a significant&#xD;
      portion of women present with unknown GBS status at the time of potential delivery. These&#xD;
      clinical situations require obstetricians to utilize a risk-based strategy that has been&#xD;
      shown to be only half as effective as culture-based screening. Thus, a need exists for a&#xD;
      rapid detection method for GBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research has focused on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods for detection of&#xD;
      GBS. Sensitivity for detection of GBS by the PCR assay has ranged from 87% to 91%. These&#xD;
      methods are limited by high cost, and inability to perform antibiotic sensitivities for GBS&#xD;
      (in women with a penicillin allergy). New technologies, called bionanopore (BNP) and&#xD;
      bionanofilter (BNF) are rapid, microbial detection systems that utilizes sandwiched-membrane&#xD;
      petri technology. These have the advantage of detecting GBS in less than 6 hours, with less&#xD;
      cost, and the potential of allowing antibiotic sensitivities to be performed.&#xD;
