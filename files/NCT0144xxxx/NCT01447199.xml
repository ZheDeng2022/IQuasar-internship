  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand factors which may influence risk for colorectal and&#xD;
      other cancers in families. These factors include genetic variability, in combination with&#xD;
      diet and lifestyle. In order to achieve these goals, we need to contact as many eligible&#xD;
      participants as possible.&#xD;

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have a single sample (8-10 teaspoons) of&#xD;
      blood collected, depending upon current health status. The blood will be drawn at MD&#xD;
      Anderson. If you cannot come to the clinic, a blood drawing kit will be sent to the your&#xD;
      home, which will include instructions and a postage-paid return express mail envelope.&#xD;
      Phlebotomy charges connected to this study will be paid by the study. The blood sample will&#xD;
      be sent to a research laboratory at MD Anderson for analyses. If you are unwilling or unable&#xD;
      to give a blood sample, you can give a saliva sample instead. In this case, a kit will be&#xD;
      mailed to you with instructions for obtaining the saliva sample. A prepaid envelope will be&#xD;
      included for its return. Participants who previously participated in Protocol PA11-0567 and&#xD;
      provided a blood sample do not need to provide another blood sample. The previously stored&#xD;
      blood sample collected by Protocol PA11-0567 may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to answer a series of questions. These questions will ask about foods eaten&#xD;
      either one year ago or one year before the first diagnosis of cancer. There will also be&#xD;
      questions about cooking methods as well as overall health, and vitamin and medication use.&#xD;
      Some of the questions are personal, but all answers will be kept strictly private.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be sent to your home via U.S. or express mail. It may take several&#xD;
      hours to complete the survey, but there is no time limit on its completion. There are no&#xD;
      right or wrong answers to the questions. A postage-paid return envelope will be provided for&#xD;
      the return of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solid tumor material and colonoscopy specimens of normal tissue will be collected from&#xD;
      participants requiring either colonoscopy or surgery for routine clinical reasons. The tumor&#xD;
      fragments will be collected from specimens. Tissue required for a clinical pathology&#xD;
      diagnosis will not be used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. About 2,000 patients and family members will take part in&#xD;
      this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
