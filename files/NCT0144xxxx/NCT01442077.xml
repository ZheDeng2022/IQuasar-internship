  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shock waves(LISW) have been proven in animal studies to induce local growth of&#xD;
      new blood vessels. The investigators hypothesized that LISW therapy could improve the&#xD;
      symptoms of patients with erectile dysfunction resulting from a problem of blood supply who&#xD;
      respond to oral therapy (PDE-5 inhibitors). The current study will check 4 different arm.&#xD;

      At the first meeting the patient will receive a full explanation of the study, the potential&#xD;
      efficacy and risks. After that the patient will be asked to sign an informed consent form,&#xD;
      and will be asked about general medical condition and any problems related to sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction. Than the patient's sexual function will be assessed by sexual function&#xD;
      questionnaires. The criteria for inclusion and exclusion will be reviewed, as well as&#xD;
      physical examination. During the visit, the patient will be assigned to one arm of the study&#xD;
      (random), and by the arm he belongs he will receive an explanation about this procedure. Then&#xD;
      shall obtain reporting sexual encounter diaries (SEP) and will be asked to avoid using&#xD;
      PDE5i's for a month (washout), then it would be the first visit. At the first visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
      The patient will be questioning the sexual function questionnaires without PDE5i's and will&#xD;
      pass examination performance Endothelial - FMD, the test takes about 10 minutes, it is not an&#xD;
      invasive test (not involved in inserting an instrument or any medication) and is painless.&#xD;
      The patient may be asked to also undergo Doppler ultrasound. At the end of the visit 1 the&#xD;
      patient will begin treatment series and will continue to study under the arm belongs, as&#xD;
      described: 1.Series of 12 treatments, in which the subject will be treated twice a week for 3&#xD;
      weeks (6 treatments), then would be discontinuation of the study for 3 weeks, and at the end&#xD;
      of this period will be treated twice a week for 3 weeks (6 treatments). 2.Series of 12&#xD;
      treatments, in which the subject will be treated twice a week for 6 consecutive weeks,&#xD;
      without intermission. 3.Series of 8 treatments, in which the subject will be treated twice a&#xD;
      week for two weeks (4 treatments), then would be discontinuation of the study for 3 weeks,&#xD;
      and at the end of this period will be treated twice a week for two weeks (4 treatments).&#xD;
      4.Series of 6 treatments, in which the subject will be treated once a week for 3 weeks (3&#xD;
      treatments), then would be discontinuation of the study for 3 weeks, and at the end of this&#xD;
      period will be treated once a week for 3 weeks (3 treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after the treatment series ends the patient will come for another visit will be&#xD;
      asked to fill in questionnaires and perform the FMD test again.&#xD;
