      As the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline is able to improve motor skills it might have positive&#xD;
      effects on sleep disruption by reducing nocturnal akinesia. As it was reported to cause only&#xD;
      minor sleep disruption in PD Patients, it might be able to improve sleep architecture. The&#xD;
      investigators thus study the effects of Rasagiline on sleep disturbances measured by&#xD;
      polysomnographic (PSG) evaluation of sleep efficacy and PDSS-2. Secondary measures are other&#xD;
      sleep variables measured by PSG, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness assessed by&#xD;
      standardized scales as well as cognitive function, depression and QoL index.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleeping disorders are very common in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Mainly&#xD;
      initiation and maintenance of sleep is disturbed, therefore many patients suffer from daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness and sleep attacks. Polysomnographic studies showed increased sleep fragmentation&#xD;
      and frequent awakenings, increased amount of wakefulness during time in bed as well as&#xD;
      reduced sleep efficacy and deep sleep time. In addition, increased sleep latency, REM-latency&#xD;
      and decreased amounts of REM sleep were documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD patients also suffer from primary sleep disorders like sleep disordered breathing and&#xD;
      especially REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD)and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only neurochemical changes affecting cholinergic and monoaminergic systems, nocturnal&#xD;
      hypokinesia and rigidity and painful dystonia due to the disease itself, but also medication&#xD;
      side effects lead to impaired sleep-wake-control and reduced REM sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although levodopa medication and dopamine agonists reduce nocturnal hypokinesia and therefore&#xD;
      improve insomnia they also have a potential impact on daytime sleepiness and are able to&#xD;
      cause sleep disruption. The impact of dopaminergic therapy is complex showing biphasic&#xD;
      effects with increased wakefulness and decreased REM-sleep frequency via stimulation of&#xD;
      dopamine D1 receptors whereas low doses promote sleep via dopamine D2 receptors. In addition,&#xD;
      acting of dopamine agonists via dopamine D3 receptors might be responsible for daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness and sleep attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus improves mainly motor skills but also&#xD;
      shows an important increase in sleep duration and quality, it could be suggested that by&#xD;
      decreasing nocturnal hypokinesia improvement in sleep quality can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rasagiline mesylate was developed as a selective and irreversible MAO-B- inhibitor which is -&#xD;
      unlike Selegiline - not metabolized to amphetamine derivates which are found to be partly&#xD;
      responsible for negative effects on RBD and REM-sleep as well as sleep efficacy. Rasagiline&#xD;
      is able to delay the need for initiating dopaminergic therapy, improves motor function in&#xD;
      early and moderate to advanced PD and was shown to exhibit neuroprotective potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As different mechanisms of dopaminergic medication on different dopamine receptors are still&#xD;
      not fully elucidated and in contrast to selegiline no side effects due to development of&#xD;
      amphetamine derivates need to be taken into consideration, this study is to aim at evaluating&#xD;
      the effects on sleep and daytime sleepiness of treatment with Rasagiline mesylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Rasagiline is able to improve motor skills it might have positive effects on sleep&#xD;
      disruption by reducing nocturnal akinesia. As it was reported to cause less sleep disruption&#xD;
      in PD Patients than placebo it might be able to improve sleep architecture. Until now no&#xD;
      clinical trial using polysomnographic techniques was performed to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      Rasagiline on sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of Rasagiline on sleep disturbances measured by polysomnographic (PSG)&#xD;
      evaluation of sleep efficacy and PDSS-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures are other sleep variables measured by PSG. In addition, sleep quality and&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness assessed by standardized scales as well as cognitive function, depression&#xD;
      indices and QoL index are measured.&#xD;
