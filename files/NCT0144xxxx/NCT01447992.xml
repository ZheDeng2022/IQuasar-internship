    <textblock>
      A single arm, single treatment study is proposed to assess the feasibility of a portable&#xD;
      artificial pancreas system outside of a hospital based clinical research center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult T1DM patients will use a newly developed platform in conjunction with a subcutaneous&#xD;
      insulin infusion pump and a continuous glucose monitor for 18 hours is quasi free conditions&#xD;
      (hotel).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Automated closed-loop control (CLC), known as &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; (AP) can have tremendous&#xD;
      impact on the health and lives of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our inter-institutional&#xD;
      and international research team has been on the forefront of CLC developments since the&#xD;
      beginning of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Artificial Pancreas initiative&#xD;
      in 2006. Thus far, we have conducted three closed-loop control clinical trials (totaling 60&#xD;
      subjects with T1D), which demonstrated significantly more time in an acceptable &quot;target&quot;&#xD;
      blood glucose range during CLC, and significantly fewer hypoglycemic events during CLC&#xD;
      compared to open loop. Our overall objective is to sequentially test, validate, obtain&#xD;
      regulatory approval for, and deploy at home, a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system&#xD;
      comprised of two algorithmic components: a Safety Supervision Module (SSM) and an automated&#xD;
      Range Correction Module (RCM). The SSM will monitor the safety of the subject's continuous&#xD;
      subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to prevent hypoglycemia, and will also monitor the&#xD;
      integrity of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data for signal sensor deviations or loss of&#xD;
      sensitivity. The RCM will be responsible for the optimal regulation of postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemic excursions through correction boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase to address our overall objective is a pilot study that will test the ability&#xD;
      of a cell-phone-based system to (1) run CTR in an outpatient setting, and (2) be remotely&#xD;
      monitored. Specifically, this pilot study entails a hybrid hotel/hospital design targeting&#xD;
      adults with T1D that are experienced insulin pump users. Subjects will spend one night in a&#xD;
      local hotel, during which the phone-based system will be remotely monitored in an adjacent&#xD;
      hotel room for validation that remote system monitoring can successfully occur. Subjects will&#xD;
      spend the following day in the hospital, where CTR will be activated, and challenged with&#xD;
      meals and a CGM sensor replacement . Subjects will then spend a second night in the hotel for&#xD;
      continued evaluation of remote system monitoring, along with outpatient testing of the CTR&#xD;
      system run on the phone-based system. This series of admissions will address the first major&#xD;
      hurdles that need to be overcome for home deployment of a closed loop CTR system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: The phone-based CTR system can be remotely monitored by&#xD;
      nurses/physicians/technicians to confirm appropriate functioning outside of the hospital&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: The CTR can be deployed outside of the hospital setting.&#xD;
