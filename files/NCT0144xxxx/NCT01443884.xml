    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine whether grape consumption can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease by reducing the presence of inflammatory molecules and positively&#xD;
      altering cholesterol levels, lipid profiles, and immune cell responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese individuals are at high risk for the development of hypertension and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Adipose tissue is a major source of pro-inflammatory molecules which can promote the&#xD;
      development of atherosclerosis. Development of atherosclerotic plaques are mediated by&#xD;
      oxidized or otherwise modified LDL cholesterol and infiltration of activated immune cells&#xD;
      into the atherosclerotic lesions. Grapes contain high levels of polyphenols, a class of&#xD;
      compounds known to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The overall goal of&#xD;
      this proposal is to determine whether grape consumption can reduce the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease by reducing the presence of inflammatory molecules and positively altering&#xD;
      cholesterol levels, lipid profiles, and immune cell responses. Using a randomized cross-over&#xD;
      design, twenty obese subjects will consume beverages containing either four servings of grape&#xD;
      powder per day or the caloric equivalent without grape powder (placebo control) for a total&#xD;
      of three weeks. After a two week washout period, the beverages will be switched for a further&#xD;
      three weeks. Blood will be taken from each person at six intervals to determine lipid&#xD;
      profiles, measure inflammatory markers in plasma, and analyze immune cell responsiveness.&#xD;

    <description>After a 1 week baseline, volunteers will consume two packets of grape powder stirred into water for three weeks. Each packet will contain the equivalent of approximately 2 servings of fresh grapes (46 grams of powder).
