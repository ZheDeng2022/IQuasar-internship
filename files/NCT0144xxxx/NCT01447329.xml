  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to complete a randomized controlled trial to compare ear&#xD;
      acupuncture at Cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega 2, shen-men, and point zero on the right and&#xD;
      left ear plus standard of care versus standard of care alone for symptomatic treatment of&#xD;
      pain following ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgery. After the subject has been discharged,&#xD;
      phone calls, emails or text messages will be made at 24 and 48 hours, 1 week and 1 month.&#xD;
      These contacts will be used to assess the subject's pain level, ambulation status, doses of&#xD;
      analgesics taken and time to return to full duty. At 1 week and 1 month, subjects will be&#xD;
      asked the PIQ-6 Pain Impact Questionnaire.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects (DoD beneficiaries) that are 18 years or older with a scheduled ambulatory&#xD;
      arthroscopic knee surgery will present for their pre-op appointment. At the time of check-in&#xD;
      the subjects meeting the inclusion criteria, will be offered the opportunity to participate.&#xD;
      Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization will be obtained prior to any study-related&#xD;
      procedures or any sedation being performed. The subject will be asked the screening questions&#xD;
      for exclusion criteria (See attached instrument). The PI will have the AI or Study staffs&#xD;
      recruit their patients to prevent any misconception of coercion. The subjects Armed Forces&#xD;
      Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) record including previous encounters,&#xD;
      vital signs review, medication list, demographics and problems list will be reviewed by one&#xD;
      of the investigators to confirm the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met. The&#xD;
      investigator will evaluate the subject and determine any further exclusion criteria based on&#xD;
      exam. These subjects will then be randomized into two groups using a random number generator&#xD;
      via block randomization by the Research Coordinator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Standard treatment alone Group 2: Standard treatment plus ear acupuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked upon admittance to the PACU and the SDSU to answer the questions in&#xD;
      the Data Collection Tool. Subjects will be given treatment while in the operating room and&#xD;
      while under sedation according to their randomization group. The right and left ears will be&#xD;
      cleansed with an alcohol swab prior to ear acupuncture. All subjects, regardless of study&#xD;
      group, will get band aid to cover both ears. This is done to blind the orthopedic surgeon,&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist and any nursing staff that comes in contact with the patient. Even&#xD;
      though they are getting standard of care pain treatment, the investigators are blinding these&#xD;
      individuals to remove any potential of bias when they are assessing a subject's pain.&#xD;
      Subjects in both groups will be instructed to remove the band aids 24 hours after their&#xD;
      surgery. After the subject has been discharged, phone calls, emails or text messages will be&#xD;
      made at 24 and 48 hours, 1 week and 1 month. These contacts will be used to assess the&#xD;
      subject's pain level, ambulation status, doses of analgesics taken and time to return to full&#xD;
      duty. At 1 week and 1 month, subjects will be asked the PIQ-6 Pain Impact Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are getting the knee arthroscopy as part of standard of care in this study. It is&#xD;
      standard of care to have military members return to to light-duty 2 weeks after knee&#xD;
      arthroscopy and full-duty 6 weeks after knee arthroscopy. Should the subject return to duty&#xD;
      with the acupuncture needles still in place, this will not affect their ability to perform&#xD;
      their duties, however, to maintain compliance with AFI 36-2903, you may want to remove the&#xD;
      needles or place a bandage over both ears to cover the ear acupuncture needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ear acupuncture utilizes up to 10 needles. The ear Acupuncture points on the right ear&#xD;
      include Cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega 2, shen-men, point zero. The ear Acupuncture points&#xD;
      on the left ear include Cingulate gyrus, thalamus, omega 2, shen-men, point zero. The subject&#xD;
      will receive five needles intra-operatively on each ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject's participation in this study is completed after 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group 2 who are receiving ear Acupuncture will be instructed to have no heavy&#xD;
      meals, excessive hot or cold foods, heavy exercise or intercourse and no alcohol for 24&#xD;
      hours. Ear Acupuncture needles will fall out on their own within about 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigators are trained in Battlefield Acupuncture and credentialed by the MOFH&#xD;
      Credentials committee to perform Battlefield Acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that the ear acupuncture will reduce the doses of analgesics&#xD;
      needed to control pain, decrease time to discharge, reduce time to ambulation without&#xD;
      assistance and improve return to duty time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standing orders for post-operative care pain control are attached. The risks associated&#xD;
      with the use of ear acupuncture needles include: pain, bleeding, infection (very rare) and&#xD;
      flare of signs and symptoms. In the event the acupuncture needles do not fall out within 6&#xD;
      days, patients will be instructed to come in and have them removed by one of the&#xD;
      Investigators. In this study the investigators are using Sedatelec ASP Original Gold needles.&#xD;
      These acupuncture needles are sterile, gold plated semi permanent ear acupuncture needles for&#xD;
      single use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time during the study, the subject decides to withdraw from the study, they can&#xD;
      come in and have the ear acupuncture needles removed by one of the Investigators. If patients&#xD;
      are withdrawn from the study, they will have the option to either have the acupuncture&#xD;
      needles removed by one of the investigators or allow them to fall out on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must agree to take precautions to prevent pregnancy during the initial phase&#xD;
      (surgery) of this study. Pregnancy tests are routinely done as standard of care for all women&#xD;
      prior to surgery. The only completely reliable methods of birth control are total abstinence&#xD;
      or surgical removal of the uterus. Other methods, such as the use of condoms, a diaphragm or&#xD;
      cervical cap, birth control pills, IUD, or sperm killing products are not totally effective&#xD;
      in preventing pregnancy. Also, women who are breastfeeding at the time of surgery may not&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
