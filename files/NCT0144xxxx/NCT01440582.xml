  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the drug&#xD;
      panobinostat that can be given in combination with the drugs Velcade (bortezomib), Revlimid&#xD;
      (lenalidomide), and Decadron (dexamethasone) to patients with MM. The safety of this drug&#xD;
      combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat is designed to cause chemical changes in different groups of proteins that are&#xD;
      attached to DNA (the genetic material of cells), which may slow the growth of cancer cells or&#xD;
      cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib is designed to block a protein that causes cells to grow. This may cause cancer&#xD;
      cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the&#xD;
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. This may slow the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by your body.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is often given to MM patients in combination with other chemotherapy to treat&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of panobinostat based on when you join this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the first portion of Part A, up to 4 dose levels of panobinostat will&#xD;
      be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group&#xD;
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of panobinostat is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the second portion of Part A, you will receive panobinostat at the&#xD;
      recommended dose from the first portion of Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the first portion of Part B, up to 3 dose levels of panobinostat will&#xD;
      be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group&#xD;
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of panobinostat is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the second portion of Part B, you will receive panobinostat at the&#xD;
      recommended dose from the first portion of Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Therapy (Part A):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Induction phase of therapy, each cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of Cycles 1-8, you will receive bortezomib either through a needle&#xD;
      under your skin or by vein over 3-5 seconds. You will be watched by the study staff for 30&#xD;
      minutes after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-14 of every cycle, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time each day. You should&#xD;
      swallow the lenalidomide capsules whole with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water. Do not break,&#xD;
      chew, or open the capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take panobinostat by mouth 1 time a day with food on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 for&#xD;
      2 weeks with 1 week of rest at the end of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of Cycles 1-8, you will take dexamethasone by mouth 1&#xD;
      time a day. After 8 cycles, you may continue to take dexamethasone if the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      needed. Dexamethasone should be taken with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Therapy (Part B):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, the induction phase of therapy is 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-8, you will receive bortezomib either through a needle under&#xD;
      your skin or by vein over 3-5 seconds. You will be watched by the study staff for 30 minutes&#xD;
      after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-21 of every cycle, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time each day. You should&#xD;
      swallow the lenalidomide capsules whole with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water. Do not break,&#xD;
      chew, or open the capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take panobinostat by mouth 1 time a day with food on Days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 19 of&#xD;
      every cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15,16, Cycles 1-8, you will take dexamethasone by mouth 1 time a day.&#xD;
      After 8 cycles, you may continue to take dexamethasone if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone should be taken with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Therapy (Parts A and B):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Maintenance phase of therapy, each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-21 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take dexamethasone by mouth 1 time a day on Days 1, 8, 15, and 21 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, you will take panobinostat by mouth 1 time a day on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of&#xD;
      each cycle. In Part B, you will take panobinostat by mouth 1 time a day on Days 1, 3, 5, 15,&#xD;
      17, 19 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You can take the study drugs anytime during the day but you should take them at the same time&#xD;
      every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you&#xD;
      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (do&#xD;
      NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). If you take more than the&#xD;
      prescribed dose of lenalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care if needed and contact&#xD;
      the study staff right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your study drug doses may be lowered if you have side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a drug diary for each cycle to write in to help keep track of your study&#xD;
      drug doses. You should bring the drug diary and pill bottles to your study visit at the&#xD;
      beginning of each new cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The panobinostat capsule(s) should be swallowed with 1 cup of water. You should try to take&#xD;
      the dose at around the same time each day. If you vomit after taking panobinostat, you should&#xD;
      not take it again until your next scheduled dose. If you forget to take a dose in the&#xD;
      morning, you can take it up to 12 hours later. If you miss a dose for more than 12 hours, you&#xD;
      should wait until your next scheduled dose. Do not make up missed doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every new study cycle and Cycle 1, Day 5, you should wait to take your&#xD;
      panobinostat until you come to the clinic for study tests. Some of the Day 1 tests need to be&#xD;
      performed before dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You need to follow all panobinostat dosing instructions as written. Do not miss any&#xD;
      panobinostat capsules. You will be asked to return all unused study drug in the bottles&#xD;
      provided, along with empty bottles, on Day 1 of every cycle, starting with Cycle 2. Capsules&#xD;
      should not be transferred between bottles at any time. Please do not allow anyone else to&#xD;
      handle or touch the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You can stop anytime after Cycle 4 of Induction to have a stem cell transplant. If you decide&#xD;
      with your doctor to delay the transplant, you will still be recommended to have your stem&#xD;
      cells collected. You will continue with Induction therapy until you have had 4-8 cycles.&#xD;
      After that, you will receive Maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given other drugs to help prevent side effects. The study staff will tell you&#xD;
      about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.&#xD;

      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have an MRI and/or a CT scan, x-rays,&#xD;
           and/or a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months during the first 2 years after you are finished with maintenance therapy, you&#xD;
      will be asked how you are doing. This will be done at the clinic or by a phone call from the&#xD;
      study staff. If you are called, the calls should take 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse, you will no longer have follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Panobinostat is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Bortezomib is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of MM. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for the treatment of certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome and for MM. The use&#xD;
      of this drug combination to treat MM is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 54 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
