      Evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib in RCC patients underwent to&#xD;
      metastasectomy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced RCC presents poor prognosis, because its pathogenesis is not clearly understood.&#xD;
      However, up-regulation of the Ras pathway is thought to play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF expression could represent independent prognostic factors for survival possibly linking&#xD;
      expression of this protein with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of both Raf-kinase and VEGF R2 signalling The anti-tumoral&#xD;
      activity of Sorafenib was clearly demonstrated in phase III trial regarding advanced&#xD;
      pretreated RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical removal of metastatic disease could potentially increase the disease control rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly in patients with a disease free interval post nephrectomy of at least 1 year,&#xD;
      with one small metastatic lesion, metastasectomy could represents an important therapeutic&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a radical resection of the metastatic disease is unclear if an anti-tumoral systemic&#xD;
      therapy may increase patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, both the preclinical and clinical data support further evaluation of Sorafenib in&#xD;
      RCC patients.&#xD;
