  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a longterm disease in which the blood does not clot&#xD;
      normally. This is due to a low number of blood cell fragments called platelets. Platelets&#xD;
      clot to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. Normally the&#xD;
      immune system makes proteins called antibodies to fight off harmful substances that enter the&#xD;
      body. In ITP, the immune system produces antibodies that attack and destroy the body's&#xD;
      platelets by mistake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can suffer from bleeding under the skin, nosebleeds, blood in urine or stools and in&#xD;
      very severe cases bleeding in the brain. Patients have an increased frequency of death from&#xD;
      bleeding complications compared to normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic ITP is fairly rare , with an incidence of 32 new cases/million people each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing treatments work by lowering the activity of the immune system or directly increasing&#xD;
      platelet count. These treatments do not work effectively in all patients and can have side&#xD;
      effects. We hope that understanding how belimumab works in ITP will help in the development&#xD;
      of future treatments for ITP and other autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the safety, blood levels and effects of the study medication in people with&#xD;
      chronic ITP. Patients will receive the study medication intravenously (through a needle&#xD;
      inserted into a vein) and blood samples will be taken before and on several occasions&#xD;
      afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients with chronic ITP, aged 18 to 75 will participate. Approximately 11 patients&#xD;
      will take dummy medicine instead of the study medicine neither they or their study doctor&#xD;
      will know which one they are given. Participants will take up to 57 weeks to finish the&#xD;
      study. They'll make 12 outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in hospitals in the UK. Other sites in mainland Europe may also be&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, is funding the study.&#xD;
