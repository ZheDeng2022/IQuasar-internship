    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no standardized sets of tests to measure changes in neuropsychological&#xD;
           functioning in patients treated for brain metastasis (cancer that has spread beyond the&#xD;
           original site to the brain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological function has an important effect on quality of life and should be&#xD;
           included when determining treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if there is a change in patients cognitive (thinking) and daily functioning&#xD;
           after standard radiation treatment for brain metastasis that can be measured with tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if any changes on these tests are related to patients response to radiation&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients 18 years of age or older who have cancer that has spread to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receive a 2-week course of radiation therapy to the brain, given daily 5 days a&#xD;
           week. Some patients may require stereotactic radiosurgery (an additional boost of&#xD;
           radiation therapy to specific sites of brain metastasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have the following evaluations before and after treatment to determine changes&#xD;
           in cognition and functioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing to measure cognitive (thinking) abilities like memory,&#xD;
           attention, processing speed, and reading, and fine motor skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires to assess quality of life and daily living skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have MRI scans and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the completion of radiation treatment, patients return to the clinic for follow-up&#xD;
           visits at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months for blood and urine tests, physical examination,&#xD;
           MRI of the brain, neuropsychological testing and assessments of quality of life and&#xD;
           daily living skills.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic brain tumors occur more frequently than primary brain tumors and occur in&#xD;
           approximately 25 percent of patients who die of cancer each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) developed three prognostic classes using a&#xD;
           recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) of a large database. These classes are based on&#xD;
           Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), age and disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The RTOG RPA classes do not include neuropsychological function as a measure of outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no consensus of standardization of test selection to measure changes in&#xD;
           neuropsychological functioning in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological function has an important effect on quality of life and should be&#xD;
           included when determining prognosis and treatment options for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological functioning is important when determining the effects of treatments&#xD;
           and for measuring outcomes in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the neuropsychological test scores which detect significant change in&#xD;
           neuropsychological functioning in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain&#xD;
           metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relationship between neuropsychological function and survival in patients&#xD;
           receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients age 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologically confirmed primary malignancy with at least one intraparenchymal brain&#xD;
           metastasis as identified on brain MRI scan with intravenous contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient must communicate in English in order to complete the neuropsychological&#xD;
           evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a longitudinal study that will administer serial neuropsychological assessments&#xD;
           to patients with brain metastases who receive radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo a battery of neuropsychological tests prior to radiotherapy (WBRT&#xD;
           or WBRT followed by SRS), and then after radiation at one month post-baseline&#xD;
           (approximately 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy), then at 3, and 6 months,&#xD;
           and then every 3 months for up to 12 months after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test battery will involve approximately 40 minutes of direct cognitive testing and&#xD;
           15 minutes of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three cohorts of 20 patients each for a total of 60 patients. The three cohorts&#xD;
      will be made up of differing histologies and will be sorted on the basis of their RTOG RPA&#xD;
      Class.&#xD;

             who is willing to collaborate with the ROB staff in the clinical management of the&#xD;
             patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All patients must sign a document of informed consent indicating their understanding&#xD;
             of the investigational nature and the risks of this study BEFORE any of the protocol&#xD;
             related studies are preformed (this does not include routine laboratory tests or&#xD;
             imaging studies required to establish eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects of childbearing or child- fathering potential must be willing to use a&#xD;
             medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while they are&#xD;
             being treated on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cognitively impaired patients who cannot give informed consent, including patients&#xD;
             assigned a power of attorney for medical decisions.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Pre- existing or active psychiatric or neurologic impairments, not caused by the brain&#xD;
             metastasis, which, in the opinion of the investigators, will interfere with the proper&#xD;
             administration or completion of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must not have been treated for a previous brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must not have had previous cranial radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must not undergo treatment with an investigational drug for the primary&#xD;
                  disease within 7 days of baseline neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must not receive systemic therapy within 7 days prior to baseline&#xD;
                  neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have had surgery for their current brain metastasis must wait at&#xD;
                  least 7 days before baseline neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Concurrent Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Treatment of primary malignancy with systemic therapy (chemotherapy or biologic&#xD;
                  agents) cannot be delivered concurrently with the treatment of the intracranial&#xD;
                  disease. However, treatment of the primary site with local therapy, either&#xD;
                  surgery or radiotherapy, can be performed concurrently with the treatment of the&#xD;
                  intracranial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients receiving glucocorticoids should be tapered to the lowest possible dose,&#xD;
                  or stopped altogether, by the treating physician. If glucocorticoid dose is&#xD;
                  adjusted or given for the first time, the patient must remain on stable dose of&#xD;
                  glucocorticoids for at least 24 hours prior to initial neurocognitive testing, CT&#xD;
                  and MR imaging.&#xD;

          8. Patients must not be HIV positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Other medical conditions deemed by the PI or associates to make the patient ineligible&#xD;
             for protocol investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded because of the potential mutagenic&#xD;
             effects on a developing fetus or newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Principal or Associate Investigator would compromise the patient s ability to tolerate&#xD;
             this therapy or are likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.&#xD;
