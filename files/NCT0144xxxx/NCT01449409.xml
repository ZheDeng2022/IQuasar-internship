      The purpose of Reduce IDentified UNcontrolled Asthma (RIDUNA) is to determine the benefit of&#xD;
      real-time identification of uncontrolled asthma by electronic administrative records linked&#xD;
      to real-time notification of uncontrolled status to patients and asthma specialists with&#xD;
      recommended guideline directed intervention by physicians. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      real-time outreach following National guideline asthma care recommendations, after real-time&#xD;
      identification of an uncontrolled asthma event in persistent asthmatics on inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids will lead to better improvements in asthma control (impairment and risk)&#xD;
      compared to standard asthma care outreach.&#xD;

      Co-primary Objectives: Determine the effectiveness of real-time identification&#xD;
      administratively of uncontrolled asthma and real-time outreach administratively to optimize&#xD;
      National asthma care guideline implementation compared to standard KP asthma outreach to&#xD;
      improve asthma control (subsequent asthma impairment and risk, separately).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists and&#xD;
      patients compared to standard Kaiser Permanente (KP) asthma outreach will reduce subsequent&#xD;
      asthma impairment and risk, separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists and&#xD;
      patients compared to standard KP asthma outreach will increase the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      receive step-up care for impairment and risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists&#xD;
      and patients compared to standard KP asthma outreach will lead to increased step-up care that&#xD;
      will reduce subsequent asthma impairment and risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Specific demographic characteristics (older age, female gender, non-Hispanic&#xD;
      white ethnicity, higher census block education/income level) will be associated with a&#xD;
      differential response in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Determine whether real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma&#xD;
      specialists and patients compared to standard KP asthma outreach will reduce subsequent&#xD;
      asthma impairment and risk, separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2: Determine whether real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma&#xD;
      specialists and patients compared to standard KP asthma outreach will increase the proportion&#xD;
      of patients who receive step-up care for impairment and risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3: Determine whether the real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma&#xD;
      specialists and patients will lead to increased step-up care that will reduce subsequent&#xD;
      asthma impairment and risk compared to standard KP asthma outreach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4: Determine whether there exist specific demographic characteristics (older age, female&#xD;
      gender, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, higher census block education/income level) that are&#xD;
      associated with a greater differential efficacy in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Determine in an exploratory analysis the frequency, characteristics (demographic, asthma&#xD;
      severity, prior health care utilization, etc) and clinical outcomes (impairment and risk) of&#xD;
      patients placed on omalizumab step-up therapy.&#xD;
