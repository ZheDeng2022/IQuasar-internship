      The purpose of the current study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of a habit reversal training (HRT) approach for children&#xD;
           ages 7 to 17 years of age inclusive with a diagnosis of trichotillomania.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore factors that may relate to symptom severity, treatment outcome, and&#xD;
           psychosocial impairment (e.g., specific symptom presence, co-morbidity, emotional&#xD;
           regulation).&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to further investigate how well Habit Reversal Training&#xD;
      (HRT) works to reduce hair-pulling symptoms in children and adolescents with trichotillomania&#xD;
      (TTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will have the option to receive 8 weekly HRT sessions. Half of all children will&#xD;
      be chosen at random to receive these sessions immediately following the pre-assessment and&#xD;
      the remaining half will receive them after eight weeks (TAU condition). These sessions will&#xD;
      focus developing skills for managing TTM and to decrease hair pulling. Such skills may&#xD;
      include teaching your child to replace hair-pulling with another behavior. In the TAU&#xD;
      condition, participants will seek the treatment in the community, with the option of&#xD;
      receiving HRT treatment sessions at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will undergo four assessments in total (1) Pre-Assessment; (2)&#xD;
      Post-treatment Assessment; (3) One-month Follow-up; (4)Three-month Follow-up. These&#xD;
      assessments will involve several interviews that ask about different psychological symptoms&#xD;
      that your child experiences such as sadness, anxiety, and TTM.&#xD;

    <measure>Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (MGHHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses the number of hair-pulling urges, the intensity of the urges, the ability of the patients to distract themselves from the urge to pull their hair, the number of hair-pulling incidents, attempts to resist hair-pulling, the ability to resist hair-pulling, and feeling uncomfortable about hair-pulling. Individual items are rated for severity from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms).</description>

    <description>The NIMH-TIS is a clinician rated scale (0-10 rating) measuring overall impairment produced by the time spent pulling or concealing damage, ability to control pulling, severity of alopecia, interference, and incapacitation caused by the pulling.</description>

    <description>8 weekly therapy sessions lasting 50 minutes based on the protocol outlined by Woods (2001).&#xD;
The overall focus of treatment is to provide patients with tools to help them manage and reduce hair-pulling.&#xD;
components:&#xD;
Session 1. (a) to develop an understanding of the subject's hair-pulling through an initial interview; and (b) to establish a protocol for ongoing assessment.&#xD;
Session 2. implement habit reversal, including awareness training, competing response training, and social support.&#xD;
Sessions 3-8. For subjects with a single hair-pulling site, Session 3 will review and practice HRT procedures and name solutions to problems that may have arisen. For those with multiple hair-pulling sites, treatment will be reviewed for the first site in the hierarchy.</description>
