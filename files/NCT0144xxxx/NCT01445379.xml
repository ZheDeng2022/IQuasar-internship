  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab-an experimental cancer&#xD;
      treatment drug used to boost immune response-in children, adolescents, and young adults.&#xD;
      Ipilimumab may allow immune cells to react to and destroy abnormal cells in the body, and has&#xD;
      been tested in adults for a variety of cancers and has shown responses in some research&#xD;
      studies. Because ipilimumab has not been tested in children, adolescents, or young adults, it&#xD;
      is considered an experimental drug. The purposes of this research study are to determine the&#xD;
      highest safe dose of ipilimumab for children, adolescents, and young adults with solid tumor&#xD;
      cancers; examine its effectiveness and possible side effects; and better understand how the&#xD;
      body and the immune system process it over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates must be between 2 and 21 years of age and must have solid malignant tumors that&#xD;
      have been resistant to standard therapy. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history,&#xD;
      a clinical examination, and computerized scans such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
      Participants must have completed their last dose of chemotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, or&#xD;
      antibody or investigational therapy at least four weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will receive an intravenous dose of ipilimumab once every&#xD;
      three weeks. The infusion of ipilimumab will last 90 minutes, and the participant s vital&#xD;
      signs will be monitored while the medicine is infusing and several times in the first 24&#xD;
      hours after the first dose (requiring a hospital stay during that time). If the participant&#xD;
      is able to tolerate the first dose of ipilimumab, further doses (called cycles ) may be&#xD;
      received on an outpatient basis. Blood and urine tests will be given on a regular basis&#xD;
      during these cycles. After four cycles, participants whose tumors do not grow and who do not&#xD;
      have unacceptable side effects will continue to receive ipilimumab every three months to&#xD;
      maintain the current condition, until researchers conclude the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solid tumors represent approximately one fourth of cancer diagnoses in children. Despite&#xD;
      intensive regimens, patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors have unsatisfactory&#xD;
      survival rates. Therefore new therapies are needed to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of biologic approaches to&#xD;
      heighten antitumor immunity in order to improve the effectiveness of immune based therapy.&#xD;
      Both directly activating immune based therapies such as cytokines and tumor vaccines as well&#xD;
      as therapies which disrupt negative counterregulatory signals such as those mediated by&#xD;
      CTLA-4:B7 may enhance existent antitumor immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibodies directed against CTLA-4 potently augment immune responses in animal models and&#xD;
      anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor effects in a variety of preclinical tumor&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I and phase II studies using ipilimumab have been performed in adults with a variety of&#xD;
      tumor types. Clinical responses have been observed in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and&#xD;
      prostate cancer. No trials have yet been performed to evaluate ipilimumab in children with&#xD;
      malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the tolerance and toxicity profile of ipilimumab at a range of doses up to, but&#xD;
      not exceeding, the highest dose tolerated in adults, in patients less than or equal to 21&#xD;
      years of age with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab administered intravenously in patients less than&#xD;
      or equal to 21 years of age with advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be 1-21 years of age at the time of enrollment with solid malignant tumors&#xD;
      refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I dose finding study with 4 planned dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients will be enrolled at each dose level with an expanded cohort of 12 at the&#xD;
      highest or maximum torlerated dose with intent to include 6 patients &lt; 12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-induction with 4 infusions of ipilimumab at the assigned dose followed by another&#xD;
      maintenance phase is possible for subjects who have progressed during maintenance therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -A patient with viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will be&#xD;
        excluded from trial to limit confounding variables in the assessment of the potential&#xD;
        hepatic toxicity of ipilimumab and uncertain impact of ipilimumab administration on viral&#xD;
        replication. Serology will not be required unless infection is clinically suspected. A&#xD;
        positive hepatitis B titer does not exclude a patient if immunization has been performed&#xD;
        and if there is no history of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INFORMED CONSENT: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18&#xD;
        years old) must sign a document of informed consent (Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI&#xD;
        screening protocol for NIH patients) prior to performing studies to determine patient&#xD;
        eligibility. After confirmation of eligibility, all patients or their legal guardians must&#xD;
        voluntarily sign the IRB approved protocol specific informed consent to document their&#xD;
        understanding of the investigational nature, the risks of this study and their willingness&#xD;
        to receive the therapy and undergo the research studies involved including pharmacokinetic&#xD;
        studies. The consent must be signed before any protocol related studies are performed (This&#xD;
        does not include routine laboratory tests or imaging studies required to establish&#xD;
        eligibility). When appropriate, pediatric patients will be included in all discussions in&#xD;
        order to obtain verbal assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY (DPA): Patients who are greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
        will be offered the opportunity to assign a DPA so that another person can make decisions&#xD;
        about their medical care if they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        BIRTH CONTROL: Patients of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use&#xD;
        a medically acceptable form of birth control which includes abstinence, while they are&#xD;
        being treated on this study and for 60 days following the last dose. Females of&#xD;
        childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to&#xD;
        initiation of study therapy and prior to each additional dose of ipilimumab.&#xD;
