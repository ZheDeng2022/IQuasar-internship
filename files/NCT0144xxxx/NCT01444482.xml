  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety of parenterally administrated investigational vaccine (commercial influenza&#xD;
      vaccine formulated with adjuvant Matrix M) in healthy adults (age 18-50) and healthy elderly&#xD;
      (age 65-75), will be investigated in the study. Moreover, the study aims to study parameters&#xD;
      associated with improved protection against clinical disease in elderly. Such parameters&#xD;
      include HI-titres, a balanced Th1/Th2 response as well as a functional cellular immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination will start in 22 healthy adults receiving the investigational vaccine.&#xD;
      Vaccination of elderly will be initiated only after demonstration of safety in adults. 88&#xD;
      healthy elderly volunteers will be vaccinated, 44 will receive the seasonal influenza vaccine&#xD;
      alone and 44 will receive the investigational vaccine. Vaccines will be administrated&#xD;
      intramuscularly in the upper arm. One dose will be administered to each volunteer included in&#xD;
      the study. Blood samples for basic immunological assessments of cellular and humoral immunity&#xD;
      will be taken at day 0, 7, 28, 90 and 150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational vaccine is equal to one standard human dose of a commercial seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccine to which 50 µg of adjuvant Matrix M has been added.&#xD;
