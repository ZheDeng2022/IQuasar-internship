      The investigators are conducting an intervention study to examine the effects of a 16-week&#xD;
      exercise and diet interventions on prevention of disease, specifically type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      heart disease, in African American youth. Sixty overweight African American boys and girls&#xD;
      will be recruited and placed in one of the following intervention groups: 1) Control Group&#xD;
      (delayed intervention), 2) Dietary Education Group (nutrition education focused on reducing&#xD;
      sugar &amp; soda, increased fiber &amp; whole grain intake), or 3) Combination of Strength Training&#xD;
      (twice/week for 60 min, progressive increases in exercise volume and intensity) + Dietary&#xD;
      Education (nutrition education focused on reducing sugar &amp; soda, increased fiber &amp; whole&#xD;
      grain intake). The investigators will assess which intervention group has the most effects on&#xD;
      health parameters such as weight, body composition, and insulin related measures.&#xD;

      A.1 Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to examine role of strength training as a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention to improve the cancer and obesity-related metabolic risk profile in&#xD;
      African-American adolescents. The project is prompted by the urgent public health need to&#xD;
      prevent and treat cancer and obesity-related problems, including diabetes and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, in African-American adolescents, a population that is understudied and medically&#xD;
      under-served in the Los Angeles area. A recent report from the Institute of Medicine&#xD;
      underscored this major public health concern in the childhood obesity field:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Children's health has made tremendous strides over the past century. In general, life&#xD;
      expectancy has increased by more than thirty years since 1900 and much of this improvement is&#xD;
      due to the reduction of infant and early childhood mortality. Given this trajectory toward a&#xD;
      healthier childhood, the investigators begin the 21st century with a shocking development -&#xD;
      an epidemic of obesity in children and youth. The increased number of obese children&#xD;
      throughout the US during the past 25 years has led policymakers to rank it as one of the most&#xD;
      critical public health threats of the 21st century. (92)&quot; Obesity and metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      problems disproportionately affect African-American adolescents (51). This project will&#xD;
      explore why African-Americans have greater cancer risk than Hispanics (91), despite a reduced&#xD;
      prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (7, 62).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work from this laboratory has shown that both African-American and Hispanic&#xD;
      children are more insulin resistant than Caucasian children, and this difference is&#xD;
      apparently not explained by differences in body fatness. Moreover, the metabolic compensation&#xD;
      to a similar degree of insulin resistance markedly differs between African-American and&#xD;
      Hispanic children (62). African-Americans display greater hyperinsulinemia in response to a&#xD;
      glucose challenge, whereas Hispanics have a more subdued increase in insulin levels due to an&#xD;
      increase in second phase insulin secretion. The investigators will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      build upon this preliminary work to examine the effects of resistance training on three&#xD;
      factors predictive of cancer and metabolic disease risk: 1) body fat distribution; 2) insulin&#xD;
      resistance and 3) measures of oxidative stress in African America adolescents. The&#xD;
      investigators previously studying Hispanic adolescents in a parallel protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypotheses of this project are that: (1) hyperinsulinemia in overweight&#xD;
      African-American youth is associated with increased long-term cancer risk; and (2) insulin&#xD;
      resistance, obesity and oxidative stress in overweight African-American youth will be&#xD;
      improved with chronic resistance training and a modified carbohydrate dietary approach. The&#xD;
      investigators will specifically examine the following metabolic outcomes, because they have&#xD;
      been hypothesized to contribute to the obesity-related increase in cancer and metabolic&#xD;
      disease risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin concentrations and insulin sensitivity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total body fat, abdominal visceral fat, muscle fat and liver fat;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating adipocytokines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intima-media thickness of the carotid artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of oxidative stress, including: F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde (MDA),&#xD;
           myeloperoxidase (MPO), oxygen radical absorbance capacity and ROS detection by flow&#xD;
           cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.2 Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims and hypotheses of project 1 are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: Cross-Sectional Measures Specific Aim 1 (Body Fat Compartments): To determine the&#xD;
      association of visceral fat, muscle and liver fat and plasma adipocytokines to variation in&#xD;
      insulin resistance in African-American youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: Visceral fat, muscle and liver fat, and adipokines will independently&#xD;
           contribute to greater insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Specific Aim 2 (Insulin Resistance): To examine metabolic compensation to insulin&#xD;
           resistance in African-American youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Insulin resistant African-American youth will exhibit a higher acute&#xD;
           insulin response to glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Specific Aim 3 (Oxidative Stress): To examine the influence of body fat and insulin&#xD;
           resistance on markers of oxidative stress and markers of metabolic disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3: Increased total body fat and insulin resistance will be associated with&#xD;
           greater oxidative stress. The increased oxidative stress will be correlated with the&#xD;
           higher acute insulin response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 (Randomized Trial of Modification of Carbohydrate Intake and Strength Training) •&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4 (Linkage of factors in Aims 1-3): To determine the effects of a randomized&#xD;
      modification of carbohydrate intake, and/or strength training intervention in overweight&#xD;
      African-American adolescents on potential factors linking obesity, insulin resistance, and&#xD;
      oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hypothesis 4: Strength training will improve metabolic factors for cancer risk. That is,&#xD;
      resistance training will reduce visceral fat; increase insulin sensitivity, reduce&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia, and reduce oxidative stress. The decreases in total body fat and visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissue will be associated with improved insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress.&#xD;
