      The objective of this clinical evaluation is to evaluate the immediate and long term (up to&#xD;
      12 months) outcome of the XIENCE PRIME Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (Abbott&#xD;
      Vascular) in a controlled prospective investigation for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      critical limb ischemia due to the presence of lesions between 3cm and 10cm in length at the&#xD;
      level of the below the knee arteries. Specifically the trial aims to illicit angiographic and&#xD;
      ultrasound patency, clinical improvement, and adverse events associated with the use of this&#xD;
      stent. The trial design is single armed, prospective, controlled trial run over 12 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

      The aim of this research is to evaluate the immediate and long term outcome of the XIENCE&#xD;
      PRIME EverolimusEluting Coronary Stent System in a prospective investigation for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia due to the presence of lesions between 3cm&#xD;
      and 10cm in length at the level of the below the knee arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is &quot;Dose the use of an Everolimus coated stent in long tibial artery&#xD;
      occlusions, between 3 and 10cm offer superior patency at 12 months compared to a historical&#xD;
      cohort of bare metal stents in similar lesions?&quot; Our hypothesis is that the use of everolimus&#xD;
      coated stents in tibial artery occlusions between 3 and 10cm will result in lower binary&#xD;
      restenosis than was historically found in equivalent but non-drugcoated bare metal stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is evidence that angioplasty and drug eluting stents can be used as a&#xD;
      therapy for patients with critical limb ischemia due to occlusive infrapopliteal disease. The&#xD;
      XIENCE PRIME™ Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (XIENCE PRIME EECSS or XIENCE PRIME&#xD;
      stent system) is manufactured by Abbott. It is a device/drug combination product consisting&#xD;
      of the CobaltChromium MULTILINK VISION 8 Coronary Stent System coated with a formulation&#xD;
      containing everolimus, the active ingredient, embedded in a nonerodible polymer. The XIENCE&#xD;
      PRIME Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent is coated with everolimus (active ingredient),&#xD;
      embedded in a nonerodible polymer (inactive ingredient). Everolimus is the active&#xD;
      pharmaceutical ingredient in the XIENCE PRIME stent. It is a novel semisynthetic macrolide&#xD;
      immunosuppressant, synthesized by chemical modification of rapamycin (sirolimus). The&#xD;
      everolimus chemical name is 40O(2hydroxyethyl) rapamycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The XIENCE PRIME stent contains inactive ingredients including poly n-butyl methacrylate&#xD;
      (PBMA), a polymer that adheres to the stent and drug coating, and PVDFHFP, which is comprised&#xD;
      of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene monomers as the drug matrix layer containing&#xD;
      everolimus. PBMA is a homopolymer with a molecular weight (Mw) of 264,000 to 376,000 dalton.&#xD;
      PVDFHFP is a nonerodible semicrystalline random copolymer with a molecular weight (Mw) of&#xD;
      254,000 to 293,000 dalton. The drug matrix copolymer is mixed with everolimus (83%/17% w/w&#xD;
      polymer/everolimus ratio) and applied to the entire PBMA coated stent surface. The drug load&#xD;
      is 100 μg/cm2 for all product sizes. No top-coat layer is used.&#xD;
