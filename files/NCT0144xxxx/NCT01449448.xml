  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injection with corticosteroid is one of the most common non-operative interventions in the&#xD;
      treatment of subacromial impingement; however, its use is limited by its potential side&#xD;
      effects (e.g. tendon rupture, subcutaneous atrophy, articular cartilage changes). The&#xD;
      objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of subacromial injection of triamcinolone&#xD;
      compared to injection of ketorolac. Thirty-two patients diagnosed with external shoulder&#xD;
      impingement syndrome were included in this double-blinded randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Each patient was randomized into the Steroid group or NSAID group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      After a single injection into the subacromial space, the patients were instructed to perform&#xD;
      home physical therapy and follow-up in four weeks. Each patient was evaluated in terms of arc&#xD;
      of motion, Visual Analog Scale and the UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures were taken at the preinjection state, immediately post injection, and at&#xD;
      4 weeks follow-up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Shoulder pain characteristic of subacromial impingement syndrome with passive and/or&#xD;
             active abduction in the 60-120 arc of motion (positive impingement sign)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of subacromial bursitis based on tenderness to palpation anterior/lateral to&#xD;
             the acromion. Pain may be exacerbated with the shoulder held in internal rotation&#xD;
             (positive Hawkins test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptoms less than one month&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous shoulder injections within the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of os-acromiale or other confounding shoulder pathology on plain radiographs&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of shoulder osteoarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Full thickness rotator cuff tear evidenced by MRI, cuff weakness after lidocaine&#xD;
             injection, or positive drop-arm sign&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Systemic inflammatory condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pending litigation or work-related claims related to the shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous shoulder surgery on the affected shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Evidence of local infection&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Evidence of adhesive capsulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Previous history of gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Evidence of shoulder instability&#xD;
