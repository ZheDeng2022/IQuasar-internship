  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, slow-growing form of skin cancer. The cancer&#xD;
           cells are found in red, scaly patches that may sometimes itch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early-stage CTCL is usually treated with topical therapies, which may lose effectiveness&#xD;
           over time and have adverse effects, such as risk of secondary skin cancers and&#xD;
           difficulty of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Romidepsin is an experimental drug that, given through a vein, has improved CTCL in some&#xD;
           patients with later stages of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A topical ointment form of romidepsin may be helpful in treating early-stage CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the highest tolerated dose of topical romidepsin that can be given to&#xD;
           patients with early-stage CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of topical romidepsin in patients with early-stage CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine how the body handles topical romidepsin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 18 of age and older with early-stage CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Part 1: Successive groups of 3 patients are treated with increasingly higher&#xD;
           concentrations of topical romidepsin until the highest tolerated dose is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Part II: The highest tolerated dose, as determined in Part I, is applied to larger&#xD;
           areas of skin in another group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All study participants apply the study medicine to their skin three times a day for 4&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During treatment, participants are monitored at weeks 2 and 4 with a history and&#xD;
           physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram, skin biopsies and photographs of&#xD;
           the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After stopping treatment, participants return to the clinic at weeks 6 and 8 for blood&#xD;
           tests and to see how the study medication is affecting the body.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase inhibitor which has demonstrated efficacy and&#xD;
           tolerability as an infusion in later stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early stages of CTCL are typically treated with skin-directed therapies, which may lose&#xD;
           efficacy over time and have adverse effects (i.e. risk of secondary skin cancers,&#xD;
           difficulty of use).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A topical form of romidepsin may be helpful in the treatment of early-stage CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary - To define the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of topical romidepsin for&#xD;
           early-stage CTCL when administered three times weekly, then escalated first in&#xD;
           concentration, followed by increased frequency and lastly over increasing body surface&#xD;
           areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary - To assess histone acetylation in topical romidepsin-treated skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary - To assess in a pilot fashion clinical efficacy of topical romidepsin in&#xD;
           early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary - To perform pharmacokinetic monitoring of blood levels of romidepsin in&#xD;
           topically treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients age greater than or equal to 18 with confirmed early-stage (stage IA, IB, or IIA)&#xD;
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Cohorts of Three design to define the MTD of topical romidepsin in Aquaphor ointment&#xD;
           initially applied overnight, three times weekly for 4 weeks, then escalated first in&#xD;
           concentration, followed by increased frequency and lastly over increasing body surface&#xD;
           areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin toxicities, systemic toxicities, and disease response will be assessed throughout&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary focus of the first part of the protocol will be to evaluate local skin&#xD;
           toxicity, beginning with dose level 1 of 0.05 percent topical romidepsin on 25 cm(2)&#xD;
           target area (0.005 mg/ cm(2). If tolerated, progress to higher dose levels of 0.25&#xD;
           percent (0.025 mg/ cm(2); dose level 2) and then 0.5 percent (0.05 mg/ cm(2); dose level&#xD;
           3) topical romidepsin on 25 cm(2) target area. Systemic toxicity will also be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To date, we have completed the first 4 dose levels and have not yet established&#xD;
           cutaneous MTD. To achieve this, we will proceed to the second part of the protocol,&#xD;
           which will increase the concentration to 1%, then increase the frequency to daily&#xD;
           application, then progress to 2% concentration, then 4% concentration, and then applying&#xD;
           to progressively larger body surface areas. Our aim is to more fully address systemic&#xD;
           toxicity by increasing drug concentration, application frequency, and body surface area&#xD;
           (BSA) treated. We will utilize topical romidepsin at the MTD on increasing BSA (lesional&#xD;
           &amp; nonlesional skin): multiple lesions up to 3% BSA (dose level 4), multiple lesions up&#xD;
           to 25% BSA (dose level 7A), 50% BSA (dose level 7B), and 75% or &gt; BSA (dose level 7C).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients must have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of CTCL based on a skin&#xD;
                  biopsy, utilizing standard histological criteria based on cytological,&#xD;
                  architectural, and immunophenotypic findings. In cases with equivocal&#xD;
                  histological features, the diagnosis may be verified or confirmed through the use&#xD;
                  of clonal T-cell gamma gene rearrangement, as detected by PCR amplification and&#xD;
                  primer sets specific for the T-cell receptor gamma chain genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients must have early stage CTCL (Stage IA, IB, or IIA as defined by TNM&#xD;
                  staging system).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients must:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. be age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. have evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. have a performance status of ECOG 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. be either on no therapy or only on topical therapy for early stage CTCL.&#xD;
                       Patients must have stopped light therapy (i.e. PUVA, UVB) for at least 2&#xD;
                       weeks prior to the use of study medication. Patients must have stopped&#xD;
                       topical therapies (i.e. corticosteroids or nitrogen mustard) to designated&#xD;
                       target sites or areas to be treated with study medication for at least 2&#xD;
                       weeks prior to the use of study medication. (Topical therapies for CTCL may&#xD;
                       be continued to non-adjacent, non-target lesions while on protocol.)&#xD;
                       Patients may have received other HDACI therapy but must have stopped&#xD;
                       systemic therapy 4 weeks prior to use of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. be able to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    6. be willing to return to the National Cancer Institute for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry&#xD;
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
                  suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
                  treating physician immediately. The effects of romidepsin on the developing human&#xD;
                  fetus are unknown. For this reason and because HDAC Inhibitor agents are known to&#xD;
                  be teratogenic, patients that are pregnant or lactating will be excluded from&#xD;
                  this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Laboratory values:&#xD;
