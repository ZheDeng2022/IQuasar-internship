      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) represents the second most frequent major&#xD;
           organ transplant in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediatric 1st degree stem cell donors can experience a variety of psychological&#xD;
           difficulties before and after donation with those who feel they are not adequately&#xD;
           prepared for possible complications following stem cell donation and transplant&#xD;
           describing negative emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The importance of preparation for children undergoing medical procedures has long been&#xD;
           recognized in the field of pediatric psychology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess how prepared pediatric donors are for stem cell donation by assessing their&#xD;
           knowledge about stem cell transplants, and to assess their anxiety at different stages&#xD;
           of the donation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effectiveness of a workbook and a board game as tools for conveying&#xD;
           information on donation and transplantation to donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify donors who may require additional preparation before stem cell collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the relationship between donor knowledge and anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Stem cell donors ages 10 to 26 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant s baseline knowledge and anxiety are evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant s knowledge is reassessed and anxiety evaluated following an information&#xD;
           session with the research nurse and doctor about the procedures for stem cell donation&#xD;
           and discussion of the consent form for the transplant protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are separated into two groups. Donors 10 to 15 years of age play a board&#xD;
           game; those 16 to 26 years of age are given a workbook on stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants knowledge and anxiety are reassessed within 24 hours after working with the&#xD;
           educational materials and again 1 month later.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) represents the second most frequent major&#xD;
           organ transplant in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A variety of psychological difficulties in sibling donors post-stem cell donation are&#xD;
           reported, including withdrawal, guilt, anger, depression, anxiety, mild to severe&#xD;
           psychopathology, and post-traumatic stress symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The importance of preparation for children undergoing medical procedures has long been&#xD;
           recognized in the field of pediatric psychology. In previous research, siblings who felt&#xD;
           they were not adequately prepared for possible complications following HSCT donation and&#xD;
           transplant often described negative emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some siblings have reported feeling pressured and coerced to become a donor, while&#xD;
           others describe a lack of attention to their physical fears associated with donation and&#xD;
           their psychological concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prospective studies examining educational tools and transplant knowledge in sibling&#xD;
           stem cell donors are currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess pediatric 1st degree stem cell donor comprehension of transplant procedures&#xD;
           and compare knowledge prior to educational interventions (pre and post-consent&#xD;
           informational session) to knowledge following educational interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effectiveness of a workbook intervention as a learning tool for conveying&#xD;
           information on stem cell donation and transplantation to pediatric donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effectiveness of a board game intervention (ShopTalk) as a learning tool&#xD;
           for conveying information on stem cell donation and transplantation to pediatric donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify donors who may require additional preparation prior to stem cell collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure donor anxiety pre and post the educational intervention and stem cell&#xD;
           donation and explore the relationship between donor knowledge and anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: 10 to 26 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants or their parents must consent to participation in active bone marrow and&#xD;
           peripheral blood stem cell transplant protocols at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For donors less than 18 years of age, their legal guardian must give informed consent,&#xD;
           the donor must give written assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For donors greater than or equal to 18 years of age, ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must understand and read English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline knowledge will be assessed following consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge will be reassessed following the information session for the transplant&#xD;
           protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors will be stratified into 2 groups by age. Donors ages 10 to 15 will be scheduled&#xD;
           the following day to play a game called ShopTalk. Donors ages 16 to 26 will be given a&#xD;
           workbook on HSCT specifically designed for 1st degree stem cell donors. Knowledge will&#xD;
           be reassessed following the administration of these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up assessment will be administered to all participants 1 month after the post&#xD;
           intervention test was administered.&#xD;
