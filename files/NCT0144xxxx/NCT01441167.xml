      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria parasites are carried by mosquitoes, which spread the infection by biting&#xD;
           people. Currently, there is no effective malaria vaccine. However, studies show that&#xD;
           volunteers bitten many times by mosquitoes that carry weakened malaria parasites could&#xD;
           fight off getting sick with malaria when later exposed to normal malaria parasites.&#xD;
           Malaria parasites are weakened by exposing them to radiation when they are in the stage&#xD;
           of development called sporozoites . Only the mosquitoes are irradiated and study&#xD;
           volunteers are not exposed to radiation. The radiation stops the parasites from being&#xD;
           able to cause disease but still promote protection. For many years, it was not possible&#xD;
           to give these sporozoites to people as a vaccine since they could not be adequately&#xD;
           purified from the mosquito. Scientists have recently figured out how to produce and&#xD;
           isolate the weakened sporozoites so that they can be given in an injected vaccine. This&#xD;
           vaccine is known as the &quot;PfSPZ vaccine&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A malaria challenge will be used to test whether the vaccine will prevent infection. In&#xD;
           a malaria challenge, mosquitoes that have the malaria parasite will be allowed to bite a&#xD;
           participant's arm. In the event that the vaccine does not work, the malaria parasite&#xD;
           used for the challenge can be treated completely with common anti-malaria medications.&#xD;
           Participants will be treated immediately if they develop malaria symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of the PfSPZ vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 to 45 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests.&#xD;
           There will be five different groups of study participants, all of whom will be monitored&#xD;
           with frequent blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will have two vaccines with the lowest amount of the vaccine given 4 weeks&#xD;
           apart, with regular clinic visits up to 24 weeks after the second vaccine. This group&#xD;
           will not have a malaria challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will have four or six vaccines given 4 weeks apart at a higher dose than group&#xD;
           1. A malaria challenge will be given about 3 weeks after the last vaccine. Follow-up&#xD;
           visits will continue through 24 weeks after the last vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 will have four or six vaccines given 4 weeks apart at a higher dose than group&#xD;
           2. A malaria challenge will be given about 3 weeks after the last vaccination, as for&#xD;
           Group 2. Follow-up visits will continue through 24 weeks after last vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4 will have four or six vaccines given 4 weeks apart at a higher dose than group&#xD;
           3. A malaria challenge will be given about 3 weeks after the last vaccination. Follow up&#xD;
           visits will continue through 24 weeks after last vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5 will serve as a control group and will not receive the vaccine, but will have&#xD;
           the malaria challenge. Follow-up visits will continue through 8 weeks after the&#xD;
           challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants from any group who receive a malaria challenge will be treated promptly for&#xD;
      malaria when it develops.&#xD;

      Study Design: VRC 312 is the second study of the PfSPZ Vaccine and the first study to&#xD;
      evaluate intravenous (IV) administration of this vaccine. The study is designed as an&#xD;
      openlabel evaluation of the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of&#xD;
      the vaccine at successively higher dosages (2000; 7500; 30,000 and 135,000 SPZ per injection)&#xD;
      administered by the IV route. The 3 higher dosages will be evaluated for protection against a&#xD;
      malaria challenge after 4 to 6 vaccinations. Control subjects are included in the malaria&#xD;
      challenge. The primary objectives of the study are related to the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the vaccine at the 4 dosage levels when administered IV; the secondary objectives are related&#xD;
      to PfSPZ vaccine-mediated protection against Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) challenge at the 3&#xD;
      higher dosage levels; and the exploratory objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      PfSPZ Vaccine and defining an immune correlate of protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: The investigational PfSPZ Vaccine is manufactured by Sanaria, Inc&#xD;
      (Rockville, MD) under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). The vaccine consists of a&#xD;
      suspension of purified, metabolically-active, radiation-attenuated cryopreserved Pf&#xD;
      sporozoites formulated in cryoprotectant and dispensed in a 0.5 mL screw-cap vial containing&#xD;
      a 20 mcL aliquot at a concentration of 150,000 sporozoites (+/-50,000 sporozoites) per 20&#xD;
      mcL. The vaccine is stored in the vapor-phase of liquid nitrogen (LNVP) at -140 to -196&#xD;
      degrees C. The PfSPZ Vaccine is delivered by Sanaria, Inc. to the clinical investigators and&#xD;
      diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 1% human serum albumin (HSA) to achieve the&#xD;
      correct dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Healthy subjects, 18-45 years old, who are malaria-naive. The fewest number of&#xD;
      subjects needed to complete the study as originally designed was 51; however, with inclusion&#xD;
      of study provisions for back-up challenge subjects enrollment of additional vaccinees and&#xD;
      options for rechallenge, as added by protocol amendments, the amended accrual allowance is 68&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Subjects will be enrolled in a step-wise, dose-escalation manner with stringent&#xD;
      stopping rules designed for subject safety. The first 12 subjects will be allocated as the&#xD;
      pilot subjects that comprise Groups 1, 2a, 3a, 4a; each of which includes 3 pilot subjects.&#xD;
      For the pilot subjects, the 1st vaccination (V1) and 2nd vaccination (V2) will be&#xD;
      administered no faster than one per pilot subject every 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before administration of the first dose to the subsequent pilot Group (dose escalation), at&#xD;
      least 5 weeks of cumulative safety data for the pilot subjects in a dosage group (i.e., 1&#xD;
      week past 2nd vaccination) must be submitted to the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) and the&#xD;
      FDA, and protocol-specified approval received for the dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in vaccine Groups 2, 3, 4 and the Group 5 controls will be challenged by exposure to&#xD;
      Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with Pf sporozoites in a controlled setting, followed&#xD;
      by testing for parasitemia at specified intervals through up to 28 days post-challenge. To&#xD;
      facilitate intensive daily close monitoring of clinical status and blood smears, 11 overnight&#xD;
      stays are required from days 7-18 post-challenge. Subjects who develop blood stage P.&#xD;
      falciparum infection will be treated as soon as a case is identified by the protocol&#xD;
      criteria. Following treatment, a subject will be considered cured when 2 consecutive daily&#xD;
      blood smears are negative. After establishing cure, blood smear checks may end and the&#xD;
      subject may discontinue overnight stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenges occur at specified timepoints in which each challenge includes vaccine recipients&#xD;
      and control subjects. Rechallenge options to assess for durability of protective responses&#xD;
      and further evaluation of immune correlates of protection are included in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: The study will take approximately 18 months to complete. The period of&#xD;
      follow-up for each vaccinated subject is through at least 24 weeks after the last&#xD;
      vaccination. The total duration on study will vary depending upon the schedule assignment and&#xD;
      whether or not the subject participates in a rechallenge. The Group 5 (challenge only)&#xD;
      subjects and rechallenged subjects will be followed through 8 weeks after last challenge.&#xD;
