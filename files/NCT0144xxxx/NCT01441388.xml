  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the success of anti-angiogenic therapy in multiple treatment settings, a fraction of&#xD;
      patients are refractory to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor treatment&#xD;
      while the majority of patients will eventually develop evasive resistance and exhibit disease&#xD;
      progression while on therapy. It is proposed that mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor&#xD;
      (c-MET) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF or scatter factor) contribute&#xD;
      significantly to VEGF inhibitor resistance such that combining a c-MET inhibitor with a VEGF&#xD;
      inhibitor will provide additional clinical activity compared to VEGF inhibitor alone. This&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested using the cMET/ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, in combination with&#xD;
      individual VEGF inhibitors. Three combinations will be prioritized, namely crizotinib plus&#xD;
      axitinib, crizotinib plus sunitinib and crizotinib plus bevacizumab, with a fourth&#xD;
      combination, crizotinib plus sorafenib to be tested only if crizotinib does not combine with&#xD;
      either axitinib and/or sunitinib.&#xD;

          -  Hypertension that cannot be controlled with medications (&gt;150/90 mmHg despite optimal&#xD;
             medical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For glioblastoma patients: Prior treatment of glioblastoma with Gliadel wafers,&#xD;
             stereotactic radiation, or brachytherapy unless there is pathological or definitive&#xD;
             radiological evidence (PET scan or perfusion MRI) of recurrent tumor or unless there&#xD;
             is new enhancement outside of the radiation field. History of Grade 2 or greater acute&#xD;
             intracranial hemorrhage. Radiation therapy (RT) for glioblastoma within 3 months&#xD;
             unless there is either: a) histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor, or b) new&#xD;
             enhancement on MRI outside of the RT treatment field.Concomitant treatment with&#xD;
             therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (low dose warfarin (Coumadin) up to 2 mg PO daily&#xD;
             for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed).&#xD;
