    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the role of cervical cerclage versus expectant&#xD;
      management in women with complete placenta previa (≥ 10mm over internal os) presenting with&#xD;
      shortened cervical length ( ≥ 10mm and ≤ 30mm) between 18w0d and 26w0d of pregnancy.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to perform a large multi-center randomized trial comparing the&#xD;
      role of cervical cerclage versus expectant management in women with placenta previa&#xD;
      presenting with shortened cervical length ( ≥ 10mm and ≤ 30mm) between 18w0d and 26w0d of&#xD;
      gestation. In addition, the role of fetal fibronectin (fFN) for the prediction of preterm&#xD;
      birth and hemorrhage will be elucidated. The hypothesis is that placement of a cervical&#xD;
      cerclage between 18w0d to 26w0d in patients with a short cervix and complete placenta previa&#xD;
      will decrease preterm birth as compared to expectantly managing these patients.&#xD;
