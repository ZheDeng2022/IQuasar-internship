      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Fenoterol has been used to treat asthma by opening up the airways in the lungs. It also&#xD;
      increases the heart rate without significantly increasing blood pressure. This means that it&#xD;
      may help improve heart function by boosting the heart's output. Researchers have developed a&#xD;
      different form of the drug that may be given to individuals with heart trouble. This new form&#xD;
      needs more testing. It is especially important to compare the new form with the original form&#xD;
      of the drug used to treat asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare how safe and effective two different forms of Fenoterol are in improving heart&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy people between 21 and 60 years of age who have no history of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
           and heart function studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those in the study will have two 36-hour inpatient study visits. At each visit, they&#xD;
           will have a physical exam and blood and urine tests. They will fast overnight and then&#xD;
           receive one of the two forms of Fenoterol first thing in the morning. They will not know&#xD;
           whether they are getting the original or the modified form of the drug. After receiving&#xD;
           the drug, they will provide frequent blood and urine samples for 24 hours. They will&#xD;
           have a final exam before being discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who take part in the study will have a followup visit 5 to 7 days after the end of&#xD;
           each study visit. They will provide more blood and urine samples and have a physical&#xD;
           exam.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fenoterol is a drug that has been used for the treatment of disease like asthma for many&#xD;
      years. It is available in Canada in an inhaled form where it is called Berotec . Fenoterol&#xD;
      stimulates receptors in the body called Beta Adrenergic Receptors and is therefore in a&#xD;
      family of drugs called Beta Agonists. While one particular form of the drug, called a Racemic&#xD;
      mixture has traditionally been used for asthma, multiple forms of the drug have now been&#xD;
      produced and it is possible that using one of the newer forms of the drug will have benefits&#xD;
      for people with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for heart failure is a complex problem. It is a problem of the heart not pumping&#xD;
      enough blood to meet the demands of the body and a number of changes that ultimately prove&#xD;
      harmful in an attempt to compensate for this failure. Scientists have observed several&#xD;
      effects of Fenoterol that may prove beneficial to people with heart failure. Use of the older&#xD;
      Fenoterol (Racemic) mixture indicates that the drug causes the heart to pump more blood out&#xD;
      to the rest of the body by increasing a person s heart rate but having little to no effect on&#xD;
      their blood pressure. These effects provide a rationale for attempting to develop Fenoterol&#xD;
      as a possible treatment for congestive heart failure. It is hoped that this new form of the&#xD;
      drug will prove to have even more benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the new form of the drug (called the R R form ) has not yet been tested in humans.&#xD;
      Animal studies and scientific understanding of these types of mixtures suggest that it will&#xD;
      little to no difference between it and the older Racemic form. To test this thinking and&#xD;
      determine what doses should be used in future studies, we will conduct a Phase I, escalating&#xD;
      dose study in healthy volunteers using the orally administered forms of the older Racemic&#xD;
      mixture and newer R R form .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of three groups of 6 people taking doses of the drug by mouth and&#xD;
      then monitoring their heart rate, blood pressure, blood chemistry, genetic factors, and heart&#xD;
      function. The first group will get a 2.5 mg dose of the R R form of the drug on one visit and&#xD;
      then a 5 mg dose of the racemic mixture on the other visit. The second group will get a 5mg&#xD;
      dose of the R R form on one of their visits and a 10mg dose of the Racemic mixture on the&#xD;
      other. Finally, the third group will get a 10mg dose of the R R form on one visit and a 20mg&#xD;
      dose of the Racemic mixture on the other. Also, blood will be collected at regular intervals&#xD;
      to monitor levels of the drug, its rate of breakdown, changes in blood chemistry, and the&#xD;
      testing of various genes. All research will be performed at the National Institute on Aging&#xD;
      (NIA) Clinical Research Unit located on the 5th floor of Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing the safety and breakdown of this drug and comparing it to the older Racemic form will&#xD;
      be an important first step in its development as a new drug for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers to establish the body s absorption and breakdown&#xD;
           of this new form of Fenoterol (R R form) in comparison with the older, established&#xD;
           Racemic mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To monitor the effects of the drug on heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac structure&#xD;
           and function after a person takes the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: This study will provide a safety assessment and will determine the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and bioavailability of (R,R )- and racemic Fenoterol in healthy subjects. In addition,&#xD;
      information will be gained about the pharmacodynamics of Fenoterol. This will provide&#xD;
      information for future studies that will evaluate (R,R )-Fenoterol as a potential treatment&#xD;
      for congestive heart failure.&#xD;
