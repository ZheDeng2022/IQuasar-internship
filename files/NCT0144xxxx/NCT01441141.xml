      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pain is the most common symptom of sickle cell disease. Episodes of severe sickle cell pain&#xD;
      are known as &quot;crises.&quot; High rates of pain crises are associated with a higher risk of early&#xD;
      death. Some people with sickle cell disease have many severe pain crises while others&#xD;
      experience fewer crises. This difference in pain crisis may be caused by sensitivity to pain.&#xD;
      People with high sensitivity to pain may have more pain crises. Many factors, including a&#xD;
      person's genetic makeup, determine sensitivity to pain. Comparing genetic information from&#xD;
      people with sickle cell disease and healthy volunteers may provide more information on pain&#xD;
      and sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study genetics and pain sensitivity in sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  African or African American individuals at least 18 years of age with sickle cell&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy African or African American volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also&#xD;
           provide blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative sensory testing to measure sensitivity to pressure, heat, cold, and&#xD;
           mechanical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EndoPat test to measure blood vessel function and reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about mood, evidence of depression, pain, quality of sleep, and sleep&#xD;
           disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measures of daily pain, whether or not related to sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the first visit, those in the study will have monthly study visits for 6 months.&#xD;
           The above tests will be repeated at these visits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease in the United States inherited&#xD;
      as an autosomal recessive disorder, where approximately 70,000 individuals have sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. Acute painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOCs) is one of the common complications of SCD&#xD;
      that influences overall survival (Platt, Thorington et al. 1991). Pain, is also the most&#xD;
      common cause of SCD morbidity, which has a negative impact on quality of life of these&#xD;
      individuals and their families. There is significant inter-individual variation in the&#xD;
      frequency and course of severe VOCs that result in hospital based treatment, the reasons for&#xD;
      which have not been clearly elucidated. Vaso-occlusion of irreversibly sickle red cells&#xD;
      within the microcirculation is believed to be the proximate cause of painful VOCs, however it&#xD;
      is likely that other non-SCD related factors affecting pain perception and sensitivity to&#xD;
      pain will also contribute to individuals susceptibility to pain and therefore contribute to&#xD;
      the observed inter-individual variability in the course of VOC. Early identification of&#xD;
      individuals who are at high risk for developing severe pain related morbidity and chronic&#xD;
      pain syndromes is crucial since early multimodal interventions might have the potential to&#xD;
      minimize both the morbidity and mortality associated with VOCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with SCD are hypothesized to have lower nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability due to NO&#xD;
      scavenging by cell free hemoglobin released into plasma during red cell hemolysis. NO&#xD;
      deficiency has been identified as a key factor in development vascular dysfunction in SCD. NO&#xD;
      has also recently been identified as a key mediator in processing nociceptive signals and&#xD;
      modulation of pain in non-SCD models. Thus, low NO is associated with lower pain perception&#xD;
      (Meller, Dykstra et al. 1992; Tegeder, Costigan et al. 2006). GTP cyclohydrolase (GCH1) is&#xD;
      the rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of an essential cofactor for both NO production and&#xD;
      metabolism of aromatic amino acids, namely tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Therefore it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that genetic variants in the GCH1 gene will affect BH4 levels and which will&#xD;
      have a secondary impact on vascular dysfunction and sensitivity to pain in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this protocol is to establish patterns of sensitivity to experimental&#xD;
      pain among subjects with SCD compared to healthy African American controls. In addition, an&#xD;
      exploratory analysis will determine if increased sensitivity to experimental pain correlates&#xD;
      with the frequency and intensity of clinical pain in those with SCD. Once an expected pattern&#xD;
      of experimental pain phenotypes are established for a cohort with SCD, we will then further&#xD;
      explore the role of GCH1 genetic variants in experimental pain perception and vascular&#xD;
      function. If successful, a longer term secondary objective is to establish a sufficiently&#xD;
      large patient cohort with experimental pain phenotypes for future exploratory genetic studies&#xD;
      to investigate the role of other loci that might influence sensitivity to experimental pain&#xD;
      and vascular function in SCD.&#xD;
