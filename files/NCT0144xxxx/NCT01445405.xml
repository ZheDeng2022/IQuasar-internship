      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib acts on molecules in head and neck cancer cells that are important for the cells&#xD;
      growth and survival. The drug may help make the cancer more sensitive to radiation and other&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that has increased the effectiveness of radiation&#xD;
      treatment in patients with head and neck cancer in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin has shrunk head and neck cancers and improved treatment response and survival when&#xD;
      combined with radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the highest safe dose of bortezomib when combined with cetuximab without or with&#xD;
      cisplatin and with radiation in patients with advanced head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the benefits and side effects of these drug combinations with radiation in&#xD;
      patients with advanced head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced Stage IV head and neck cancer who have not&#xD;
      previously had neck radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned sequentially to one of two treatment groups: Group A receives&#xD;
      bortezomib and cetuximab beginning the week before, and for the duration of, radiation&#xD;
      therapy; Group B receives bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin beginning the week before, and&#xD;
      for the duration of, radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab is given as a 2-hour infusion through a vein (intravenously, IV) for the first&#xD;
           dose and then over 1 hour for subsequent weekly doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bortezomib is given as an injection into a vein over about 5 seconds, twice a week for 2&#xD;
           weeks, followed by a 1-week rest for a total of three 3-week treatment cycles during&#xD;
           radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin is given in once a week as a 1-hour IV infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy is given 5 days a week for 7 to 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Until 2 weeks after treatment ends, patients are followed once a week including a&#xD;
           physical examination, review of treatment side effects, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 2 months after treatment ends, patients may need to return to the hospital for&#xD;
           medical evaluation and supportive care, depending on their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  8-weeks after treatment ends, patients return for evaluation with a history and physical&#xD;
           examination; blood tests; ear, nose and throat evaluation and endoscopy; CT or MRI scan,&#xD;
           or both, of the neck and chest; and, if indicated, a PET scan....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced squamous cell carcinoma involving the head and neck (SCCHN) has a mortality&#xD;
           exceeding 50 percent and significant impact on function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of locally advanced SCCHN with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)&#xD;
           antibody cetuximab (Erbitux or C225) or DNA damaging agent cisplatin concurrent with&#xD;
           radiation therapy (RT) have shown improvements in response, survival, and organ&#xD;
           preservation, of approximately10-20 percent over RT alone. The combination of cetuximab,&#xD;
           cisplatin and RT is currently under investigation as the next standard for concurrent&#xD;
           chemo-RT for patients with SCCHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab inhibits EGFR, which is overexpressed by approximately 90 percent of SCCHN and&#xD;
           is associated with decreased patient survival. EGFR contributes to activation of the&#xD;
           Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and Signal Transduction and Activating&#xD;
           Transcription Factor (STAT3) pathways, which promote induction of genes involved in cell&#xD;
           proliferation and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recently, the Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kB) pathway has been shown to be an independent&#xD;
           pathway important for altered expression of prosurvival genes, the malignant phenotype,&#xD;
           and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) can inhibit NF-kB and target genes, as&#xD;
           well as increase expression of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 in SCCHN. Bortezomib&#xD;
           in combination with RT, cetuximab or cisplatin induces greater cytotoxic effects in&#xD;
           cancer cells than these treatments individually in preclinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this phase I trial we will determine the feasibility of administering bortezomib&#xD;
           concurrently with cetuximab and RT, and cetuximab, cisplatin and RT. We hypothesize that&#xD;
           bortezomib can be given with these combinations with an acceptable toxicity profile and&#xD;
           a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that demonstrates clinical activity and effects on NF-kB,&#xD;
           MAPK and STAT3 pathway signaling and apoptosis in SCCHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of combining the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib&#xD;
      with cetuximab, or cetuximab and cisplatin concurrent with radiation for therapy of patients&#xD;
      with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and to identify the MTD&#xD;
      for bortezomib for further clinical phase 2 development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival with&#xD;
      the above regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of bortezomib with cetuximab, or bortezomib, cetuximab with&#xD;
      cisplatin to inhibit activation of the NF-kB, EGFR, MAPK, and STAT3 signal pathways,&#xD;
      expression of pro-survival and pro-angiogenesis genes regulated by these pathways, and&#xD;
      effects on proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with advanced Stage IV SCCHN, without history prior neck radiation, for whom&#xD;
      concurrent chemo-RT is an option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive standard RT to a total dose of 70 Gy, in 2 Gy/day fractions, 5&#xD;
           days/week, concurrent with either bortezomib and cetuximab, or bortezomib, cetuximab and&#xD;
           cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bortezomib will be given following a dose escalation schema (3 dose levels of 0.7, 1 and&#xD;
           1.3 mg/m2/dose) IV twice weekly for the first two weeks of three 21-day cycles which&#xD;
           each include a 1 week break, starting the week prior to RT initiation and for a total of&#xD;
           7-8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In group A, patients with receive bortezomib, cetuximab and RT, and in group B,&#xD;
           bortezomib, cetuximab, cisplatin and RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously established MTDs will be used for weekly administration of cetuximab&#xD;
           (400mg/m2 initially and then 250 mg/m(2) IV weekly), and cisplatin (30mg/m(2) IV&#xD;
           weekly).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cetuximab or cetuximab and cisplatin will be given with the first dose of bortezomib the&#xD;
           week prior to RT and continue weekly during RT (7-8 weekly doses). Drug therapy will not&#xD;
           be given after RT completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups A will accrue before group B, to identify the MTD for the combination of&#xD;
           bortezomib, cetuximab and RT, and then bortezomib, cetuximab, cisplatin and RT, for&#xD;
           expansion and phase 2 development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum and blood will be collected for study of potential proteomic and genetic markers&#xD;
           of drug sensitivity and effects, and tumor response and recurrence, within 2 weeks&#xD;
           pretreatment and days 5, 12 of bortezomib cycle 1, and day 12 of cycles 2 and 3. Serum&#xD;
           will be collected thereafter every 3 months up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional tumor and/or skin biopsies will be performed within 2 weeks before start of&#xD;
           treatment and on day 5 of the first week during treatment with drugs alone, and on day&#xD;
           12 after start of RT for correlative studies of the combined effects of bortezomib with&#xD;
           cetuximab, or bortezomib cetuximab and cisplatin on signal pathway activation, apoptosis&#xD;
           and other markers, without and with RT. (Details of correlative studies). Patients will&#xD;
           be evaluated by CT and FDG-PET pre-treatment and for response 8 weeks post-RT using WHO&#xD;
           RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study design and sample size is Phase 1, 3-6 patients per dose level to establish&#xD;
           the MTD. An additional 6-10 patients (in each group) will be treated at the MTD in order&#xD;
           further assess toxicity, response and molecular correlatives. The anticipated sample&#xD;
           size is between 6 and 46.&#xD;

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, including variants,&#xD;
             or undifferentiated/poorly differentiated carcinoma of the head and neck (any site,&#xD;
             except nasopharynx).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previously untreated stage IV disease (AJCC staging system, 6th edition), or,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with residual disease or regional recurrence of head and neck cancer after&#xD;
             surgery and/or chemotherapy, but with no prior bortezomib, EGFR inhibitor therapy or&#xD;
             head and neck radiotherapy. All such patients should be eligible to receive full dose&#xD;
             radiation therapy, and must be evaluated and accepted for treatment by a Radiation&#xD;
             Oncologist. Prior cisplatin is allowed if administered greater than 3 months earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with no clinically measurable distant disease, or those with asymptomatic&#xD;
             small distant lesions outside the radiation field of less than or equal to 3cm&#xD;
             individual or aggregate diameter, but for whom palliation of local and regional&#xD;
             disease is clinically warranted will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any number of other prior systemic therapies is allowed. Patients must have fully&#xD;
             recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, or chemotherapy. A minimum time&#xD;
             period of 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) should elapse between the&#xD;
             completion of prior chemotherapy and enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of bortezomib in combination with cetuximab or&#xD;
             cisplatin and radiation in patients &lt;18 years of age, and head and neck cancer in&#xD;
             children is exceedingly rare, except for those with disorders of DNA damage repair,&#xD;
             bone marrow or transplant immunosuppression likely to have lower tolerance to these&#xD;
             drugs and RT, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 70 percent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, except for patients with&#xD;
                  Gilberts syndrome, with increased indirect bilirubin less than or equal to 3&#xD;
                  mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with&#xD;
             creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The effects of bortezomib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must have agreed to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; prior vasectomy; tubal&#xD;
             ligation or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate cognitive and neurologic function to protect against and detect and report&#xD;
             toxicities experienced, and to understand and to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with previously untreated nasopharyngeal cancer (any stage) will be excluded,&#xD;
             but patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior treatment with radiation to the head and neck, or systemic EGFR inhibitors or&#xD;
             bortezomib is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or&#xD;
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to bortezomib, cetuximab, cisplatin or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with greater than or equal to grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy because&#xD;
             bortezomib can cause irreversible worsening and a painful type of chemotherapy&#xD;
             associated peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bortezomib, cetuximab and&#xD;
             cisplatin have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin.&#xD;
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. HIV-positive patients or patients on any antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for possible pharmacodynamic interactions with bortezomib, cetuximab&#xD;
             and cisplatin, particularly bone marrow and mucosal toxicity, which could affect the&#xD;
             MTD. These patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
