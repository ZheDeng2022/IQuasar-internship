    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine sustained immunogenicity of the quadrivalent&#xD;
      vaccine 'Gardasil', 48 months after initial vaccination, among HIV-1 infected boys and girls&#xD;
      age 9-14 years. This age range is within the World Health Organization (WHO) stipulated&#xD;
      guidelines for national programs for the vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected individuals bear a disproportionate disease burden of HPV-related diseases&#xD;
      suggesting more rapid progression from HPV acquisition to malignancy. HIV infected women have&#xD;
      a 2-22 fold increased risk for cervical cancer compared to uninfected women. The quadrivalent&#xD;
      HPV vaccine marketed as &quot;Gardasil&quot; has demonstrated efficacy against type specific HPV&#xD;
      infections known to cause 70% cervical cancer (HPV 16 &amp; 18) and HPV 6 &amp; 11 known to cause 90%&#xD;
      of anogenital warts in populations of HIV negative young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the risk of HPV exposure persists throughout a person's sexual life, the duration of&#xD;
      protection, especially when the vaccine is given in the pre-adolescent period, is critical to&#xD;
      overall vaccine effectiveness. Extended follow up of HIV-uninfected individuals has shown&#xD;
      sustained response to HPV vaccine for 8.4 and 6 years respectively to the bivalent and&#xD;
      quadrivalent vaccines. However, other vaccines such as the hepatitis B vaccine have been&#xD;
      shown to require additional dosages to be effective among HIV-infected persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on immunogenicity of the HPV vaccine among HIV infected adolescents is limited to a 12&#xD;
      month follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current HPV vaccine guidelines target pre-sexual adolescents. Since the risk of HPV exposure&#xD;
      persists throughout an individual's sexual life, the duration of protection provided by&#xD;
      vaccination is critical to the overall vaccine effectiveness. Duration of sustained HPV&#xD;
      6/11/16/18 antibody response is directly related to vaccine effectiveness and determines the&#xD;
      need for booster dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose to extend follow up of 179 girls and boys in Kenya, age&#xD;
      9-14 years who have received 3 doses of the quadrivalent 'Gardasil' vaccine and assess for&#xD;
      immunogenicity annually.&#xD;
