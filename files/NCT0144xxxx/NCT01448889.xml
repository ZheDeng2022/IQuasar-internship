      Acute renal failure induced by radiographic contrast agents is a known complication of&#xD;
      coronary angiography.hypoxia plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Contrast induced&#xD;
      nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of normobaric hyperoxygenation&#xD;
      therapy on renal functions in patients at high risk for CIN undergoing coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is aimed to include 180 consecutive patients with estimated GFR base on the MDRD&#xD;
      equation of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 that are candidates for elective coronary&#xD;
      angiography. Patients with acute renal failure, acute myocardial infarction, noncompensated&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, hemodynamic instability, known sensitivity to contrast media and&#xD;
      patients who had been exposed to contrast media during the last 3 months will be excluded.&#xD;
      Patients with oxygen blood saturation of less than 94% at room air will also be excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 100% oxygen by mask&#xD;
      (treated group) or breath room air (control group) for duration of 4 hours starting at the&#xD;
      beginning of the angiographic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with 0.9% salin and NAC. Coronary angiography will be performed&#xD;
      using nonionic, low osmolar iodine (Ultravist®-370) (Schering, Berlin, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be hospitalized 1 day before and at least 24 hours following angiography.&#xD;
      Blood samples for urea, creatinine and cystatin- C will be drawn on admission, 6, 24 and 48&#xD;
      hours after coronary angiography. Urine sample will be taken 24 hours before angiography and&#xD;
      6, 24 and 48 hours post angiography. In those urine samples the ratio between creatinine to&#xD;
      Isoprostanes and NO will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure induced by radiographic contrast agents is a known complication of&#xD;
      coronary angiography. It has been demonstrated that following contrast media application the&#xD;
      renal outer medullar blood flow is reduced, resulting in medullar ischemia. N-acetylcysteine&#xD;
      (NAC) together with well hydration stands in the center of treatments to prevent contrast&#xD;
      induced nephropaathy (CIN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, hypoxia plays a major role in the pathogenesis of CIN it seems rational that further&#xD;
      increase oxygen delivery to the renal tissue will further ameliorate the expected CIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of normobaric hyperoxygenation&#xD;
      therapy on renal functions in patients at high risk for CIN undergoing coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee and each patient will give&#xD;
      written informed consent before including in the study. The study is aimed to include 180&#xD;
      consecutive patients with estimated GFR base on the MDRD equation of less than 60 mL/min/1.73&#xD;
      m2 that are candidates for elective coronary angiography. Patients with acute renal failure,&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, noncompensated congestive heart failure, hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability, known sensitivity to contrast media and patients who had been exposed to&#xD;
      contrast media during the last 3 months will be excluded. Patients with oxygen blood&#xD;
      saturation of less than 94% at room air will also be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 100% oxygen by mask&#xD;
      (treated group) or breath room air (control group) for duration of 4 hours starting at the&#xD;
      beginning of the angiographic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with 0.9% salin and NAC. Saline o.9% hydration will be infused&#xD;
      at a rate of 1 mL/kg/hour 12 hours before and 12 hours after coronary angiography. NAC 1g&#xD;
      [Mucomyst 20% solution (Bristol-Meyers, New York, NY, USA)] will be administered orally twice&#xD;
      daily 24 hours before and 24 hours after coronary angiography. Coronary angiography will be&#xD;
      performed using nonionic, low osmolar iodine (Ultravist®-370) (Schering, Berlin, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be hospitalized 1 day before and at least 24 hours following angiography.&#xD;
      Blood samples for urea, creatinine and cystatin- C will be drawn on admission, 6, 24 and 48&#xD;
      hours after coronary angiography. Urine sample will be taken 24 hours before angiography and&#xD;
      6, 24 and 48 hours post angiography. In those urine samples the ratio between creatinine to&#xD;
      Isoprostanes and NO will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis Two 10mL aliquots from each urine collection will be separated and stored&#xD;
      at -70°C until analyzed for nitric oxide metabolites and urinary isoprostanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of urinary nitric oxide metabolites Metabolites of nitric oxide (NOx) (NO2+ NO3)&#xD;
      will be measured in the urine samples. Total NO synthesis will be evaluated in duplicates, by&#xD;
      a specific two-step photocolorimetric assay (R&amp;D Systems, USA) by a protocol supplied by a&#xD;
      manufacturer. The intensity of the developing color was measured in ELISA reader, at 540 nm&#xD;
      wavelength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress Oxidative stress will be assessed by measurement of urinary isoprostanes,&#xD;
      which are secondary end products of lipid peroxidation and are known to be an accurate and&#xD;
      sensitive marker of renal oxidative stress in vivo. STAT-8 isoprostane PGF2 content will be&#xD;
      estimated by a specific EIA (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, Mich., USA) based on a&#xD;
      competition between 8-isoprostane and 8-isoprostane-alkaline phosphatase conjugate for a&#xD;
      limited number of the specific STAT-8 isoprostane PGF2 antibody binding sites and subsequent&#xD;
      reaction of the immobilized complex with p-nitrophenyl-phosphate. The intensity of the&#xD;
      developing yellow color will be measured in ELISA reader at 405 nm wavelength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators involved in the measurement of blood urea, creatinin and cystatin-C and in the&#xD;
      urinary NOx and isoprostanes will be blinded to the patients' treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The calculation of the sample size is based on the following assumption:&#xD;
      Baseline frequency of CIN of 20%, at least 35% reduction in the control group, alpha error&#xD;
      level of 5%, beta error level of 50% and expected drop out rate of 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous baseline variables will be compared between the treatment groups by an unpaired t&#xD;
      test and by a paired t test within each group. Categorical parameters will compared by a&#xD;
      chi-square test. The effect of oxygen therapy on serum urea, creatinine, serum urea, serum&#xD;
      cystatin-C, urinary NOx, and urinary isoprostanes at baseline 6, 24 and 48 hours following&#xD;
      angiography will be compared between the groups by a general linear model repeated-measures&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistical software SPSS (version 13.0, SPSS, Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA) will be used for all analyses. All tests were two tailed. P values below&#xD;
      0.05 were considered significant. Data are expressed as mean SEM.&#xD;
