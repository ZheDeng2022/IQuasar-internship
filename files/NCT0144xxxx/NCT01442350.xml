    <textblock>
      The cardiac variant of the Fabry disease is a rare cardiomyopathy affecting 1/50000&#xD;
      individuals in general population. It is generally diagnosed in advanced stages of the&#xD;
      disease, because it presents clinical features very similar to the hypertrophic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy ones, making difficult the correct diagnosis. In Fabry disease there is a&#xD;
      remodeling process of the myocardial interstitium and apoptosis of myocytes which leads to&#xD;
      fibrosis development and later systolic dysfunction. The investigators propose to evaluate&#xD;
      the utility of several biomarkers in the diagnosis of this cardiomyopathy, to facilitate the&#xD;
      early diagnosis, which is clue to establish early enzyme replacement therapy or intensify the&#xD;
      patients' follow up. In order to achieve this objective, the investigators will analyze&#xD;
      markers of endothelial dysfunction, fibrosis and apoptosis in peripheral blood samples of&#xD;
      patients carrying the mutation but without clinical manifestations and the investigators will&#xD;
      compare their levels with dose obtained from two different control groups: diagnosed patients&#xD;
      presenting clinical manifestations or index cases and healthy controls without carrying the&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive disease, affecting lysosomal storage with a variable&#xD;
      phenotype characterized by the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in several tissues. It has&#xD;
      been described more than 200 mutations in the alfa-galactosidase A (GLA) gene which cause&#xD;
      Fabry disease. Nowadays, the treatment of Fabry disease consists of enzyme replacement&#xD;
      therapy (ERT) which development has shown a reversal of abnormal accumulation of&#xD;
      glycosphingolipids in different tissues and a clinical improvement or stabilization (1).&#xD;
      Unlike classic systemic Fabry disease with multiple organ affectation, the cardiac variant of&#xD;
      the disease is characterized by myocardial hypertrophy. Hence, cardiac Fabry variant is&#xD;
      defined as a storage myocyte disorder mimicking the clinical features of the hypertrophic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (HCM)(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for the diagnosis of Fabry disease is the electron microscopy evaluation of&#xD;
      cardiac samples obtained from endomyocardial biopsy (2), although it has been published that&#xD;
      the determination of the alfa-galactosidase activity in plasma of patients diagnosed of Fabry&#xD;
      disease, followed by sequencing of the GLA gene in those individuals with low activity level&#xD;
      is a good non-invasive diagnostic method which allows the identification of the disease&#xD;
      carriers and the early start of the enzymatic replacement therapy (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the similarity between clinical characteristics of both diseases and to the&#xD;
      extraordinary low incidence of the Fabry disease, the biopsy execution is rarely carried out&#xD;
      for diagnosis. Hence, it has been speculated that a higher disease incidence should exist&#xD;
      hidden among patients presenting with clinical symptoms of HCM. Several studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the incidence of the Fabry disease among patients diagnosed of HCM, finding out&#xD;
      that even 8-10% of these patients actually presented Fabry disease (4,5), although a bias in&#xD;
      the patient selection can exist. In more recent studies including one carried out by our&#xD;
      group with a higher number of patients, a lower incidence (between 1-3%) has been found&#xD;
      (3,6). So, Fabry is a rare disease affecting 1/50000 individuals in the population (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracellular matrix is a dynamic structure with an intense participation in the myocardial&#xD;
      remodeling that occurs in different cardiovascular diseases (7). Alterations in the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix could perform an important role in the diastolic dysfunction process&#xD;
      linked to the myocardial hypertrophy. Collagen deposits increase left ventricular chamber&#xD;
      stiffness and ventricular load during diastole is compromised. Collagen turnover is increased&#xD;
      when compared to healthy controls, and synthesis is predominant over degradation, finding&#xD;
      associated changes in metalloproteinase activity (MMP, which are the principal enzymes in&#xD;
      charge of matrix degradation) and their inhibitors (TIMP) (8). Our group has recently&#xD;
      published several papers about the relevance of the fibrosis in patients with MCH&#xD;
      (9,10,11,12). The investigators found out that fibrosis, assessed by late Gadolinium&#xD;
      enhancement in cardiac magnetic resonance, is related to ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy,&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia (10) and functional state of the patient (11) and that MMP-9 value is&#xD;
      independently associated to fibrosis (9). There are also studies describing structural&#xD;
      changes in the matrix associated to Fabry disease, where fibrosis presence is evident both at&#xD;
      the interstitial level and replacing myocardiocytes loss (13). However, it has not been yet&#xD;
      demonstrated whether the alteration in the interstitial matrix takes place due only to&#xD;
      fibroblasts activation in response to humoral or mechanical factors without myocardiocytes&#xD;
      loss or, on the contrary, it is associated to cellular death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is increasing in heart failure.&#xD;
      Apoptosis can be activated by the interaction of cell surface death receptors (i.e. receptors&#xD;
      of tumoral necrosis factor superfamily -TNFR- and Fas protein receptor), with its ligands&#xD;
      (TNF-alfa and Fas ligand, FasL) (14), and by activation of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic&#xD;
      mechanisms, in response to unfavorable changes in intracellular environment (15). The&#xD;
      subsequent development is regulated by the Bcl-2 protein group (16) and executed by the&#xD;
      caspase family (17). During the apoptosis, Annexin 5, is produced in the myocytes and&#xD;
      secreted to the interstitial space (18,19). Annexin 5 seems to contribute to the&#xD;
      intracellular calcium management alteration, leading to the systolic dysfunction (20, 21).&#xD;
      Myocardiocytes death via apoptosis could be a more common process that previously thought,&#xD;
      with estimation of repair process that contribute to the interstitium expansion. GDF-15 is a&#xD;
      member of the TGF-β superfamily, and a well establish marker of risk and prognosis in acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes. It has been recently proposed as a regulator of fibrosis and tissue&#xD;
      remodeling processes probably by prevention of apoptosis (22). Apoptosis of myocardiocytes&#xD;
      leads to the progressive ventricular wall slimming, as previously reported in MCH (23), and&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the molecules involved in apoptosis and ventricular remodeling can be detected in&#xD;
      peripheral blood and are known as biomarkers. Biomarkers give information about normal&#xD;
      biological processes or physiopathologic mechanisms and can be very useful in differential&#xD;
      diagnosis or even in prognosis. Nowadays, there is a raising interest in the study and&#xD;
      utility of biomarkers in cardiovascular disease, being more used in ischemic cardiopathy and&#xD;
      heart failure (24-27). Unfortunately their study in HCM has been less developed, even less in&#xD;
      Fabry disease. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is the most studied biomarker in HCM and has&#xD;
      been related to the presence of heart failure symptoms (28-30), poor functional capacity (30)&#xD;
      and left ventricular outflow obstruction (31-34). On the other hand ST2 has started very&#xD;
      recently to be considered as a good biomarker for myocardial-specific response to stretch,&#xD;
      with synergistic implications in prognosis with BNP (35).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group is currently developing a project studying several biomarkers (myocardial stress,&#xD;
      endothelial damage, hypercoagulable state) in order to explore different systems involved in&#xD;
      ventricular remodeling in HCM (assessed by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance)&#xD;
      that could be very similar in Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Fabry disease, plasma or urine level of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) is used as biomarker.&#xD;
      This glycosphingolipid is stored in lysosomes in Fabry patients, although is has been shown&#xD;
      that detected plasma or urine concentrations can vary, due to different mutations that do not&#xD;
      provoke a complete loss of alfa-galactosidase activity. In addition, in heterozygous women&#xD;
      plasma levels can be normal but there are some data suggesting high concentration in urine&#xD;
      (36). On the other hand, it has been suggested that is lactosylceramide, a catabolic product&#xD;
      of Gb3, who regulates the expression pattern of TNF-alfa and y ICAM-1, contributing to&#xD;
      atherosclerosis development (37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators dispose of a specialized cardiomyopathy clinic in each of the three&#xD;
      hospitals: Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Hospital General&#xD;
      Universitario de Alicante, and Hospital General Universitario de Elche. The investigators&#xD;
      have already recruited 12 families with diagnosed Fabry probands and a total of 60 relatives&#xD;
      clinically checked up within last 4 months. The investigators consider that the recruitment&#xD;
      of patients has been successful and are ready to carry out the present project. However, the&#xD;
      investigators would like to participate with other centres in order to share patients and&#xD;
      mutated relatives without phenotypic disease expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present project is to study biomarkers of apoptosis, fibrosis and interstitial&#xD;
      remodeling in peripheral samples of patients diagnosed with Fabry disease and relatives. Our&#xD;
      objective is to establish whether exists or not myocardial affectation data in mutations&#xD;
      carriers without phenotypic disease criteria. The investigators will also focus on different&#xD;
      polymorphisms and their implication in the development of Fabry disease.&#xD;
