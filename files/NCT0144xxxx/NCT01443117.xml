      HIV-infected people and pregnant women are at risk of developing severe pneumococcal disease.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and immune response to two pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccines in HIV-infected pregnant women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcus is the most common bacterial opportunistic infection in HIV-infected children,&#xD;
      and it is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonias in HIV-infected pregnant and non-pregnant&#xD;
      adults. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      (PCV-13) are two vaccines used for the prevention of pneumococcal (PNC) disease. The PPV-23&#xD;
      vaccine is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for&#xD;
      HIV-infected adults, including HIV-infected pregnant women. The PCV-13 vaccine is recommended&#xD;
      by the CDC for use in children, including HIV-infected children. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      PCV-13 and vaccines like PCV-13 are safe for use in healthy pregnant women, but they have not&#xD;
      been studied in HIV-infected pregnant women. This study will compare the safety and immune&#xD;
      response to the PCV-13 and PPV-23 vaccines in HIV-infected pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll HIV-infected pregnant women in their second or third trimester who are&#xD;
      receiving antiretroviral therapy. The study will take place in two steps. In Step 1,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive PPV-23 vaccine, PCV-13 vaccine, or placebo&#xD;
      vaccine. At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination, medical&#xD;
      history and nutritional status review, fetal heart rate measurement, blood collection, an&#xD;
      ultrasound, an adherence questionnaire, and a nose and throat swab procedure. They will then&#xD;
      receive their assigned vaccine. Participants will not be told which vaccine they are&#xD;
      receiving. Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 to 60 minutes after receiving the&#xD;
      vaccine for monitoring. They will attend study visits 14 to 21 days after the vaccination&#xD;
      visit, at Week 8, and at the time of labor and delivery. During these visits, they will&#xD;
      undergo select baseline study procedures. After delivery, participants' babies will have a&#xD;
      physical examination and blood collection. At 2 and 4 months after delivery, participants'&#xD;
      babies will undergo select baseline study procedures. Participants' babies will receive the&#xD;
      PCV vaccine according to the local standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 of the study will begin 6 months after delivery, at which time participants and their&#xD;
      babies will attend a study visit for a physical examination, medical history and nutritional&#xD;
      status review, an adherence questionnaire, and blood collection. Participants who received&#xD;
      the PPV-23 vaccine or the PCV-13 vaccine in Step 1 will end their participation in the study&#xD;
      after this visit. Participants who received placebo vaccine in Step 1 will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive the PPV-23 vaccine or PCV-13 vaccine at this study visit but will not be&#xD;
      told which vaccine they are receiving. Participants will attend a study visit 14 to 21 days&#xD;
      after receiving the vaccine, which will include select study procedures.&#xD;

    <description>IgG antibodies to pneumococcal (PNC) 19A, 6B, 18C, and 5 will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the capacity to opsonize to 19A and 6B will also be measured by OPA. The primary endpoint is a response to 3 out of 4 serotypes. A greater than or equal to 4-fold increase in OPA- and/or a greater than or equal to 2-fold increase in ELISA-measured IgG antibodies against PNC 19A and 6B will define a response against these serotypes. Responses to PNC 18C and 5 will rely only on the ELISA results.</description>
