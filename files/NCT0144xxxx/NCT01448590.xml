    <textblock>
      Epidural anesthesia is associated with potential risks and complications, post dural puncture&#xD;
      headache (PDPH) one of the most recognized with epidural or spinal anesthesia. Accidental&#xD;
      dural punctures occur with approximately 1.5% of all epidural attempts. Studies have&#xD;
      suggested that the use of an intrathecal catheter reduces the incidence of PDPH. A systematic&#xD;
      review of the existing literature will identify if there is reliable evidence to support this&#xD;
      theory. A secondary outcome, headache severity, will also be explored via incidence rates of&#xD;
      epidural blood patch, as this intervention is performed as a treatment for the most severe&#xD;
      headaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post dural puncture headache (PDPH) is one of the recognized complications experienced with&#xD;
      epidural or spinal anesthesia, resulting from needle puncture of the dura layer of the&#xD;
      meninges. This puncture can be deliberate (during spinal anesthesia) or accidental (during&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia). Dural punctures allow a leak of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to the&#xD;
      characteristic syndrome of PDPH; also known as a spinal headache or low-pressure headache.&#xD;
      Accidental dural punctures occur with approximately 1.5% of all epidural attempts. Studies&#xD;
      have estimated that, within the obstetrical population, headaches resulting from an&#xD;
      inadvertent dural puncture are as high as 50% to 75%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the risk of accidental dural punctures (ADP) cannot be eliminated, research has focused on&#xD;
      possible interventions that may be taken in order to avoid the onset of a PDPH, eliminate its&#xD;
      severity, or treat effects. One of the most common and effective treatments being an epidural&#xD;
      blood patch (EBP). More recently, threading the epidural catheter directly into the&#xD;
      intrathecal space after the dural puncture has been recognized as a viable option.&#xD;
