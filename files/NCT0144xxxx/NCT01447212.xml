      The purpose of this study, SALOME, is to determine if 1) the closely supervised provision of&#xD;
      injectable, hydromorphone (HDM; trade name Dilaudidâ„¢) is as effective as injectable&#xD;
      diacetylmorphine (DAM; heroin) in the treatment of chronic, multi-morbid opioid-dependent&#xD;
      individuals who have not benefited sufficiently from conventional treatments, and if a switch&#xD;
      to the oral equivalent of hydromorphone and diacetylmorphine is as effective as the injection&#xD;
      form. The availability of an effective, licensed opioid medication such as hydromorphone, for&#xD;
      substitution treatment of chronic, multi-morbid treatment-refractory opioid-dependent&#xD;
      individuals, would be of immense impact locally and internationally. It could help to&#xD;
      establish alternative treatment options where for non-medical reasons Heroin Assisted&#xD;
      Treatment would not be acceptable. Thus, one result could be the expansion of treatment&#xD;
      options for the most difficult to treat heroin dependent persons. This would also be an&#xD;
      important step for secondary prevention of HIV and Hepatitis C as well as a better&#xD;
      integration of those patients in other medical treatments. Switching from intravenous to oral&#xD;
      application would also reduce a lot of potential risk factors (like overdose, seizures,&#xD;
      infections, etc) and side effects associated with the injection route. Additionally it could&#xD;
      make these treatments more feasible in normal treatment settings, like existing methadone&#xD;
      services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SALOME is two-stage single centre (Vancouver) phase III, randomized, double blind controlled&#xD;
      trial involving a total of 202 individuals with chronic opioid-dependence who are not&#xD;
      benefiting currently from conventional therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objectives of this study are to determine whether 1) the closely supervised&#xD;
      provision of injectable, hydromorphone is as effective as injectable diacetylmorphine in&#xD;
      recruiting, retaining, and benefiting chronic, multi-morbid opioid-dependent individuals who&#xD;
      have not benefited sufficient from conventional treatments, and 2) if the switch to the oral&#xD;
      equivalent of hydromorphone and diacetylmorphine after six-months is as effective as the&#xD;
      injection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be evaluated looking at the benefits for the drug users and society&#xD;
      of each form of treatment including health status, treatment retention, use of additional&#xD;
      methadone, cocaine use and criminal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Treatment Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: Half of the 202 participants will be randomized to receive injectable&#xD;
      diacetylmorphine, and the other half will receive injectable hydromorphone. Stage I will&#xD;
      involve 6-months of treatment and the primary outcome will be change in illicit heroin use in&#xD;
      the prior 30 days at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II: All volunteers retained in injection treatment at the end of Stage I will be&#xD;
      eligible to enter Stage II Half the participants will then be randomized to continue&#xD;
      injection treatment exactly as in Stage I on a blinded basis while the other half will switch&#xD;
      to the oral equivalent of the same medication (diacetylmorphine or hydromorphone). Stage II&#xD;
      will involve 6-months of treatment and the primary outcome will be illicit heroin use in the&#xD;
      prior 30 days at 6 months after randomization into Stage II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals completing Stage I will be eligible for Stage II provided they are still&#xD;
      receiving injection medication at the treatment clinic. Participants will be excluded from&#xD;
      Stage II if they meet any of the exclusion criteria above which may have changed since entry&#xD;
      into Stage I. Patients who switch completely to other treatments or abstinence during Stage I&#xD;
      will not be randomized to Stage II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that at the present time DAM is not a licensed drug in Canada and HDM for substitution&#xD;
      treatment can only be provided as a drug under investigation, at the end of the second study&#xD;
      phase patients cannot longer receive these medications. Thus, study treatments will be&#xD;
      provided for 12 months followed by a period of up to 1-month during which participants still&#xD;
      being treated with DAM or HDM will be tapered and transitioned to conventional therapies such&#xD;
      as methadone. From the end of phase two and transitioning period (12 to 13 months) to the&#xD;
      next follow-up evaluation (18 month) participants might be receiving Methadone Maintenance&#xD;
      Therapy (MMT), engaged in other addiction treatment, abstinent or untreated, using illicit&#xD;
      opioids. The 6 and 12-month study visit at which the primary outcome measures will be&#xD;
      assessed will be conducted before any tapering or transition began.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have research assessments performed during the pre-randomization period, at&#xD;
      baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months following initial randomization The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure (POM) for both Stages I and II will be change in illicit heroin use defined&#xD;
      as the number of days of illicit (&quot;street&quot;) heroin in the prior 30 days of each endpoint (6&#xD;
      months-Stage I, 12 months-Stage II) by means of self report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include health status, safety of the study treatments,&#xD;
      treatment retention, use of additional methadone, cocaine use, urinalysis, criminal&#xD;
      involvement, gender, ethnicity and victimization, health economics and quality of life and an&#xD;
      evaluation of the study blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All self-reported outcomes data collection with the study participants will occur in a&#xD;
      face-to-face, fully confidential interview setting at the research centre. The interviews&#xD;
      will be conducted by trained field research interviewers, who are not part of the clinical&#xD;
      treatment team, using standardized instruments. These include: Baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      European version of the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI); EQ-5D (EuroQoL) Opioid Treatment&#xD;
      Index (OTI); SCLR-90; WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHO-DAS II); Maudsley Addiction&#xD;
      Profile (MAP); Fagerstrom; Health Utilities Index (HUI) as well as Baseline and Follow-up&#xD;
      Socio-Demographic questionnaires. The study blinding will be evaluated by a blinding&#xD;
      evaluation instrument which follows best practices and current recommendations for evaluating&#xD;
      blinding in randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
