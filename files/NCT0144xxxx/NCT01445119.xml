  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Enzastaurin, an experimental drug&#xD;
      that may prevent the growth of tumor vessels, in combination with Carboplatin, for patients&#xD;
      who have a glioma, a type of brain tumor. Carboplatin is used for treating many kinds of&#xD;
      cancers, though not recurrent gliomas. Tumor growth involves new cancer cell formation and&#xD;
      accumulation, requiring a blood supply. Research shows that brain tumor cells can produce&#xD;
      substances that stimulate new blood vessel formation. This study will look into whether the&#xD;
      combination of drugs can stop that process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 and older who have recurring gliomas, who are not pregnant or breast&#xD;
      feeding, and who do not have serious diseases may be eligible for this study. About 96&#xD;
      patients will participate for 1 year. They will have a physical examination, give blood and&#xD;
      urine samples for analysis, and undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans regarding tumor growth, and perhaps an electrocardiogram. Patients may&#xD;
      also undergo a dynamic MRI with spectroscopy or PET scan (positron emission tomography), to&#xD;
      distinguish a live tumor from a dying one. Researchers are studying patients taking a certain&#xD;
      type of antiseizure medicine and patients who are not taking it because some antiseizure&#xD;
      medicines may change the way the body handles a drug such as Enzastaurin. There will be two&#xD;
      groups of participants, with 16 to 48 each. Group A is not taking enzyme-inducing antiseizure&#xD;
      drugs, and Group B is taking such drugs. In Groups A and B are four dose levels, with 4 to12&#xD;
      patients at each level. Patients' doctors will tell them which group they belong to and how&#xD;
      much Enzastaurin and Carboplatin they will take. Treatment consists of Enzastaurin every day&#xD;
      for 5 weeks in Cycle 1 only and for 4 weeks beginning with Cycle 2 (each 4-week period as a&#xD;
      cycle). Patients take Enzastaurin within 30 minutes after a meal. History, physical, and&#xD;
      neurological examinations are repeated at the end of Cycle 1 and then every 4 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      will have a repeat head MRI or CT scan before each cycle. If they tolerate the drugs without&#xD;
      serious side effects and the tumor is not growing, they may continue with another cycle of&#xD;
      Enzastaurin, taking the tablets every day, and Carboplatin being infused on Day 8 of Cycle 1&#xD;
      and on Day 1 of each additional cycle. Routine lab tests are done regularly. Patients will&#xD;
      continue the 4-week cycles of treatment for as long as they have no serious side effects and&#xD;
      there are no signs of tumor growth. Side effects of Enzastaurin may be fatigue, constipation,&#xD;
      cough, and nausea. In men, there may be a decrease in sperm count. Carboplatin can lead to&#xD;
      low counts in blood cells and platelets, and there may also be an allergic reaction. Vomiting&#xD;
      is a likely side effect. At injection sites, there may be redness, swelling, and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may or may not have a direct benefit for participants. However, information gained&#xD;
      may help the sponsor of the study, Eli Lilly and Company, and may help patients in the future&#xD;
      who have gliomas.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enzastaurin, is a macrocyclic bisindolylmaleimide which disrupts the intrinsic&#xD;
           phosphotransferase activity of conventional and novel PKC isoforms via an interaction at&#xD;
           the ATP binding site, displays selectivity in inhibiting the isoforms. Preclinical&#xD;
           studies demonstrate potent anti-angiogenic activity of enzastaurin and studies in normal&#xD;
           volunteers and solid tumor patients demonstrate the drug is very well tolerated at doses&#xD;
           that achieve a biologically active serum concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin has shown activity as monotherapy in the treatment of recurrent malignant&#xD;
           gliomas in adults and preclinical data generated in our laboratory demonstrates additive&#xD;
           anti-glioma activity with enzastaurin. The safety profile of carboplatin and the&#xD;
           preclinical and clinical data supports its use in combination with enzastaurin in&#xD;
           patients with malignant gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To establish the maximally tolerated dose of enzastaurin in combination with carboplatin in&#xD;
      patients with refractory primary brain tumors not on any enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs&#xD;
      (nEIAED) and for patients on EIAEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients with histologically proven malignant glioma are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients will be stratified into two groups based on their anti-epileptic medications&#xD;
      (nEIAEDs = Group A, EIAED = Group B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Each cycle of therapy will consist of enzastaurin administered daily for 4 weeks&#xD;
      with no breaks between cycles. All patients will receive a 7-day lead-in treatment period&#xD;
      (Cycle 1) consisting of a loading dose of oral enzastaurin on Day 1 at 1125mg, followed by&#xD;
      enzastaurin administered once daily at 500mg for 6 additional days in order to achieve steady&#xD;
      state pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin. The first dose of carboplatin will be administered on&#xD;
      Day 8 of Cycle 1, which will consist of 35 days. Following the lead-in treatment period, the&#xD;
      first combination cycle of enzastaurin and carboplatin (Cycle 2) will commence as a 28-day&#xD;
      cycle. Within each combination cycle, enzastaurin will be orally administered at 500mg once&#xD;
      daily on Days 1 through 28 and carboplatin will be administered as an intravenous infusion&#xD;
      over approximately 30 minutes on Day 1 every 28 days. The carboplatin dose will be 3 AUC for&#xD;
      dose level one. For dose levels 2, 3, and 4, the carboplatin dose will be 4, 5 and 6 AUC,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Each cycle of therapy will consist of enzastaurin administered daily for 4 weeks&#xD;
      with no breaks between cycles. All patients will receive a 7-day lead-in treatment period&#xD;
      (Cycle 1) consisting of a loading dose of oral enzastaurin on Day 1 at 1125mg, followed by&#xD;
      enzastaurin administered once daily at 875mg for 6 additional days in order to achieve steady&#xD;
      state pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin. The first dose of carboplatin will be administered on&#xD;
      Day 8 of Cycle 1, which will consist of 35 days. Following the lead-in treatment period, the&#xD;
      first combination cycle of enzastaurin and carboplatin (Cycle 2) will commence as a 28-day&#xD;
      cycle. Within each combination cycle, enzastaurin will be orally administered once daily on&#xD;
      Days 1 through 28 at 875mg and carboplatin will be administered as an intravenous infusion&#xD;
      over approximately 30 minutes on Day 1 every 28 days. The carboplatin dose will be 3 AUC for&#xD;
      dose level one. For dose levels 2, 3, and 4, the carboplatin dose will be 4, 5 and 6 AUC,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically proven malignant glioma who have progressive disease&#xD;
             following standard treatment will be eligible for this protocol. Malignant glioma&#xD;
             include glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic&#xD;
             oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant glioma&#xD;
             NOS (not otherwise specified). Additionally, patients with primitive neuroectodermal&#xD;
             tumors (PNETs) of the central nervous system, progressive low-grade gliomas and&#xD;
             radiographically diagnosed brain stem gliomas will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan. This&#xD;
             scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dosage&#xD;
             that has been stable for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the&#xD;
             date of imaging and registration a new baseline MR/CT is required. The same type of&#xD;
             scan, that is., MRI or CT must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for&#xD;
             tumor measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be&#xD;
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. They have recovered from the effects of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             B. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for&#xD;
             eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease&#xD;
             post-operatively, a CT/ MRI should be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  at least 4 weeks post-operatively, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  within 14 days of registration, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If the 96 hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be&#xD;
             repeated. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and&#xD;
             registration, a new baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at&#xD;
             least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 4 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All patients or their previously designated LAR (Legally Authorized Representative)&#xD;
             (if the patient is deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or&#xD;
             questionably impaired in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed&#xD;
             consent is questionable) must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware&#xD;
             of the investigational nature of this study. Patients will be registered prior to&#xD;
             starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old, and with a life expectancy&#xD;
             greater than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 2 weeks from any&#xD;
             noncytotoxic investigational agent, 4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy, two weeks&#xD;
             from vincristine, 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration,&#xD;
             and 1 week for non-cytotoxic agents, for example., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide,&#xD;
             cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to the&#xD;
             definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC greater than or equal to&#xD;
             3,000/microl, ANC greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3), platelet count of greater than&#xD;
             or equal to 100,000/mm(3), and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 gm/dl), adequate&#xD;
             liver function (SGOT and bilirubin less than or equal to 2 times ULN), and adequate&#xD;
             renal function (creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 60 cc/min) before starting therapy. These tests must be&#xD;
             performed within 14 days prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may&#xD;
             be reached by transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise&#xD;
             the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to&#xD;
             measure differences of intervention effects. Males and females will be recruited with&#xD;
             no preference to gender. No exclusion to this study will be based on race.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must practice adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Prior treatment with an enzyme inducing antiepileptic drug must have been discontinued&#xD;
             at least 14 days prior to study entry for Group A patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who, in the view of the treating physician, have significant active cardiac,&#xD;
             hepatic, or renal diseases are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No concurrent use of other standard chemotherapeutics or investigative agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment with platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients known to have an allergic response to mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients known to have an active malignancy other than their malignant glioma (except&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have an active infection requiring IV antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;

             metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. QTc with Bazett's correction that is unmeasurable, or greater than or equal to 460&#xD;
             msec on screening ECG. If a patient has QTc greater than or equal to 460 msec on&#xD;
             screening ECG, a second screen ECG may be repeated at least 24 hours apart. The&#xD;
             average QTc from the 2 screening ECGs must be less than 460 msec in order for the&#xD;
             patient to be eligible for the study.&#xD;

             ventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients who have baseline EKGs suggestive of past or present cardiac ischemia will&#xD;
             not be eligible unless they have an appropriate (as defined by the P.I. of this trial)&#xD;
             negative cardiac work up (that is, echocardiogram, stress test).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients may not be on systemic anti-coagulants (that is, heparin, warfarin, small&#xD;
             heparin fragments).&#xD;
