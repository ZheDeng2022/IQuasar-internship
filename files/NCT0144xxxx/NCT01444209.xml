    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm Phase II pilot trial. Patients enrolled on the trial will undergo&#xD;
      implantation of high activity iodine-125 seeds into their pituitary adenoma. The tumor&#xD;
      response to treatment will be monitored as well as change in visual fields, associated&#xD;
      adverse effects, progression free survival and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathological or radiographic diagnosis of a pan-invasive pituitary macroadenoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pan-invasive for the purposes of the protocol will be defined as meeting each of the&#xD;
             following 2 major criteria: (1). tumor volume greater than 20 cc at enrollment, and&#xD;
             (2). suprasellar extension. In addition, a pan-invasive tumor must meet any one of the&#xD;
             following 3 minor criteria, a) unresectable tumor invasion into a cavernous sinus, b)&#xD;
             bone or bone marrow invasion into the clivus or temporal bones, or c) tumor extension&#xD;
             in any direction unlikely to be completely removed by specifically a transphenoidal&#xD;
             surgical approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who meet the two major criteria above (1 and 2) and are medically inoperable&#xD;
             for tumor resection (due to confounding co-existing medical problems) are eligible&#xD;
             without meeting any of the three minor criteria (a, b, or c).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be immediately threatened for vision loss or other significant&#xD;
             neurological impairment directly related to tumor mass effect. As such, all patients&#xD;
             enrolled would likely benefit from tumor response (shrinkage).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have visible tumor on imaging studies (MRI or CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient's Zubrod performance status must be 0-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mandatory Imaging Studies: Must be done 45 or fewer days prior to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        MRI or CT scan of the brain including the entire skull base and all areas of tumor&#xD;
        extension&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to undergo general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to undergo placement of a stereotactic head frame&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe kidney dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have contraindications to MRI, such as implanted pacemaker device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diagnosis of pituitary carcinoma&#xD;
