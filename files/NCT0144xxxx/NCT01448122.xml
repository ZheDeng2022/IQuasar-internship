  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of Avène Compact Honey in&#xD;
      preventing pigmentation induced by visible light in subjects with a phototype III or IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be exposed to a range of visible light to areas on the back to confirm study&#xD;
      eligibility. Patients showing pigmentation after 7 days on the exposed areas will be eligible&#xD;
      to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have study product applied to part of the back. The back will be&#xD;
      exposed to a range of light based on the minimum exposure inducing pigmentation previously&#xD;
      ascertained. The area where study product is applied will have a higher range of light&#xD;
      exposure than the area without the study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days later, the areas will be examined to determine the lowest exposure inducing&#xD;
      pigmentation on the sides with and without study product. The color will also be measured&#xD;
      between two identical exposures with and without the applied study product.&#xD;

      Part A At Day -7, all subjects will be exposed to a range of doses of visible light on an&#xD;
      approximately 0.90 cm diameter area on the back to ascertain their predisposition for&#xD;
      pigmentation induced by visible light. The doses will be 30, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 J cm-2.&#xD;
      At the Day 0 visit, subjects' pigmentation will be determined by investigator visual&#xD;
      assessment. Subjects with a lowest observed pigmentation at the 30 J cm-2 or the 120 J cm-2&#xD;
      dose will not continue in the study. For each subject that continues, the area where Avène&#xD;
      Compact Honey will be applied on the back will be randomized. At least 15 minutes later,&#xD;
      unprotected areas will be exposed to doses ranging from ~1/20th to 1.8 times the lowest dose&#xD;
      of visible light that induced pigmentation at Day -7. To not unnecessarily over expose&#xD;
      subjects, the first 3 will have protected areas exposed to doses ranging from ~half to 16&#xD;
      times the lowest dose of visible light that induced pigmentation at Day -7. All subjects will&#xD;
      have an additional exposure on the protected side equal to the highest dose of the&#xD;
      unprotected side for colorimetric comparison. Subjects will be examined at Day 7 (seven days&#xD;
      after visible light exposure). Pigmentation on all exposed areas will be evaluated by&#xD;
      investigator visual assessment. The colorimetric measurements on protected and unprotected&#xD;
      skin will be recorded for the equivalent exposures and for adjacent skin. The exposed area on&#xD;
      the protected side to be tested with colorimetric analysis will be hidden during the&#xD;
      investigator visual assessment. The minimum dose on the unprotected side and an area of&#xD;
      unprotected and unexposed skin will be hidden from the colorimetric evaluator to maintain the&#xD;
      blind. The lowest visible light dose inducing pigmentation will be recorded for both the&#xD;
      unprotected and protected areas. If the first three subjects are only pigmented at either the&#xD;
      16X level or not at all on the protected side, then the remaining subjects in the study will&#xD;
      be exposed at doses ranging from 0.7 to as high as 24 times the lowest dose of visible light&#xD;
      that induced pigmentation at Day -7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B At Day 0, all subjects will be exposed to a range of doses of visible light on an&#xD;
      approximately 0.90 cm diameter area on the back to ascertain their disposition for&#xD;
      pigmentation induced by visible light. The doses will be 8, 40, 80, 160, 320 and 480 J cm-2.&#xD;
      At the Day 7 visit, subjects' pigmentation will be determined by investigator visual&#xD;
      assessment. Subjects will be divided into 2 cohorts. Cohort A will contain 5 subjects of&#xD;
      phototype IV with dark skin and cohort B will contain 5 subjects with skin phototype V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C At Day -7, all subjects will be exposed to a range of doses of visible light on an&#xD;
      approximately 0.90 cm diameter area on the back to ascertain their predisposition for&#xD;
      pigmentation induced by visible light. The doses will be 8, 40, 80, 160, 320 and 480 J cm-2.&#xD;
      At the Day 0 visit, subjects' pigmentation will be determined by investigator visual&#xD;
      assessment. Subjects with a lowest observed pigmentation at the 8 J cm-2 dose will not&#xD;
      continue in the study and neither will subjects showing no pigmentation at 480 J cm-2. For&#xD;
      each subject that continues, the area where Avène Compact Honey will be applied on the back&#xD;
      will be randomized and then receive the application. At least 15 minutes later, protected&#xD;
      areas will be exposed to doses of 32, 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 1920 cm-2. Unprotected areas&#xD;
      will be exposed to the same doses as Day 0. To not unnecessarily over expose subjects, those&#xD;
      with a lowest observed pigmentation at Day 0 of 40 or 80 J cm-2 will have the maximum&#xD;
      exposure at Day 0 determined at the investigators discretion. Subjects will be examined at&#xD;
      Day 7 (seven days after visible light exposure). Pigmentation on all exposed areas will be&#xD;
      evaluated by investigator visual assessment. The lowest visible light dose inducing&#xD;
      pigmentation will be recorded for both the unprotected and protected areas. The colorimetric&#xD;
      measurements on protected and unprotected skin will be recorded for the equivalent exposures&#xD;
      and for adjacent skin. Four areas of unprotected and protected skin will be hidden from the&#xD;
      colorimetric evaluator to maintain the blind. Subjects will be divided into 2 cohorts. Cohort&#xD;
      A will contain 5 subjects of phototype IV with dark skin and cohort B will contain 5 subjects&#xD;
      with skin phototype V.&#xD;
