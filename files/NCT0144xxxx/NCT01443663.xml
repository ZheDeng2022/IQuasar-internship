  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      H5N1 is an influenza virus that has the potential to cause an influenza pandemic. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the safety and immune response to an H5N1 influenza vaccine in people who have&#xD;
      previously received one of two versions of an H5N1 vaccine or have previously received an&#xD;
      H7N3 vaccine and in people who have not previously received any live attenuated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine (LAIV).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Avian influenza viruses, including H1N1 and H5N1, are capable of causing an influenza&#xD;
      pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused approximately 10,000 deaths in the United States, and&#xD;
      H1N1 and H5N1 influenza outbreaks have been observed in countries around the world. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that people who received an H5N1 vaccine and then received another H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine years later had a greater antibody response than people who only received a single&#xD;
      vaccination. This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to an inactivated H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy adults who have previously received two doses of the H5N1 VN 04 ca vaccine&#xD;
      or the H5N1 HK 03 ca vaccine or who have previously received two doses of the H7N3 ca&#xD;
      vaccine, which is another avian influenza vaccine. The study will also enroll people who have&#xD;
      not previously received any LAIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who previously received an H5N1 or H7N3 vaccine will receive one injection of&#xD;
      the H5N1 vaccine at baseline. Participants who have not received any previous LAIV will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either one dose or two doses of the H5N1 vaccine. At a baseline&#xD;
      study visit, participants will undergo a medical history review, physical examination, blood&#xD;
      collection, vital sign measurements, and a pregnancy test for females. All participants will&#xD;
      then receive one injection of the vaccine in the upper arm. After receiving the vaccine,&#xD;
      participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes for observation and monitoring. All&#xD;
      participants will attend additional study visits at Days 3 and 7. Participants who are&#xD;
      assigned to receive one vaccination will also attend study visits at Days 28, 56, and 180.&#xD;
      Participants who are assigned to receive two vaccinations will attend study visits at Days 28&#xD;
      (at which time they will receive the second vaccination), 35, 56, 84, and 208. Select&#xD;
      baseline study procedures will occur at the follow-up study visits.&#xD;
