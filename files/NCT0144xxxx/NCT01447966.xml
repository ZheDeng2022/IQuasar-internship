  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to further investigate how well cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      psychotherapy works to reduce obsessive-compulsive symptoms in young children with&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been shown to work well&#xD;
      in youth with OCD and other anxiety disorders; however, there are only a few studies to date&#xD;
      in preschool and young children with OCD. All children will have the option to receive 12&#xD;
      twice-weekly cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy sessions that are up to 60-minutes each.&#xD;
      Randomly determined, half of all children will receive these sessions immediately following&#xD;
      the pre-assessment and the remaining half will receive them after six weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that youth receiving the study-based therapy will show more improvement&#xD;
      in OCD symptoms in six weeks in contrast to youth waiting to receive the therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for OCD includes several core therapeutic elements including&#xD;
      establishment of treatment goals, assigned homework, operant conditioning paradigms (the&#xD;
      putative mechanism for exposure-based therapies), provision of psychoeducation (e.g., the&#xD;
      link between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors), cognitive (e.g., cognitive restructuring)&#xD;
      and behavioral (e.g., exposure) coping skill implementation, and target behavior progress&#xD;
      assessments. Nevertheless, research is lacking in preschoolers with OCD and these children&#xD;
      likely require adaptations to the traditional CBT regimen. Preschoolers often have a high&#xD;
      level of family accommodation, whereby the family members become part of the rituals and&#xD;
      compulsions in attempt to ease the young child's anxiety. CBT with preschoolers will need to&#xD;
      emphasize delivering intervention within the context of the family. The flexibility of this&#xD;
      modular approach for treatment (modular therapies allow for variations in the order and&#xD;
      intensiveness of the aforementioned treatment elements, providing an individually tailored&#xD;
      treatment instead of a one-size-fits-all approach) may be optimally suited for preschoolers&#xD;
      with OCD given their wide variability in developmental level and symptom presentation. This&#xD;
      is consistent with the NIH Roadmap Initiative which calls for personalized interventions&#xD;
      matched to individual patient characteristics. Our OCD research team in the Rothman Center is&#xD;
      highly experienced in clinical research for pediatric and adult OCD. The proposed&#xD;
      investigation is a single-site controlled trial of CBT in preschool aged youth with OCD aged&#xD;
      3-8 years. We will randomly assign patients to immediate treatment or 6-week Treatment as&#xD;
      Usual (TAU) control. A manualized CBT protocol will be followed. Assessments will occur at&#xD;
      Screening, Baseline, Post-treatment and 1 and 3-month follow-ups. Ratings of patient OCD&#xD;
      symptom severity will be conducted at each time point by trained raters blinded to treatment&#xD;
      condition. Diagnosis will be established by an experienced clinician and verified by a&#xD;
      validated rating scale conducted with the child's parent(s); cases will be reviewed by study&#xD;
      investigators. Assessments will be audio-recorded and verified for integrity. Randomization&#xD;
      will be determined immediately following the baseline assessment; patients will be assigned&#xD;
      TAU or immediate treatment in a 1:1 ratio. All eligible patients will receive 12 therapy&#xD;
      sessions over 6 weeks using the evidence-based treatment protocol that incorporates E/RP and&#xD;
      parent involvement; sessions are twice weekly for 60 minutes. Dr. Lewin and other trained OCD&#xD;
      therapists under his supervision will conduct therapy sessions. All sessions are&#xD;
      audiorecorded for integrity.&#xD;

    <measure>Clinician Global Impression - Improvement Scale (Measure of patient improvement at relevent timepoints)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Post-treatment or Post-waitlist/1 and 3 Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a 7-point rating of treatment response anchored by 1 (&quot;very much improved), 4 (&quot;no change&quot;) and 7 (&quot;very much worse&quot;). Youth being rated by the IE as 1 (&quot;very much improved&quot;) and 2 (&quot;much improved&quot;) will be considered treatment responders. This measure assesses change or improvement across time and consequently is appropriate for use at multiple assessments - reflects patient improvement relative to baseline functioning. Represents change in functioning and assesses change in baseline. Appropriate for use at multiple time-points.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the TAU arm will be instructed to continue receiving their prior interventions as recommended by their providers (e.g., psychotherapy, social skills training, behavioral interventions, family participation in family therapy or a parenting class, or pharmacological interventions). Treatment changes (e.g., medication increase, starting psychotherapy in the community) are not prohibited and will be monitored. Thus, treatment will continue as it would in standard practice.</description>
