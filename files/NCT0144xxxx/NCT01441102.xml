    <textblock>
      Background: Many people with diabetes have macular edema (swelling) at the back of the eye.&#xD;
      Macular edema can cause loss of vision. Studies suggest that inflammation may be involved in&#xD;
      the swelling. A drug called dextromethorphan may help prevent the inflammation and the&#xD;
      swelling. Dextromethorphan is approved for use as a cough medicine, but it has not been&#xD;
      studied to see if it can help in diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To see if dextromethorphan can help treat diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have diabetic macular edema in at least&#xD;
      one eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study lasts 2 years, and will require at least 14 visits to the National Eye&#xD;
           Institute outpatient clinic. Study visits will be every month for the first 2 months and&#xD;
           then every other month. Each visit will take about 2 to 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, eye exam, and blood&#xD;
           tests. One eye with macular edema will be chosen as the study eye for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take dextromethorphan twice a day, about 12 hours apart, for 2 years.&#xD;
           A study diary will help keep track of the date, time, and number of pills taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have study visits once a month for the first 2 months and then every&#xD;
           other month for the rest of the study. Each study visit will involve eye exams and blood&#xD;
           and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four months after starting the study medication, participants may have laser surgery or&#xD;
           other treatments for the macular edema, if it is needed.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States. A&#xD;
      frequent manifestation of DR is diabetic macular edema (DME) for which the only proven&#xD;
      treatment is laser photocoagulation. In the retina, microglia are capable of migrating&#xD;
      through the retina to sites of inflammation to associate closely with neurons and the&#xD;
      vasculature, and are key cellular players in the mediation of processes of chronic&#xD;
      inflammation implicated in DME. For these reasons, microglia represent a promising cellular&#xD;
      target for forms of therapy that limit the deleterious inflammatory changes found in DR. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of dextromethorphan as a&#xD;
      microglia inhibitor in participants with DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria include presence of diabetic retinopathy with retinal thickening due to&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema within 3000 μm of the center of the macula as measured by optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT), and visual acuity better than 20/200 in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five participants will be initially enrolled in this unmasked pilot study. However, up to an&#xD;
      additional three participants may be enrolled to account for participants who withdraw from&#xD;
      the study prior to receipt of six months of study treatment. Participants will take an oral&#xD;
      dose of 60 mg of dextromethorphan twice daily for 24 months. During each visit, participants&#xD;
      will have their visual acuity measured and will undergo OCT testing to measure retinal&#xD;
      thickness. Beginning at the Month 4 visit, participants will be assessed for worsening&#xD;
      disease defined as loss of ≥ 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters of&#xD;
      vision compared to baseline or a ≥ 50% increase in total central retinal thickness as&#xD;
      measured by OCT. Individual participants deemed to have worsening disease may stay on the&#xD;
      study and continue to receive study medication, but will be allowed to receive focal laser&#xD;
      therapy for any amenable leaking microaneurysms and/or anti-vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) intravitreal injections (such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab) at the discretion&#xD;
      of the treating physician. Additionally, beginning at the Month 6 visit, participants will be&#xD;
      eligible for treatment, with either focal laser or anti-VEGF injections if they have&#xD;
      center-involving macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the change in retinal thickness measured by OCT at 6 months compared&#xD;
      to baseline. Secondary outcomes include the change in retinal thickness as measured by OCT at&#xD;
      12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at&#xD;
      6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, change in mean macular sensitivity as measured&#xD;
      by microperimetry at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, as well as changes in&#xD;
      fluid leakage in the macula as demonstrated by fluorescein angiography at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months compared to baseline. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of systemic and&#xD;
      ocular toxicities, and adverse events.&#xD;

               -  Clinical exam and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface disease (e.g., a&#xD;
                  taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the primary cause of the&#xD;
                  macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual&#xD;
             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,&#xD;
             pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, non-retinal condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetic retinopathy (DR) that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during&#xD;
             the course of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory&#xD;
             disease, neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be&#xD;
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing&#xD;
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within four months prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of prior pars plana vitrectomy within six months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any&#xD;
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within three months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of Yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) capsulotomy performed within two months&#xD;
             prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of treatment within three months prior to enrollment with any drug that has&#xD;
             not received regulatory approval at the time of study entry, such as intravitreal or&#xD;
             periocular steroids or intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Choice of Study Eye in Cases of Bilateral Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        If both eyes of a participant meet the criteria described above, the following will be used&#xD;
        to determine the study eye:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. If one eye is treatment-naïve and the other is not, the treatment-naïve eye will be&#xD;
             chosen as the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If both eyes are treatment-naïve, the eye with the better visual acuity will be chosen&#xD;
             as the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If both eyes are treatment-naïve and are equivalent, the choice of study eye will be&#xD;
             determined at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If both eyes have been previously treated, the choice of study eye will be determined&#xD;
             at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the participant.&#xD;

          <title>Percentage Change in Retinal Thickness in the Study Eye at 18 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
          <description>Retinal thickness was assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), a non-invasive imaging technique that uses long-wavelength light to capture micrometer-resolution cross-sectional images from biological tissue. Changes in OCT will be calculated using the ETDRS grid. Attention will be directed to changes in retinal thickness as measured by OCT in each of the 9 subfields of the grid.</description>

          <title>Number of Study Eyes Demonstrating a Decrease in the Area of Late Leakage, as Measured by Fluorescein Angiography (FA), at 12 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
          <description>Fluorescein angiography (FA) images were obtained via a standard digital imaging system (OIS, Sacramento, CA) at baseline and at Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, and Month 24. Three retinal specialists independently graded the area of late fluorescein leakage (at approximately 10 minutes) using a region-of-interest tool in an image analysis software package (NIH ImageJ, Bethesda, MD).</description>
