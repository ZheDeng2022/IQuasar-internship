      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an&#xD;
      investigational pneumococcal vaccine in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of an investigational pneumococcal vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of an investigational Pneumococcal vaccine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An initial cohort of 10 participants will receive a single dose of investigational&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccine. After safety assessment of this cohort during a 24-hour in-unit&#xD;
      observation period, additional cohorts will receive two injections of the study vaccine 30&#xD;
      days apart, at three dose levels, in ascending doses by cohort, pending safety review at each&#xD;
      dose level. All participants will be monitored for safety for 30 days after each vaccination.&#xD;
