  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with chronic illness often are at risk for developing neurobehavioral problems&#xD;
           due to effects of the disease or associated treatments. These problems may include&#xD;
           cognitive impairments involving problem-solving, remembering things, paying attention,&#xD;
           and understanding and using language, or emotional functioning or quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The National Cancer Institute Medical Illness Counseling Center Neuropsychology Group&#xD;
           has collected data from neurobehavioral evaluations of infants, children, adolescents&#xD;
           and adults with chronic illnesses enrolled in NIH protocols since 1987 and continues to&#xD;
           collect data from patients enrolled in current protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data from these evaluations, along with demographic and medical information are&#xD;
           stored in an NIH computer database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigating the neurobehavioral functioning of patients with chronic illness is&#xD;
           important for identifying and monitoring the effects of the disease and treatments over&#xD;
           time, determining possible at-risk subgroups, evaluating response to therapy, and&#xD;
           recommending educational and rehabilitative interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To learn about how certain illnesses or treatments may affect a person s cognitive&#xD;
      abilities, emotional functioning and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients currently enrolled in NIH studies who are having neuropsychological testing or&#xD;
           completing quality-of-life questionnaires as part of that study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data obtained from infants, children, adolescents, and adults administered&#xD;
           neurobehavioral assessments as part of a past or future NIH protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study does not involve any extra tests or questionnaires; it uses information&#xD;
           collected from evaluations that subjects have already completed or will complete as part&#xD;
           of other NIH studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information about participating patients that may help elucidate how cognitive&#xD;
           abilities, emotional functioning, and quality of life are affected in people with&#xD;
           chronic illness may be collected and stored.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with chronic illness often are at risk for developing neurobehavioral impairments&#xD;
      due to effects of the disease and/or associated treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Neurobehavioral Group has been collecting neurobehavioral&#xD;
      data obtained from the longitudinal psychometric testing of infants, children, adolescents,&#xD;
      and adults with various chronic illnesses enrolled on IRB-approved protocols at the NIH since&#xD;
      the 1980 s, many of which are now closed. In addition, we continue to collect neurobehavioral&#xD;
      data obtained from assessments of individuals enrolled on current IRB-approved protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurobehavioral test data from these evaluations, as well as demographic information,&#xD;
      medical values, neurologic findings, and neuroimaging abnormalities, are stored in the&#xD;
      neuropsychological database currently located on the secure NIH mainframe computer system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating the neurobehavioral functioning of children with chronic illness is important&#xD;
      for identifying and monitoring the effects of the disease and treatments over time,&#xD;
      determining possible at-risk subgroups, evaluating response to therapy, and recommending&#xD;
      educational and rehabilitative interventions. In addition, the data may be used to compare&#xD;
      various aspects of neurobehavioral functioning among different illness groups healthy&#xD;
      controls, and validate novel methodologies to better assess selected domains of functioning,&#xD;
      such as a pediatric quality of life (QOL) scale for children with chronic illnesses with CNS&#xD;
      involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the neurobehavioral functioning of individuals with chronic illness based on the&#xD;
      analysis of stored data collected from IRB-approved protocols, consisting of retrospective&#xD;
      data collected on protocols that are now closed and data collected prospectively on current&#xD;
      and future protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from infants, children, adolescents, and adults administered neurobehavioral&#xD;
      assessments as part of a past, current, or future IRB-approved protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data will be collected specifically for this protocol. Retrospective data previously&#xD;
      collected from individuals receiving neurobehavioral assessments as part of past IRB-approved&#xD;
      protocols or prospective data that already will be collected as specified in current or&#xD;
      future IRB-approved protocols and stored in the secure NCI Neurobehavioral database will be&#xD;
      used for data analysis as outlined in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional or longitudinal data will be selected from the database for statistical&#xD;
      analysis based on the objective being studied. Since different objectives may be studied&#xD;
      using various types of data, a variety of statistical analyses will be conducted to examine&#xD;
      the stored data depending on the objective being studied.&#xD;
