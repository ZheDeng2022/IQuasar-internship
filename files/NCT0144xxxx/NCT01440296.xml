  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN) is a pan-canadian imaging network funded&#xD;
      through grants from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Canadian Institutes&#xD;
      of Health Research (CIHR). This unique research network is focused on the pathobiology of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease as it pertains to the coronary and carotid circulations. The CAIN&#xD;
      research program involves the creation of a unique national network focused on in vivo&#xD;
      imaging of vessel wall disease, combined with imaging of occult end-organ disease as well as&#xD;
      the acquisition of clinical and pathological end points. CAIN enables unprecedented&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical studies of patients with atherosclerotic disease in&#xD;
      coronary or carotid vascular beds, and has established an international resource for studying&#xD;
      the natural history, progression, regression and novel therapeutic interventions aimed at&#xD;
      atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is to accurately characterise carotid plaque morphology in&#xD;
      non-surgical patients with mild to severe (30-95%) carotid disease. The investigators will&#xD;
      also assess evidence of ischaemic brain disease. Patients will undergo MRI scanning of the&#xD;
      brain and carotid and US scanning of the carotid at baseline and thereafter at 1 and 2 years&#xD;
      or sooner if presenting clinically in order to monitor the natural history of carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and its effect on end-organ brain disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will consent to baseline scanning and follow up at 1 and 2 years, and databasing of&#xD;
      clinical and imaging data. After each imaging session images will be processed, stored&#xD;
      locally and also sent to a central repository. 500 patients will be recruited over a 2 year&#xD;
      period in anticipation of study completion within 4 years.&#xD;
