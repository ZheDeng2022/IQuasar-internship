    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a drug called sirolimus is safe to give to people with&#xD;
      geographic atrophy (GA) and if it can help preserve vision in patients. GA is an advanced&#xD;
      form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD affects the macula, the central part&#xD;
      of the retina at the back of the eye needed for sharp, clear vision. There are two types of&#xD;
      AMD, wet and dry. In dry AMD, cells in the macula die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GA may be partially caused by inflammation. Sirolimus helps prevent inflammation and&#xD;
      therefore may help people with GA. Researchers want to see whether sirolimus can help prevent&#xD;
      vision loss in people with GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People at least 56 years of age who have GA related to AMD in both eyes may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study requires at least 8 visits to the National Eye Institute over 1 year. Study visits&#xD;
      will be every 2 months for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests, and eye exams. One eye will be selected as the study eye to&#xD;
           receive the sirolimus injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a sirolimus injection into the study eye at the first visit and&#xD;
           every 2 months thereafter unless contraindicated. There will be a follow-up eye exam 1&#xD;
           month after the first injection.&#xD;

      Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people&#xD;
      over age 65 in the United States, is a heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal&#xD;
      degeneration occurs predominantly in the macula in the context of aging and leads to&#xD;
      impairment of central visual acuity. AMD occurs in two general forms, one of which involves&#xD;
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with subsequent formation of a disciform scar. This is&#xD;
      often referred to as the neovascular or wet form. A second form, the subject of this study,&#xD;
      is termed dry or atrophic macular degeneration and involves a constellation of clinical&#xD;
      features that can include drusen, pigment clumping and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)&#xD;
      dropout and geographic atrophy (GA). GA can begin as a thinning of the RPE with involvement&#xD;
      of the underlying choriocapillaris and subsequently lead to an atrophic change in the macula.&#xD;
      Inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of GA. Sirolimus inhibits the production,&#xD;
      signaling and activity of many inflammatory factors relevant to the development of GA.&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the safety and possible efficacy of&#xD;
      serial sirolimus intravitreal injections in participants with bilateral GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Six participants with bilateral GA associated with AMD will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Initially, 10 participants with bilateral GA associated with AMD were to be enrolled.&#xD;
      However, only six will be enrolled, as sirolimus intravitreal injections will no longer be&#xD;
      administered to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In this single-center, prospective, controlled, unmasked, Phase I/II study, one eye&#xD;
      of eligible participants was initially randomized to investigational product (intravitreal&#xD;
      sirolimus) while the fellow eye was observed. Participants initially received a 20 μL (440&#xD;
      μg) intravitreal injection sirolimus in the study eye at baseline and every two months&#xD;
      thereafter unless contraindicated. As of September 2012, sirolimus intravitreal injections&#xD;
      were no longer administered to participants. Both the study and fellow eyes will be observed&#xD;
      every two months until the study terminates. The study will not terminate until all&#xD;
      participants have been followed through Month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the rate of change in area of GA based on masked&#xD;
      grading by an external Reading Center of fundus photographs in the study eye and fellow eye&#xD;
      at Month 12 compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes will include changes in best-corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity (BCVA), changes in drusen area based on masked digital grading of fundus&#xD;
      photography, absolute and relative changes in area of GA measured using fundus photography&#xD;
      and autofluorescence imaging, and development of exudative AMD measured using optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT). Safety outcomes will include the number and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs). Ocular safety outcomes will be indicated by changes in visual acuity, ocular&#xD;
      surface changes, intraocular inflammation and any other ocular changes not consistent with&#xD;
      the natural progression of GA.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 56 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must understand and sign the protocol's informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have at least ½ disc area (approximately 1 mm^2) of GA compatible with AMD&#xD;
             present in each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
             GA is defined as one or more well-defined and often circular patches of partial or&#xD;
             complete depigmentation of the RPE, typically with exposure of underlying choroidal&#xD;
             blood vessels. Even if much of the RPE appears to be preserved and large choroidal&#xD;
             vessels are not visible, a round patch of RPE partial depigmentation may be classified&#xD;
             as early GA. The GA in each eye must be able to be photographed in their entirety, and&#xD;
             it must not be contiguous with any areas of peripapillary atrophy, which can&#xD;
             complicate area measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must have at least one large druse (greater than or equal to 125 μm) in each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must not have any evidence or history of exudative disease related to AMD in either&#xD;
             eye as determined by a recent fluorescein angiogram performed within 4 months of study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have a steady fixation in both eyes in the foveal or parafoveal area and media&#xD;
             clear enough for good quality photographs&#xD;

             contraception throughout the course of the study and four months after their last&#xD;
             study injection. Acceptable methods of contraception include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal&#xD;
                  patch or vaginal ring),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine device,&#xD;

        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20. One eye (the study eye) was initially randomized to receive intravitreal sirolimus and the fellow eye was observed as the control.</description>

          <title>Changes in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Fellow Eye at 12 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
          <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20. One eye (the study eye) was initially randomized to receive intravitreal sirolimus and the fellow eye was observed as the control.</description>
          <population>The analysis was intention-to-treat (ITT). Although 6 participants were enrolled, only 5 were followed for 12 months.</population>

        <description>Geographic atrophy (GA) is the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina. The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The area of GA was determined using planimetry for color stereoscopic fundus images by masked graders at the Doheny Image Reading Center (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).&#xD;
This outcome measure was calculated by subtracting the GA value for the study eye at baseline from the GA value for the study eye at Month 12.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Area of GA, as Measured by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) Imaging Using a Modified Fundus Camera (mFC), in the Study Eye at 12 Months Compared to Baseline.</title>
        <description>Geographic atrophy (GA) is the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina. The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The area of GA was determined using planimetry for FAF images obtained with a mFC by masked graders at the Doheny Image Reading Center (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).&#xD;
This outcome measure was calculated by subtracting the GA value for the study eye at baseline from the GA value for the study eye at Month 12.</description>

        <title>Relative Change in Area of GA, as Measured by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) Imaging Using a Modified Fundus Camera (mFC), in the Study Eye at 12 Months Compared to Baseline.</title>
        <description>Geographic atrophy (GA) is the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina. The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The area of GA was determined using planimetry for FAF images obtained with a mFC by masked graders at the Doheny Image Reading Center (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).&#xD;
This outcome measure was calculated by dividing the absolute change in the total area of GA in the study eye at 12 months by the baseline value.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was intention-to-treat (ITT). Although 6 participants were enrolled, only 5 were followed for 12 months.</population>
