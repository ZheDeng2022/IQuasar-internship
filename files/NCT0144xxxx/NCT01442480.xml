  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to ambient levels of air pollution increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Advanced age is among the factors associated with susceptibility to the adverse effects of&#xD;
      air pollution. Dietary fatty acid supplementation has been shown to decrease cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk through multiple mechanisms. This study evaluated the efficacy of supplementation with&#xD;
      marine fish oil or olive oil in protecting against cardiovascular effects induced by&#xD;
      controlled exposure of middle-aged healthy volunteers to concentrated ambient air pollution&#xD;
      particles. Subjects (ages 50 to72 years), were randomly assigned to receive 3 g/d of fish oil&#xD;
      (1.2 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 0.82 g docosahexaenoic acid), or olive oil (3g/d) for 28 d.&#xD;
      Subjects were then exposed to concentrated ambient air pollution particles or filtered air&#xD;
      for 2 hr on sequential days. Heart rate variability (HRV), plasma lipids, coagulation&#xD;
      markers, and endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery&#xD;
      (FMD) were assessed pre-, immediately post-, and 20 hr post-exposure.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Normal resting electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oxygen saturation greater than 94% at the time of physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of angina, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and ischemic&#xD;
             myocardial infarction or coronary bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 150 systolic, &gt; 90 diastolic).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cancer (possible exception for&#xD;
             history of nonmelanoma skin cancer), rheumatologic diseases, immunodeficiency state,&#xD;
             significant chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
             or severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of migraine headache.&#xD;
