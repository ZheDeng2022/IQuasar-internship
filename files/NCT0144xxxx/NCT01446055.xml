  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) to treat patients with chronic limb&#xD;
      ischemia has been proved safe and effective. However, processing bone marrow by Ficoll&#xD;
      density gradient centrifugation is not only time consuming but also expensive. Manually&#xD;
      processing of bone marrow also results in large variation in therapeutic cell quantity and&#xD;
      quality which directly leads deviation of safety and efficacy of the cell therapy. This study&#xD;
      is aiming to compare an automated bone marrow processing system with a conventional manual&#xD;
      method in term of safety and efficacy.&#xD;

      Using autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) to treat patients with chronic limb&#xD;
      ischemia has been proved safe and effective. However, processing bone marrow by Ficoll&#xD;
      density gradient centrifugation is not only time consuming but also expensive. Manually&#xD;
      processing of bone marrow also results in large variation in therapeutic cell quantity and&#xD;
      quality which directly lead deviation of safety and efficacy of the cell therapy. This study&#xD;
      is aiming to compare an automated bone marrow processing system with a conventional manual&#xD;
      method in term of safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ResQ system developed by Thermogenesis in USA provides an automatic cell processing system&#xD;
      for bone marrow. The system takes less than 30 minutes to concentrate the therapeutic&#xD;
      mononuclear cells including stem cells in a closed system without adding any additive such as&#xD;
      separation reagent (Ficoll). The system also be able to be operated at point of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to prove no inferior of safety and efficacy of bone marrow cells&#xD;
      processed by ResQ to those of cells using conventional manual method. The conventional manual&#xD;
      method is involved Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and cell washing stems in an open&#xD;
      system. Each of test arms (ResQ vs manual method) consists of 25 patients. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is safety which is measured by cell treatment-related adverse events. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include resting ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI)and toe brachial pressure index&#xD;
      (TBI) , transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), claudication distance, rest pain scale&#xD;
      evaluation, collateral vessel scale, etc.&#xD;
