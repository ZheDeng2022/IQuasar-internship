  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is a drug that is normally used to treat people with diabetes. New research has&#xD;
      discovered that metformin may also kill cancer stem cells. These cancer stem cells make up&#xD;
      only a small portion of a cancer, but may be responsible for resistance to chemotherapy or&#xD;
      for causing recurrence of the cancer. Future studies are envisioned to that test the efficacy&#xD;
      of administering metformin with chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety of administering metformin in combination with chemotherapy. Since chemotherapy and&#xD;
      cancer itself both cause adverse events by themselves, this study is designed to have a&#xD;
      run-in stage as well as a subsequent randomization to metformin or no metformin. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will compare the rate of dose-limiting toxicities between these two arms. After a&#xD;
      period of 3 weeks for the primary endpoint comparison, all patients will receive metformin.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically documented cancer; diagnosis of hepatocellular&#xD;
             carcinoma may be made by characteristic radiographic and/or AFP findings 33;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intended treatment with, or currently being treated by anti-cancer chemotherapy in the&#xD;
             adjuvant or advanced setting;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 to 79;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine levels &lt;1.5 mg/dL [males], &lt;1.4 mg/dL&#xD;
             [females]). If a subject does not meet these criteria, but does have an estimated&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min using the Cockroft-Gault calculation, they will be&#xD;
             allowed. The Cockroft-Gault formula is CrCl = (140-age) x weight(kg)÷(Cr x72), where&#xD;
             CrCl = estimated creatinine clearance and Cr is plasma creatinine in mg/dL;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤&#xD;
             1.5 x ULN, and alkaline phosphatase levels ≤ 2.5 x ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must anticipate receiving at least 3 cycles (or treatment periods of at least 3-weeks)&#xD;
             of chemotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of metformin (within 1 week of start of chemotherapy regimen to be&#xD;
             assessed);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes are allowed, however they will be excluded if there is&#xD;
             intent to use metformin for treatment of diabetes during the course of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing chemotherapy treatment concurrent with radiation therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant setting prior to potentially curative&#xD;
             surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal disease or renal dysfunction not meeting inclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant medical conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, septicemia, acute or chronic metabolic acidosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of, or states associated with, lactic acidosis such as shock or pulmonary&#xD;
             insufficiency, alcoholism (acute or chronic), conditions associated with hypoxemia and&#xD;
             pancreatitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe dehydration;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic treatment, or unstable or acute&#xD;
             congestive heart failure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to metformin hydrochloride;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women (serum pregnancy test will be performed for all women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements and/or obscure results&#xD;
