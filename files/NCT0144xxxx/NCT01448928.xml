      This study is a regulatory post marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local&#xD;
      prospective and observational study of patients who have received Zevalin for relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory, CD20+, low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Mantle cell lymphoma. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of using Zevalin in clinical&#xD;
      practice. This study is also all case investigation of which the enrollment period is five&#xD;
      years, and all patients who received Zevalin will be recruited and followed 13 weeks after&#xD;
      the administration.&#xD;
