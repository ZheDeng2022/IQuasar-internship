  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority, prospective study of the relationship between the 24-hour urine&#xD;
      protein collection and spot protein:creatinine ratio in the diagnosis of preeclampsia&#xD;
      involving a sample of 18-45 year-old pregnant women attending the new Obstetrics orientation.&#xD;
      The investigators will follow all participants who consent to be part of this study&#xD;
      throughout their entire pregnancy. Those who get evaluated for preeclampsia will then have a&#xD;
      P:C ratio anytime their Primary Obstetrics provider orders a standard of care 24-hour urine&#xD;
      collection (standard of care). Those participants who are not evaluated for preeclampsia&#xD;
      during their pregnancy will be dropped from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants evaluated for preeclampsia during the prenatal period will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      random spot clean-catch urine sample at intervals of approximately 0 and 24 hours following&#xD;
      the initiation of the 24-hour urine collection. The patient's demographic and clinical data,&#xD;
      as well as the spot protein:creatinine ratio and 24-hour urine protein will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed at the conclusion of the study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit a total of 12,000 pregnant female subjects ages 18-45 that&#xD;
      have a confirmed positive pregnancy test and whom are attending the new Obstetrics&#xD;
      Orientation class. Subjects will be recruited from the MOFH and Eglin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain signed Informed Consent document and HIPAA Authorization (research-driven)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review Medical History and record patients age, gestational age, parity and presence of&#xD;
           high-risk antepartum conditions (i.e. chronic hypertension, gestational diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus-all classes, and pre-existing renal disease) (standard of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who consent to be part of this study will be followed throughout their&#xD;
      entire pregnancy (birth of child). Those who are identified by their primary obstetrics&#xD;
      provider as potentially having preeclampsia will then have a P:C Ratio anytime their Primary&#xD;
      Obstetrics provider orders a standard of care 24-hour urine collection (see Antepartum Visit&#xD;
      Schedule Below). Those participants who are not evaluated for preeclampsia during their&#xD;
      pregnancy will be dropped from the study at the end of their pregnancy (birth of child).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antepartum Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect 24-hour protein urine (standard of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect spot random urine protein:creatinine ratio (at 0 and 24 hours) (research-driven)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a urinalysis to identify subjects that may have a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)&#xD;
           (if participant tests positive for a UTI, they will be excluded from this data point,&#xD;
           however, they will continue in the study and data will be collected from their&#xD;
           subsequent urine collections given that the UTI is no longer present) (research-driven)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the new Obstetrics Orientation class so that baseline&#xD;
      data may be used to compare a participant's &quot;non-pregnant&quot; physiological state to later&#xD;
      gestations (i.e. before and during the time they develop preeclampsia). Previous studies do&#xD;
      not directly compare baseline and later gestational data that would show whether the&#xD;
      correlation between the P:C ratio and 24 hour urine protein changes or remains unchanged.&#xD;
      This data would be more clinically relevant when determining presence of preeclampsia with&#xD;
      the understanding that the spot protein:creatinine ratio may or may not retain a strong&#xD;
      correlation to the 24 hour urine protein during all gestational ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be continually followed by their Primary Obstetric provider, who will&#xD;
      provide standard of care. This includes notifying patients of worsening conditions of&#xD;
      preeclampsia, laboratory results, all treatment for preeclampsia, and all teaching involved&#xD;
      in the diagnosis and treatment of preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of urine collected for the standard of care 24-hour urine is approximately 2,000&#xD;
      milliliters (mls) of urine. The amount needed in order to process a P:C Ratio is&#xD;
      approximately 10mls at 0 hours and 24 hours (total of 20mls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will follow the standard procedures for a 24-hour urine collection. During the&#xD;
      first urination (0 hours) and the last urination (24 hours) participants will pour off 50 mls&#xD;
      into a urine cup&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site's Laboratory will be responsible for analyzing urine samples obtained at their site&#xD;
      for this study. Samples will be labeled as they would for standard laboratory draws. All&#xD;
      Laboratories are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified and will use&#xD;
      these procedures when processing Laboratory specimens mentioned in this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS COMPLETING THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject's participation in this study is completed at the conclusion of their pregnancy.&#xD;
      Subjects will be told the results of their protein urine and spot random urine&#xD;
      protein:creatinine ratio by their primary obstetrics provider after each study is completed.&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, each Associate Investigator will send the de-identified data to&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator via an encrypted email for analysis. Associate Investigators are&#xD;
      also responsible for sending the Principal Investigator all the Informed Consent and HIPAA&#xD;
      Authorization documents via encrypted email for retention the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time during the study, the subject decides to withdraw from the study, they may do&#xD;
      so with no further testing required, beyond that required by standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEVIATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations that do not increase the risks to subjects like those listed in the &quot;risks&quot;&#xD;
      section of this protocol are to be reported to the Principal Investigator of this study the&#xD;
      1st workday of every month via the &quot;WHMC Tracking Log for Problems Not Requiring Immediate&#xD;
      Reporting&quot;. This is done to ensure ongoing monitoring and identification of trends that may&#xD;
      arise.&#xD;
