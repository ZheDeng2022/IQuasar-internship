  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is associated with a high risk of relapse and hospitalisation and many&#xD;
      patients do not recover to previous psychosocial function. Major reasons for poor outcome are&#xD;
      delayed intervention for prodromal depressive and manic episodes as well as decreased&#xD;
      adherence with treatment. Recently, electronic self monitoring of affective symptoms using&#xD;
      cell phones to prompt patients to respond to weekly text messages has been suggested as an&#xD;
      easy and cheap way to identify early signs of affective episodes. Nevertheless, so far the&#xD;
      electronic devises has been rather simple not including a bi-directional feed back loop&#xD;
      between patients and providers and without electronic data on &quot;objective&quot; measures of the&#xD;
      affective psychopathology. As part of an ongoing EU research program a software program for&#xD;
      online electronic self-monitoring using a cell phone is being developed including an&#xD;
      interactive feed back loop between patients, relatives and clinicians. Electronic&#xD;
      self-monitoring includes subjective items such as mood, irritability, sleep duration,&#xD;
      activity, alcohol consumption, medication intake and objective items of speech duration (on&#xD;
      the cell phone), social activity (numbers of calls and SMS'es at the cell phone) and physical&#xD;
      activity (acceleration of the cell phone). The present PhD. study will in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled single blind trial including 60 patients with bipolar disorder allocated to using&#xD;
      the active cell phone program (intervention group) or to using a cell phone to usual&#xD;
      communication (control group) during a 6 months study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the cell phone self-monitoring system is proved effective in preventing mood symptoms and&#xD;
      improving psychosocial functioning,quality of life etc. in the present study there might be&#xD;
      basis for extending the use of the system to treatment of patients with bipolar disorder in&#xD;
      clinical practice in general.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to investigate in a randomised controlled single blind trial&#xD;
      whether the use of an online monitoring system in patients suffering from bipolar disorder&#xD;
      reduces symptoms of affective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the clinical assessment in the Mood Disorder clinic, a paper version with daily&#xD;
      monitoring of subjective items has been in use for four years. Based on an interactive&#xD;
      process with patients suffering from bipolar disorder, the literature as well as clinical&#xD;
      experience of the research and clinical group involved in the study we have chosen to monitor&#xD;
      the following subjective items: mood, activity, irritability, sleep duration, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, medication intake. Patients are prompted to evaluate these items every evening.&#xD;
      In the same way, the following objective items will be collected on all cell phones used in&#xD;
      the study: speech duration (minutes speech per 24 hours on the cell phone), social activity&#xD;
      (numbers of calls and SMS'es per 24 hours at the cell phone and acceleration of the cell&#xD;
      phone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personal homepage for each patient is set op on a server so the patient can connect to the&#xD;
      homepage with his cell phone using secure codes. By giving informed consent to participate in&#xD;
      the MONARCA trial patients allow clinicians to connect to the homepage. It is optionally&#xD;
      whether patients allow relatives (or others) to get access to the homepage. Online programs&#xD;
      present the monitored subjective items as well as speech duration and number of calls and&#xD;
      SMS's graphically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known whether using a cell phone for electronic monitoring of bipolar disorder the&#xD;
      way described above improve outcome compared to using a cell phone to usual communication. A&#xD;
      total of 60 patients with bipolar disorder are randomised (1:1) to using the active cell&#xD;
      phone program (intervention group) or to using a cell phone to usual communication (control&#xD;
      group). All randomised patients will receive a cell phone (Android) for use during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification is done for age (18-30 versus 30-60 years) and prior hospitalisations (none&#xD;
      versus hospitalisation). Study period: 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments are done by the PhD.-student who is not involved in the treatment of the&#xD;
      randomised patients and is blinded versus having received the intervention system or the&#xD;
      control system. All participants in the study will be examined every month by the PhD student&#xD;
      for the entire study period. The following will be done: The bipolar diagnosis is confirmed&#xD;
      by a SCAN interview. Further the following ratings/questionnaires are performed every month&#xD;
      for 6 months: Hamilton Depression Scale-17 items (HAMD-17), the Young Mania Rating Scale&#xD;
      (YMRS), psychosocial functioning (FAST), Cohen's Perceived stress scale, quality of life&#xD;
      (WHOQOL), coping strategies (CISS), Altman Self-rating mania scale, Major Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (MDI). Assessment of cognitive function (SCIP and Massachusetts General Hospital&#xD;
      Questionnaire), awakening salivary cortisol, urinary oxidative stress, adherence to&#xD;
      medication (plasma values of medication) and plasma BDNF are measured at start, half way and&#xD;
      end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessment is done single blind, i.e., the assessor (researcher) does not know whether&#xD;
      the patient is randomized to the intervention group or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes are differences between intervention and control group in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: depressive and manic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: psychosocial functioning, quality of life, perceived stress, coping&#xD;
           strategies,adherence to medication, cognitive function, awakening salivary cortisol,&#xD;
           urinary oxidative stress, plasma BDNF, physical activity, self-rated depressive and&#xD;
           manic symptoms&#xD;
