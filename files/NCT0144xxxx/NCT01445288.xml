    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the effects of radiation given to children who have tumors of the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS). Researchers want to learn more about changes in the quality of&#xD;
      life that patients may experience as a result of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 21 and younger who have a primary CNS tumor and who have not received radiation&#xD;
      previously may be eligible for this study. They will have a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination. Collection of blood (about 2-1/2 tablespoons) and urine will be done, as well as&#xD;
      a pregnancy test. Patients will complete neuropsychological tests, which provide information&#xD;
      about their changes in functioning over time. An expert in psychology will give a number of&#xD;
      tests, and the patient's parents or guardian will be asked to complete a questionnaire about&#xD;
      the patient's behavior. Also, patients will be given a quality of life questionnaire to&#xD;
      complete and vision and hearing tests. The radiation itself is prescribed by patients'&#xD;
      doctors and is not part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will give researchers information about the tumor and brain,&#xD;
      through several scanning sequences . MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
      obtain images of body organs and tissues. Patients will lie on a table that slides into the&#xD;
      enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will need to lie still, and medication may be given to&#xD;
      help them to do that. They may be in the scanner for up to 2 hours. As the scanner takes&#xD;
      pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds, and they will wear earplugs to&#xD;
      reduce the noise. A contrast agent will be administered, to allow images be seen more&#xD;
      clearly. Blood and urine tests will be conducted after the first dose of radiation. MRI scans&#xD;
      will be done 2 weeks after patients finish radiation therapy and again at 6 to 8 weeks, 6&#xD;
      months, 12 months, and yearly. Also at those follow-up periods, patients will undergo similar&#xD;
      procedures as previously, including blood and urine tests and neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
      Patients can remain in this study for 5 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory study will be performed in pediatric patients with CNS tumors who are&#xD;
      undergoing radiation therapy to investigate pathophysiologic effects of radiation on the CNS.&#xD;
      The study includes the analysis of blood, urine, and CSF (if available) to measure biological&#xD;
      markers involved with angiogenesis, blood: brain barrier integrity, and neurotoxicity. It&#xD;
      also entails comprehensive MR imaging techniques and neuropsychological testing in an effort&#xD;
      to correlate changes with biomarker measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To detect changes in angiogenesis related to radiation of the CNS by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measurement of VEGF, bFGF, thrombospondin, TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-8, and MMP in blood&#xD;
                and urine specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MR perfusion and DEMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe changes in blood:brain barrier permeability associated with radiation of the&#xD;
           CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize neurotoxicity by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measuring biomarkers associated with neurotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Documenting changes in neurobehavioral functioning through longitudinal&#xD;
                comprehensive assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describing changes in quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessing changes in memory&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Defining changes in ophthalmologic studies associated with radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Detecting changes in audiometry associated with radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a primary CNS tumor for which radiation therapy is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be less than or equal to 21 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior/Concurrent: Patients will be eligible if they have not received prior radiation.&#xD;
           Patients who have undergone surgery or received chemotherapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance Status: Patients will be eligible regardless of performance score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This minimally invasive study is designed to explore various biologic effects of radiation on&#xD;
      the pediatric CNS in an attempt to 1) obtain information on the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      radiation-induced damage, 2) explore the association of neuropsychological deficits with&#xD;
      biologic markers and neuroimaging abnormalities, 3) document changes in neurobehavioral&#xD;
      functioning through longitudinal comprehensive neuropsychological assessments with comparison&#xD;
      of various radiation therapy techniques, 4) describe changes in quality of life in pediatric&#xD;
      patients who have received radiation therapy, and 5) attempt to identify children at&#xD;
      increased risk of radiation-induced neurotoxicity.&#xD;
