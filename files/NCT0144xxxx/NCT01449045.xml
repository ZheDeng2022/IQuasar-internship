  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a major public health problem. 250 million cases annually leads to approximately 1&#xD;
      million deaths. Over 80 per cent of these deaths occur among African children under age five.&#xD;
      The main interventions covered treatment with Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACT), long&#xD;
      lasting bednets distribution and Rapid Diagnosis Tests (RDT) to improve malaria diagnosis.&#xD;
      This has led in Senegal to a substantial decrease in the incidence of malaria, in 2009.&#xD;
      However the recent overall decline hides the fact that malaria incidence remains very high in&#xD;
      the south of Senegal. That's why Home-based management (HMM) for malaria is being introduced&#xD;
      in selected areas. Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) by monthly administration of a&#xD;
      therapeutic dose of antimalarials can achieve a very high degree of protection from attacks&#xD;
      of clinical malaria in children. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of combining IPTc with HMM in southern Senegal&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the tolerance of IPTc using SP+AQ when it is administered for a longer period in&#xD;
           areas with a longer transmission season,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the added benefit that IPT with the association of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine +&#xD;
           Amodiaquine can offer in populations where a rapid and early care with home management&#xD;
           of malaria is already established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the cost benefit ratio of the addition of IPTc with HMM. A cluster randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial has been designed to evaluate the effectiveness of adding seasonal IPTc&#xD;
           with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ) for 5 months per year, in&#xD;
           villages where home-based management of malaria is implemented. All villages in Saraya&#xD;
           district, excluding 7 villages with a health post, will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
           Saraya villages will be combined to form 24 clusters which will be randomized to receive&#xD;
           HMM from a community volunteer, or IPTc plus HMM. Trained volunteer Community Medicine&#xD;
           Distributors (CMD) will provide HMM. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of&#xD;
           clinical malaria with fever or history of fever and parasitaemia with density of at&#xD;
           least 3000/ul. Secondary outcomes will include the safety, the tolerability, the&#xD;
           coverage and acceptability of the intervention. Both the recurrent and capital costs to&#xD;
           the health service of training staff and delivering the interventions will be estimated.&#xD;
           Both direct and indirect costs to users of the services (children and their families)&#xD;
           will also be assessed.&#xD;
