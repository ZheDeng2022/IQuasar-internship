      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab inhibits blood vessel growth in cancer cells by blocking a growth factor&#xD;
           called VEGF. Dasatinib inhibits the action of proteins called tyrosine kinases, which&#xD;
           promote and stimulate blood vessel formation and cancer growth and spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the two drugs in combination may provide a more effective cancer treatment than&#xD;
           either drug used alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for different cancer&#xD;
           types, but their use in combination sis experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the highest doses of the combination of dasatinib and bevacizumab that can be&#xD;
      safely given to patients with different cancers and to find out what effects, good and bad,&#xD;
      these drugs may have on the patient and the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adult patients with an advanced solid tumor cancer that cannot be treated successfully with&#xD;
      standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in Group 1 receive dasatinib and bevacizumab together throughout the study. The&#xD;
           dose is increased in successive groups of three to six patients until the optimum safe&#xD;
           dose is determined. Patients take dasatinib by mouth once a day and receive bevacizumab&#xD;
           as an infusion through a vein once every 2 weeks in 28-day treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in Group 2 are randomly assigned to receive either dasatinib or bevacizumab for&#xD;
           cycle one, and then both drugs for all subsequent cycles. The drug doses are based on&#xD;
           the optimum doses found in Group 1 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have a physical examination and blood and urine tests every 2 weeks for cycles&#xD;
           1 and 2, and then every 4 weeks for the duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have CT or MRI scans or another imaging test such as ultrasound every 8 weeks&#xD;
           to monitor the cancer s response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsies are obtained from patients in Group 2 before treatment, 2 weeks into the&#xD;
           first treatment cycle, and 2 weeks into the second cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamic, contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) tests are done on patients in Group 2 before&#xD;
           treatment, 2 weeks into the first cycle and 4 weeks into the second cycle. This MRI test&#xD;
           uses a special non-radioactive dye that shows blood flow in a certain part of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients who have been on the study over 2 years, the cycle may be lengthened to 6&#xD;
           or 8 weeks at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib is an inhibitor of SRC family kinases, BCR-ABL, c-KIT, EPHA2 and PDGF beta&#xD;
      receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds all biologically active&#xD;
      isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, or VEGF-A) with high affinity&#xD;
      (k(d) equal to 1.1nM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I trial is open to patients with all solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of dasatinib and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine biochemical changes in the src-FAK and src-PLC-. and VEGF signal transduction&#xD;
      pathways in tumor and stromal cells in response to treatment at the MTD, in a pilot fashion,&#xD;
      if those changes are statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with histologically documented solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or&#xD;
      unresectable and for which standard curative therapies do not exist or are no longer&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or biological&#xD;
      therapy for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolling in Group 2 must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status 0 or 1 and adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive dasatinib and bevacizumab together at the start of study in a dose&#xD;
      escalation fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will be randomized as to which agent they receive for cycle one. Cycles 2 and beyond&#xD;
      are treated using both agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsies will be obtained from patients in Group 2 before treatment, two weeks into&#xD;
      mono-therapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE-MRI studies will be obtained on patients in Group 2 before treatment, two weeks into&#xD;
      monotherapy, four weeks into monotherapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for toxicity in clinic every 2 weeks for Cycles 1 and 2, and then&#xD;
      every 4 weeks. For patients who have been on the study over 2 years, the cycle may be&#xD;
      lengthened to 6 or 8 weeks at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for response every 8 weeks using the RECIST criteria. After&#xD;
      patients have completed 2 or more years on study, the interval may be lengthened to 12 or 16&#xD;
      weeks at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 48 patients will be needed to achieve the objectives of the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients who have an active pleural effusion may be considered if tapped prior to&#xD;
                  study. Patients with pleural effusions that are too small to be removed may be&#xD;
                  considered on a case by case basis. Patients with a Grade 2, asymptomatic&#xD;
                  pericardial effusion found incidentally on imaging studies may be considered on a&#xD;
                  case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Dasatinib is metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 liver enzyme. Consideration&#xD;
                  should be given to using alternative medications not impacting CYP3A4 while on&#xD;
                  dasatinib therapy.&#xD;

                  starting dasatinib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Category I drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades&#xD;
                  de Pointes. A wash-out period of greater than or equal to 7 days is required for&#xD;
                  the following drugs prior to starting dasatinib treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide&#xD;

                       lidoflazine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with dasatinib,&#xD;
             bevacizumab, and/or the combination. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated with dasatinib (any other Src-family kinase inhibitors)&#xD;
             will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg or diastolic&#xD;
             pressure greater than 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proteinuria defined as a spot urine analysis for protein creatinine ratio (UPC) of&#xD;
             greater than 1.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapeutic anticoagulation with coumadin, heparins, or heparinoids. Prophylaxis doses&#xD;
             are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious non-healing wounds (including wounds healing by secondary intention), acute or&#xD;
             non-healing ulcers, or bone fractures within 3 months of fracture. History of&#xD;
             abdominal fistula, major surgery, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscesses&#xD;
             within 28 days will be excluded. Any patient with history of gastrointestinal&#xD;
             perforation will be excluded due to possibility of increased risk of perforation with&#xD;
             bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impairment of swallowing that would preclude administration of dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hemoptysis or surgery within the past 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs will be excluded due to risk of&#xD;
             fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. If a patient has a history of any type primary lung cancer&#xD;
             and hemoptysis, they will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of high grade varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of herbal supplements are not permitted within 7 days of trial commencement and on&#xD;
             study. Vitamin supplement (above a typical single multi-vitamin) usage is discouraged&#xD;
             unless clearly indicated by an existing medical condition. An Associate or Principal&#xD;
             Investigator will have the discretion regarding which vitamin supplements are&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or recombinant human&#xD;
             antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any other concurrent investigational agents for treatment or anticancer agents&#xD;
             including hormonal therapy, except in the case of prostate cancer patients who are&#xD;
             being treated with LHRH agonist at the time of trial entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an antibody to VEGF&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Dasatinib is a potential&#xD;
             teratogen. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother bevacizumab or dasatinib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.&#xD;
