      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some breast cancer cells have specific proteins (receptors) on their surface that make&#xD;
           the tumor grow faster than normal cells. One of these receptors is called HER2/neu.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An FDA-approved drug called Herceptin attaches to HER2/neu if it is present on the&#xD;
           cancer cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indium-Herceptin is an agent in which a tiny amount of radioactivity called Indium has&#xD;
           been attached to a tiny amount of Herceptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To see if Indium-Herceptin provides information about the characteristics of the breast&#xD;
      cancer in women whose tumors express HER2/neu and those whose tumors do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Women 18 years or older with primary or metastatic breast cancer who have not received&#xD;
      treatment with herceptin for at least 6 months before enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue from the patient s original breast or tumor biopsy is analyzed for HER2/neu&#xD;
           status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have a physical examination and review of medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receive an injection of Indium-Herceptin, followed by scanning with a gamma&#xD;
           camera that detects the radioactivity in the Indium-Herceptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients return to the clinic 1, 2, 3 and 7 days later for repeat imaging to determine&#xD;
           the best time to image after injection of Indium-Herceptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples are obtained every day of scanning to monitor the effects, if any, of the&#xD;
           Indium-Herceptin and to see how fast the agent leaves the body.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab (Herceptin ), targets HER2 (aka: neu, ErbB2, c-erb-B2) on the surface of&#xD;
           cancer cells and is used in the treatment of breast cancers that overexpress HER2/Neu&#xD;
           (Erb2). It has also been demonstrated that other malignancies express HER2/Neu (Erb2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiolabeling trastuzumab could allow human biodistribution studies, noninvasive&#xD;
           assessment of HER2/Neu (Erb2) expression, identification of HER2/Neu (Erb2) positive&#xD;
           metastases, monitoring of treatment response and establishment of dosimetry for future&#xD;
           radioimmunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have developed a chelated form of trastuzumab, CHX-A DTPA-trastuzumab, that can bind&#xD;
           a number of radioisotopes including (111)In, (212), (213)Bi, (212)Pb (86), (90)Y and&#xD;
           (177)Lu which have alpha, beta and gamma emissions for imaging and therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We believe that the agent will be safe based on the low dose of trastuzumab (up to a&#xD;
           maximum of 200 mcg of protein or less than1% of the typical loading dose of trastuzumab&#xD;
           in a 70 Kg human) and the low dose of radioactivity (5mCi).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whereas trastuzumab therapy is generally only useful in tumors that highly express&#xD;
           HER2/Neu (Erb2), (111)In-CHX-A DTPA trastuzumab (henceforth (111)Indium-trastuzumab )&#xD;
           will image tumors that are not only highly expressing HER2/Neu (Erb2) but also tumors&#xD;
           that are poorly expressing HER2/Neu (Erb2) as documented by preclinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The primary objective is to compare uptake of 111Indium trastuzumab with HER2/Neu (Erb2)&#xD;
      status of the tumor as determined by IHC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with a history of primary or metastatic cancer (other than melanoma, basal&#xD;
           cell carcinoma, sarcoma or lymphoma) with known solid tumor size greater than or equal&#xD;
           to 1.5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Availability of HER2/Neu (Erb2) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or pathology or&#xD;
           biopsy specimen can be provided on which such an analysis can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The design of this pilot trial follows the concept of a Phase 0 or Exploratory IND&#xD;
           (xIND) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with known malignancy greater than or equal to 1.5cm and known&#xD;
           HER2/Neu(ErbB2) tumor status (0, 1+, 2+ or 3+) by IHC or FISH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After receiving 5 mCi of (111)Indium-trastuzumab, all participants will undergo gamma&#xD;
           camera scans at approximately 24-72 hours after injection. In some subjects, an&#xD;
           additional imaging session may be required 24 hours after the first set of images as&#xD;
           physiologic bowel clearance is variable and may obscure the lesion of interest on the&#xD;
           initial scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will accrue 20 participants to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 8 blood samples (4 lab tests and up to 4 for pharmacokinetics) will be&#xD;
           obtained from each participant to establish toxicity and the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
           clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Images will be correlated with IHC status using tumor to background ratios and the&#xD;
           optimal scanning strategy with regard to HER2/neu(ErbB2) expression will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who undergo a therapy thought to target or effect HER2 will have the option&#xD;
           of undergoing repeat imaging following therapy.&#xD;
