    <textblock>
      Iron is an essential micronutrient that plays an important role in cellular functions of all&#xD;
      microorganisms. Both iron deficiency and iron excess during the early weeks of life can have&#xD;
      severe effects on neurodevelopment that may persist into adulthood and may not be corrected&#xD;
      by restoration of normal iron levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron overload remains a significant concern in preterm infants because they have low levels&#xD;
      of iron-binding proteins and immature antioxidant systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate if iron supplementation is required/necessary in VLBW&#xD;
      Very Low Birth Weight (less than 1500 grams) and to assess the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      iron supplementation practice for VLBW preterm infants as implemented in the Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Ha'Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.&#xD;

      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The aim of the study is to investigate the presence and level of Cryptic LPI in pre term&#xD;
           infants plasma before and during enteral iron supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the iron status in preterm infants and correlated them with clinical&#xD;
           parameters: the blood transfusions given and the amount of blood obtained for routine&#xD;
           laboratory analysis, and amount of daily iron intake through diet (human milk or&#xD;
           formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify which preterm infants are at risk for iron deficiency or iron overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate laboratory tests, Hepcidin and CHr, for the assessment of iron metabolism&#xD;
           in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To review the current guidelines in use for monitoring iron status and&#xD;
      prevention of iron deficiency in VLWP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To implement future new guidelines for monitoring iron therapy and iron supplementation in&#xD;
      pre terms infants if the results suggest changes in the current policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythropoietin will not be administrated. Restrictive red cell transfusion guidelines will be&#xD;
      followed. All the premature infants included in the study will receive Vitamin E&#xD;
      supplementation as the currently used in the NICU ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron supplementation with IPC in a dose of 4 mg/kg/day of elemental iron started not before 4&#xD;
      weeks of age and as soon as 120 ml/kg/day of enteral feedings is tolerated given together&#xD;
      with the first morning meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Study population: all newborn infants VLBW and or borne at 30 weeks or&#xD;
      less of gestational age admitted at the Ha'Emek Medical Center, NICU will be screened for&#xD;
      study eligibility. The estimate number of patients that will be included in the study is 50&#xD;
      during a period of one year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VLBW and / or borne at 30 weeks or less of gestational age that are scheduled to receive&#xD;
      enteral iron supplementation as part of the standard protocol currently used by the NICU.&#xD;
      Birth weight will be not an inclusion or exclusion criteria for preterms born at 30 weeks or&#xD;
      less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Major physical anomalies, renal or cardiac diseases, newborns that&#xD;
      underwent major surgery during the study period, acute or chronic fetal blood loss, hemolytic&#xD;
      anemia, refusal to receive parental consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete blood count including reticulocyte count and CHr. Serum iron, Transferrin, C&#xD;
      Reactive Protein (CRP), erythropoietin, ferritin Serum Hepcidin and serum Cryptic LPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be obtained 3 hs after oral iron administration. The blood tests will&#xD;
      be collected at same time of necessary routine blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serum will be collected at last 72 hs apart of clinical events: sepsis, NEC Necrotizing&#xD;
      Enterocolitis, Intra ventricular hemorrhage, severe illness and or blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete blood count including reticulocyte count and CHr (0.5 cc of blood in EDTA), will be&#xD;
      performed on a cell counter at Ha'Emek Medical Center laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum laboratory analyses 2.5 cc of blood will be centrifuged (no more than 2 h after&#xD;
      extraction) 0.25 cc of serum will be conserved at -700 C for the hepcidin analysis, 1 cc of&#xD;
      serum will be conserved at -700 C for the Cryptic LPI analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum iron, Transferrin, C Reactive Protein (CRP), erythropoietin and ferritin analysis will&#xD;
      be performed at Ha'Emek Medical Center laboratory in the day of blood extraction immediately&#xD;
      after blood centrifugation ( 0.5 cc of serum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron saturation will be calculated from serum iron and transferrin results. Serum hepcidin&#xD;
      will be measured by ELISA using the kit EIA-4705, DRG Instruments GmbH, Germany,&#xD;
      Frauenbergstr at Ha'Emek Medical Center laboratory following the kit instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Cryptic LPI will measured by Aferrix Ltd, Rehovot, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples will be obtained at 3 different times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before starting iron supplementation (maximum one week before).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the beginning of iron supplementation in order to assess early signs of&#xD;
           erythropoiesis, iron overload or free iron (day 4 - 7 days of supplementation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Before discharge from hospitalization in order to asses the iron metabolism and sings of&#xD;
           iron deficiency (At least more than 2 weeks of supplementation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and perinatal data will be collected, the data will include:&#xD;
