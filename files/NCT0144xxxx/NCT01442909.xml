  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both pemetrexed and docetaxel have been reported to have similar activity against non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who failed previous chemotherapy in a large randomized phase III&#xD;
      study. However, no study showed different toxicity and efficacy profiles within individual&#xD;
      patients. Present phase II randomized clinical trial is designed to answer these questions,&#xD;
      with addition of information about whether or not sequential therapy can prolong disease-free&#xD;
      and overall survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel was the first third-generation anti-cancer drug found to have activity in&#xD;
      second-line chemotherapy for NSCLC, with a prolongation of patient survival in phase III&#xD;
      randomized trials comparing docetaxel with vinorelbine or ifosfamide, or with the best&#xD;
      supportive care, for NSCLC patients who have failed previous chemotherapy; thus, it has been&#xD;
      recommended for the second-line treatment of NSCLC. Four years after these trials, pemetrexed&#xD;
      showed similar activity with less toxicity, when compared with docetaxel treatment in a phase&#xD;
      III randomized trial of NSCLC patients previously treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate which exhibits clinical activity in a variety of&#xD;
      solid tumors, especially malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC. It inhibits thymidylate synthase,&#xD;
      dihydrofolate reductase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase. Pemetrexed has&#xD;
      confirmed activity against previously chemotherapy-treated NSCLC and has a better toxicity&#xD;
      profile than docetaxel, in which study docetaxel dosage used was 75 mg/m2 intravenous&#xD;
      infusion (IV) every 3 weeks. However, docetaxel dosage used in Japan and Taiwan is usually 60&#xD;
      mg/m2 every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether or not toxicity profiles of these two different drugs in same individual patients is&#xD;
      similar to findings of patients who received specific drug only is unknown, so is unknown of&#xD;
      toxicity profiles of docetaxel 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks comparing alimta 500 mg/m2 every 3&#xD;
      weeks. Present phase II randomized clinical trial is designed to answer these questions, with&#xD;
      addition of information about whether or not sequential therapy can prolong disease-free and&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
