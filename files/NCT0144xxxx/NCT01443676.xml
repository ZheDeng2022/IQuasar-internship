      This is a randomized (2:1), explorative, parallel-group, open-label, phase II trial in&#xD;
      elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In the control arm, patients will receive&#xD;
      radiotherapy, in the experimental arm, patients will receive bevacizumab during and after&#xD;
      radiotherapy until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades, neurosurgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy have been the&#xD;
      cornerstones of treatment for patients with glioblastoma. Most chemotherapeutic agents showed&#xD;
      little or no activity in malignant glioma patients, with the possible exception of&#xD;
      nitrosoureas. This has changed with the introduction of temozolomide, first shown to be&#xD;
      active in recurrent disease (Yung et al. 2000) and more recently in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma (Stupp et al. 2005, 2009). This EORTC 26981-22981 NCIC CE.3 trial demonstrated&#xD;
      an increase in median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months and of the 2 year survival rate from&#xD;
      10% to 26% in patients receiving radiotherapy plus temozolomide compared with radiotherapy&#xD;
      alone. Notably patients with tumors exhibiting methylation of the promoter region of the&#xD;
      O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene showed a striking benefit from&#xD;
      temozolomide (Hegi et al. 2005). Yet, inclusion in this trial was limited to patients up to&#xD;
      the age of 70, and subgroup analyses demonstrated that younger patients were more likely to&#xD;
      derive benefit from combined modality treatment than older patients. Thus, radiotherapy alone&#xD;
      is still the standard of care in the elderly. The value of radiotherapy has been confirmed in&#xD;
      a small randomized trial comparing best supportive care versus radiotherapy alone: median&#xD;
      survival was 29 weeks with radiotherapy compared with 16.9 weeks with supportive care only&#xD;
      (Keime-Guibert et al. 2007). Based on the overall shorter survival in elderly patients,&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy has been explored and shown to be equieffective in patients&#xD;
      aged 65-70 years and more (Roa et al. 2004). Two randomized trials presented in abstract form&#xD;
      at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June 2010 failed to&#xD;
      show superiority of primary temozolomide chemotherapy alone over radiotherapy alone in&#xD;
      elderly patients (Malmstrom et al. 2010, Wick et al. 2010a). In fact, the German NOA-08 trial&#xD;
      even showed that primary temozolomide alone is not non-inferior to primary radiotherapy alone&#xD;
      (Wick et al. 2010a). A concomitant treatment strategy is currently evaluated in a NCIC-EORTC&#xD;
      randomized trial. Further, the Nordic trial corroborated the equieffectiveness of an&#xD;
      accelerated radiotherapy protocol of 40 Gy administered in 15 fractions versus the standard&#xD;
      fractionation of 30 x 2 Gy. Altogether, these clinical data justify the exploration of new,&#xD;
      temozolomide-free first-line treatment strategies in glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioblastomas express high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and are highly&#xD;
      vascularized tumors. The VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, has recently gained approval in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent glioblastoma in the USA and in Switzerland in 2009, but not in the EU. Its&#xD;
      role in the first-line treatment of glioblastoma is currently being evaluated in randomized&#xD;
      trials. There is limited data on the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in elderly patients&#xD;
      with glioblastoma, although the safety profile of bevacizumab in elderly patients with other&#xD;
      types of cancer, e.g., lung cancer is favorable. There are ample rationales for combining&#xD;
      bevacizumab with radiotherapy, including the induction of VEGF by radiotherapy and the&#xD;
      concept of vascular normalization resulting in increased oxygenation and thus sensitivity to&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Thus, bevacizumab is not only expected to inhibit angiogenesis, but may also&#xD;
      exhibit additive or synergistic interactions with radiotherapy and further impair tumor&#xD;
      growth. Altogether, this study seeks to explore, using a dedicated neuroimaging protocol, the&#xD;
      possibility that bevacizumab enhances the effects of radiotherapy via the process of vascular&#xD;
      normalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with&#xD;
      radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in the treatment of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma in the elderly.&#xD;
