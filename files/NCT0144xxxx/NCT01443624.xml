    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pro-oxidant toxicity of iron injections in&#xD;
      critically ill patients and in healthy volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      inflammatory state of critically ill patients will reduce the oxydative stress induced by&#xD;
      iron injections, compared to the one induced in healthy volunteers. It will be an open&#xD;
      &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; study aimed at evaluating iron toxicity in critically ill patients (n=40)&#xD;
      as compared to healthy volunteers (n=40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the oxidative stress (principal judgment criteria=&#xD;
      8-iso-PGF2α) following a 100 mg injection of iron (at T0, T2, T6 and T24 hours post&#xD;
      injection) in both groups and the investigators will compare the effect of repeated&#xD;
      injections in the critically ill patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is frequent among critically ill patients, with 60% of the patients being anemic at&#xD;
      admission and more than 80% at discharge. This anemia is associated with an increased&#xD;
      MORBI-mORTALITY. However, therapeutic options, mainly transfusion and erythropoietin, are&#xD;
      disappointing. There is a remaining therapeutic option, iron injection, which has not been&#xD;
      fully evaluated because of potential restrictions: inflammation may prevent its efficacy, and&#xD;
      iron could be toxic, notably through the generation of oxidative stress. Our research is&#xD;
      aimed at exploring the benefit of iron treatment in the critical care anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators already demonstrated in a MURIN model of critical care anemia that the&#xD;
      master regulator of iron metabolism, hepcidin, is repressed and that iron can be mobilized&#xD;
      from the stores despite inflammation. In addition, in an observational human study, the&#xD;
      investigators reported that 25% of critically ill patients had iron deficiency and low to&#xD;
      normal hepcidin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All together, these data indicate that iron therapy may be beneficial in this situation. In&#xD;
      the present study, the investigators evaluate the toxicity of iron in that context of&#xD;
      critical care anemia. Iron, especially non-transferrin bound iron, is known to induce the&#xD;
      generation of oxygen-derived free radicals through the Fenton reaction. However, the&#xD;
      generation of oxidative stress secondary to iron injection has not been investigated in the&#xD;
      critically ill. In our animal model, preliminary data indicate that the production of&#xD;
      oxidative stress in the serum following iron injection may be prevented by inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To evaluate the pro-oxidant toxicity of iron injections in critically ill&#xD;
      patients and in healthy volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that the oxidative stress&#xD;
      will be reduced in critically ill as compared to healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human study : It will be an open &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; study aiming at evaluating iron toxicity&#xD;
      in critically ill patients (n=40) as compared to healthy volunteers (n=40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the oxidative stress (principal judgment criteria=&#xD;
      8-iso-PGF2α) following a 100 mg injection of iron (at T0, T2, T6 and T24 hours post&#xD;
      injection) in both groups and the investigators will compare the effect of repeated&#xD;
      injections in the critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should confirm that iron does not produce more oxidant stress in critically ill&#xD;
      patients than in healthy volunteers. The animal study should help to precise the efficacy of&#xD;
      this treatment, in addition to its toxicity. All these results will help to design a phase&#xD;
      III randomized study of intravenous iron in critically ill anemic patients&#xD;
