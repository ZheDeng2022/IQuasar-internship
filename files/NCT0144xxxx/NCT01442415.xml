    <textblock>
      Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are prone to develop obesity and are at increased risk of&#xD;
      developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes compared to the general pediatric&#xD;
      population. Few lifestyle modification trials have been conducted in overweight/obese CCS and&#xD;
      it is unclear whether CCS respond similarly to lifestyle modification compared to&#xD;
      overweight/obese individuals who have not had cancer (non-CCS). We propose a 3-year pilot&#xD;
      study that will enroll separate cohorts of overweight/obese CCS and overweight/obese non-CCS&#xD;
      every September into a family-based lifestyle modification program consisting of weekly&#xD;
      sessions at the University of Minnesota. The goal of the program will be to facilitate&#xD;
      improved physical fitness, weight management, heart health, and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in cancer detection and treatment over the last few decades have led to a marked&#xD;
      increase in survival rates in children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer. As a result,&#xD;
      the number of CCS has burgeoned and continues to grow. Unfortunately, damage to multiple&#xD;
      physiological systems often occurs when many of these effective, yet toxic, cancer therapies&#xD;
      are used. In particular, radiation and chemotherapy are thought to promote an environment&#xD;
      favorable to obesity, atherosclerosis, and impaired glucose metabolism. More specifically,&#xD;
      the cardiometabolic risk factor profile in CCS is characterized by abdominal obesity,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, and impaired glucose metabolism/insulin resistance. Excess&#xD;
      adiposity in adolescence and young adulthood, even in otherwise healthy individuals who have&#xD;
      not had cancer, is associated with increased risk for CVD and T2DM. Moreover, longitudinal&#xD;
      data uniformly implicate obesity early in life as a strong predictor of future risk factor&#xD;
      clustering and vascular abnormalities in later adulthood. Therefore, obesity in adolescence&#xD;
      and young adulthood, even in those without a history of cancer, is associated with greatly&#xD;
      increased risk of CVD and T2DM. The risk is likely further compounded when obesity is present&#xD;
      in the context of cancer survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle modification is the preferred approach for reducing the risk of developing CVD and&#xD;
      T2DM in CCS. However, few studies have been conducted in this area and none have assessed&#xD;
      multiple physiological outcomes. Furthermore no studies have evaluated the response to&#xD;
      lifestyle modification in overweight/obese CCS vs. overweight/obese non-CCS. It is possible&#xD;
      that because the cancer therapies are responsible for the increased risk in CCS (and not&#xD;
      necessarily behavioral habits), CCS may respond less-favorably to lifestyle modification&#xD;
      compared to overweight/obese non-CCS. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study will be to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of a 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program on&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic health in overweight and obese children who have survived&#xD;
      childhood cancers of all types and overweight and obese children who have not had cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following specific aims will be addressed in this pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect of a 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program on physical&#xD;
           fitness in overweight/obese children who have survived childhood cancer and&#xD;
           overweight/obese children who have not had cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that compared to overweight/obese non-CCS children, overweight/obese CCS&#xD;
           who engage in a 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program will have an&#xD;
           attenuated improvement in peak V02.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effect of a 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program on body&#xD;
           weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, artery health, and quality of life&#xD;
           in overweight/obese children who have survived childhood cancer and overweight/obese&#xD;
           children who have not had cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that compared to overweight/obese non-CCS children, overweight/obese CCS who&#xD;
      engage in a 10-week family-based lifestyle modification program will have attenuated&#xD;
      improvements in body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, artery health, and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
