      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a genetic condition that increases the risk for some types of&#xD;
      cancer. LFS may lead to cancer of the bone or connective tissue, breast, and brain. It may&#xD;
      also increase the risk for certain types of leukemia and other cancers. The only known cause&#xD;
      of LFS is a change (called a mutation ) in a gene known as TP53. However, not all people with&#xD;
      LFS have a TP53 mutation. Researchers want to study other possible genetic causes of LFS, and&#xD;
      factors that may increase or decrease cancer risk in people with the syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the types of cancers that occur in individuals with LFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the role of the TP53 gene in the development of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look for other possible genes that cause LFS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effect of LFS diagnosis on families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if environmental factors or other genes can change a person s cancer risk&#xD;
           associated with LFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with a family or personal medical history of cancers consistent with LFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with a family or personal medical history of cancers that does not meet the&#xD;
           diagnosis of LFS, but the history is suggestive for LFS (meets the diagnosis for the&#xD;
           so-called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with certain rare cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with a family or personal history of a TP53 gene mutation, with or without&#xD;
           related cancer(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill out a medical history questionnaire and a family history&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected for DNA and for storage. Cheek cell samples may be&#xD;
           collected if blood cannot be obtained for DNA. Participants can choose to have or not&#xD;
           have cancer screening with blood tests, imaging studies, and other exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their worries about cancer, stress&#xD;
           levels, and coping strategies. Diet and physical activity questionnaires will also be&#xD;
           given. Other psychological tests may be given as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored for several years, with regular followup visits to the&#xD;
           National Institutes of Health, if indicated. Any changes in health or cancer status will&#xD;
           be recorded.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a dominantly-inherited cancer predisposition syndrome&#xD;
           associated with a lifetime risk of approximately 90% by age 60 of numerous cancer types,&#xD;
           most notably bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, and&#xD;
           adrenal cortical carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classic LFS is defined by 1) A proband with a sarcoma diagnosed before 45 years of age,&#xD;
           and 2) a first-degree relative with any cancer under 45 years of age, and 3) a first- or&#xD;
           second-degree relative with any cancer diagnosed under 45 years of age or a sarcoma at&#xD;
           any age. Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL), a more inclusive diagnostic criteria, shares&#xD;
           some of the features of LFS but that do not meet the strict LFS diagnostic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TP53 was identified as the underlying cause of LFS in 1990. A TP53 mutation is&#xD;
           identified in approximately 70% of classic LFS and 40% of LFL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although screening LFS patients for certain cancers can lead to early detection, a&#xD;
           favorable impact on quality of life or overall survival as a result of such screening&#xD;
           has not been shown. Currently, there is no standard recommended screening protocol in&#xD;
           either adults or children with LFS&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate and define the clinical spectrum and quantify cumulative cancer risk in&#xD;
           individuals with LFS and LFL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a cancer screening program for individuals with LFS and LFL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genetic determinants, environmental factors, and gene-environment&#xD;
           interactions that potentially modify cancer risk in these high-risk individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the plausibility of lifestyle risk-reducing interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the psychological and social functioning effects of LFS on the individuals and&#xD;
           the family&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create an annotated biospecimen repository of LFS-related materials for translational&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A family or personal medical history of cancers consistent with the diagnosis of LFS or&#xD;
           LFL; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A personal history of a germline TP53 mutation; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A first- or second- degree relative of a TP53 mutation carrier, regardless of mutation&#xD;
           status; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A personal history of three or more LFS-related primary cancers; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A personal history of adrenal cortical carcinoma or choroid plexus carcinoma at any age&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term prospective cohort study to collect data from as many individuals with LFS as&#xD;
           permissible in order to precisely evaluate the main aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical/pathology records are reviewed to ascertain the family history and verify a&#xD;
           diagnosis of LFS. Questionnaires are administered to gather etiologic risk factor data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are offered the option of undergoing a screening protocol and are followed&#xD;
           prospectively. Biospecimens are collected to investigate cancer etiology and mechanisms&#xD;
           of carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical genetic testing is offered as appropriate after education and counseling.&#xD;
           Genetic testing is optional, and not required for other protocol aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We do not offer anti-cancer therapy; consultations for treatment recommendations of&#xD;
           cancer diagnosed while on study will be offered if available.&#xD;
