  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some genes may be associated with a greater chance of side effects during cancer treatment.&#xD;
      These genes may also make certain treatments less effective. Researchers want to collect&#xD;
      blood or cheek swab samples from people having cancer treatment to study these genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To obtain a blood or cheek swab sample to study genetic differences that may affect cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals with cancer who are being treated at the National Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have blood-based cancer, such as leukemia, will provide a cheek swab&#xD;
           sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the blood or cheek swab sample does not have enough genetic material for analysis, an&#xD;
           additional sample may be collected.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters/receptors might affect an&#xD;
      individual s response to drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-individual differences in efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy are especially&#xD;
      important given the narrow therapeutic index of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During analysis of investigational agents, inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) is most often noted. Genetic variation in genes encoding proteins&#xD;
      that regulate or mediate the metabolism and transport of drugs often account for some of the&#xD;
      wide variation seen in PK/PD, and ultimately the response to, and toxicity from,&#xD;
      pharmaceutical agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain and analyze the genomic DNA from patients with cancer on a therapeutic clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prospectively explore correlations between genetic variants involved in inter-individual&#xD;
      differences in drug disposition versus pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, response, and&#xD;
      toxicity endpoints in patients receiving pharmaceutical agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mitigate harm due to treatment with ineffective or toxicity-inducing drugs in patients&#xD;
      where gene-drug interactions are established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals enrolled on IRB approved NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) therapeutic&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory study with a planned accrual of 1,000 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA will be extracted from blood samples collected from patients (patients with&#xD;
      leukemia will have cheek swab samples collected) and genotyped using the Affymetrix Drug&#xD;
      Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporter (DMET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where patients carry genetic variants that are related to poor outcome or&#xD;
      significant toxicity on a given drug, clinical recommendations will be provided where&#xD;
      specific instructions are available in the package insert. This will apply to non-anticancer&#xD;
      agents as well given that patients with cancer often receive multiple agents to manage side&#xD;
      effects and co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between genetic variants in DMET-covered genes will be correlated with PK/PD&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes such as response and/or toxicity.&#xD;
