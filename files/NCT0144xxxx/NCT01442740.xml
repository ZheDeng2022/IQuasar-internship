    <textblock>
      Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is normally performed in our centre in a 0-degree&#xD;
      supine position, with the patient laying flat. This study will be investigating whether&#xD;
      changing patients to a 15-degree head up, feet down position will improve field of view and&#xD;
      reduce blood loss during surgery. The 15-degree head up, feet down position has been used in&#xD;
      other circumstances, such as brain surgery and for severely obese patients where airways can&#xD;
      be blocked due to lying flat. Every 15 minutes, blood pressure, heart rate and field of view&#xD;
      according to the Boezaart nasal scope scaling system will be recorded.&#xD;

      Our objective is to determine whether 15-degree RTP during FESS will influence&#xD;
      intra-operative blood loss and surgical field scores when compared to patients in a supine&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the 15-degree RTP position is not inferior to the supine position in&#xD;
      reducing intra-operative blood loss and improving surgical field view during FESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the effect of 15-degree RTP on total blood loss, time of surgery and&#xD;
      endoscopic surgical view, when compared with patients in the supine position, during FESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their sinus cavities assessed by rigid endoscopy during surgery. The&#xD;
      Boezaart scaling system will be used as our primary endoscopic surgical field measure. Total&#xD;
      Blood Loss (TBL), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), pulse rate and Time of Surgery (TOS) will be&#xD;
      recorded intra-operatively by the anesthesiologist and supporting nurse staff. The results of&#xD;
      this experiment will determine whether utilizing the 15-degree RTP is effective to reduce&#xD;
      blood loss during ESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is associated with nasal obstruction, discolored nasal&#xD;
      discharge, facial congestion or pressure that lasts at least twelve weeks (1,2). Nasal&#xD;
      polyposis may also be present with CRS (1,2). Corticosteroids and medicated nasal irrigations&#xD;
      are recommended as preliminary treatment options3. Sinus surgery is recommended for patients&#xD;
      whose symptoms are refractory to maximal medical management. FESS has evolved to become the&#xD;
      preferred surgical method for treating CRS and other sinus related diseases4. When compared&#xD;
      to the previous open craniofacial approach, this technique has been found to be less&#xD;
      invasive, low-risk and reduces operating time with improved post-operative outcomes4. FESS&#xD;
      performed in the supine position has been the standard at the St. Paul's Sinus Centre.&#xD;
      Surgeon experience has indicated that patients in a 0-degree operating position, allows for&#xD;
      consistent orientation of the sinus anatomy. However, bleeding within the surgical area can&#xD;
      obscure endoscopic field of view, increasing risk for surgical complications which may&#xD;
      include cerebrospinal fluid leak, hemorrhage, infection and damage to the optic nerve and&#xD;
      internal carotid artery (4,6). There are several factors available to control hypotension&#xD;
      during surgery such as the use of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), pre-operative topical&#xD;
      treatment with steroids, local vasoconstrictors and patient position4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIVA has been observed to reduce intra-operative hemorrhage by lowering mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) when compared to inhalational anesthesia during ESS5. The use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids prior to surgery has been found to reduce peri-operative blood loss (6).&#xD;
      Results indicate that TIVA and pre-operative steroid treatment can significantly lower&#xD;
      surgical grade scores by improving endoscopic visualization (5,6). However, altering patient&#xD;
      position during the operation may provide a simple option to further reduce the presence of&#xD;
      blood within the surgical field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Reverse Trendelenburg Position (RTP) is a head-up, feet-down tilt varying from 10 to 30&#xD;
      degrees (7). When used in surgery, RTP has been found to reduce hydrostatic forces and venous&#xD;
      congestion (6,7). In morbidly obese patients where anesthesia can alter respiratory function&#xD;
      RTP has been identified as a safe intra-operative procedure, improving oxygenation with&#xD;
      minimal MAP changes (9). This position has been found to reduce intra-cranial pressure during&#xD;
      craniotomy and thereby, decreasing surgical risks for cerebral swelling and herniation (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of RTP and other factors related to intra-operative blood loss during FESS has&#xD;
      recently been examined. Ko et al. (2008) equally randomized 60 CRS patients to receive FESS&#xD;
      while in the 10-degree RTP or complete supine position. Patients with CRS with or without&#xD;
      nasal polyposis, mild or moderate hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal disease, and other&#xD;
      uncritical medical conditions were included in the study (10). Patients were excluded if they&#xD;
      had severe or uncontrolled cases of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and preoperative use&#xD;
      of anticoagulant medication (10). All patients received a combination of intravenous and&#xD;
      inhaled anesthesia. This was induced with fentanyl, xylocaine, propofol and cisatracurim.&#xD;
      Desflurane or sevoflurane were used intra-operatively to maintain anesthesia (10). In&#xD;
      addition, a 1% solution of lidocaine hydrochloride, a local anesthetic, and adrenaline at a&#xD;
      dilution of 1:80,000 was injected into the surgical field and pterygopalatine fossa. Total&#xD;
      blood loss (TBL) was measured from the suction bottle during the surgery by an OR nurse.&#xD;
      Blood loss per minute (BL/Min) was calculated from dividing the TBL by the total time of the&#xD;
      surgery. The Boezaart grading system was used to evaluate the effect of bleeding within the&#xD;
      surgical field (SF). The inverse trendelenburg position was found to significantly reduce TBL&#xD;
      (P &lt; 0.001), BL/Min (P &lt; 0.001) and SF score (P &lt; 0.004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the highly vascularized nature of the paranasal sinuses, small amounts of blood can&#xD;
      cause substantial impairment to endoscopic view. The RTP reduces venous return and cardiac&#xD;
      output by retaining blood in the lower parts of the body (10,11). As a result, reduced&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss has been reported in previous studies employing this operating&#xD;
      position during surgery (10,11,12). Although RTP has been utilized in Otorhinolaryngology,&#xD;
      the previously mentioned study used a combination of total intravenous and inhaled anesthesia&#xD;
      for study subjects (10). Previous literature has shown that TIVA can reduce intra-operative&#xD;
      blood loss when compared to inhaled anesthesia5. We aim to evaluate if 15-degree RTP with&#xD;
      patients receiving TIVA and preoperative steroid treatment can reduce endoscopic visual&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized unblinded, prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of CRS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients requiring endoscopic sinus surgery will be approached to partake in this study.&#xD;
      These patients are individuals who have failed conventional medical therapy and require the&#xD;
      expertise of a tertiary rhinologist in treating their sinus disease. This tertiary based&#xD;
      rhinology centre averages 6000 outpatient visits and &gt;400 FESS cases a year. This is the&#xD;
      busiest rhinology centre in Western Canada. The site coordinator or one of the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator's designates will describe the study design to the patients. Patients will have&#xD;
      up to one month prior to surgery to sign the consent form if they plan to partake in the&#xD;
      study. Patients placed in the study will be provided with the direct line to the St. Paul's&#xD;
      Sinus Centre and therefore can talk to any of the co-investigators if they have any questions&#xD;
      or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 19 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who will undergo primary or revision functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with CRS with or without polyposis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients under the age of 19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a history of coagulation disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with severe or uncontrolled cases of hypertension and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergoing sinonasal tumor resection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental and Control Arm All patients are treated with a one-week course of prednisone&#xD;
      20mg once a day and oral antibiotics (clavulin or clindamycin if penicillin allergic) prior&#xD;
      to surgical intervention. Patients will be randomized to the experimental (15-degree RTP) or&#xD;
      control (supine) arm based on a closed envelope system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Operative:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain informed consent of 64 patients prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomize patients to the experimental (15-degree RTP) arm or the control (supine&#xD;
           position) arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  32 patients will receive FESS while in the 15-degree RTP position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  32 patients will receive FESS while in the standard supine (0-degree) position&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing health conditions, current medication and patient demographics (age, sex)&#xD;
           will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be instructed to take the standard pre-operative medications used at St.&#xD;
           Paul's Hospital (prednisone and antibiotics for 1 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will initially be placed in a 0-degree supine position, where blood pressure&#xD;
           and pulse rate will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will undergo total intravenous anesthesia, with a prescribed infusion&#xD;
           administered by the residing anesthetist. Anesthesia infusions will be documented and&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Principal Investigator or one of his designates will electronically calibrate the&#xD;
           operating table to bring patients in the experimental arm of the study to the 15-degree&#xD;
           RTP. Those in the control arm will remain in the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MAP, pulse rate and endoscopic field view will be recorded every 15 minutes&#xD;
                intra-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Once the procedure is complete, total time of surgery and total estimated blood&#xD;
                loss will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood loss per minute will be calculated using total blood loss divided by total&#xD;
                operating time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the effect of 15-degree RTP on total blood loss, time of surgery and&#xD;
      endoscopic surgical field view when compared with patients in the supine position, during&#xD;
      FESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will be documented at periodic intervals intra-operatively and at&#xD;
      the completion of surgery. The Principal Investigator or one of his designates will record&#xD;
      MAP, pulse rate and endoscopic surgical field score every 15 minutes from the start of&#xD;
      surgery. Documentation of MAP, pulse rate, and endoscopic surgical field score at periodic&#xD;
      intervals is not standard practice during surgery and it will only be done on study patient&#xD;
      cases. Once the procedure is completed, total blood loss and time of surgery will be&#xD;
      recorded. The total amount of blood lost will be calculated from the suction bottle and&#xD;
      measured in milliliters after surgery. This will be confirmed by the circulating nurse and&#xD;
      the anesthetist. Total time of surgery will be recorded in minutes, by the circulating nurse&#xD;
      and the anesthetist. In certain circumstances the operation may be extended due to unexpected&#xD;
      complications, therefore total blood loss may increase due to prolonged surgery. To determine&#xD;
      blood loss per minute (mL/min), total estimated blood loss will be divided by time of&#xD;
      surgery. Ko et al (2008) previously calculated blood loss per minute with the above formula&#xD;
      in their analysis of the role of RTP during endoscopic sinus surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Boezaart intra-operative surgical field scale will be used to grade the level of bleeding&#xD;
      during surgery. This 0 to 5-point scale will be used to outline the amount of suction&#xD;
      required to rid the area of blood disrupting vision. A score of 0 is given for an area with&#xD;
      no bleeding, 1 for slight bleeding with no suction required, 2 for slight bleeding requiring&#xD;
      suction, 3 for moderate bleeding which improves for several seconds once suction has&#xD;
      occurred, 4 for moderate bleeding which restarts directly after suctioning and 5 for severe&#xD;
      bleeding which occurs faster then can be removed (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion with a statistician indicated that based on a previous study10, a population size&#xD;
      of 64 patients would be needed to achieve a power rating of 80%. Both the experimental and&#xD;
      control arms each will have 32 patients enrolled. To determine the sample size, a confidence&#xD;
      interval of 95% was utilized to create a responsive range of double the standard deviation.&#xD;
      In consideration of the location and vascularity of the paranasal sinuses, a Boezaart score&#xD;
      of 3 is expected during surgery. Clinically significant change in intra-operative bleeding&#xD;
      will be defined as a change in Boezaart scoring by 20%, or one point in relation to the&#xD;
      scale. All data collected for this study will be gathered in a password protected Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel spreadsheet file. Each patient will be assigned unique identification allowing for no&#xD;
      patient data to be recorded. The Microsoft Excel database will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing health conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lund-Kennedy CT score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRS with or without polyposis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary or revision surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anesthesia infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical position (15-degree RTP or Supine)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAP (15 minute intervals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse rate (15 minute intervals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic surgical field scores (15 minute intervals)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-operative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microdebrider usage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks No adverse risks are expected from placing patients in the experimental 15-degree&#xD;
      reverse trendelenburg position. Patient care will not be compromised at any time during&#xD;
      surgery. Patients will be able to withdraw from the study at any stage without affecting the&#xD;
      quality of the medical care they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties and Limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: No difficulties are expected. Standard practice during FESS at the St. Paul's Sinus&#xD;
      Centre is to document total time of surgery and blood loss on anesthetist and nurse progress&#xD;
      notes, and post-operative surgical reports. For best results, we have included periodic&#xD;
      measurement of MAP, pulse rate and endoscopic surgical field view at 15-minute intervals&#xD;
      intra-operatively. Unexpected or sudden adverse events during surgery may hinder periodic&#xD;
      assessment of our primary outcome measures, as priority will be given to patient safety.&#xD;
