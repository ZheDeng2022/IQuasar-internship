  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies vitamin D levels in the skin of healthy subjects after oral&#xD;
      supplementation. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The&#xD;
      use of cholecalciferol, a vitamin D, may keep skin cancer from forming.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if high-dose oral cholecalciferol supplementation increases vitamin D&#xD;
      receptor (VDR) expression in keratinocytes from photoprotected areas in healthy subjects with&#xD;
      documented insufficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (defined as =&lt; 30.0 ng/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the modulation in CYP24 expression in keratinocytes (from photoprotected and&#xD;
      photodamaged skin samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the modulation in VDR expression in keratinocytes (from photodamaged skin&#xD;
      samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the mechanistic information concerning the action of cholecalciferol&#xD;
      supplementation in the state of keratinocytic differentiation by assessing caspase 14,&#xD;
      loricrin, and assessment of stratum corneum thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation in&#xD;
      this patient cohort, including the evaluation of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      (PTH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels after intervention supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the corresponding VDR and CYP24 expression in benign melanocytic nevi.&#xD;
      (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive cholecalciferol orally (PO) twice weekly for up to 8-9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 10-14 days.&#xD;
