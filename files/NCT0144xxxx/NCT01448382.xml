      1. Primary Scientific Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect human clinical data to sustain the development of blood detection sensor&#xD;
                and optimize its algorithm and parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preliminary evaluation of blood detection performances in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Scientific Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of blood detection sensor ability to identify the anatomical location&#xD;
                (i.e. Stomach, SB or Colon)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of capsule transit characteristics in the GI tract&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of BBC capsule safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that by implementing a spectrophotometer technology in capsule and utilizing&#xD;
      the unique characteristics of light absorption by blood in specific spectrum, the capsule&#xD;
      will be able to automatically detect blood in the GI tract with high accuracy. As such, the&#xD;
      system may be an add-on to video capsules to provide efficient and quick detection of blood&#xD;
      presence (for example in OGBI patients) or as stand alone low cost capsule (without video)&#xD;
      which could serve as a tool similar to standard FOBT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to support the development of a novel blood sensing detector embedded&#xD;
      in a PillCam® capsule and to provide initial evaluation of its performance in humans. The&#xD;
      device is named Blood Sensing Capsule (BSC), and is based on the Given PillCam® Platform with&#xD;
      a modified capsule.&#xD;
