  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugammadex is a new reversal agent for neuromuscular blockers (curare). It encapsulates the&#xD;
      curare molecule and terminates immediately its action. The recommended dose is 2 mg/kg for a&#xD;
      slight neuromuscular block and 4 mg/kg for a profound neuromuscular block. Magnesium sulphate&#xD;
      is frequently used in perioperative medicine and it is known to reinforce the neuromuscular&#xD;
      block induced for instance by rocuronium. The researchers want to investigate, whether higher&#xD;
      doses of sugammadex must be given to antagonize the neuromuscular block induced by rocuronium&#xD;
      in patients who received magnesium sulphate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are frequently used in anaesthesia and intensive care&#xD;
      medicine for tracheal intubation, artificial ventilation, and continued muscle relaxation&#xD;
      during surgical interventions. Postoperative residual curarisation is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of postoperative complications and morbidity. Consequently, adequate reversal&#xD;
      of neuromuscular block after surgery is of great importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholinesterase inhibitors have been widely used as reversal agents. They increase the amount&#xD;
      of acetycholine at the neuromuscular junction, which then competes with the NMBA to restore&#xD;
      muscle function. Cholinesterase inhibitors have, however, a number of limitations. They&#xD;
      antagonise the neuromuscular block slowly and are only effective when partial spontaneous&#xD;
      recovery has already occurred. These agents are also associated with a relatively high&#xD;
      incidence of cholinergic adverse reactions, including bradycardia, arrhythmia, salivation,&#xD;
      and bronchoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugammadex, a modified gamma cyclodextrin, is a selective binding agent specifically designed&#xD;
      to encapsulate steroidal NMBAs such as rocuronium. It causes a rapid and complete reversal of&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade by preventing directly rocuronium to react on the neuromuscular&#xD;
      receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-finding studies have suggested that sugammadex 2 mg kg-1 was needed for the reversal of&#xD;
      a moderate neuromuscular block (reappearance of T2), and that doses ≥4 mg kg-1 were needed&#xD;
      for the reversal of a profound block (1 to 2 post-tetanic counts). The median time for the&#xD;
      recovery of a moderate neuromuscular block to a T4/T1 ratio of 0.9 (which is considered&#xD;
      clinically safe) is around two minutes, and of a profound neuromuscular block is about three&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium is sometimes used in perioperative medicine, for instance, to prevent seizures in&#xD;
      parturients with pre-eclampsia. Magnesium has an impact on neuromuscular transmission. It&#xD;
      reduces the amount of acetylcholine that is released at the motor nerve terminal, by&#xD;
      decreasing the calcium conductance of presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channels. After&#xD;
      pre-treatment with a clinically relevant dose of magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), an increased&#xD;
      speed of onset and a prolongation of the recovery period of the neuromuscular blockade have&#xD;
      been observed with standard intubation doses of atracurium, vecuronium, and rocuronium. With&#xD;
      rocuronium, for instance, the investigators recorded a shortening of the speed of onset of&#xD;
      the neuromuscular block by about 35% but at the expense of a prolongation of the recovery&#xD;
      period by about 25%. It has been shown that the interaction between magnesium and rocuronium&#xD;
      may become relevant in specific clinical situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinically relevant interaction between MgSO4 and rocuronium begs the question as to&#xD;
      whether in a patient who has received MgSO4, the efficacy of sugammadex to reverse a&#xD;
      rocuronium-induced block may be affected. Indeed, animal studies have indicated that&#xD;
      significantly higher doses of sugammadex might be needed to reverse a rocuronium-induced&#xD;
      neuromuscular block after magnesium pretreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the established doses of sugammadex for&#xD;
      the fast and safe reversal of a moderate and a profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular&#xD;
      block are inadequate in patients who have received MgSO4. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      in subjects who received magnesium pretreatment, the time to reverse a moderate and a deep&#xD;
      neuromuscular block (induced by a single intubation dose of rocuronium) with standard doses&#xD;
      of sugammadex (2 and 4 mg kg-1, respectively) is prolonged by ≥ 50% and that the dose&#xD;
      response curves will be displaced to the right (i.e. higher doses of sugammedex will be&#xD;
      necessary to achieve the same speed of action as in patients who are not exposed to&#xD;
      magnesium.&#xD;
