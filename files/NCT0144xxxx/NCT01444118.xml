  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine contains humanized recombinant antigen (Epithelial Growth Factor) and an&#xD;
      adjuvant. The antibodies induced by vaccination will react with circulating EGF leading to&#xD;
      removal of EGF from the circulation. As a result, binding to its target EGF-Receptor is&#xD;
      prevented. Blocking of EGF-Receptor is preventing activation and stimulation of proliferation&#xD;
      of tumour cell. A Phase III clinical trial on the EGF vaccine is ongoing in Cuba. The result&#xD;
      from previous studies demonstrated positive correlation between extended survival and immune&#xD;
      response against the vaccination in the late-stage NSCLC patients' age below 60 with improved&#xD;
      quality of life. The purpose of this international Phase III trial is to determine whether&#xD;
      the recombinant human EGF cancer vaccine is safe, immunogenic and effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients compared to standard treatment and supportive care.&#xD;

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, corresponding&#xD;
             to locally and regionally advanced, inoperable disease (Stage IIIb or Stage IV [as&#xD;
             defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system]), excluding brain&#xD;
