      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is an important target in cancer because it promotes&#xD;
           chemotherapeutic resistance and confers a poor prognosis for many types of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several inhibitors of the pathway are being developed as cancer therapeutics. However,&#xD;
           the process of de novo drug development takes years, and is often curtailed due to&#xD;
           diminished activity and/or unforeseen toxicities in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One approach to expedite the development of new cancer therapies is to test drugs that&#xD;
           are already approved for other indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our group has shown that nelfinavir, an orally available FDA-approved HIV-1 protease&#xD;
           inhibitor used to treat HIV/AIDS, can inhibit endogenous Akt and growth factor receptor&#xD;
           induced Akt activity in cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Importantly, nelfinavir demonstrates dose-dependent cytotoxicity in every cell line in&#xD;
           the NCI 60 cell line panel at plasma concentrations attainable in human plasma, is&#xD;
           profoundly effective in cancer cell lines that have been selected to become resistant to&#xD;
           standard therapies, and inhibits tumor growth in-vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because an MTD with nelfinavir has not been observed in prior phase I studies with HIV&#xD;
           patients, the objectives of the Phase I design will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the MTD and dose limiting toxicity for this drug in patients with solid&#xD;
           Tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate nelfinavir pharmacokinetics with baseline activity of CYP3A4 as assessed by&#xD;
           measuring midazolam clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To preliminarily explore the biological and clinical effects through a series of&#xD;
           correlative studies involving analysis of blood and tissue across patients throughout&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adults with solid tumors who are refractory to, or have relapsed after receiving, standard&#xD;
      front-line chemotherapies are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive nelfinavir beginning at the FDA-approved dose for HIV patients&#xD;
           (1250 mg po bid).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalations will occur for 6 dose levels i.e. cohorts, or until the MTD is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 45 patients are expected to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staging CT scans will be performed every two cycles.&#xD;
