      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal cancers are among the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the United&#xD;
           States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are currently no tests to predict how patients with gastrointestinal cancers will&#xD;
           respond to radiation therapy or which patients may develop side effects from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies on tumor cells in the stool, urine, or blood from patients may provide valuable&#xD;
           information that can be used to develop tests to determine which patients may need more&#xD;
           or less aggressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies of other substances in the stool, urine, or blood from patients may provide&#xD;
           valuable information that can be used to develop tests to determine which patients are&#xD;
           likely to develop side effects from radiation treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect blood, urine and stool specimens from patients with gastrointestinal cancers&#xD;
           who will undergo radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study hormone and protein changes in these blood, urine and stool specimens before,&#xD;
           during and after radiation treatment in order to develop a way to predict how&#xD;
           gastrointestinal cancers will respond to radiation therapy and if patients with these&#xD;
           cancers will develop side effects from radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 18 years of age and older with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus,&#xD;
      stomach, pancreas, rectum) who plan to receive radiotherapy to the site of the cancer on an&#xD;
      NCI protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy: Before any treatment or at the time of surgery if it is the first&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine collection: Before, during, and after treatment and at follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool collection: Before, during, and after treatment and at follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood collection: Before, during, and after treatment and at follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intestinal permeability assessment: Before any treatment, before radiation (if radiation&#xD;
           is not the first treatment), 1 month after radiation is completed, and 3 months after&#xD;
           radiation is completed. This test determines how the patient s intestines are working to&#xD;
           absorb sugar and may provide information about side effects from radiation treatments.&#xD;
           Patients fast after midnight, then drink a small glass of sugars, and then do a 6-hour&#xD;
           urine collection.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal (GI) carcinomas represent one of the most commonly diagnosed&#xD;
           malignancies in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sensitive and specific marker of tumor persistence or recurrence would permit a more&#xD;
           accurate determination of the appropriateness of adjuvant therapy in patients with no&#xD;
           clinical evidence of disease following curative resection and allow the diagnosis of&#xD;
           recurrences at earlier stages that may be amenable to curative salvage therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A biomarker detectable shortly after treatment or in the early stages of chronic&#xD;
           radiation toxicity may allow the identification of patients at risk and early&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our primary objective is to determine if patient specific tumor markers in stool, urine,&#xD;
           or serum can be reliably detected prior to treatment and followed after treatment to&#xD;
           monitor the extent of residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second objective is to evaluate the predictive value of potential markers of chronic&#xD;
           gastrointestinal injury after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach,&#xD;
           pancreas, rectum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned to receive radiotherapy to the site of the gastrointestinal malignancy on an NCI&#xD;
           protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol provides a means of acquiring tissue, serum, urine, and stool samples from&#xD;
           patients who will receive radiation therapy as part of their treatment for&#xD;
           gastrointestinal malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients treated with radiation therapy on NCI treatment protocols will be asked to&#xD;
           provide samples prior to any local or systemic therapy as well as before, during and&#xD;
           after their radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These samples will be tested for the presence of tumor specific DNA mutations and&#xD;
           aberrant methylation patterns determined to be present in each patient s tumor by&#xD;
           screening of initial biopsy or surgical material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor markers specific to each patient, such as tumor specific DNA mutations or aberrant&#xD;
           DNA methylation, may provide an individualized method to evaluate disease status and&#xD;
           determine prognosis after therapy. Additionally, a number of stool and serum markers&#xD;
           will be explored as early indicators of acute and eventual chronic gastrointestinal&#xD;
           injury in patients receiving radiotherapy to the abdomen.&#xD;
