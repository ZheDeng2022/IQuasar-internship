  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a novel study design to safely and ethically conduct a&#xD;
      long-term randomized controlled trial among patients at high risk for both sleep apnea and&#xD;
      cardiovascular events that will examine whether effective positive airway pressure(PAP)&#xD;
      therapy reduces cardiovascular risk. Patients with transient ischemic attack(TIA) or stroke&#xD;
      have a high prevalence of sleep apnea(60-80%), and they are at high risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events(myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, recurrent stroke, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      death)in the first year post event, despite current prevent strategies. Therefore, the&#xD;
      treatment of sleep apnea may represent a novel therapeutic target to reduce cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes in this high risk population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial among patients with transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack (TIA) and minor stroke, comparing strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep&#xD;
      apnea with usual care over 6-12 months at 2 sites (Yale University School of Medicine and&#xD;
      Indiana University School of Medicine). Patients with TIA and minor stroke will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either usual care or a diagnosis and treatment approach that includes ambulatory&#xD;
      polysomnography and initiation of autotitrating CPAP for sleep apnea in a 1:2&#xD;
      (control:intervention) randomization scheme. Intervention patients with sleep apnea will&#xD;
      receive either a standard CPAP treatment intervention or an enhanced protocol designed to&#xD;
      increase long-term CPAP adherence. The primary outcomes will include: (a) the impact of CPAP&#xD;
      on pathophysiologic markers in the following domains of cardiovascular risk: inflammation&#xD;
      (CRP, Il-6), heightened sympathetic activity/parasympathetic withdrawal (plasma&#xD;
      catecholamines and heart rate variability (HRV)), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, HbA1C),&#xD;
      endothelial injury (flow mediated vasodilation), and atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media&#xD;
      thickness); and (b) long-term (6-12 month) CPAP adherence.&#xD;

        <title>Flow-mediated Vasodilation Mean Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>Flow-mediated vasodilation is performed when the brachial artery diameter is measured (in mm) during three conditions; baseline (after at least 10 min supine rest), during reactive hyperaemia (induced by inflation to 250 mmHg and then deflation of a sphygmomanometer cuff around the forearm) and finally after the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. A linear array, high resolution ultrasound transducer is used to provide B-mode images of the target vessel, proximal to the forearm cuff. Flow-mediated vasodilation is one of the measures used to assess cardiovascular risk and the mean of the change in the multiple measurements was used at each time point. The change from baseline up until the final measurement (up to 12 months) was assessed.</description>

          <description>The homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). HOMA IR change is one of the measures used to assess cardiovascular risk. HOMA-IR Index (measured by calculating - fasting insulin (microU/L) x fasting glucose (nmol/L)/22.5.) To determine if CPAP use had an impact on cardiovascular risk, these measures were compared among CPAP usage groups. The change from baseline up until the final measurement (up to 12 months) was assessed.</description>

        <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. CRP is produced in the liver and its level is measured by testing the blood. CRP is classified as an acute phase reactant, which means that its levels will rise in response to inflammation. CRP is one of the measures used to assess cardiovascular risk. To determine if CPAP use had an impact on cardiovascular risk, these measures were compared among CPAP usage groups.

        <title>Flow-mediated Vasodilation Mean Change From Baseline With CPAP Use</title>
        <description>Flow-mediated vasodilation is performed when the brachial artery diameter is measured (in mm) during three conditions; baseline (after at least 10 min supine rest), during reactive hyperaemia (induced by inflation to 250 mmHg and then deflation of a sphygmomanometer cuff around the forearm) and finally after the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. A linear array, high resolution ultrasound transducer is used to provide B-mode images of the target vessel, proximal to the forearm cuff. Flow-mediated vasodilation is one of the measures used to assess cardiovascular risk and the mean of the change in the multiple measurements was used at each time point.

          <title>Flow-mediated Vasodilation Mean Change From Baseline With CPAP Use</title>
          <description>Flow-mediated vasodilation is performed when the brachial artery diameter is measured (in mm) during three conditions; baseline (after at least 10 min supine rest), during reactive hyperaemia (induced by inflation to 250 mmHg and then deflation of a sphygmomanometer cuff around the forearm) and finally after the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin. A linear array, high resolution ultrasound transducer is used to provide B-mode images of the target vessel, proximal to the forearm cuff. Flow-mediated vasodilation is one of the measures used to assess cardiovascular risk and the mean of the change in the multiple measurements was used at each time point. To determine if CPAP use had an impact on cardiovascular risk, these measures were compared among CPAP usage groups. The change from baseline up until the final measurement (up to 12 months) was assessed.</description>

        <title>Carotid Intima-Medial Thickness Change From Baseline With CPAP Use Change</title>
        <description>Carotid Intima-Medial Thickness are measurements of the mean values of Intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries. Caroid Intima-Medial Thickness change is one of the measures used to assess cardiovascular risk. To determine if CPAP use had an impact on cardiovascular risk, these measures were compared among CPAP usage groups. The change from baseline up until the final measurement (up to 12 months) was assessed. The carotid intimal thickness measurement was obtained by averaging the distance between the lumen-intima interface and the media-adventitia interface obtained from 5 contiguous sites 1 mm apart.</description>
