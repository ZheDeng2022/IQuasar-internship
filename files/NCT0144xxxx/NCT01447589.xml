  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to test whether the drug nelfinavir, which can increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of radiotherapy, can be given safely at the same time as a full dose of&#xD;
      radiotherapy for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that one way that nelfinavir works is through causing changes in the blood&#xD;
      vessels within tumours. The status of tumour blood vessels and the blood flow through them&#xD;
      will be investigated during the trial using special imaging techniques. The dose of radiation&#xD;
      used in this trial is greater than that used in previous trials with nelfinavir in other&#xD;
      disease settings and the response of normal lung to the combination of nelfinavir plus&#xD;
      radiation is unknown. Therefore, a low dose of nelfinavir will be given to the first few&#xD;
      patients that participate and will be gradually increased in subsequent groups of patients&#xD;
      provided that no worrying side effects are identified. There is a single report of serious&#xD;
      side-effects in an AIDs patient who was treated with radiotherapy for lung cancer when he was&#xD;
      also taking nelfinavir. However, in this case nelfinavir was taken at a dose 3-fold higher&#xD;
      than the highest dose level to be tested in this trial. An important goal of this trial is to&#xD;
      select the optimum dose of nelfinavir to be used in combination with lung radiotherapy, that&#xD;
      can then be tested more extensively in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiotherapy treatment in this trial has been carefully designed to minimise the amount&#xD;
      of healthy lung that receives radiation. Some specialised imaging techniques will be used&#xD;
      during radiotherapy planning and delivery to help ensure that the lung cancer is targeted&#xD;
      very precisely by radiation and that normal lung is avoided as much as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One effect of nelfinavir is to interfere with the function of a particular protein in cells&#xD;
      (called AKT). The degree to which this happens can be measured in cells from blood or tissue&#xD;
      samples. Therefore, another aim of the study is to investigate AKT and related proteins, to&#xD;
      check whether nelfinavir is having the predicted effect.&#xD;
