    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-finding, study of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol&#xD;
      in subjects with resectable pancreatic tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin E tocotrienols have been shown to exhibit cancer-preventive activities in preclinical&#xD;
      studies. Vitamin E tocotrienols are composed of α-, β-, δ-, and γ-tocotrienols. The&#xD;
      investigators preclinical studies indicate that δ-tocotrienol possesses the most potent&#xD;
      antitumor activity against pancreatic cancer. It is believed that this micronutrient may have&#xD;
      a role in the prevention of pancreatic cancer in healthy participants who are at increased&#xD;
      risk of developing the disease.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol and to determine the minimally effective dose (MED) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol administered once. Safety will be assessed by standard clinical findings and laboratory tests. Toxicity grade is defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)v.4.0. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals may be calculated for selected safety and exploratory variables.</description>

To determine the effects of dose on the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol when orally administered as a single dose in healthy subjects. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals may be calculated for selected safety and exploratory variables. Dose escalation will be based on safety and available PK data.</description>
