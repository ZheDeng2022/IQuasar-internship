  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive value of the presence or absence of&#xD;
      cardiac activity by bedside ultrasound during cardiac arrest. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      based on previous research that patients who suffer a cardiac arrest and have cardiac&#xD;
      activity on bedside ultrasound will have a greater chance of surviving to hospital admission.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that the mortality rate in patients in cardiac arrest with no&#xD;
      cardiac activity by ultrasound will have a mortality rate of 100%.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational trial involving sites across the United&#xD;
      States and Canada. Patients will be enrolled through the emergency department either&#xD;
      presenting in cardiac arrest, or going into cardiac arrest while in the emergency department.&#xD;
      Patients who develop cardiac arrest as inpatients will also be enrolled at centers capable of&#xD;
      enrolling inpatients subjects. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocols and&#xD;
      institutional policies for resuscitation will be followed, as is the current standard of&#xD;
      care. A patient encounter will conclude upon halting of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Final&#xD;
      disposition of the patient will be evaluated by chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial cardiac arrest and disposition there will be no further direct patient&#xD;
      interactions as part of the study except in the setting of repeat cardiac arrest. Patients&#xD;
      that have a repeat arrest can undergo a repeated ultrasound exam if they continue to meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. The repeat episode will be recorded as a continuation of the event and&#xD;
      not as a separate enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject data, with Protected Health Information (PHI) removed, will be uploaded into the&#xD;
      REDcap web-based database as soon as possible and within 7 days of final disposition. Data&#xD;
      will be obtained from initial patient encounter, patient records, and EMS records when&#xD;
      available. Additional data may be obtained by chart review to obtain data points not&#xD;
      available at initial contact. Individual sites will keep secured records to enable&#xD;
      identification of the patient source if data review is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information will include 6 types of data, past medical history, events surrounding&#xD;
      the cardiac arrest, actions taken by health care professionals, peri-arrest presentation,&#xD;
      peri-arrest interventions, and patient outcomes. Health care professional actions can include&#xD;
      ACLS medication administration, airway management, chest compressions, defibrillation,&#xD;
      pacing, and other resuscitative interventions. Specific data points are listed in the paper&#xD;
      version of electronic Case Report Form, CRF, see Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonography will not hinder or impair resuscitative efforts in any way, including halting CPR&#xD;
      or prolonging pauses in cardiopulmonary rescusitation (CPR). Sonographic images will be&#xD;
      obtained during designated pauses in chest compressions, as is routine care, during CPR for&#xD;
      pulse checks, rhythm checks, and necessary resuscitative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single or multi-view echocardiography will be performed as appropriate to obtain diagnostic&#xD;
      information for each particular patient during resuscitative efforts. Recording of the image&#xD;
      loops will be performed during image acquisition according to standard technology&#xD;
      availability at each site. To facilitate image acquisition, the ultrasound probe may be&#xD;
      placed in the epigastrium or parasternal region during CPR with the heart centered in the&#xD;
      field of view, if it will not interfere with ongoing resuscitation. Recording of the images&#xD;
      can begin immediately upon pauses of CPR using whatever means are available at the site.&#xD;
      Sonographic images will be obtained by competent personnel with experience in bedside cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound. This information will be made available to the physician taking care of the&#xD;
      patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound images will consist of a single or multiple view(s) that can include subxiphoid,&#xD;
      parasternal long axis, and/or apical 4 chamber. While not primarily preferred views; also&#xD;
      acceptable are parasternal short axis or apical 2 chamber views. Image requirements will be&#xD;
      based on adequate echocardiographic windows and adequate image acquisition as determined by&#xD;
      the physician performing the bedside ultrasound. In the setting of difficult to image&#xD;
      patients a combination of views may be required to obtain adequate information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be at least two ultrasound exams performed. The initial ultrasound exam and video&#xD;
      will be obtained upon the first pause for pulse or rhythm check once the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      are met and no exclusion criteria are present. The final ultrasound exam and video will be&#xD;
      obtained when resuscitative efforts are halted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasound images will be recorded for later review by the Regional Coordinating Site for&#xD;
      each Local Site. Ultrasound videos will be interpreted during acquisition as cardiac activity&#xD;
      present or absent and valvular movement present or absent. Specific video file formats that&#xD;
      are acceptable include MPEG4, Quicktime (MOV), DV, AVI, and WMV. Files will be forwarded at&#xD;
      least monthly to the Site Coordinator for the Regional Site and sent within 1 week of request&#xD;
      by the regional coordinating site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INITIAL INTERPRETATION OF CARDIAC IMAGES The Local Site PI will interpret ultrasound images&#xD;
      and the information will be uploaded into the central database or another database specified&#xD;
      by the Central Coordinating Site. Cardiac activity will initially categorize as &quot;Cardiac&#xD;
      Activity Present&quot;, &quot;Cardiac Activity Absent&quot;, Valve Movement Present&quot;, or Valve Movement&#xD;
      Absent&quot;. Cardiac activity is defined as any intrinsic movement of the myocardium, but not&#xD;
      isolated movement of the cardiac valves. Valve movement is defined as any movement of the&#xD;
      cardiac valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINAL INTERPRETATION OF CARDIAC IMAGES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac images will be reviewed by regional site PIs for sub-categories of cardiac activity.&#xD;
      A heart with any intrinsic cardiac movement outside of isolated valvular motion will be&#xD;
      categorized as &quot;Cardiac Activity Present&quot;. Ultrasound images in patients with cardiac&#xD;
      activity will be further categorized as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiac motion but No decrease in chamber size&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac motion with a decrease in chamber size &lt;10%&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cardiac motion with a decrease in chamber size of &gt;10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated duration that each subject will participate is the length of the&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation which can vary by patient, but can be from 15 minutes to 1&#xD;
      hour, with later follow up (hours to days later) to determine final disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary of the sequence and duration of all research activities is as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient interactions (estimated 15 minutes to 1 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient identified to be in cardiac arrest with confirmation of no pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest compressions and ACLS protocols initiated as per standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bedside ultrasound of heart performed and interpreted during standard pauses in cardiac&#xD;
           compressions as per routine care at institution (3-6 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACLS protocols continue as per standard care by treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resuscitation activities halted by either pronouncement of patient or return of&#xD;
           spontaneous circulation allowing disposition planning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bedside ultrasound of heart performed and interpreted (3-6 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Acquisition (Immediate to days later via chart review)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final patient disposition determined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interval events recorded (ie: repeat cardiopulmonary arrest)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management (immediate to days or weeks later)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject data with PHI removed entered into research database&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject data with PHI removed updated in research database if CRF not completed&#xD;
           initially&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac ultrasound images with PHI removed sent to regional site for review&#xD;
