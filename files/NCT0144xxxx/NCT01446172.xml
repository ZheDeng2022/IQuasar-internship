    <textblock>
      While cognitive therapy and exposure therapy are both proven to be effective for panic&#xD;
      disorder and/or agoraphobia when outcome is assenssed up to one year after treatment (Gould&#xD;
      et al., 1995) the scientific knowledge about long-term course of these disorders is still&#xD;
      scanty. Although several long-term outcome studies have been conducted, the quality of these&#xD;
      studies has been questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to conduct a follow-up study of patients with either panic disorder with history&#xD;
      of agoraphobia or agoraphobia without history of panic disorder. the patients were treated in&#xD;
      a group format at Modum Bad during the years 1989 to 1997. Four subsamples will be included&#xD;
      in the study. Subsample 1 (76 patients treated in 1989 and 1990) received combined cognitive&#xD;
      and psychodynamic treatment. Subsample 2 and 3 (46 patients treated in 1992 - 1993) were&#xD;
      allocated to either cognitive therapy or guided mastery treatment. Subsample 4 (45 patients&#xD;
      treated in 1994 - 1996) received cognitive and schema focused therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the follow-up study the participants will be requested to complete the same self report&#xD;
      measures as they completed at intake, discharge and at previous follow-up times. the&#xD;
      participants will also be interviewed using the SCID-I and II as they were at the previous&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present sample is relatively unique in having received pure psychosocial experimental&#xD;
      treatments. The very long term efficacy of cognitive therapy relative to behavioural&#xD;
      treatmetns for agoraphobia can be evaluated, and the potential moderating effects of&#xD;
      personality disorders can be assessed.&#xD;
