    <textblock>
      The primary purpose for this study is to determine if children who receive Occupational&#xD;
      Therapy while they are an inpatient in the hospital will be more motivated to participate in&#xD;
      therapy as well as increase the amount of time they will work during that particular session&#xD;
      when a therapy dog is present during their sessions. The investigators will also be&#xD;
      collecting data regarding a child's heart rate and blood pressure prior to the session&#xD;
      starting and ending to determine if having a therapy dog present also helps relax a child.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a patient in the pediatric acute care&#xD;
      setting receiving Occupational Therapy (OT) services in adjunct with animal assisted therapy&#xD;
      (AAT) are more motivated to actively participate in the therapy session for a longer period&#xD;
      of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty inpatients will be recruited to participate in this study. This study will utilize a&#xD;
      randomized crossover study design where the patients act as their own control. The treatment&#xD;
      period for hospitalized patients will include an on off pattern of incorporating AAT into&#xD;
      their OT session. Patients' participation of therapy will be assessed with a participation&#xD;
      scale (see Figure 2) and the OT session time. Patients will be evaluated for OT and the&#xD;
      therapist will determine goals based on functional status and needs of the particular&#xD;
      patient. Goals will be determined by providing a functional evaluation based upon&#xD;
      Occupational Therapists clinical observation, developmental standards and current functional&#xD;
      level of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are potential candidates for this study will be hospitalized at Children's&#xD;
      Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota on the St. Paul campus. All inpatients stated to have&#xD;
      decreased functional skills that have been referred by a physician to OT will be invited to&#xD;
      participate this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have a difficult time participating in various therapies due to emotional stress,&#xD;
      anxiety, and feeling uncomfortable with the hospital environment. Limited studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the value of AAT used in conjunction with OT for children, regardless of&#xD;
      diagnosis within the hospital setting. Results of this study can justify the use of this&#xD;
      valuable therapy not only for the selected population, but also for other disciplines such as&#xD;
      physical and speech therapy.&#xD;
