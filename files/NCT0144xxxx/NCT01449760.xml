  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and in particular sport is beneficial to health. Nevertheless, some of&#xD;
      these activities may create a risk of injury. Ankle sprain is the most common sport related&#xD;
      injury. Sports that are causing the highest number of ankle sprains are: football (30%),&#xD;
      handball-basketball-volleyball-rugby (24%), gymnastics sports (6%), skiing (6%), cycling&#xD;
      (6%), athletics (4%) and contact sports (4%). A recent study in the Netherlands identified a&#xD;
      total of 1.3 million sports injuries. 47% of these patients required medical care. The total&#xD;
      costs (direct and indirect) were assessed 84.240.000 EUR per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective studies demonstrated that athletes with a ankle sprain have a twofold risk of&#xD;
      re-injury during the first year after the trauma, and in half of patients with an ankle&#xD;
      sprain recurrence this could lead to instability or chronic pain of the ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wii Balance Board 速 is a tool that is increasingly used in the field of health. In some&#xD;
      hospitals, therapists are beginning to use it for the rehabilitation of patients after&#xD;
      surgery, fractures or strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are asked to complete their physical therapy session by practicing &quot;sports&quot; via&#xD;
      video games such as skiing, bowling or hula hoop. Currently, there are no randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies that publish on the effectiveness of this tool. Recently, a study&#xD;
      investigated the efficacy of the Wii Balance Board 速 to improve balance, strength, joint&#xD;
      mobility and level of physical activity. After 10 weeks of training, people an increased&#xD;
      strength and balance was found. However, these results still require statistical&#xD;
      confirmation. Thus this objectives of this study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of exercise training with the Wii Balance Board 速 Platform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy (based on current guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare these two types of care (conventional physiotherapy versus Wii) to a control&#xD;
           group (non-treatment).&#xD;
