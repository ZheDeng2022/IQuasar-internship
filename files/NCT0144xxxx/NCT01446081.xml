  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced quality of life, fatigue, and loss of physical function are common in patients&#xD;
      getting chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The investigators completed a pilot&#xD;
      study showing that exercise during active chemotherapy for AML is feasible, safe, and may&#xD;
      improve symptoms and physical function. The investigators now propose to compare our&#xD;
      hospital-based supervised exercise program to usual care to see if exercise can improve&#xD;
      symptoms, physical function, and improve treatment tolerability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a life-threatening malignant blood disorder. Curative&#xD;
      treatment requires multiple cycles of intensive chemotherapy. The first cycle, induction, is&#xD;
      the most intense and intended to achieve complete disease remission (CR). Induction therapy&#xD;
      requires 4-6 weeks of inpatient admission and is associated with extended bed rest and&#xD;
      multiple toxicities, leading to physical deconditioning. Regular exercise during induction&#xD;
      may reduce declines in physical fitness, leading to improved quality of life (QOL), reduced&#xD;
      fatigue, improved tolerance of chemotherapy, and potentially greater survival. Four prior&#xD;
      studies of exercise in AML patients undergoing induction have suggested improvements in QOL,&#xD;
      fatigue, physical function, and treatment tolerability. However, all 4 studies suffered from&#xD;
      major limitations including small sample sizes, design limitations, generalizability&#xD;
      concerns, and limited safety information. The investigators conducted a pilot non-randomized&#xD;
      study in 35 AML patients and demonstrated feasibility, safety, and potential improvements in&#xD;
      QOL, fatigue, and physical fitness outcomes. The investigators now propose a rigorous&#xD;
      evaluation of the intervention in a phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives include: (1) To determine the efficacy of a supervised mixed-modality&#xD;
      exercise program during induction chemotherapy on QOL and fatigue; (2) To determine the&#xD;
      efficacy on physical fitness. Our secondary objective is to determine the efficacy on AML&#xD;
      treatment tolerability (hospital length of stay, development of sepsis, intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) admission, delays in consolidation chemotherapy).&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive an individualized, supervised mixed-modality exercise program created by a CSEP-Certified Exercise Physiologist (CEP). They will perform 30 minutes of light to moderate intensity exercise 4-5 times/week tailored to ability. Aerobic exercise will primarily consist of walking and/or stationary cycling. Resistance exercises will target large muscle groups using dumbbells, resistance bands, and stability balls. The CEP will monitor and document details of each exercise session as well as patient tolerance and symptoms, and make appropriate adaptations to ensure program safety and progression. Exercise intensity and duration will vary based on patient tolerance, symptoms and blood parameters. Exercise equipment will be carefully sanitized between each use.</description>
