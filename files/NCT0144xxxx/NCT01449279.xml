  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, open-label, pilot study of palliative radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
      combined with ipilimumab in patients with stage IV melanoma. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety of combining ipilimumab with palliative RT in patients with&#xD;
      Stage IV melanoma. Secondary objectives are a) to assess the induction of anti-melanoma&#xD;
      immune responses using laboratory correlative studies of T cell responses to melanoma&#xD;
      antigens, and b) to compare tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated&#xD;
      sites with responses in patients with Stage IV disease treated with ipilimumab alone on&#xD;
      expanded access study CA184045. In this study, ipilimumab will be administered as recently&#xD;
      approved by the FDA (3 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments). Palliative RT&#xD;
      will start within 2 days of the first ipilimumab dose. Patients will be seen at least every&#xD;
      12 weeks for follow-up following completion of ipilimumab therapy until progression of&#xD;
      disease by imaging criteria or increased symptomatology that requires another therapy. A&#xD;
      total of 20 patients with previously treated unresectable metastatic melanoma requiring&#xD;
      palliative radiation therapy will be treated on this pilot study over approximately 18&#xD;
      months. All subjects who receive study drug will be monitored for safety. Relevant tumor&#xD;
      imaging studies will be obtained at baseline, 2-4 weeks following the 4th/last dose of&#xD;
      ipilimumab, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. This study will provide the&#xD;
      safety data (and possibly early efficacy signals) needed to proceed with a randomized Phase&#xD;
      II study for proof of principle. If compelling data is obtained supporting this IT + RT&#xD;
      vaccine strategy, this approach will be extended to other solid tumor types.&#xD;

             be given a written informed consent document to read. Then, if subjects consent to&#xD;
             participate in the study, they will indicate that consent by signing and dating the&#xD;
             informed consent document in the presence of study personnel.&#xD;

                  to avoid conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last&#xD;
                  dose of investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is&#xD;
                  minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Sex and Reproductive Status&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy&#xD;
                  for the entire study and for up to 8 weeks after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
                  product.&#xD;

               -  Prior treatment with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody if treatment failure was due to&#xD;
                  adverse events (AEs). If a subject was discontinued from the prior anti-CTLA-4&#xD;
                  treatment due to an AE or serious adverse event (SAE), regardless of the type of&#xD;
                  event, that discontinuation constitutes an exclusion criterion. If AEs were&#xD;
                  serious enough to require a subject's withdrawal from prior treatment, the&#xD;
                  subject should be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A history of AEs with prior IL-2 or Interferon will not preclude subjects from&#xD;
                  entering the current study.&#xD;

                  disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are excluded from this&#xD;
                  study as are subjects with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid&#xD;
                  arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma]; systemic lupus&#xD;
                  erythematosus (SLE); autoimmune vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
                  physical (eg, infectious disease) illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  investigator, could make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or could&#xD;
                  obscure the interpretation of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases for&#xD;
                  up to 4 weeks before or after any dose of ipilimumab, with the exceptions of&#xD;
                  amantadine and flumadine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Central nervous system (CNS) metastases that require palliative radiation&#xD;
                  therapy; prior brain irradiation is allowed providing CNS disease is stable.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Chronic systemic corticosteroids (unless required for treating treatment emergent&#xD;
                  AEs or required for management of signs or symptoms due to brain metastases, upon&#xD;
                  discussion with BMS medical monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of&#xD;
        the study subjects and to ensure that the results of the study can be used. It is&#xD;
        imperative that subjects fully meet all eligibility criteria.&#xD;
