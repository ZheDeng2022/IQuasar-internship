      INTRODUCTION Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a serious health problems worldwide,&#xD;
      particularly in the southern Chinese population, with an incidence rate ranging from 15 to 50&#xD;
      per 100 000. NPC is an epithelial malignancy with a striking racial and geographic&#xD;
      distribution differences. High incidence rates are observed in the southeast Chinese&#xD;
      population, and similar rates have been reported in these people wherever they have migrated,&#xD;
      including Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. This incidence is almost 100 fold higher than in&#xD;
      white populations. The most unique feature of NPC is its almost universal association with&#xD;
      the infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is the first human virus identified to be&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of several malignancies and has a particularly close association&#xD;
      with NPC, as EBV genome can be detected in virtually all NPC cells. While radiotherapy has&#xD;
      been the first-line treatments for NPC, radio-resistance remains a significant clinical issue&#xD;
      for the NPC radiotherapy. Thus, there is unmet medical needs to discover and develop novel&#xD;
      radiosensitizers for NPC therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV infection in NPC is classified as type II latent infection in which only EBV nuclear&#xD;
      antigen-1(EBNA-1), latent membrane protein-1(LMP1), LMP2, and EBV early RNA (EBER)&#xD;
      expressions can be detected. Among these proteins, LMP1 is thought to play a key role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of NPC. As a 60kD integral membrane protein, LMP1 functions as a constitutively&#xD;
      active tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), and contributes to multiple aspects of NPC&#xD;
      through activating a number of signaling pathways including nuclear factor NF-κB, activator&#xD;
      protein-1(AP-1), and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription(JAK/STAT).&#xD;
      Activation of NF-kB or AP-1 by LMP1 has been linked to the upregulation of some cellular&#xD;
      proteins and inhibition of apoptosis. Depending on the cell types, expression of LMP1 has&#xD;
      been shown to play different roles in response to biological and physiological stimulus. It&#xD;
      acts as a primary oncoprotein for human cell immortalization and is also shown as the only&#xD;
      EBV-coded product that can transform rodent fibroblast cell line, human epithelial cells and&#xD;
      keratinocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the critical role of viral oncoproteins in transformation and apoptosis, suppression of&#xD;
      some viral oncoproteins would provide a sensible strategy to genetically treat NPC. Indeed,&#xD;
      antisense oligonucleotides against LMP1 or EBNA1 have been shown to inhibit viral oncoprotein&#xD;
      expression, induce apoptosis, and sensitize the EBV-positive cells to cytotoxic agents.&#xD;
      Recently, some experimental studies indicated that the RNA interference against LMP1&#xD;
      exhibited an anti-proliferative and anti-metastasis effect in LMP1 expressing NPCs. These&#xD;
      results suggested that EBV-encoded LMP1 may present a potential molecular target for&#xD;
      treatment of EBV-associated carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNAzymes are synthetic, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that can be engineered to bind&#xD;
      to their complementary sequence in a target messenger RNA (mRNA) through Watson-Crick base&#xD;
      pairing and cleave the mRNA at predetermined phosphodiester linkages. A general model for the&#xD;
      DNAzyme has been proposed, and is known as the ''10-23'' model. A ''10-23'' DNAzyme has a&#xD;
      catalytic domain of 15 deoxyribonucleotides, flanked by two substrate-recognition domains of&#xD;
      seven to nine deoxyribonucleotides at each arm. In vitro analyses showed that this type of&#xD;
      DNAzyme could effectively cleave its substrate RNA at purine: pyrimidine junctions under&#xD;
      physiological conditions. These agents have been used in a number of in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      applications to inhibit the expression of their target genes and the dependent genes. Their&#xD;
      capacity to block development of a diverse range of pathologies in animal models suggests&#xD;
      that DNAzymes can be used as therapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop EBV-LMP1 targeted DNAzymes for NPC treatment, we showed that the&#xD;
      phosphorothioate-modified ''10-23'' DNAzymes specifically targeted at the LMP1 mRNA could&#xD;
      significantly down-regulate the expression of LMP1 in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell (NPC)&#xD;
      and affected the down-stream pathways activated by LMP1, including the NF-κB pathway. It was&#xD;
      also demonstrated that suppression of the LMP1 expression by the LMP1-targeted DNAzyme DZ1&#xD;
      could enhance radiosensitivity both in vivo and vitro. Radio-resistance has been one of the&#xD;
      impediments in clinical settings for effective cancer therapy, which is thought to be&#xD;
      associated with multiple signaling pathways in different cancer types. ATM (ataxia&#xD;
      telangiectasia mutated) is a nuclear 350-kDa protein kinase with a carboxylterminal&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase domain[1]. It functions as a member of a&#xD;
      coordinated system that detects DNA breaks; arrests the cells temporarily at G1, S, or G2&#xD;
      checkpoints; and activates DNA repair. Cells lacking functional ATM protein show increased&#xD;
      sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and other genotoxic events. NF-κB (nuclear factor&#xD;
      kappa B) can activate a great number of genes involved in stress responses, inflammation, and&#xD;
      programmed cell death (apoptosis). P50 homodimers or p50/p65 or p50/c-Rel heterodimers bind&#xD;
      to the NF-κB DNA binding sites in the promoter regions of many stress-responsive genes,&#xD;
      suggesting a complex gene and physiological regulation network controlled by NF-κB in stress&#xD;
      response. The elevated basal NF-κB activity in certain cancers has been linked to tumor&#xD;
      resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. Inhibition of NF-κB blocked the adaptive&#xD;
      radioresistance. Our studies for the molecular mechanism of the LMP1-DNAzyme mediated&#xD;
      radiosensitization revealed that LMP1 activated the ATM expression through the NF-κB pathway&#xD;
      and inhibition of LMP1 expression by the DNAzyme attenuated the binding of NF-κB&#xD;
      transcription factor to the ATM promoter. Further evidence showed that the radiosensitivity&#xD;
      was recovered when the ATM expression was knocked down by siRNA in NPCs. Together, all our&#xD;
      data support our hypothesis and provide solid experimental basis for the use of LMP1-targeted&#xD;
      DNAzymes as potential radiosensitizers for treatment of the EBV-associated carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicological studies in mice showed that no morbidity or mortality was observed in any of&#xD;
      the dosing groups during the course of the study (50mg, 100mg, and 200mg/kg). All&#xD;
      hematological values and biochemistry results from tests of hepatic and renal function were&#xD;
      normal. No microscopic lesion that could be attributed to the modified DNAzyme&#xD;
      oligonucleotide treatment was found in liver, spleen and kidney in any groups. After i.v.&#xD;
      administration of 100 mg/kg DNAzyme oligonucleotide in mice, the peak plasma concentration of&#xD;
      24.13±2.6μg/ml was achieved. The decrease in plasma concentration of DNAzyme followed a&#xD;
      bi-exponential pattern with initial distribution half-life (t1/2α) of 0.18±0.03 h and a&#xD;
      terminal half-life (t1/2β) of 2.55±1.0 h, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve&#xD;
      (AUC) was 54.17±9.1μg.h/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This study will be a randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled Phase&#xD;
      I/II clinical trial. Forty (40) patients will be randomized to one of two groups of equal&#xD;
      size: placebo group receiving saline by intra-tumor injection and standard radiotherapy; or&#xD;
      DZ1 group receiving LMP1 DNAzyme (DZ1) and standard radiotherapy. The placebo group will&#xD;
      provide the basis for assessment of safety and efficacy of DZ1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive placebo or DZ1 injection two (2) hours prior to radical radiation therapy on&#xD;
      Monday and Thursday over seven weeks. The radical radiotherapy is given to patients 5 times&#xD;
      per week with 2 Gy of each treatment. The entire procedure lasts seven weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete the study at 104 weeks post-first injection. The patients will&#xD;
      undergo assessment and testing every week in the first seven weeks, then every three months&#xD;
      from the weeks 8 to week 104.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include evaluations of safety and tolerability:&#xD;
