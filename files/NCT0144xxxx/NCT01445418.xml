  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AZD2281 is an experimental drug in a class of agents called PARP inhibitors. PARP is a&#xD;
           protein that is -involved in repairing DNA damage; PARP inhibitors interfere with that&#xD;
           process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the optimum doses of AZD2281 and carboplatin that can safely be used in&#xD;
           patients with breast and ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the response of the tumor to the drug combination and determine the side&#xD;
           effects of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 18 years of age or older with breast or ovarian cancer who have a family history of&#xD;
      cancer or who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this dose escalation study, the first small group of patients receives the smallest&#xD;
           study doses of AZD2281 and carboplatin. Subsequent groups receive incrementally higher&#xD;
           doses of first AZD2281 and then carboplatin as long as the preceding group has not&#xD;
           experienced unacceptable side effects. When the highest safe dose is determined,&#xD;
           additional patients receive that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receive treatment in 21-day cycles as follows: AZD2281 by mouth twice a day&#xD;
           every day; carboplatin thorough a vein on day 8 of each cycle. Treatment may continue&#xD;
           until it is no longer beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations during treatment include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination 1 week after starting treatment and then every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests weekly for the first 4 weeks of treatment and then every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans or other imaging tests such as ultrasound or MRI every 6 weeks to evaluate the&#xD;
           tumor.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD2281 (KU-0059436) is an oral PARP-1 and PART-2 inhibitor that affects tumor growth by&#xD;
      impairing the ability of the cell to repair damaged DNA. Carboplatin causes covalent&#xD;
      cross-linking of DNA with stalled replication forks that would usually be repaired through&#xD;
      nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination (HR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sporadic breast (triple negative) and ovarian cancers have been shown to exhibit a BRCA1-like&#xD;
      phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRCA1/2 proteins have a critical function in the homologous DNA repair pathway. BRCA1/2&#xD;
      mutation carriers are at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, and increased risk of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Mutation carriers have been shown to have increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to DNA damaging agents, such as the platinums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRCA1/2 deficient cells have been shown to be sensitive to PARP inhibition alone and in&#xD;
      combination with DNA damaging agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining these two agents in a background of impaired HR in BRCA1/2 mutation potitive&#xD;
      malignancies may result in synergistic anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of AZD2281 and carboplatin in&#xD;
      BRCA1/2-associated or familial recurrent breast and ovarian cancer patients (cohort 1, Group&#xD;
      A), non-high risk serous ovarian cancer patients (Group B), and non-high risk triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer patients (Group C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine pharmacodynamics, estimates of biochemical changes in the apoptosis and PARP signal&#xD;
      transduction pathways in tumor and stromal cells in response to treatment of an expansion&#xD;
      cohort (cohort 2) at the MTD in a pilot fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with breast or ovarian CA that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard&#xD;
      curativetherapies do not exist or are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documented deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation or a BRCAPRO score of greater than or equal to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-high risk serous ovarian cancer (negative family history, BRCAPRO score of less than or&#xD;
      equal to 20% or negative BRCA1/2 mutation test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documented ER negative, PR negative, Her2neu negative breast cancer (negative family history&#xD;
      and/or BRCAPRO score less than or equal to 10% (or negative BRCA1/2 mutation test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or biological&#xD;
      therapy for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolling in cohort 2 must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive AZD2281 for days 1-7 of each 21 day cycle to maximize PARP inhibition&#xD;
      with carboplatin administration on day 2. Carboplatin will then be administered q3weeks and&#xD;
      with continuation AZD2281 BID on days 1-7 of each 21 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD2281 or carboplatin will be escalated sequentially in Cohort 1 (Groups A, B, and C), and&#xD;
      after the maximum tolerated dose is determined, Cohort 2 will be enrolled for assessment of&#xD;
      translational endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for toxicity in clinic every 3 weeks and every other cycle for&#xD;
      response using RECIST criteria. The clinic visit will be changed to every 4 weeks when&#xD;
      patients continue to stay on the study longer than two years with no or minimal disease.&#xD;
      Imaging studies will be obtained every 3 cycles for patients who stay on the study longer&#xD;
      than four years. The clinic visit will be changed to every two months (+/- 7 days) and the&#xD;
      imaging studies will be obtained every four months (+/- 7 days) for patients who stay on the&#xD;
      study longer than five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsies and plasma and serum samples will be obtained from patients in Cohort 2 before&#xD;
      treatment (biopsy mandatory), prior to treatment on cycle 2, day 1, and at time of disease&#xD;
      progression (biopsies optional). Tumor biopsies (optional) will also be taken from &quot;super&#xD;
      responders&quot; in Cohort 1 who have had a durable response longer than two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 84 and a maximum of 101 patients will be needed to achieve the objectives of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

        The effects of AZD on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because&#xD;
        platinum agents are known to be teratogenic, men and women of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
        agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
        abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
        woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
        should inform her treating physician immediately, Patients of child-bearing potential&#xD;
        should continue on contraception for at least three months following the last dose of&#xD;
        therapy on study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had chemotherapy, biological therapy, hormonal therapy (with the&#xD;
        exception of raloxifene or others approved for bone health) or radiotherapy within 4 weeks&#xD;

        28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known brain metastases diagnosed within 1 year should be excluded from this&#xD;
        clinical trail because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
        neurological dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse&#xD;
        events.&#xD;

        requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant and breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the&#xD;
