      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The risk for becoming addicted to drugs varies from person to person, even among those who&#xD;
      use similar drugs in a similar way. Studies suggest that certain personality traits seen in&#xD;
      people with drug addiction may be present before drug use. These traits include responding&#xD;
      differently to rewards or impulsivity. Early use of drugs (before age 15) is also associated&#xD;
      strongly with drug addiction later in life. Researchers want to study teenagers with and&#xD;
      without certain behavioral problems, including those who have used drugs and those who have&#xD;
      not. This may help them better understand behaviors that might predict future drug addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand brain function in teenagers who may be at a higher risk than others to drug&#xD;
      addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teenagers between 13 and 17 years of age who fit into one of four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have never or rarely used drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have never or rarely used drugs and have conduct or behavior disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have used drugs on many occasions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have used drugs on many occasions and have conduct or behavior disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, and physical and neurological&#xD;
           exams. They will also have blood and urine tests. Participants will answer questions&#xD;
           about past drug use and any current medications. They will also have a breathalyzer and&#xD;
           carbon monoxide breath test to check for recent drug and alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires four visits to the clinical center for magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (MRI) scans and other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first study visit will include training for the MRI scans. Participants will&#xD;
           practice the tasks in front of a computer and in a mock (fake) MRI machine. Participants&#xD;
           will also be asked several questions about their personality and past experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will test changes to tryptophan and dopamine levels. Both of these chemicals&#xD;
           affect decision making and brain function. On the three study visits, participants will&#xD;
           have the following tests in a randomly selected order. One study will be done at each&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans with changes to dopamine and tryptophan levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans with changes to dopamine only (with placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans with changes to tryptophan only (with placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored with frequent blood draws and other tests during the&#xD;
           study visits....&#xD;

      Background: Even under similar drug use patterns, the risk for drug addiction varies from&#xD;
      individual to individual. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this variability&#xD;
      are poorly understood and characterized. Studies suggest that certain traits observed in&#xD;
      substance dependent individuals may actually precede drug use, and could augur future&#xD;
      substance dependence. Understanding how the presence of these traits increases vulnerability&#xD;
      to substance addiction could aid in the development of early intervention, preventative&#xD;
      measures, as well as better treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary goal of this protocol is to improve our understanding of increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to developing substance addiction. We focus here on reward and punishment&#xD;
      learning, and impulse control, with an emphasis on the underlying role of dopamine and&#xD;
      serotonin function in these two cognitive functions. Further, given that cortical plasticity&#xD;
      is enhanced during childhood and adolescence, we begin to address whether early exposure to&#xD;
      substances enhances neurobiological changes that make an individual vulnerable to subsequent&#xD;
      substance addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: We focus on adolescents (13-17 years old) with known increased&#xD;
      vulnerability to substance addiction individuals with early exposure to substances, i.e. ,&#xD;
      those who have used drugs on multiple occasions before the age of 15, and those diagnosed&#xD;
      with conduct disorder and who are not as yet substance dependent, along with matched&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: This study involves cognitive, pharmacological and functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) testing in a mixed, within/between-subject design. Based upon power&#xD;
      analyses, we estimate needing 30 participants in each of 4 groups early exposure (EE),&#xD;
      conduct disorder (CD-NE), conduct disorder with early exposure (CD-EE), and controls with no&#xD;
      early exposure (NE) to complete the experiment. This is a within subjects, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, crossover design with participants tested before and after 1) cabergoline (D2&#xD;
      receptor agonist) treatment, 2) acute tryptophan depletion, and 3) placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures will be BOLD fMRI activation and behavioral&#xD;
      performance on various cognitive tasks that deal with impulse control and reward learning&#xD;
      before and after each of the three treatments listed above. Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      include gene x environment interactions and stress and novelty-seeking measures.&#xD;
