      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Thyroid hormone is produced by the thyroid gland, an organ at the base of the neck. Thyroid&#xD;
      hormone controls the body's metabolism and the function of many organs. The thyroid gland&#xD;
      produces two forms of thyroid hormone: T4 and T3. People who have thyroid cancer are treated&#xD;
      with thyroid hormone therapy (synthetic T4, levothyroxine), which at times needs to be&#xD;
      stopped to allow for cancer treatments. At these times, a different form of thyroid hormone&#xD;
      (synthetic T3, liothyronine) is used to reduce the symptoms caused by low levels of thyroid&#xD;
      hormone. Researchers want to know more about how changes in T3 hormone affect the body and&#xD;
      organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how changes in T3 hormone levels affect the body and organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have had most or all of their thyroid removed to&#xD;
      treat thyroid cancer who need to stop taking their regular thyroid hormone dose in&#xD;
      preparation for the treatment of thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study involves a screening visit and a baseline evaluation. It also includes an&#xD;
           11-day inpatient hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have blood tests and a neck ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be evaluated with a physical exam, blood tests, and the following&#xD;
           procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose tolerance test to measure blood sugar&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of body fat, muscle strength, and calorie burning levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies of the heart, liver, and thigh muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food preference and diet questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 4 weeks of treatment with T3 hormone, participants will have an 11-day inpatient&#xD;
           hospital stay to study the effect of thyroid hormone on their metabolism. The stay will&#xD;
           involve the same tests done in the baseline evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In human adults thyroid hormone action plays a critical role in the modulation of metabolism&#xD;
      and the function of virtually all organ/systems. The specificity of the hormonal action is&#xD;
      ultimately the result of the interaction of the active hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), with&#xD;
      the receptors isoforms and the co-activators and co-repressors specific for the various cells&#xD;
      target of the hormonal action. Circulating and tissue levels of T3 are the result of the&#xD;
      secretion of T3 and its precursor, thyroxine (T4), from the thyroid gland, the peripheral&#xD;
      conversion of T4 into T3, and the degradation of these hormones. This complex system has only&#xD;
      been partially studied in humans and very little is known regarding the kinetics of T3, and&#xD;
      in particular on the correlation between circulating levels of T3 and end-organ target tissue&#xD;
      thyroid hormone action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this protocol is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of T3 and its biological&#xD;
      effects at various concentrations in a cohort of thyroidectomized patients undergoing thyroid&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy withdrawal for the management of thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen patients with a clinical indication for thyroid hormone withdrawal in preparation for&#xD;
      131I therapy or 123I diagnostic scan for follow-up and management of differentiated thyroid&#xD;
      cancer will be recruited for this study. After enrollment in the study, the patients baseline&#xD;
      characteristics will be determined during an outpatient visit while receiving levothyroxine&#xD;
      (L-T4) therapy. The L-T4 therapy then will be suspended and substituted with an equivalent&#xD;
      thrice daily liothyronine (L-T3) therapy for one month. Patients will be admitted to the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center on the day prior to withdrawal of the T3 therapy until the diagnostic scan or&#xD;
      the administration of radioactive iodine. During the hospitalization for this research&#xD;
      protocol, which is expected to last eleven days, the following studies will be performed:&#xD;
      serial blood sampling for circulating thyroid hormones to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      of L-T3, lipids, glucose and insulin, resting energy expenditure, echocardiogram, skeletal&#xD;
      muscle strength measurement, cardiac, hepatic and skeletal muscles MRI, and quality of life&#xD;
      and well-being questionnaires. The pharmacokinetic parameters of L-T3 will also be assessed&#xD;
      with the first dose after the diagnostic scan or the administration of radioactive iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained from this study will help in understanding the effects of thyroid&#xD;
      hormone on metabolism, and may lead to important information on how to optimize the duration&#xD;
      of the thyroid hormone therapy withdrawal for the treatment of thyroid cancer.&#xD;
