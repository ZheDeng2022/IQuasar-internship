      The purpose of this research study is to look at two of the common forms of treatment for&#xD;
      this condition: physical therapy and epidural steroid injection. The investigators are&#xD;
      attempting to evaluate whether or not physical therapy alone, or epidural steroid injections&#xD;
      alone, are effective in treating this condition. The investigators will also try to determine&#xD;
      whether or not one of these treatments is better than the other for the treatment of&#xD;
      herniated discs with nerve injury (radiculopathy).&#xD;

      1. Potential research participants identified from clinic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  40 subjects will be enrolled in each group (TFESI and PT). An additional 40&#xD;
                subjects will be enrolled into the concurrent observational cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Appropriate study subjects will be identified upon initiation of care (MD&#xD;
                evaluation and/or physical therapy). They will have pain of less than or equal to&#xD;
                three months duration, within the current pain episode. This may be the initial&#xD;
                pain episode or the onset of a most recent episode of pain, preceded by at least a&#xD;
                six month pain free interval. They will have focal disc protrusion with correlating&#xD;
                radicular symptoms and possible radicular/neurological deficits. These radicular&#xD;
                symptoms/signs are defined as pain or paresthesias below the knee, pain&#xD;
                reproduction with straight-leg-raising and/or extension or quadrant maneuvers, and&#xD;
                radicular pattern sensory, reflex or strength changes. These symptoms will be&#xD;
                consistent with the level of nerve root impingement. Only subjects with&#xD;
                radiculopathy primarily at L5 and/or S1, due to pathology at L4-5 and/or L5-S1 disc&#xD;
                levels will be included. Those with canal and foraminal compromise due to disc&#xD;
                protrusion at L4-5 with L5 &gt; L4 signs and symptoms WILL be included. Those with&#xD;
                predominantly degenerative stenosis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, or&#xD;
                spondylolysis will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects also need to have an eleven point Likert pain scale score greater than or equal&#xD;
           to four. They will not have a history of prior epidural steroid injections within the&#xD;
           prior year or prior lumbar surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initial evaluation and study eligibility determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presentation of study to patient and informed consent obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Baseline pain and outcome measures evaluation (VAS, SF-36, ODI, GPC, PSAQ, physical&#xD;
           exam, work history, analgesic use log, and ancillary treatment log, lost productivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Upon entry to the study, baseline measurements of the patient's pain and function will&#xD;
           be established. The primary outcome measure for this study will be reduction in pain as&#xD;
           measured by a three day average Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary measures will&#xD;
           include: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), SF-36, a seven point Global Perception of&#xD;
           Change (GPC), a three question Patient Specific Activity questionnaire (PSAQ) (each&#xD;
           patient will list 3 cardinal activities of daily living that are restricted or rendered&#xD;
           impossible because of their pain and will score each item), and utilization of&#xD;
           analgesic, outside medical care, and surgical options, as well as physician physical&#xD;
           exam test parameters and lost productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Randomization to TFESI or PT group, if subject declines then inquire about enrolment in&#xD;
           the observational cohort. Participants in this group (Cohort) will chose their treatment&#xD;
           (per-protocol physical therapy, injections, or both) after consulting with their&#xD;
           physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Injection: Anesthetic/corticosteroid (per randomization); repeat 1-3 times if clinically&#xD;
           indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following drugs will be used for this procedure: 80mg Depo-Medrol and 1% lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These drugs used for the epidural injections are local anesthetic numbing medicines and&#xD;
           cortisone/steroid anti-inflammatory medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Physical therapy carried out per protocol; 2-3 times per week for a total of 12&#xD;
           treatment sessions (excluding initial evaluation, including exit evaluation, minimum&#xD;
           attendance 8/12) to be completed by 6 weeks from initiation of care (within study).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Please note: There will be another PT evaluation at the end of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. MD visit at intake evaluation, 4 weeks, 12 weeks,6 months, 12 months (additional phone&#xD;
           contact or prn follow up will be logged as additional care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pain and functional evaluations at: baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months&#xD;
           (VAS, SF-36, ODI, GPC, PSAQ, work history, analgesic use log, lost productivity and&#xD;
           ancillary treatment log).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At the 4 week follow-up, subjects who are not satisfied with treatment will be&#xD;
                provided the option to cross-over to the alternate treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will chose their treatment (per-protocol physical therapy,&#xD;
      injections, or both) after consulting with their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the procedures for this protocol are standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be asking participants if they are willing to be contacted regarding future research&#xD;
      studies that may be of interest to them.&#xD;
