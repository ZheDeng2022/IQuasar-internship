  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dietary supplements selenium and Q10 has been evaluated in a double blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study in an elderly Swedish population. The hypothesis is that as a&#xD;
      majority of Northern Europeans suffers insufficient levels of selenium that is used by the&#xD;
      cell in the building of at least 25 different enzyme systems in the body, and that the cell&#xD;
      need presence of Q10 in order to produce the selenium containing enzymes, we wanted to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of a combined intervention of the two supplements in an elderly&#xD;
      population in Sweden. All participants were controlled every 6 months, and the intervention&#xD;
      was 48 months in each participant. Besides blood samples, echocardiography and cardiac&#xD;
      natriuretic peptides were analyzed at start, every 6 months and at end of the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The amount of patients suffering from heart failure is increasing throughout the Western&#xD;
      hemisphere. The prognosis of heart failure is poor, in many cases worse than malignant&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated that by evaluating the plasma concentration of the&#xD;
      natriuretic peptides that are stimulated by increased wall tension of the myocardium, it is&#xD;
      possible to estimate the risk of cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific reports have demonstrated decreased symptoms of heart failure after selenium&#xD;
      supplementation. Selenium, which is acquired by the body through food, often exists in low&#xD;
      levels in the body in the northern parts of Europe due to poor levels of selenium in the&#xD;
      soil. Animal studies have shown that selenium has a positive effect on the myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ubiquinon, commonly called Q10, has a central position in many of the enzyme systems of the&#xD;
      body. It has recently been shown that the body requires the presence of Q10 to produce&#xD;
      selenium containing enzymes which are central in the energy handling processes of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the supplementation of selenium combined&#xD;
      with Q10 can influence heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in an elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1998 all people aged between 70-80 years living in the Kinda municipality in Sweden were&#xD;
      offered the chance to participate in an epidemiological study with an emphasis on heart&#xD;
      failure. Of the 1130 people living in the municipality in the specified age group, 871 agreed&#xD;
      to participate in the study. Participants have been questioned regarding a new patient&#xD;
      record, examined, new echocardiograms have been performed, blood samples drawn and health&#xD;
      related quality of life evaluated. These participants will also be offered the chance to&#xD;
      participate in a follow-up of this epidemiological study. In addition to this, they will be&#xD;
      offered the chance to participate in the present intervention study where they will be given&#xD;
      a dietary supplement of 200 microgram selenium/day and 200 milligram Q10/day, or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No serious side effects from these supplements have been observed in earlier studies using&#xD;
      the doses planned in this intervention study. The dietary supplements are sold without any&#xD;
      restrictions as over the counter products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study all participants will be followed-up with blood samples, a new patient&#xD;
      record, and new tablets every six months. Evaluation of health related quality of life will&#xD;
      be performed at inclusion, after 18 months and after 48 months. The quality of life will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the validated instrument SF-36. At the end of the study, new blood samples&#xD;
      and new echocardiograms will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To evaluate changes in primarily cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality , and&#xD;
      secondary, cardiac function as evaluated with cardiac natriuretic peptides and&#xD;
      echocardiography after dietary supplementation of selenium and Q10, or a placebo, in an&#xD;
      elderly population during 48 months of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of selenium and Q10 combined during&#xD;
      an intervention of 48 months. To measure the perceived health related quality of life during&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible health related economic consequences will be evaluated using the instrument EQ-5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint Development of cardiovascular disease, worsening of existing cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      and cardiovascular mortality during intervention with selenium and Q10 in comparison with&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change of concentration of natriuretic peptides during intervention with selenium and Q10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint Development of all-cause mortality during intervention with selenium and&#xD;
      Q10. Consumption of hospital resources during intervention with selenium and Q10 in relation&#xD;
      to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A prospective randomized double-blind placebo controlled study. Randomising The&#xD;
      randomising procedure will be performed using PharmaNord's computer assisted randomization in&#xD;
      blocks of 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study All participants will be offered a selenium-containing yeast preparation corresponding&#xD;
      to 200 micrograms of selenium/day, and ubiquinone corresponding to 200 milligrams/day, or a&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention period, blood samples will be drawn every six months from all&#xD;
      participants, and the following list of substances are to be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NT-proBNP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Thioredoxin&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thioredoxinreductase&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lipidperoxidase&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Panel of cytokines&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. &quot;New&quot; biomarkers for heart failure. All blood sample results will be blinded for both&#xD;
           the investigators and the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Individuals living in the municipality of Kinda, aged between 70-80 years&#xD;
      who have accepted participation in the study, and who are expected to fulfill a study period&#xD;
      of 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Recent myocardial infarction (within 4 weeks). Planned cardio-vascular&#xD;
      operative procedure within 4 weeks. Hesitation concerning if the candidate can decide for&#xD;
      him/herself whether to participate in the study or not, or if he/she understands the&#xD;
      consequences of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious disease that substantially reduces survival or where it is not expected that the&#xD;
      participant can cooperate for the full 4 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other factors making participation unreasonable, such as long/complicated transport to the&#xD;
      Primary Health Center where the project is managed, or drug/alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparations Coenzyme Q10 ( Bio-Quinon 200mg, PharmaNord, Vejle, Denmark) Selenium&#xD;
      (SelenoPrecise 200 microgram, PharmaNord, Vejle, Denmark) Placebo (PharmaNord, Vejle,&#xD;
      Denmark) All preparations will be ingested twice a day together with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparations will be supplied by PharmaNord, Vejle, Denmark. The preparations will be&#xD;
      stored in a locked, dry, dark room where only the personnel involved in the study will have&#xD;
      access. A rigorous log regarding received and delivered preparations will be kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant pharmacological treatment Participants who have been prescribed pharmacological&#xD;
      drugs due to concomitant diseases/medical conditions are advised to continue treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have been prescribed anticoagulants containing warfarin are advised to&#xD;
      continue treatment, but it is recommended that they analyze the INR at the start of the&#xD;
      intervention with selenium and Q10, and again after 2 weeks. Interactions between&#xD;
      selenium/Q10 and warfarin have been discussed in literature but have not been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where is the code list? The code list containing information of active treatment/placebo is&#xD;
      kept in a sealed envelope at PharmaNord, Vejle, Denmark, and the codes will not be broken&#xD;
      before the end of the study, or in the case of an emergency where information regarding the&#xD;
      intervention is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects Serious side effects should be reported to both the National Board of Health and&#xD;
      Welfare and PharmaNord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropouts Participants choosing to discontinue the study for any reason will be followed&#xD;
      according to the intention to treat principle. All dropouts will be registered, as well as&#xD;
      their reason for discontinuing participation, if the participant chooses to supply this&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who take supplements of selenium or Q10 for any reason outside the study will be&#xD;
      regarded as dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical permission Ethical permission shall be accepted from the Ethical Review Board before&#xD;
      the start of the study. Oral and written &quot;patient&quot; information will be given to all&#xD;
      participants, as well as a signed copy of the consent form .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permission from the Swedish Medical Products Agency Contact has been taken with the Medical&#xD;
      Products Agency in Sweden regarding permission to use the preparations during the&#xD;
      intervention. However, the principal investigator of the project has been orally informed by&#xD;
      the Agency that since this was not regarded as a trial of a medication, but rather of food&#xD;
      supplement commodities that are readily available as commercial goods, the Agency would not&#xD;
      review the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants 500-600 healthy individuals as well as patients treated for various diseases and&#xD;
      already participating in the former epidemiological heart failure study in the Kinda&#xD;
      municipality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic power calculation Using the assumption that the incidence of occurrences in the placebo&#xD;
      group during a follow up of 4 years is 40%, and 28% in the intervention group, i.e. a&#xD;
      difference in incidence between the groups of 30% and an absolute difference of 12%, 244&#xD;
      individuals are needed in order to obtain a statistical power of 80% with a significance&#xD;
      level of 5%. A dropout frequency of 15% is to be expected, which is why a minimum of 560&#xD;
      individuals is needed in order to obtain significant differences.&#xD;
