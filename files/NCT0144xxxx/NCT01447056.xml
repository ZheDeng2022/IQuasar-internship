  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of a lymph node cancer called lymphoma, a tumor of the nasal passages&#xD;
      called nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a tumor of a particular type of muscle called&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma (LMS) or a condition called severe chronic active EBV (SCAEBV) syndrome. The&#xD;
      disease has come back, may come back or has not gone away after treatment. This voluntary&#xD;
      research study uses special immune system cells called LMP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes,&#xD;
      a new experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with these diseases show evidence of infection with the virus that causes&#xD;
      infectious mononucleosis (called Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV) before or at the time of their&#xD;
      diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half of the patients with lymphomas, and&#xD;
      in some cases of NPC and LMS, suggesting that it may play a role in causing these diseases.&#xD;
      Those cancer cells (as well as some B cells in SCAEBV) that are infected by EBV are able to&#xD;
      hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction. We want to see if special white&#xD;
      blood cells, called T cells, that have been trained to kill cells infected by EBV can survive&#xD;
      in the blood and affect the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment with specially trained T cells has had activity against these viruses when the&#xD;
      cells are made from patients with those diseases (or, after bone marrow transplant, from the&#xD;
      patient's transplant donor). However, sometimes it is not possible to grow these cells; other&#xD;
      times, it may take 2 to 3 months to make the cells, which may be too long when one has an&#xD;
      active tumor. We are therefore asking if subjects would like to participate in this study,&#xD;
      which tests if blood cells from a donor that is a partial match with the subject (or the&#xD;
      transplant donor) that have been grown in the way described above can survive in the blood&#xD;
      and affect the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These LMP-specific CTLs are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, we will search our cell bank to see if there is a CTL line that is a match with the&#xD;
      subject and his/her donor. This matching is done using HLA type, which measures 6 proteins on&#xD;
      the cell surface. If HLA type has not been previously checked, we will do a blood draw (half&#xD;
      to one tablespoon) so that this can be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These CTL lines have been made at Baylor College of Medicine from donors for other transplant&#xD;
      patients or other normal donors from the National Marrow Donor Program. All donors have been&#xD;
      screened in the same way that we screen blood donors. When the CTL lines were made, blood was&#xD;
      taken from the donors and used to grow T cells. To do this, we first grew a special type of&#xD;
      cells called dendritic cells or monocytes and we put a specially produced human virus&#xD;
      (adenovirus) that carries the LMP genes into the dendritic cells or monocytes. They were then&#xD;
      used to stimulate T cells. This stimulation trained the T cells to kill cells with LMP on&#xD;
      their surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We then grew these LMP specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells (made from&#xD;
      the same blood). We also put the adenovirus that carries the LMP genes into these EBV&#xD;
      infected cells so that we increased the amount of LMP that these cells had. These EBV&#xD;
      infected cells were treated with radiation so they could not grow. Once we made sufficient&#xD;
      numbers of T cells, we tested them to make sure they kill cells with LMP on their surface and&#xD;
      froze them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make sure that these cells won't attack the subject's tissues, we will also test the cells&#xD;
      against his/her own cells, which we will grow in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the level of circulating T-cells in the patient is relatively high, s/he will receive one&#xD;
      treatment of cyclophosphamide. This drug will decrease the numbers of the patient's own&#xD;
      T-cells before the investigators infuse the LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. If the&#xD;
      patient is already receiving chemotherapy, this may not be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LMP specific CTLs will be thawed and injected IV over 1-10 minutes. Initially, one dose&#xD;
      of T-cells will be given. If after the first dose, there is a reduction in the size of the&#xD;
      patient's disease, they can receive up to five additional doses of the T-cells if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose escalation study, which means that the doses of cells will be increased as&#xD;
      more patients are treated, as long as the lower doses are determined to be safe.&#xD;
