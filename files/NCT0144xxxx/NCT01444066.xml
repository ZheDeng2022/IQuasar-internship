      The goal of our study is to determine if stretching the esophagus with a rubber dilator helps&#xD;
      patients with swallowing difficulties who have a normal appearing esophagus on upper&#xD;
      endoscopy. In order to do this we will perform a randomized controlled study, where patients&#xD;
      will undergo esophageal dilation (stretching) with different diameter dilators. We will&#xD;
      measure change in symptom severity between baseline (prior to dilation) and 1, 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months after the procedure&#xD;

      Dysphagia typically refers to the sensation of food being stuck in the throat or chest(&#xD;
      esophageal dysphagia) as well as difficulty with the initiation of swallowing (oropharyngeal&#xD;
      dysphagia). It is typically classified into oropharyngeal and esophageal dysphagia.&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal dysphagia is typically the result of neuromuscular disease as well as head and&#xD;
      neck malignancy and can be diagnosed on the basis of history and physical examination in most&#xD;
      cases. Patients with esophageal dysphagia can further be sub-classified into two groups;&#xD;
      those with obvious abnormality in the esophageal mucosa or motility on endoscopy and those&#xD;
      with normal findings on endoscopic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis and treatment of patients with dysphagia and abnormal findings on endoscopy has&#xD;
      been extensively studied and there are well-define practice guidelines availed on the&#xD;
      subject. In contrast to this the management strategy for the group of patients with&#xD;
      esophageal type dysphagia and a normal appearing esophagus on upper endoscopy (DNE) has been&#xD;
      a topic of controversy for over a decade. Those patients with DNE are thought to fall into&#xD;
      several categories, those with very subtle strictures and rings in the esophagus that are not&#xD;
      seen during endoscopy, as well as patients with non-erosive reflux disease, eosinophilic&#xD;
      esophagitis, primary motility disorders of the esophagus, and finally those with &quot;functional&quot;&#xD;
      dysphagia (in whom no cause can be identified). Several approaches have been advocated for&#xD;
      the evaluation and treatment of patients with DNE, including a trial of proton pump inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy, obtaining random biopsies to exclude eosinophilic esophagitis and non-erosive reflux&#xD;
      disease, referral for manometry and esophageal pH monitoring, as well as empiric esophageal&#xD;
      dilation with a large caliber bougie. Of these options empiric esophageal dilation with a&#xD;
      large diameter bougie has been the initial management approach recommended by the most recent&#xD;
      AGA guidelines as well as many experts in the field of esophagology, for the treatment of&#xD;
      DNE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial evidence for empiric esophageal dilation in patients with DNE came from a&#xD;
      retrospective study by Marshal et al, who found that 50% of patients experienced a sustained&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms following dilation with a large diameter bougie. This was followed by&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial by Colon and coworkers, who again found a significant benefit&#xD;
      to empiric esophageal bougie dilation. However, two randomized trials in the mid-2000's did&#xD;
      not find any benefit to empiric esophageal dilation; although the dilation methods used in&#xD;
      these studies differed from that used by Marshal and Colon et al. Despite these conflicting&#xD;
      results empiric dilation continues to be popular by community gastroenterologists, and is&#xD;
      perceived to be safe effective intervention for treating patients with DEN. A recent study by&#xD;
      Olson et al found that empiric dilation for DNE was performed more commonly then dilation for&#xD;
      dilation for esophageal strictures in the United States and is associated with a 0.65%&#xD;
      complication rate. Additionally, in the current era of financial pressure on the medical&#xD;
      community empiric dilation for DNE at the time of the first diagnostic upper endoscopy could&#xD;
      lead to a significant savings if it is effective in relieving symptoms; by obviating the need&#xD;
      for further diagnostic testing, medications and repeat endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind, our goal is to conduct a randomized controlled trial evaluating the role&#xD;
      of empiric dilation in patients with DNE, to help fill existing gaps in the medical&#xD;
      literature. Specifically, prior studies are lacking with regard to three important points.&#xD;
      First, esophageal manometry and pH monitoring were not uniformly performed on patients; this&#xD;
      testing is crucial to excluding esophageal motility disorders and non-erosive reflux disease,&#xD;
      which are thought to be causes of DNE. Second, esophageal biopsies were not performed in any&#xD;
      of the studies; this has become a standard part of the evaluation of all patients with DNE&#xD;
      over the past 5 years, as eosinophilic esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease can lead to&#xD;
      dysphagia and may be missed without microscopic examination of the esophageal mucosa.&#xD;
      Finally, none of the studies used a standardized and validated dysphagia questionnaire, such&#xD;
      as the Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire (MDQ) to evaluate symptoms.&#xD;
