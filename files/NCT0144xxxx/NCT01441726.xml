      Rationale: In Canada, as in most industrialized countries, Alzheimer's disease and other&#xD;
      related dementia are increasingly prevalent in older people. At an advanced stage,&#xD;
      institutionalization in a long-term care (LTC) setting will be the fate of a majority of&#xD;
      patients. A structured palliative care approach is increasingly used for cancer patients, but&#xD;
      is still rarely accessible in LTC institutions for older people with advanced or terminal&#xD;
      dementia. This approach should include a more systematic detection and treatment of pain and&#xD;
      other physical and psychological symptoms during the last weeks of life, as well as better&#xD;
      communications between patients, families and care staff, particularly relating to advanced&#xD;
      care directives. Objectives: The general objective of this study is to implement and evaluate&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary and multidimensional program of palliative and end-of-life care for older&#xD;
      persons with terminal dementia in LTC facilities. Methodology: The intervention program will&#xD;
      include five components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. daily involvement of a nurse from the regular staff in the LTC facility as a change&#xD;
           agent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. awareness sessions with administrators and staff on the importance of high quality&#xD;
           palliative care in dementia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a training program for physicians and all the staff involved in direct care of patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. systematic discussions with families and distribution to families of a document on&#xD;
           different aspects of palliative care in dementia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. systematic clinical care by regular staff for the control of pain, respiratory symptoms&#xD;
           and mouth care. The program will be implemented in two LTC settings (one in Quebec City&#xD;
           and one in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada), and results will be compared with the LTC&#xD;
           control settings where usual care will be applied without implementation of the program.&#xD;
