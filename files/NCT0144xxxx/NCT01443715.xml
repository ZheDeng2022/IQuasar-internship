  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is challenging for depressed adolescents and their families to access specialized mental&#xD;
      health services. A viable option is delivering treatment in the primary care clinic (PCC)&#xD;
      setting; however, few effective models are currently available. The overall aim of this study&#xD;
      is to assess in the pediatric PCC, the preliminary acceptability and feasibility of a novel&#xD;
      collaborative stepped care model of treatment for depressed adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interpersonal Psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A) is a guideline based treatment with&#xD;
      established efficacy focusing on reducing depression symptoms and current interpersonal&#xD;
      problems associated with depression. This stepped care model (SCIPT-A) first delivers a low&#xD;
      intensity 6 session plus two parent session adaptation of IPT-A, a treatment designed for&#xD;
      mild to moderate adolescent depression with impairment. The second phase in the model is for&#xD;
      adolescents with persistent depressive symptoms who will receive 8 more sessions of IPT-A in&#xD;
      combination with the addition of an antidepressant. The social worker clinicians (SW)&#xD;
      currently employed in the PCC will be trained to deliver the Brief Interpersonal&#xD;
      Psychotherapy for adolescents (BIPT-A)and in the second phase, the pediatrician will provide&#xD;
      the medication treatment in collaboration with the SW clinician continuing to provide IPT-A.&#xD;
      Fifty adolescents identified by their primary care pediatrician and meeting criteria for&#xD;
      DSM-IV major depression, dysthymic disorder, or depression, not otherwise specified will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either treatment as usual (TAU) or the SCIPT-A model of stepped&#xD;
      collaborative depression care in the PCC for 16 weeks. TAU consists of pediatrician referral&#xD;
      of depressed adolescents to either a psychologist, social worker or child psychiatrist within&#xD;
      the clinic or to another mental health agency in the community. All adolescents will be&#xD;
      administered clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires during the 16 week protocol&#xD;
      to assess treatment acceptability, feasibility, safety and preliminary change in symptoms.&#xD;
      The project will provide information concerning the feasibility and acceptability of this&#xD;
      treatment model for adolescent depression delivered by pediatricians and social work&#xD;
      clinicians in pediatric primary care practice.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will demonstrate the feasibility of the model by calculating the proportion of: 1) adolescent who attend SCIPT-A sessions, 2) adolescents stepped to Phase II who attend their pediatric appointments for medication management, 3) adolescents in Phase II who accepted and followed the medication treatment recommendation, 4) social workers' who were willing and able to learn the SCIPT-A model as demonstrated by displaying fidelity to the treatment model.</description>
