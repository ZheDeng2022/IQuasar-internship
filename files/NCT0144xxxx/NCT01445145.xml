  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Few resources exist for helping adolescents and young adults with cancer or HIV disease&#xD;
           understand their changing physical, emotional and social needs when treatment is no&#xD;
           longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An advance directive document called Five Wishes has had particular success with the&#xD;
           adult population because of the consideration of personal, emotional and spiritual needs&#xD;
           in addition to medical and legal concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To learn which questions in Five Wishes are useful for adolescents and young adults and to&#xD;
      then create a new document that reflects the issues they feel are most appropriate for people&#xD;
      with cancer or HIV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adolescents and young adults 16 to 30 years of age with advanced cancer or HIV disease&#xD;
      acquired perinatally or early in life and enrolled in an active NIH treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1: Participants go through each question in Five Wishes and respond to whether&#xD;
           they feel the questions are useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2: Participants are asked to compare each question from Five Wishes to a newly&#xD;
           developed document based on the feedback received during first stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are enrolled for either Stage 1 or Stage 2 depending on the date they enter&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discussing end of life (EoL) care with adolescents and young adults can be one of the&#xD;
           most difficult aspects of living with a life threatening disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Few established resources exist to aid this population in accepting and understanding&#xD;
           their changing physical, emotional and social needs when treatment is no longer&#xD;
           effective. Standards in palliative care suggest that discussion of end of life issues be&#xD;
           routine and commence soon after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While many helpful documents exist to facilitate such conversations with adults, few&#xD;
           address the particular concerns and needs of adolescents and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One advance directive (AD) document, Five Wishes, has had particular success with the&#xD;
           adult population because of the consideration of 'personal, emotional and spiritual&#xD;
           needs' in addition to medical and legal concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if adolescents and young adults living with advanced cancer or HIV disease&#xD;
           feel that an AD document, such as Five Wishes, is useful in addressing end of life&#xD;
           issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop and perform a pilot evaluation of a modified age-appropriate advance care&#xD;
           planning tool for young adults and adolescents based on Five Wishes that reflects the&#xD;
           participants opinions on which questions they feel are most useful and additional items&#xD;
           that might be helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: 16 to 30 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known metastatic, progressive or recurrent cancer or HIV disease acquired perinatally or&#xD;
           early in life and enrolled in an active NIH treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -A descriptive study of attitudes of young adults (16-30 years) with cancer or HIV disease&#xD;
      concerning the questions contained in the AD document Five Wishes as well as a comparison&#xD;
      between Five Wishes and a modified version of that document.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients less than 18 years of age must have a score of 40 or higher on&#xD;
             Lanksy/Karnofsky, as determined by the medical team at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients greater than 18 years of age must have a score of 3 or less on the Eastern&#xD;
             Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale (ECOG PS) at the time of&#xD;

             interfere with the study procedures or results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously identified cognitive impairment which in the judgment of the Principal or&#xD;
             Associate Investigator would compromise the patient s ability to understand the Five&#xD;
             Wishes material or is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant, systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac,&#xD;
             pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction) which in the judgment of the research&#xD;
             team would compromise the patient s ability to tolerate this study&#xD;
