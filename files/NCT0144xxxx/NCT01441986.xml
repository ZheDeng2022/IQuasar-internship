  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate that dextromethorphan (DXM) and amantadine&#xD;
      compared to placebo exert blood glucose (BG) lowering effects following an oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT) in male subjects with T2DM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia due to an impaired insulin&#xD;
      activity (insulin resistance) or a reduced insulin production by the pancreas. The&#xD;
      restoration of adequate insulin secretion represents one of the goals of several antidiabetic&#xD;
      therapies such as sulfonylureas or incretin mimetics. Lowering blood glucose in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevents complications, microvascular complications in particular.&#xD;
      Weight reduction is also a fundamental target in the treatment of T2DM; however, achieving&#xD;
      weight loss through lifestyle measures is difficult, and the problem of obesity is often&#xD;
      exacerbated by therapy with glucose-lowering agents such as insulin, that cause weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic ß- cells are part of the pancreatic islets, of which 1-2 millions are located&#xD;
      within the human pancreas. Interestingly, pancreas function is controlled in part by the&#xD;
      central nervous system and ß- cells have many features in common with neurons, including the&#xD;
      expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neural guidance molecules, such as Eph receptors and&#xD;
      ephrins, neural cell adhesion molecules, such as N-Cadherin and NCAM (Neural Cell Adhesion&#xD;
      Molecule), and NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)-type glutamate receptors. Thus, it has been&#xD;
      hypothesized that some drugs available for manipulating the central nervous system(CNS) may&#xD;
      also act on the pancreatic ß- cells and may be of use for T2DM and MODY treatment. NMDA&#xD;
      receptors represent key targets for drugs against several neuronal diseases with&#xD;
      excitotoxicity as a contributing mechanism, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer disease, as&#xD;
      well as for the therapy of CNS-controlled disease symptoms, such as coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamate NMDA receptors are transmembrane, excitatory cell surface receptors at the level of&#xD;
      the CNS and pancreatic islets. NMDA antagonists thus exert a preponderantly antiexcitatory&#xD;
      effect on the CNS and decrease the central activation of the adrenal gland. This potentially&#xD;
      leads to indirect effects on pancreatic cells and insulin secretion, but even direct effects&#xD;
      on pancreatic ß-cells have been suggested by the antagonism of pancreatic NMDA receptors.&#xD;
