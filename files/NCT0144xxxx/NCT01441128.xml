      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - PF-02341066 and PF-00299804 are drugs that specifically target certain proteins that may be&#xD;
      more active in cancer cells than normal cells, in particular in non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      Both drugs seem to be able to stop the growth of or kill cancer cells. Researchers want to&#xD;
      combine them to see if they are a safe and effective treatment for advanced non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of PF-02341066 and PF-00299804 for advanced non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age with advanced non-small cell lung cancer that has not&#xD;
      responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests, and imaging studies. Heart and lung function tests and an&#xD;
           eye exam may also be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first cycle of treatment will be 28 days. Every cycle after the first will be 21&#xD;
           days. Participants may have up to 17 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take both study drugs as tablets. Twelve hours after the first dose,&#xD;
           participants will take only the PF-02341066. This dose schedule will remain the same&#xD;
           throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored with frequent blood and urine tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
           Tumor biopsies will be taken as needed. Those in the study will keep a diary to record&#xD;
           any symptoms or side effects of taking the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 17 cycles of treatment, or after stopping the study drugs early for any other&#xD;
           reason, participants will have a final followup visit.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 85% of lung cancer is defined histologically as NSCLC and the majority of&#xD;
           patients present with inoperable locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV)&#xD;
           disease for which no curative treatment is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with disease progression on or after first-line treatment with platinum-based&#xD;
           doublets may be candidates for second-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent evidence strongly implicates EGFR activating somatic mutations as a mechanism of&#xD;
           tumorigenesis and a determinant of sensitivity to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite the dramatic initial response to gefitinib and erlotinib, about 50% of NSCLC&#xD;
           tumors develop resistance due to secondary activating mutations in EGFR itself,&#xD;
           including the EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation, and more than 20% of acquired resistance&#xD;
           is due to an increase in mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is evidence from a limited number of tumors from patients with acquired resistance&#xD;
           to EGFR-TKIs that both T790M and cMET resistance mechanisms can occur in the same&#xD;
           patient at different metastatic sites and even in different fractions of the same&#xD;
           lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumors with acquired resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib might be vulnerable to a&#xD;
           combination of PF-00299804 a second generation EGFR TKI which is also an inhibitor of&#xD;
           T790M mutation, and PF-02341066 which is an inhibitor of c- Met/Hepatocyte Growth Factor&#xD;
           Receptor (HGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of combined PF-02341066 plus&#xD;
&#xD;
      PF-00299804 in patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the overall safety and tolerability, plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical&#xD;
           activity of combined PF-02341066 plus PF-00299804.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze potential predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in tumor and blood in&#xD;
           patients with advanced NSCLC who have acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation Phase: Adults with histologically documented diagnosis of NSCLC that is&#xD;
           locally advanced or metastatic, after failure of either at least one chemotherapy&#xD;
           regimen or treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion Phase: Adults with histologically documented diagnosis of NSCLC that is&#xD;
           locally advanced or metastatic, with acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib, and&#xD;
           must have one lesion amendable to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All pathology samples will be reviewed at the NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized trial of combined oral PF- 02341066&#xD;
           and oral PF-00299804 in patients with advanced NSCLC. Trial consists of two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Escalation Phase: Patients will be treated with varying doses of combined PF-&#xD;
           02341066 plus PF-00299804. Tumor biopsy is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion Phase: Two expansion cohorts will run concurrently following completion of the&#xD;
           Dose Escalation Phase. Both cohorts will enroll patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic NSCLC with acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib, which is defined as&#xD;
           progression following an initial response (complete or partial) or stable disease for at&#xD;
           least six months while on erlotinib or gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose escalation phase and the dose expansion phase can run concurrently insofar as&#xD;
           the dose expansion phase can enroll before completion of the dose escalation phase&#xD;
           provided that the dose used in the expansion phase has already been tested in the&#xD;
           escalation phase and has been declared safe; i.e., for each specific safe dose the&#xD;
           escalation phase is followed by the expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy is mandatory for Expansion Phase entrance, however, all patients will be&#xD;
           treated with study drugs irrespective of the biomarker identified which will be analyzed&#xD;
           retrospectively. The mandatory biopsy in the Expansion Phase is necessary in order to&#xD;
           identify acquired mutations that change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion cohort 1 will continue to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK of the drug&#xD;
           combination PF-02341066 plus PF-00299804.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion cohort 2 will enroll patients who are either untreated by prior PF- 00299804&#xD;
           or who have progressed on single agent PF-00299804 administered in an ongoing clinical&#xD;
           trial. Patients who are previously untreated with PF-00299804 will be treated&#xD;
           sequentially; i.e., first with single agent PF-00299804 until progression, then with the&#xD;
           combination of PF-02341066 plus PF-00299804. Those who progressed with single agent&#xD;
           PF-00299804 on another clinical trial will be treated with the combination PF-02341066&#xD;
           plus PF-00299804.&#xD;

             ketoconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, indinavir, nefazodone,&#xD;
             amprenavir, delavirdine, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, diltiazem, verapamil and&#xD;
             grapefruit juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of drugs that are known potent CYP3A4 inducers within 12 days prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication, including but not limited to carbamazepine, phenobarbital,&#xD;
             phenytoin, rifabutin, rifabutin, rifampin, tipranavir, ritonavir, and St. John s wort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices,&#xD;
             including but not limited to pimozide, aripiprazole, triazolam, ergotamine and&#xD;
             halofantrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of drug that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism including&#xD;
             S-metoprolol, propafenone, timolol, amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine,&#xD;
             imipramine, paroxetine, haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine, codeine, flecainide,&#xD;
             mexilletine, tamoxifen, venlafaxine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6, substrate is allowed if medically indicated and no suitable&#xD;
        alternative anti-tussive medication is available. However, the dose of dextromethorphan may&#xD;
        need to be modified. In a clinical study in healthy volunteers who were extensive&#xD;
        metabolizers (A7471039) PF-00299804 increased mean total exposure (AUC(last) and C(max)) of&#xD;
        dextromethorphan 855% and 874%, respectively, following concomitant administration with&#xD;
        PF-00299804 45 mg compared to exposure of administration of dextromethorphan alone.&#xD;
        Extensive metabolizers comprise approximately 80% of the population, with ultra-,&#xD;
        intermediate-, and poor-metabolizers accounting for the remaining portion of the general&#xD;
        population. Therefore, if no alternative is available dextromethorphan dosing should be&#xD;
        initiated at a lower dose (approx 25%) with close monitoring of patient clinical status.&#xD;
        Dose increases or decreases of dextromethorphan may be considered based upon individual&#xD;
        patient tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lidocaine may be used systemically with clinical monitoring (including telemetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Opiates such as morphine, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and tramadol can be used&#xD;
        as substitutes to replace codeine. Use of these opiates should be monitored for altered&#xD;
        analgesic effect during treatment as they may be partly metabolized by CYP2D6.&#xD;
