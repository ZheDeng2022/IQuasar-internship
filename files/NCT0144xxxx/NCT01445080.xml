    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib in treating&#xD;
      young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or leukemia. Sorafenib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking&#xD;
      blood flow to the cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of sorafenib in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia can tolerate&#xD;
      the MTD of sorafenib for solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the tolerability, active N-oxide metabolite, pharmacodynamics, and activity of&#xD;
      sorafenib a the MTD in a subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and FLT3-ITD&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the toxicities of this drug in these patients. V. Determine the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug within the confines of a&#xD;
      phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the biologic effect of sorafenib on circulating endothelial cells (CEC),&#xD;
      circulating CEC precursors (CECP), VEGF, and VEGF-2 in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the gene expression, proteomic profile, and ERK phosphorylation in blasts of&#xD;
      patients with refractory leukemia treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the effect of sorafenib on solid tumor vascularity and tumor blood flow using&#xD;
      dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DEMRI) in patients with measurable soft tissue tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Analyze tumor samples and leukemic blasts for the presence of ras, raf, or FLT3&#xD;
      (leukemias) mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Analyze the plasma inhibitory activity for FLT3 phosphorylation in peripheral blood of&#xD;
      patients with AML and FLT3-ITD mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Determine the tolerability, pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and sorafenib?s active N-oxide&#xD;
      metabolite, pharmacodynamics, and activity of sorafenib administered at the MTD for&#xD;
      refractory leukemias in a subset of patients with AML and FLT3-ITD mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Analyze the plasma inhibitory activity for FLT3 phosphorylation in peripheral blood&#xD;
      samples obtained at the time of PK studies in patients with FLT3-ITD mutation AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      diagnosis (malignant solid tumor vs leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM I(REFRACTORY SOLID TUMOR PATIENTS): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of&#xD;
      sorafenib until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT). Once the MTD is determined, up to 6 additional patients under 12 years of age may be&#xD;
      treated at the MTD. The MTD dose level is also expanded to enroll up to 6 patients with&#xD;
      refractory leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM II (REFRACTORY LEUKEMIA PATIENTS): A cohort of 3-6 patients with leukemia receives&#xD;
      treatment as in stratum 1 at the MTD determined in stratum 1. If 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience a DLT at the solid tumor MTD, sorafenib is reduced by one dose level. The leukemia&#xD;
      MTD is defined as the dose at which &lt; 1/3 of patients experience DLT during course 1 of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM III (ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA AND FLT3-ITD MUTATION PATIENTS): Patients receive&#xD;
      sorafenib as in stratum 1 at the MTD determined in stratum 2. Patients undergo blood sample&#xD;
      collection for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (in leukemia blasts only), circulating&#xD;
      endothelial cells (CEC), circulating CEC precursors (CECP), VEGF and VEGF-2 , gene&#xD;
      expression, proteomic profile, ERK phosphorylation, and FLT3 phosphorylation activity. Tumor&#xD;
      tissue samples may also be analyzed for the presence of ras, raf, or FLT3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;

            <description>Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Once the MTD is determined, up to 6 additional patients under 12 years of age may be treated at the MTD. The MTD dose level is also expanded to enroll up to 6 patients with refractory leukemia.</description>

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Once the MTD is determined, up to 6 additional patients under 12 years of age may be treated at the MTD. The MTD dose level is also expanded to enroll up to 6 patients with refractory leukemia.</description>

The SAE table reflects NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEs) submitted by the institution via expedited reporting (NCI AdEERs / CAeRs). All remaining CTCAEs collected by means other than expedited reporting are non-serious and are reported in the &quot;AE Other&quot; table. Ineligible patients are excluded from reporting of adverse events. All-Cause Mortality includes all deaths collected on the study.</desc>
