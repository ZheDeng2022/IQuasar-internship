  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are adapting Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT-A) for adolescents who are&#xD;
      referred to emergency services either for a suicide attempt or for being evaluated as high&#xD;
      risk for suicidal behavior. The investigators will recruit 15 adolescents ages 12-19 years&#xD;
      who present with a diagnosis of major depression, dysthymic disorder, depression disorder not&#xD;
      otherwise specified who have a history of a suicide attempt in the past 2 months or a&#xD;
      non-medically lethal attempt that may require psychiatric hospitalization, suicide attempt&#xD;
      that is or report current suicidal ideation with a plan/intent, and treat them in an open&#xD;
      clinical trial. The treatment will be conducted twice weekly for the first 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment and then weekly for the remaining 12 weeks of the study. Using feedback from&#xD;
      clinicians and participants, the investigators will make further modifications to the manual&#xD;
      in preparation for conducting a larger controlled clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All treatment will be done on the Children's Day Unit (CDU) and the adolescent and his/her&#xD;
      family need to agree to participate in the CDU program. The acute phase is biweekly for 8&#xD;
      weeks followed by weekly sessions for the remaining 12 weeks to allow for continued work on&#xD;
      the skills and for consolidation of skills to prevent relapse. It is a total of 28 sessions&#xD;
      in 20 weeks. There also are up to 4 additional emergency sessions that can be used to handle&#xD;
      crises or have additional parent sessions during those 20 weeks. In addition, the child and&#xD;
      adolescent psychiatrist will evaluate each study participant in terms of presently prescribed&#xD;
      medication or for the need to initiate pharmacological treatment which will follow the&#xD;
      evidence based medicine recommendations for pediatric psychopharmacology (Walkup et al.,&#xD;
      2009). The child and adolescent psychiatrist will see each study participant weekly for&#xD;
      monitoring of illness severity and medication management. Over the course of the 20 week&#xD;
      treatment, the investigators will assess their diagnosis, global functioning, severity of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, and family factors. At each therapy session, the&#xD;
      adolescents will be assessed for suicidal behavior by their clinician. They also will be seen&#xD;
      every 4 weeks by an independent evaluator who will track their symptoms and functioning at&#xD;
      weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 or early termination and week 32 follow-up assessments. The open trial&#xD;
      will allow us to determine the feasibility of recruiting depressed and suicidal youth. It&#xD;
      also will allow us to determine the benefits of using IPT-A to treat depressed and suicidal&#xD;
      youth.&#xD;
