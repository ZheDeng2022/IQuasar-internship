  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis lead to cardiovascular diseases and are an indirect cause&#xD;
      of increased death rate in the general population. This association is still more evident in&#xD;
      specific subpopulations, like patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially&#xD;
      hemodialysis (HD) patients, due to a higher prevalence of lipid disturbances and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis compared to the general population. Cardiovascular events in CKD patients are&#xD;
      frequently associated with traditional risk factors, including diabetes, male sex,&#xD;
      hypertension, dyslipidemia and advanced age. However, these factors failed to fully account&#xD;
      for the increased risk of cardiovascular events in CKD. The efforts are made to identify new&#xD;
      risk factors that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and participate in causes&#xD;
      of cardiovascular death. In 2003, there were identified peptides designated salusin-alpha and&#xD;
      salusin-beta. Development of atherosclerosis may be suppressed by salusin-alpha.&#xD;
      Salusin-alpha may have a lipid lowering effect, similar to that of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 1) salusin-alpha is associated with lipid&#xD;
      metabolism of HD patients (without or with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus),&#xD;
      similarly or not like in healthy or obese subjects; 2) treatment with atorvastatin and its&#xD;
      effects are associated with changes in plasma salusin-alpha concentration, if so - whether it&#xD;
      is dependent on the direct influence of atorvastatin on salusin-alpha or associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in serum lipid level; 3) salusin-alpha may predict mortality in HD patients.&#xD;

      Purpose I, step 1. To investigate whether plasma salusin-alpha is associated with lipid and&#xD;
      lipid-related abnormalities in hemodialysis (HD) patients, plasma salusin-alpha&#xD;
      concentration, expression of receptor CD36 on macrophages, serum lipid parameters,&#xD;
      anthropometric and laboratory indices of nutrition and biomarkers of inflammation will be&#xD;
      cross-sectionally analyzed. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients there is a close&#xD;
      association between atherosclerosis (A), malnutrition (M) and inflammation (I), known as MIA&#xD;
      syndrome, so interactions between all these parameters will be obviously present and should&#xD;
      be taken into account. In addition, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance&#xD;
      (HOMA-IR) will be applied as insulin resistance is a metabolic abnormality occurring in&#xD;
      advanced CKD, in metabolic syndrome shown in about 50% of HD patients and diabetic mellitus&#xD;
      (DM), being a cause of CKD in approximately 40% of cases. Results of correlations and&#xD;
      associations shown in HD patients will be compared with those of healthy controls and obese&#xD;
      persons with normal renal function for evaluation of salusin-alpha relationships under&#xD;
      different metabolic conditions, which may exert not uniform influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD patients (n = 200) Obese persons (n = 50) Controls (n = 60)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history (with special attention for demographics - age, gender, cause of CKD, renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy vintage, changes in body weight, habits and data required for inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination (with special attention for skin abnormalities related to lipid&#xD;
      disturbances and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric indices:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  directly measured: height, body weight, hip and waist circumferences, midarm&#xD;
           circumference (MAC), triceps skin fold thickness (TSF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  calculated or estimated: hip to waist ratio (WHiR), height to waist ratio (WHeR), body&#xD;
           mass index (BMI), in HD patients - dry body weight (DBW) Laboratory parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apolipoprotein B (APO B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cholesterol - total&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cholesterol HDL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cholesterol LDL directly measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD36&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Free fatty acids (FDA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HOMA-IR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin 6 (IL-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  L-carnitine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipoprotein(a)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salusin-alpha&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triglycerides&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic serum biochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose I, step 2. HD patients suffering from type 2DM or having metabolic syndrome (MeS) are&#xD;
      at risk of more severe lipid abnormalities than the remaining ones. Data collected in Step 1&#xD;
      will be helpful in diagnosis of MeS in the examined HD patients. The investigators expect&#xD;
      that also in controls they will find persons with abnormal serum lipid profile. Differences&#xD;
      inside these both groups may influence plasma salusin-alpha levels and the examined&#xD;
      associations. Thereby, the following groups will be analyzed separately and compared to each&#xD;
      other:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HD patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group with MeS and with type 2 DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group only with MeS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group only with type 2 DM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group without MeS and without DM&#xD;
&#xD;
      For controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group without detected serum lipid abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group with detected serum lipid abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of correlations/associations found in the cross-sectional study will be done in&#xD;
      the prospective studies (Purpose II) and at the final analysis (Purpose III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose II. The treatment with atorvastatin lowers serum LDL cholesterol in HD patients.&#xD;
      Using this statin during the study, the investigators can observe dynamic changes in serum&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol in HD patients with known plasma salusin-alpha concentration before&#xD;
      atorvastatin medication. With repeated salusin-alpha measurements during continued&#xD;
      atorvastatin treatment the investigators can follow concomitantly occurring (or not&#xD;
      occurring) changes in plasma salusin-alpha concentrations, which can be related to&#xD;
      atorvastatin directly or to its LDL cholesterol lowering effect. To elucidate this aspect,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to examine hyperlipidemic HD patients treated with a prescribed diet&#xD;
      and increased physical activity as well as obese persons (not taking lipid lowering&#xD;
      medication) during weight lowering therapy, which usually decreases lipidemia. Results of&#xD;
      these persons may give the answer whether a decrease in lipidemia without pharmaceutical&#xD;
      medication leads (may be also leads) to changes in plasma salusin-alpha concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study is planned in two groups of persons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD patients, participating in Step 1 (n = 200), Obese persons, participating in Step 1 (n =&#xD;
      50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose III. Annual mortality rate in HD patients is 10 - 15%. LDL cholesterol and total&#xD;
      cholesterol are predictors of mortality in end-stage renal disease patients. If salusin-alpha&#xD;
      is associated with lipid abnormalities, it is a reasonable to check whether this peptide may&#xD;
      be a predictor of mortality in HD patients. To investigate this aspect the investigators plan&#xD;
      to perform the analysis of HD patients outcome after two years from the first salusin-alpha&#xD;
      determination and to check whether there is any association between plasma salusin-alpha&#xD;
      concentration and death from cardiovascular events and all cause death.&#xD;
