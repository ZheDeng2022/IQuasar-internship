  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental materials with antibacterial properties can prevent the harmful effects caused by oral&#xD;
      cariogenic bacteria. This double-blind controlled clinical trial evaluated the performance of&#xD;
      antibacterial cement for sealing infected dentin in atraumatic restorations of primary&#xD;
      molars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study enrolled 45 children (45 teeth) between 5 and 8 years of age, of both genders,&#xD;
      divided into two groups. In group A (GA; n=22), the cavities were lined with conventional&#xD;
      glass ionomer cement (Vidrion F®) and in group B (GB; n=23), with antibacterial cement&#xD;
      (Vidrion F® containing 1% each of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefaclor). Both groups&#xD;
      were restored with Ketac Molar Easymix®. Molars with carious lesions on the inner half of&#xD;
      dentin without clinical or radiographic pulp damage were selected. Patients were evaluated&#xD;
      clinically (for pain, fistulas, or mobility) and radiographically (area of caries, periapical&#xD;
      region, and furcation of teeth) after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>The absence of pain, fistulas, and mobility throughout the study was considered clinical success and the decreased or unchanged area of caries (obtained by a software to accurately measure distances between anatomical points selected by the operator of radiolucent zone beneath the restoration) and no bone or dental disorder was detected was considered radiographic success.&#xD;
Overall success was defined as clinical and radiographic success being achieved simultaneously.</description>
