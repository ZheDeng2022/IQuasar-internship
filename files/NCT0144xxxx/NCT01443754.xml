    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a prospective, single centre, open label, observational&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect information about the medical care patients receive during their&#xD;
      planned procedure(s). No new testing or procedures will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients elected for hybrid revascularization will be asked their written consent to the use&#xD;
      of their personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left internal mammary artery to the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery&#xD;
      (LIMA-LAD)surgical revascularization will be performed first, followed by percutaneous&#xD;
      revascularization of the other vessels in the frame of the same hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge patients will attend clinic visits at 30 days and 12 months, as per usual&#xD;
      clinical practice, and will be contacted by phone at 6 months after procedure. Angiographic&#xD;
      follow-up will be performed in symptomatic patients, as clinically indicated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hybrid coronary revascularization integrates the positive features of both Percutaneous&#xD;
      Coronary Intervention (PCI) and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), combining the durability&#xD;
      of Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery (LIMA) coronary bypass with the minimal&#xD;
      invasiveness and lower risk of percutaneous intervention. Thereby it might represent a better&#xD;
      option in a sizeable proportion of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate patients in whom hybrid revascularization would be advantageous are several&#xD;
      subgroups of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients that are increasing in numbers: the&#xD;
      elderly patients with a high risk of mortality and/or morbidity for CABG, patients with&#xD;
      significant disabilities and patients in whom treatment durability is important but a&#xD;
      significantly invasive approach is not an option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several potential advantages of the hybrid procedure over conventional CABG in&#xD;
      selected patients. These advantages include the avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass-related&#xD;
      morbidity, no aortic manipulation with the LIMA-LAD with the beating heart procedure, less&#xD;
      blood loss and decreased transfusions, a shorter recovery time than after conventional CABG&#xD;
      and patient's preference for &quot;minimally invasive&quot; surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in selected patients with diffuse coronary disease, a&#xD;
      &quot;hybrid&quot; approach employing a staged revascularisation procedure may allow to lower the&#xD;
      surgical risk, increase the completeness and effectiveness of revascularisation and,&#xD;
      hopefully, to improve immediate and long term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, a well designed, properly sized, prospective, randomized study is&#xD;
      needed. Available data, however, do not provide sufficient information to speculate on a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful, yet achievable, effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this observational study is therefore to collect more information on the target&#xD;
      population, the clinical outcomes and optimal management in order to inform the design of a&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness trial.&#xD;
