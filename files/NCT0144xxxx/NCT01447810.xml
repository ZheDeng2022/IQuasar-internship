    <textblock>
      Hemiplegia (weakness or poor muscle function on one side of the body) is a neurological&#xD;
      impairment which can occur in children as a result of a brain tumor or related treatment.&#xD;
      This impairment can negatively impact the child's functional abilities and movement&#xD;
      development, making it difficult for them to play, learn to feed, dress or bathe themselves,&#xD;
      and to participate fully in home, daycare, or school environments. Poor movement skills may&#xD;
      also impact overall quality of life. Constraint Induced Therapy is a rehabilitation technique&#xD;
      which has been found to improve the child's abilities to move their arms following&#xD;
      neurological injuries like stroke and traumatic brain injury in both adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a constraint induced&#xD;
      movement therapy program in a small group of children with a brain tumor and hemiplegia.&#xD;
      Children who participate in the program may experience improved ability to use their weak arm&#xD;
      leading to increased participation in meaningful activity and improved quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constraint Induced Therapy (CI Therapy) is based on the theory of &quot;learned non-use.&quot;&#xD;
      Following an event that impacts the brain (stroke, brain injury etc.), the messages from the&#xD;
      brain to the arm and the messages from the arm to the brain are interrupted in the area of&#xD;
      the brain where the injury occurred and in a small surrounding area. The arm is often&#xD;
      inefficient and difficult to use. Over time, even after swelling in the brain decreases,&#xD;
      movement of the affected arm continues to be more effortful and the child becomes quite&#xD;
      accustomed to completing activities with the unaffected arm only. Additionally, because the&#xD;
      child has not used the weak arm for a while, the part of the brain that is ready to receive&#xD;
      signals and give commands to the arm or leg is &quot;quiet&quot; and does not work like it used to. The&#xD;
      theory of &quot;learned no-nuse&quot; has lead to the development of the CI Therapy approach which is&#xD;
      comprised of the following principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constraint - the strong or normal arm/leg is restrained, forcing use of the weaker&#xD;
           arm/leg during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practiced Use - the weak limb is treated by engaging the child in structured practice of&#xD;
           specific movements and functional skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfer Package - a home program is developed for the child to use with his or her&#xD;
           caregivers that focuses on facilitating carryover of learned skills into the real world&#xD;
           environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This theory hypothesizes that, because the nervous system, particularly in the child, has&#xD;
      plasticity (can be shaped and learn to do new things), CI Therapy will facilitate cortical&#xD;
      (brain) reorganization, and help the child overcome learned non-use, eventually leading to&#xD;
      improved function of the weak arm or leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Initial evaluations will be completed on day 1 of the program. They include&#xD;
      interview questions and direct assessment of the participant's ability to use the affected&#xD;
      arm as well as to participate in meaningful age-appropriate activities. These assessments&#xD;
      include the Motor Activity Log, The Pediatric Arm Function Test, the Inventory of New Motor&#xD;
      Activities and Programs, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and the Preschool Activity&#xD;
      Card Sort or Children's Assessment of Activity Preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: The participant completes an intensive occupational therapy program which consists&#xD;
      of 15 three-hour therapy sessions (5 days per week for 3 weeks). Throughout the three week&#xD;
      program the un-involved arm will be constrained with a removable cast. The cast is to be worn&#xD;
      24 hours per day throughout the 3 week program with the exception of regularly scheduled cast&#xD;
      changes, washings and skin checks completed by the treating occupational therapist. During&#xD;
      the direct intervention sessions, a focus of therapy is on facilitation of new motor skills&#xD;
      for the affected arm. Play is utilized as a means to motivate the pediatric participants with&#xD;
      activities and exercises specifically chosen to facilitate new motor skills. The program also&#xD;
      includes a variety of tools and activities caregivers will complete increasing adherence to&#xD;
      the program outside of the direct intervention sessions and to facilitate transfer of&#xD;
      affected upper extremity use into the real world environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Immediately following the 3 week intervention program the participant's performance&#xD;
      is re-assessed. Additionally weekly follow up evaluations are completed by phone for a period&#xD;
      of one month. Three months following the intervention program the participant will return for&#xD;
      follow up evaluations.&#xD;

    <description>Two focused rigidity bi-valve long arm (upper arm to finger tips) casts will be fabricated for each participant on day one of the constraint-induced therapy (CIT) program. Focused rigidity casting materials are water proof and latex/fiberglass free. Focused rigidity casting does not require use of a cast saw for removal thus decreasing potential for anxiety during the casting process. Casts will be fabricated by therapist trained in the casting technique.</description>
