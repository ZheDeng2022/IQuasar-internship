  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 randomized, single center, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of live, replication competent recombinant Adenovirus type&#xD;
      4-H5N1Influenza Vietnam 1194 Hemagglutinin (HA) (Ad4-H5-Vtn). Determining the optimal route&#xD;
      and dose for this recombinant platform will greatly accelerate investigations of this vector&#xD;
      as an influenza vaccine and an HIV vaccine platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intranasal and tonsillar administration of the vaccine will be separately assessed. The oral&#xD;
      enteric-coated capsule will also be assessed in 10 outpatients using similar blood sampling&#xD;
      for comparison. The Ad4-H5-Vtn orally administered as enteric-coated capsules has already&#xD;
      been evaluated in an ascending dose Phase 1 study, in dosages as high as 10(11) viral&#xD;
      particles (vp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate safety of ascending dosages of the Ad4-H5-Vtn&#xD;
      vaccine following intranasal and tonsillar administration. A dosage or dosages will be&#xD;
      selected to further evaluate the humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses against both&#xD;
      the vector and the inserted gene. The Ad4-H5-Vtn will be initiated at 10(3) vp. Once safety&#xD;
      is established at the initial dose, a second round of testing will begin at the next ten-fold&#xD;
      higher dose. The Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine will be assessed in three participants at each dosage&#xD;
      level. The maximum viral dose administered by the tonsillar route will be 10(8) vp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to clinical and laboratory monitoring of safety, the principal assessments will&#xD;
      be shedding of the Ad4-H5-Vtn virus in rectal, cervicovaginal, throat, and nasal swabs, and&#xD;
      assessment of the antibody (mucosal and systemic) response to the HA and to the Ad4 virus.&#xD;
      When safety has been confirmed in all three participants at a given dosage level, the next&#xD;
      higher dose group is enrolled. If one grade 3 or greater toxicity (or pre-specified Grade 2&#xD;
      toxicity, see Section 3.4) attributable to the vaccine is observed, the group will be&#xD;
      expanded at that dose. If a second attributable grade 3 or greater toxicity (or pre-specified&#xD;
      Grade 2 toxicity, see Section 3.4) is observed, the dose will be reduced one level and the&#xD;
      group will be expanded. Up to 25 Ad4-seronegative individuals will be enrolled at the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose to fully evaluate safety and immunogenicity in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be followed for 28 days following immunization, and again at 8 and 26&#xD;
      weeks to evaluate any long-term toxicity and persistence of immunity. Tonsillar Participants&#xD;
      will receive a booster dose of vaccine [SK1]at the 26-week visit and be seen for follow-up&#xD;
      visits at Weeks 30 and 34. Household and intimate contacts will also be enrolled and&#xD;
      monitored for Adenovirus and HAI antibodies.&#xD;

      vaccine after the 26-week visit and be seen for follow-up visits 4 and 8 weeks following&#xD;
      booster immunization, with an additional telephone follow-up 6 months after boosting.&#xD;
      Household and intimate contacts will also be enrolled and monitored for Adenovirus and HAI&#xD;
      antibodies following Ad4-H5-Vtn administration only; household and intimate contacts will not&#xD;
      be enrolled or monitored during the boost portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct an expansion H5N1 boost phase of this study, in which all vaccinees from the&#xD;
      initial phase of the study will be offered re-enrollment to receive a booster vaccination&#xD;
      with an FDA-approved H5N1 inactivated monovalent influenza vaccine. We will offer enrollment&#xD;
      in the expansion phase to all participants who received the Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine in the initial&#xD;
      phase, regardless of whether they also received the recombinant hemagglutinin influenza H5&#xD;
      vaccine boost. We will also enroll individuals who have never received an H5 influenza&#xD;
      vaccine as controls. Participants will receive a single vaccination with the H5N1 vaccine and&#xD;
      be seen for follow-up visits 4 and 8 weeks later for immunogenicity evaluations.&#xD;
