      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After allogeneic (donor) stem cell transplantation, a new immune system grows in the&#xD;
           patient from the transplanted donor stem cells and lymphocytes (type of immune cell).&#xD;
           Donor lymphocytes, unlike the patient s own lymphocytes, often can recognize the patient&#xD;
           s tumor cells as being foreign and destroy them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is thought that tumor shrinkage after stem cell transplantation is the result of&#xD;
           donor T lymphocytes, or T cells. Some studies show that patients with tumors that have T&#xD;
           cells are better able to keep tumor growth in check.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have had donor stem cell transplantation may have donor T cells in their&#xD;
           tumors that can recognize and fight their cancer. Compared with donor T cells taken&#xD;
           directly from the donor and infused into the patient, donor T cells found in patients&#xD;
           tumors may be specific for the cancer cells and thus better able to attack tumor. Also,&#xD;
           because the T cells found their way to the tumor, they may be less likely to recognize&#xD;
           and attack non-tumor tissues than the T cells given in donor lymphocyte infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The T cells may be especially effective at controlling tumor if they are given an&#xD;
           additional stimulus to become active. Costimulation is the name of the body s natural&#xD;
           process for providing an extra stimulus, and can be performed on cells in the&#xD;
           laboratory. Costimulation can produce large numbers of activated cells that may be able&#xD;
           to attack cancer cells and shrink tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the ability of lymphocytes found in tumors from patients who have received donor&#xD;
      stem cell transplants to control their tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with a B-cell cancer that has continued to grow or&#xD;
      recurred after remission following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This includes&#xD;
      patients who have received transplants from unrelated donors and cord blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune cells are collected from patients blood and blood from their stem cell donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergo surgery to remove their tumor and a small piece of skin. In the&#xD;
           laboratory, donor T cells are isolated from the tumor and costimulated to expand the&#xD;
           number of cells and activate them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The expanded, activated T cells as infused into the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have a needle biopsy and possibly surgery to remove a sample of remaining tumor&#xD;
           for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are followed at the NIH clinic 48 hours after the cell infusion, and again at&#xD;
           1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the infusion. Tumor size is monitored every month with CT&#xD;
           scans, and possibly also with a PET or bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, for the first&#xD;
           3 months after the cells are infused. Thereafter, visits are less frequent (every 3&#xD;
           months, then every 6 months, and then yearly) during a minimum 5-year follow-up.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prognosis for patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies (BCL) with relapse or&#xD;
           refractory disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AlloHSCT)&#xD;
           is poor. Effective therapy for patients who fail withdrawal of immune suppression and&#xD;
           administration of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) has not been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the setting of recurrent or refractory BCL, the immunologic graft-versus-tumor (GVT)&#xD;
           effect generated by unmanipulated donor lymphocytes is often not durable and can be&#xD;
           accompanied by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have hypothesized that lymphocytes found in tumor after alloHSCT are of donor origin,&#xD;
           and because they are tumor-derived, they may be tumor-specific in their homing and&#xD;
           antigen specificity characteristics. Similarly, inpatients with bone marrow involvement&#xD;
           with tumor, the marrow may be enriched with similarly tumor-specific T cells. Further,&#xD;
           activation and expansion of these cells through CD3/CD28 costimulation may yield a more&#xD;
           effective form of cell therapy than DLI after alloHSCT, with enhanced GVT effects and&#xD;
           less GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of isolating and expanding clinically relevant numbers of&#xD;
           TDL from patients after alloHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety, vis-a-vis infusion toxicities and/or GVHD, of administering&#xD;
           TDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with B cell malignancies with tumor that has not responded to successful T cell&#xD;
           engraftment after alloHSCT, withdrawal of immune suppression and administration of donor&#xD;
           lymphocyte infusion will be eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have a minimum of 1.5 cm of accessible tumor which is amenable to&#xD;
           resection with minimal surgical morbidity and/or bone marrow tumor involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will have accessible lesion surgically resected and/or harvested via bone&#xD;
           marrow aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphocytes will be liberated and expanded using a co-stimulatory approach with&#xD;
           anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads to generate TDL and/or marrow-TDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1.0 x 10(6) - 1.0 x 10(8) TDL will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be monitored for the development of infusion reactions (in-hospital for 24&#xD;
           hours after infusion), GVHD (weekly for four weeks then monthly) and tumor responses&#xD;
           (monthly).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two cohorts will be enrolled, with an arm evaluating TDL from resected tumor and an arm&#xD;
           to evaluate marrow-TDL from tumor-involved bone marrow. For the TDL arm, 15 to 18&#xD;
           patients and up to 18 donors will be enrolled; for the marrow-TDL arem, 15 patients and&#xD;
           up to 15 donors will be enrolled. Both arms will test the primary endpoints of&#xD;
           feasibility (with at least 11 of 15 tumors yielding 1.0 x 10(6) TDL/kg meeting defined&#xD;
           release criteria) and safety (primarily defined as having a no greater risk of&#xD;
           developing grade II-IV acute GVHD by day 28 as standard therapy with unmanipulated DLI).&#xD;

        1.4 Eligibility of Recipients is not contingent upon enrollment of the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Donor enrollment is not required to meet the primary objectives of this protocol and&#xD;
        will not affect eligibility of recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Donor must be the same individual whose cells were used as the source for the patient&#xD;
             s original stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary central&#xD;
             venous catheter for apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant protocol,&#xD;
             or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent (as determined by Principal&#xD;
             Investigator and/or his designee).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective method&#xD;
             of contraception. The effects of the immunosuppressive medications that could be&#xD;
             required to treat GHVD are likely to be harmful to a fetus. The effects upon breast&#xD;
             milk are also unknown and may be harmful to an infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Serum total bilirubin &gt; 2.5 mg/dl, serum ALT and AST values greater than or equal to&#xD;
             2.5 times the upper limit of normal. If the abnormal liver function is attributable to&#xD;
             liver involvement by malignancy, patients may be eligible with serum total bilirubin&#xD;
             up to 5.0 mg/dl, and serum ALT and AST values up to 5.0 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal, provided the patient has no evidence of impending hepatic failure&#xD;
             (encephalopathy or prothombin time &gt;2 time the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Minimum absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/microl, unless attributable to tumor.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Donors:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant&#xD;
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, or severe heart&#xD;
             disease (donors with symptomatic angina will be excluded). Donors with a history of&#xD;
             coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty who are symptom free will receive a&#xD;
             cardiology evaluation and be considered on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Donors must not be pregnant. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective&#xD;
             method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Anemia (Hb &lt; 11 gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 100,000 per microl). However,&#xD;
             potential donors with Hb levels &lt; 11 gm/dl that is due to iron deficiency will be&#xD;
             eligible as long as the donor is initiated on iron replacement therapy. The NIH&#xD;
             Clinical Center, Department of Transfusion Medicine will determine the appropriateness&#xD;
             of individuals as donors.&#xD;
