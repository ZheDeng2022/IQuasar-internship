  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to assess changes in corneal sensation and dry eye signs and symptoms&#xD;
      following cataract extraction/femtosecond arcuate relaxing incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our clinical hypothesis is to determine if a combination of cataract surgery and femtosecond&#xD;
      arcuate relaxing incisions lead to a reduction in corneal sensation and the onset or&#xD;
      worsening of dry eye signs and symptoms.&#xD;

             understanding of the contents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject scheduled for cataract extraction with intraocular lens and requiring two (2)&#xD;
             femtosecond arcuate relaxing incisions for correction of corneal astigmatism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has greater than or equal to 1.0 D and less than or equal to 2.5 Diopters of&#xD;
             corneal astigmatism as measured by keratometry or corneal topography&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two (2) arcuate incisions should be 45° in length and 180° apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All arcuate relaxing incisions will be placed exactly 4.5 mm from the visual axis for&#xD;
             a 9 mm optical zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corneal sensation at Screening by Cochet-Bonnet Aesthesiometry with floor stand &gt;50 mm&#xD;
