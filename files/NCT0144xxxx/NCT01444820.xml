  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In North America, around a quarter a million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every&#xD;
      year, and about 31,000 patients will die of their disease each year. Like other western&#xD;
      countries, the incidence in Canada has increased due to an aging population and prostate&#xD;
      specific antigen (PSA) screening. This has led to a significant demand on cancer care&#xD;
      services for these patients. Prostate cancer patient with high risk features are more often&#xD;
      treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) plus two to three years of hormonal&#xD;
      manipulation (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist). The most common&#xD;
      radiation dose treatment for these patients is 74-78 Gy in 37-39 daily fractions of 180-200&#xD;
      cGy for a treatment length of 7.5 weeks. This fraction size is believed to offer the best&#xD;
      balance between desired tumour kill and unwanted normal tissue injury. Larger fraction sizes&#xD;
      of more than 250 cGy (hypofractionation) are usually avoided for curative therapy because&#xD;
      late reacting normal tissues. However prostate cancer cells have a unique radiobiology&#xD;
      characteristic that suggests that hypofractionated radiotherapy is more efficient at prostate&#xD;
      tumour killing than standard fractionation is, and will produce equivalent tumour control&#xD;
      with a lower total dose and a shorter overall treatment time. Improved target localization&#xD;
      techniques and conformal radiation therapy technology have allowed for dose escalation and&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation delivery in these circumstances with minimal or no increased&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed to determine whether high risk prostate cancer patients can be safely&#xD;
      treated with a dose escalation hypofractionated radiation therapy in 5 weeks as opposed to&#xD;
      the usual 7-8 weeks. These patients will be randomized to either the usual 76 Gy in 38&#xD;
      fractions or 68 Gy in 25 fractions. 3D-Conformal Radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or Intensity Modulated&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (IMRT) will be used to deliver the required radiation dose. Patients will also&#xD;
      receive 28 months of androgen deprivation therapy (LHRH agonist). The primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study is the acute and delayed toxicity and the secondary outcomes include biochemical&#xD;
      failure, prostate specific mortality rate, bone metastases free survival, the prognostic and&#xD;
      predictive value of several biological variables: presence of the PTEN deletion; expression&#xD;
      of FoxP3 gene variants, topoisomerase 2α and cancer testis antigens; expression of X&#xD;
      chromosome-linked micro-RNAs; presence of TMRSS2-ERG gene fusion and quality of life. It is&#xD;
      planned to recruit 250 patients to this study.&#xD;

Institutions using 3D-CRT will deliver the required dose to the pelvic volume (including pelvic lymph nodes and boost volume) - 4500 cGy - and a concomitant boost to the prostate and proximal 1-cm (or the whole SV if involved) SV to 6800 cGy.</description>
