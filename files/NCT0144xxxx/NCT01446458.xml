  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy and&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) prior to surgery in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer is safe and well tolerated. This study will obtain preliminary data on the response of&#xD;
      the cancer to this therapy by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and by studying the cancer&#xD;
      after it is resected surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will perform biochemical studies on the tumor tissue obtained&#xD;
      from your tissue biopsy as well as from the tumor removed by the surgeon in order to measure&#xD;
      the effect of treatment with FOLFIRINOX and SBRT on several proteins that may be important in&#xD;
      the behavior of pancreatic cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained from this trial will be extremely valuable to help improve the approach to&#xD;
      treating pancreatic cancer in the future. If you do not undergo surgery after completion of&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX + SBRT, the investigators will request a second biopsy of the tumor under computer&#xD;
      tomography (CT) -guidance in order to measure the effect of treatment on your tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for treating early stage pancreatic cancer involves surgery&#xD;
      followed by chemotherapy and / or chemoradiotherapy using conventional fractionated external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Despite the the incorporation of multi-modality adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy following surgery, patients with surgically resected pancreas cancer have a high&#xD;
      likelihood of recurrence of their cancer and/ or death from their disease. Patients with more&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancers experience even worse outcomes in the face of unresectable&#xD;
      disease or lower likelihood of achieving a negative margin resection. In these particular&#xD;
      group of patients, chemotherapy and radiation given prior to surgery may help select patients&#xD;
      who are more likely ultimately to benefit from a pancreaticoduodenectomy and may improve the&#xD;
      rate of margin negative resection, factors which may influence their outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic chemotherapy traditionally used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer has included&#xD;
      drugs such as gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Recently, a multi-agent chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen called FOLFIRINOX has shown significant efficacy in patients with advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer with improved tumor responses and improved overall outcomes with a reasonable toxicity&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a unique radiation technique that allows higher&#xD;
      doses of radiation to be delivered to the cancer over a significantly shorter period of time&#xD;
      compared to conventional radiation. SBRT's advantages over conventional radiation include:&#xD;
      shorter duration of therapy (one to three days versus two to five weeks) as well as the&#xD;
      ability to deliver full doses of chemotherapy. In treating patients with pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      SBRT has been tolerated and has been effective when compared historically to conventional&#xD;
      radiation. SBRT has been combined with chemotherapy and has also been very well tolerated in&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will ask whether giving chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX followed in short sequence by&#xD;
      radiation therapy using Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is safe and feasible. This&#xD;
      study will also begin to ask what is the effect of this approach on the rate of margin&#xD;
      negative resection in patients who may subsequently undergo surgery for their pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

    <description>A standard 3 + 3 design will be used for evaluating the safety and tolerability of SBRT radiation doses. Any grade 3 liver, gastric, small bowel or spinal cord toxicity or any grade 4 toxicity (hematologic or other non-hematologic except for diarrhea) will be considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
Each cohort will consist of 3 patients, unless 1 of the patients experiences a DLT in which case the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as the dose level below that which results in a DLT in 2 or more of the 6 patients in a cohort.</description>

    <description>The overall pathologic (complete + partial) response rate and margin negative resection rate will be estimated using all registered patients and all resected patients (via the Intention to Treat principle for effectiveness assessment).&#xD;
The overall objective clinical response rate will involve MRI assessment of pancreas tumors of all registered patients with comparison of baseline (pre-treatment) MRI measurement to post-treatment MRI measurement prior to surgical resection using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Measurements will involve all registered patients.</description>
