      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Parainfluenza is a virus that can cause infections in people. Most people infected with&#xD;
      this virus have mild symptoms including fever, cough, red eyes, or runny nose (a common&#xD;
      cold). Some people, especially those with a weakened immune system, get very sick from this&#xD;
      virus. They may have difficulty breathing or develop lung infections. Currently, there are no&#xD;
      specific treatments for parainfluenza. However, a drug called DAS181 may make the virus go&#xD;
      away faster. Researchers are interested in testing DAS181 to see if it is safe and effective&#xD;
      against parainfluenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of DAS181 as a treatment for parainfluenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have the parainfluenza virus and have developed&#xD;
      symptoms within the past 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and questions about&#xD;
           symptoms and activity levels. Participants will also have a lung function test and&#xD;
           provide blood and nasal fluid samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DAS181 is an inhaled medication, and everyone will receive a study medication inhaler.&#xD;
           Participants will receive either DAS181 or a placebo through the inhaler. They will take&#xD;
           it once every day for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have monitoring visits on days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 28 to provide&#xD;
           blood and nasal fluid samples and have a lung function test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who still have the virus in their system on Day 28 will return to the&#xD;
           clinic on Day 42 for more tests. Participants who still have the virus in their system&#xD;
           on Day 42 will return to the clinic on Day 56 for more tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have followup visits 6 months and 1 year after the start of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parainfluenza virus (PIV) infections cause considerable morbidity in the immunocompromised&#xD;
      population. In the immunocompetent population, PIV is usually self-limited, but can cause&#xD;
      more severe disease including pneumonia and tracheobronchitis in adults, and croup and&#xD;
      bronchiolitis in young children. DAS181, an inhaled sialidase, cleaves the binding site of&#xD;
      PIV from respiratory mucosal cells limiting the ability of PIV to infect new cells. This may&#xD;
      improve outcomes in patients with PIV infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory randomized double-blind Phase 2 study will assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, and explore the efficacy of DAS181 versus placebo for the treatment of&#xD;
      parainfluenza. Thirty eligible patients diagnosed with parainfluenza will be randomized in a&#xD;
      2:1 allocation to receive either DAS181-F02 formulation (10 mg times 5 days) or placebo.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed on Study Days 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28, 180, and 365 with a series of&#xD;
      clinical, pulmonary function, functional status, virologic, and safety assessments.&#xD;
