  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravesical treatment for superficial bladder cancer has been used for the past 4-5 decades.&#xD;
      Intravesical chemotherapy is beneficial in terms of recurrence and time to recurrence in&#xD;
      grade 1-2 stage Ta tumours, usually non-invasive. Intravesical chemotherapy has negligible&#xD;
      effect on disease progression in high-risk superficial bladder cancer-ie, grade 3, stage T1,&#xD;
      and carcinoma in situ. However, BCG as induction and maintenance treatment effectively delays&#xD;
      progression. Electromotive mitomycin increases tissue uptake compared with that of passive&#xD;
      diffusion. Electromotive mitomycin has emerged as an alternative or complementary treatment&#xD;
      to BCG. The rationale for combining anticancer drugs is based on the need to increase&#xD;
      efficacy and reduce emergence of resistant malignant cells. This approach is not frequently&#xD;
      applied to use of intravesical agents for treatment of superficial bladder cancer, for which&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic BCG and chemotherapeutic mitomycin seem to be a potentially effective&#xD;
      combination. Studies have addressed concurrent use of mitomycin and BCG, and assigned two&#xD;
      roles to mitomycin: antitumor action and tissue-scarifying (ie, surface-modifying) effect&#xD;
      that enables BCG to attach more efficiently to the urothelium. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      aimed to assess whether induction of inflammation by use of BCG before mitomycin treatment&#xD;
      makes the bladder mucosa more permeable and thus enables mitomycin to reach the target more&#xD;
      easily. This randomised trial to compare the efficacy of sequential BCG and electromotive&#xD;
      mitomycin with that of the current standard of BCG alone for patients with high-risk&#xD;
      superficial bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After transurethral resection and multiple biopsies patients with stage pT1 bladder cancer&#xD;
      are randomly assigned to: 81 mg BCG infused over 120 min once a week for 6 weeks; or to 81 mg&#xD;
      BCG infused over 120 min once a week for 2 weeks, followed by 40 mg electromotive mitomycin&#xD;
      (intravesical electric current 20 mA for 30 min) once a week as one cycle for three cycles&#xD;
      (n=107). Complete responders underwent maintenance treatment: those assigned BCG alone had&#xD;
      one infusion of 81 mg BCG once a month for 10 months, and those assigned BCG and mitomycin&#xD;
      had 40 mg electromotive mitomycin once a month for 2 months, followed by 81 mg BCG once a&#xD;
      month as one cycle for three cycles. The primary endpoint was disease-free interval;&#xD;
      secondary endpoints were time to progression; overall survival; and disease-specific&#xD;
      survival. Analyses were intention to treat.&#xD;

      All patients with histologically proven stage pT1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder,&#xD;
      whether papillary or solid, are regarded as being at high risk for tumour recurrence and at&#xD;
      moderate to high risk for progression because of: multifocal pT1, primary or recurrent, grade&#xD;
      2 transitional-cell carcinoma; primary or recurrent pT1, multifocal or solitary, grade 3&#xD;
      transitional-cell carcinoma; or pT1 with carcinoma in situ. Inclusion criteria are: age 18&#xD;
      years or older; adequate bone-marrow reserve; normal renal function; normal liver function;&#xD;
      and Karnofsky performance status between 50 and 100. Exclusion criteria are: previous&#xD;
      treatment with BCG or electromotive mitomycin; treatment with any other intravesical&#xD;
      cytostatic agent within the past 6 months; concomitant urothelial tumours of the upper&#xD;
      urinary tract; previous muscle-invasive (ie, stage T2 or higher) transitional-cell carcinoma&#xD;
      of the bladder; bladder capacity less than 2 L; untreated urinary-tract infection; severe&#xD;
      systemic infection (ie, sepsis); urethral strictures that would prevent endoscopic procedures&#xD;
      and repeated catheterisation; disease of upper urinary tract (eg, vesicoureteral reflux or&#xD;
      urinary-tract stones) that would make multiple transurethral procedures a risk; previous&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the pelvis; other concurrent chemotherapy; treatment with&#xD;
      radiotherapy-response or biological-response modifiers; history of tuberculosis; other&#xD;
      malignant diseases within 5 years of trial registration (except for basal-cell carcinoma);&#xD;
      pregnancy or nursing; and psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical factors that&#xD;
      would preclude study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The institutional review boards of every participating centre approved the study&#xD;
      design. Every patient enrolled signed an informed-consent form approved by the institutional&#xD;
      review boards. All patients underwent: urinary cytology of the bladder and upper urinary&#xD;
      tract; random cold-cup biopsies of the bladder and prostatic urethra-ie, sampling of&#xD;
      seemingly healthy urothelium and of suspicious areas; and complete transurethral resection of&#xD;
      all bladder tumour visible on endoscopy, ensuring muscle is included in resected samples.&#xD;
      Patients with positive or suspect cytology, carcinoma in situ, multifocal tumours, or grade 3&#xD;
      tumours underwent restaging transurethral resection 4-5 weeks later. All clinical assessors&#xD;
      are adequately trained in the above procedures, and no methods are used to enhance the&#xD;
      quality of measurements. All biopsy samples of tumour and bladder are reviewed by a&#xD;
      pathologist for stage and grade. Tumour stage is classified according to the 1997 TNM&#xD;
      classification of the International Union Against Cancer, and tumour grade is defined in&#xD;
      accordance with the 1973 WHO classification. Patients are randomised within 10 days of the&#xD;
      first or restaging transurethral resection. Randomisation and data collection are done by use&#xD;
      of a central computer. Patients are allocated to BCG alone or to BCG and electromotive&#xD;
      mitomycin by use stratified, blocked randomisation cross 14 strata as a result of four&#xD;
      factors: primary versus recurrent tumours; multifocal versus unifocal tumours; grade 3 versus&#xD;
      grade 2 tumours; and presence versus absence of carcinoma in situ. MV generated and&#xD;
      coordinated the randomisation process. This study is not blinded because of differences in&#xD;
      treatment schedules and drug appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment schedules All patients are scheduled to receive their allocated intervention about&#xD;
      3 weeks after transurethral resection and multiple, random biopsy sampling. The BCG&#xD;
      instillation consisted of 81 mg wet weight BCG Connaught substrain (ImmuCyst®, Alfa&#xD;
      Wassermann SpA, Bologna, Italy). Lyophilised (ie, freeze-dried) BCG is suspended in 50 mL&#xD;
      bacteriostatic-free solution of 0·9% sodium chloride. After draining of the bladder, the&#xD;
      suspension is infused intravesically through a Foley catheter. The solution is retained in&#xD;
      the bladder for 120 min, followed by emptying of the bladder and removal of the catheter.&#xD;
      Patients randomly allocated to BCG and mitomycin, are placed on fluid restriction and 2 g&#xD;
      ingested sodium bicarbonate the night before treatment, the morning of treatment, and 2 h&#xD;
      before treatment with mitomycin. A Foley catheter is inserted and postvoid residual volume is&#xD;
      reduced to less than 10mL. 40 mg mitomycin (Mitomycin, Kyowa Italiana Farmaceutici, Srl,&#xD;
      Milan, Italy) dissolved in 100 mL water is infused intravesically through the Foley catheter&#xD;
      by gravity and retained in the bladder for 30 min, while 40-60 mA per s to a maximum of 20 mA&#xD;
      or 30 min pulsed electric current is given externally.13 Two dispersive cathode electrodes&#xD;
      are placed on lower abdominal skin that had been degreased with alcohol and a 2-5-mm layer of&#xD;
      conductive gel applied. The bladder is then emptied and the catheter removed. The BCG-alone&#xD;
      group is assigned one course of intravesical treatment per week for 6 weeks; patients&#xD;
      assigned sequential BCG and electromotive mitomycin are assigned one course of treatment per&#xD;
      week for 9 weeks, for whom one cycle consisted of two BCG infusions and one mitomycin&#xD;
      infusion (three cycles in total). Patients in the BCG-alone group who are disease-free 3&#xD;
      months after treatment are scheduled to receive monthly infusions of BCG for 10 months.&#xD;
      Patients in the BCG-and-mitomycin group who are disease-free 3 months after treatment are&#xD;
      scheduled to receive one infusion a month for 9 months: three cycles of mitomycin, mitomycin,&#xD;
      and BCG (ie, six infusions of mitomycin and three infusions of BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance treatment for both groups is given to the same dose and methods of infusion as&#xD;
      initial allocated treatment.&#xD;
