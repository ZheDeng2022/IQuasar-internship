      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the&#xD;
           treatment of certain cancers. It works by causing DNA damage, resulting in cell death,&#xD;
           including cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABT-888 is an experimental drug that has been given to a small number of patients. It&#xD;
           works by preventing DNA repair in tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the safety of the combination of ABT-888 and CP, and to determine the dose of&#xD;
           each drug that can be given together to patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see how the body handles ABT-888 when given together with CP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the anti-tumor response of the drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with solid tumors or lymphoid cancers (lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia)&#xD;
           whose disease does not respond to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients take ABT-888 by mouth once a day for 7, 14 or 21 days, depending on the dose&#xD;
           level assigned to the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients take CP by mouth once a day every day in 21-day cycles. (Some patients take CP&#xD;
           for 14 days only.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergo tests and procedures periodically during the study, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic visit and physical examination at the beginning of each cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, measurement of vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans, MRI scans or ultrasound tests to check the response of the tumor to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsies (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes is characterized by the&#xD;
           ability to poly-ADP-ribosylate protein substrates. PARP-1 and PARP-2 play a critical&#xD;
           role in the maintenance of genomic stability by regulating a variety of DNA repair&#xD;
           mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PARP activity has been shown to be important in base excision repair pathways. The&#xD;
           inhibition of PARP could inhibit the repair of the DNA damage caused by alkylating&#xD;
           agents such as cyclophosphamide. ABT-888 has been shown to potentiate the action of&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide in xenografts models. ABT-888 is an orally delivered PARP inhibitor and&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide can be delivered orally as an alkylating agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metronomic therapy with cyclophosphamide has demonstrated efficacy in multiple tumor&#xD;
           types including, but not limited to, ovarian cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer, and&#xD;
           breast cancer. Its activity has been at least partially attributed to mediation of&#xD;
           anti-angiogenic effects through induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of ABT-888 with metronomic&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 when administered combination with&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate for anti-tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of the study treatment on the level of PARP inhibition and&#xD;
           gamma-H2AX in PBMCs and tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically documented solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies (lymphoma&#xD;
           and CLL) whose disease has progressed following standard therapy or who have no&#xD;
           acceptable standard treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No major surgery, radiation or chemotherapy within four weeks prior to study enrollment,&#xD;
           and recovered from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABT-888 will be administered orally once daily for 7 to 21 days, depending on the dose&#xD;
           level (see below). Cyclophosphamide will be administered orally once daily in 50 mg or&#xD;
           100 mg doses continuously from days 1 to 21. Cycle length is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation will proceed as outlined below. Once MTD is established, 6 additional&#xD;
           patients will be enrolled at the MTD to evaluate that dose further and extend PD studies&#xD;
           at that dose level.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically documented solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies&#xD;
             (lymphoma and CLL) refractory to standard therapy or who have no acceptable standard&#xD;
             treatment options. Patients with lymphoid malignancies will be eligible if their&#xD;
             disease has progressed following standard therapy and if stem cell transplantation is&#xD;
             not indicated or has been refused.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior therapy must have been completed greater than or equal to 4 weeks (greater&#xD;
             than 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to enrollment on protocol, and the&#xD;
             participant must have recovered to eligibility levels (CTCAE Grade less than or equal&#xD;
             to 1) from prior toxicity. Prior radiation should have been completed greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 4 weeks prior to study enrollment, and all associated toxicities should have&#xD;
             resolved to eligibility levels. Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks&#xD;
             since any investigational agent administered as part of a Phase 0 study, and should&#xD;
             have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of ABT-888 in patients less than 18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric Phase&#xD;
             I combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%, see Appendix A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL (mcL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL (mcL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin less than 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times the institutional upper limit&#xD;
                  of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine less than 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine levels&#xD;
        1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ABT-888 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because cyclophosphamide hydrochloride used in this trial is known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (abstinence; female use of hormonal methods, or barrier methods of birth control; male&#xD;
             use of a condom) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and&#xD;
             for 3 months after completion of study. Because there is a risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued while the patient is on this trial and for 30&#xD;
             days after completion of treatment on this trial. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
        nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered&#xD;
        from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients must be&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a&#xD;
        Phase 0 study, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have been administered ABT-888 as part of a single or limited dosing study,&#xD;
        such as a Phase 0 study, should not be excluded from participating in this study solely&#xD;
        because of receiving prior ABT-888.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received prior cyclophosphamide should not be excluded solely because of&#xD;
        receiving prior cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gliomas, symptomatic CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are&#xD;
             excluded from this clinical trial. Patients with history of CNS metastases who have&#xD;
             received treatment and whose CNS metastatic disease status has remained stable for&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 3 months without steroids or anti-seizure medications may be&#xD;
             eligible. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HIV who are taking protease inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug&#xD;
             intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take oral medication or a&#xD;
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption,&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome, active peptic ulcer disease) are excluded. Subjects with&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel&#xD;
             obstruction are also excluded.&#xD;
