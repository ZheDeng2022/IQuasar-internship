  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is a new radiation treatment that delivers&#xD;
      high-dose, precise radiation to small tumors in 1-3 weeks of treatment. This new technique&#xD;
      can potentially allow radiation treatments to be focused more precisely, and delivered more&#xD;
      accurately than with older treatments. This improvement could help by reducing side effects&#xD;
      and by improving the chance of controlling the cancer by more precisely treating the cancer.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare SABR with current approaches of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      conventional radiotherapy to assess the impact on overall survival and quality of life.&#xD;

      TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0.1 Standard Arm (Arm 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy for patients in the standard arm should follow the principles of palliative&#xD;
      radiotherapy as per the individual institution, with the goal of alleviating symptoms or&#xD;
      preventing imminent complications. Patients in this arm should not receive stereotactic doses&#xD;
      or radiotherapy boosts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment recommendations are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain: Whole brain radiotherapy i.e. 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung: Palliative radiotherapy as per 2011 consensus guidelines.15 i.e. 8 Gy in 1 fraction, 20&#xD;
      Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone: Palliative radiotherapy as per 2011 consensus guidelines.16 i.e. 8 Gy in 1 fraction&#xD;
      (most common), 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver: 20 Gy in 5 fractions if standard institutional practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0.2 Treatment Planning for Standard Arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment planning is to be done using CT simulation or conventional simulation (fluoroscopy)&#xD;
      as per individual institutional practice. Simple beam arrangements, such as parallel opposed&#xD;
      beams, are favored wherever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Experimental Arm (Arm 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatments in this study are based on current protocols in clinical use at the LRCP and&#xD;
      VUmc for treatment of lung,17 liver,18 brain,19,20 and spinal cord21 metastases. The guiding&#xD;
      principle for radiotherapy is to achieve disease control but to minimize any potential&#xD;
      adverse impact on quality of life. Concurrent chemotherapy or targeted therapy at the time of&#xD;
      radiotherapy is not permitted within the 4 weeks prior to SABR. Hormone therapy is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.1 Dose/Fractionation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung- tumors 3 cm or less surrounded by lung parenchyma, 54(Gy) in 3 fractions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abutting chest wall or &gt;3 cm, 55(Gy)in 5 fractions, every second day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 2 cm of mediastinum or brachial plexus, 60(Gy),8* fractions, every second day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone -Any bone except femur,35(Gy), in 5 fractions,daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vertebral body,16-20(Gy)in 1 fraction, single dose, or 30Gy in 3 fractions, every second&#xD;
           day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain - Non-radiosurgical,40(Gy) to metastases, in 5 fractions,daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If whole brain treated, then simultaneous boost to each lesion,20 Gy whole brain&#xD;
           (optional), in 5 fractions, daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiosurgical, ≤1 cm, 22-24(Gy), in 1 fraction, &gt;1 and ≤2 cm, 22-24(Gy) in 1 fraction &gt;2&#xD;
           and ≤ 3 cm, 18-20(Gy) in 1 fraction Optional whole brain to follow (see text) Liver-LRCP&#xD;
           site: Dose is based on calculated normal tissue probability of &lt;5%,Every second day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other sites 45-60(Gy), in 3-8 fractions, every second day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenal, 60 (Gy), in 8 fractions, every second day&#xD;
&#xD;
      (If whole brain treated, then simultaneous boost to each lesion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.2 Immobilization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be setup using reproducible positioning, verified using an on-line protocol,&#xD;
      for all patients in this study. Immobilization may include a custom immobilization device,&#xD;
      such as thermoplastic shell or vac-lok bag, as per individual institutional practice when&#xD;
      delivering SABR. Some centers do not use immobilization devices and have demonstrated high&#xD;
      degrees of accuracy; this is acceptable in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.3 Imaging/Localization/Registration All patients in Arm 2 will undergo planning CT&#xD;
      simulation. 4-dimensional CT will be used for tumors in the lungs or liver. Axial CT images&#xD;
      will be obtained throughout the region of interest. For centres using stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery platforms, real-time tumor tracking and orthogonal imaging systems are&#xD;
      permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any center which is not yet experienced in lesions at any specific sub-site (e.g. adrenal&#xD;
      metastases) shall be eligible to participate by including only patients with lesions at other&#xD;
      pre-specified sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is strongly recommended that the doses to organs at risk are not to be exceeded - in some&#xD;
      specific cases, this may require lower doses or higher fractionations than listed here. Such&#xD;
      changes in dose will require approval of one of the local principal investigators. (see&#xD;
      section 6.2)&#xD;
