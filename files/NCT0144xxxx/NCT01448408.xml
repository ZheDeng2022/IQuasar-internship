    <textblock>
      The present study attempts to evaluate the diagnostic capacity of a) anterior segment&#xD;
      parameters b) biomechanical metrics and c) a combination model, in differentiating Forme&#xD;
      Fruste Keratoconus (FFK) from healthy corneas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and written informed consent&#xD;
      was given by all participants. The study was conducted at the Eye Institute of Thrace (ΕΙΤ),&#xD;
      in Alexandroupolis, Greece. EΙΤ is a Democritus University research institute focusing&#xD;
      primarily on the conditions of the anterior segment of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants underwent a complete clinical evaluation including review of medical&#xD;
      history, visual acuity measurements, uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity, placido&#xD;
      disc topography, Scheimpflug camera measurements, ORA measurements , slitlamp biomicroscopy&#xD;
      and fundoscopic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants were divided in two groups. The FFK group (FFKG) consisted of patients&#xD;
      with unilateral KC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (CG) was formed by refractive surgery candidates who visited EIT's&#xD;
      outpatients service for their preoperative examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRF and CH parameters were obtained while the patient was sitting on a chair in front of the&#xD;
      Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA; Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, Buffalo, NY, USA) device.&#xD;
      Upon successful fixation of the patient's eye on a red blinking target, the operator&#xD;
      activated the device. An air puff was released by a non-contact probe, which scanned the&#xD;
      central area of the eye and sent a signal to the ORA. In brief, the air puff causes the&#xD;
      cornea to move inward, past applanation, and into slight concavity. After milliseconds, the&#xD;
      air pumps shut off, the pressure decreases, and the cornea begins to return in its normal&#xD;
      state. The system monitors the entire process and measures two pressure values, which are&#xD;
      determined from the inward and outward applanation processes. The aforementioned measuring&#xD;
      procedure enables the determination of CH which is related to the viscoelastic structure of&#xD;
      the corneal tissue, and is calculated as the difference between the two pressure values at&#xD;
      the two applanation processes, and CRF which is indicative of the overall resistance of the&#xD;
      cornea and is calculated as a linear function of the two pressures associated with the two&#xD;
      applanation. In order to ensure accurate results, ORA was done four times for each eye, by&#xD;
      the same operator. Signals that differ significantly in appearance from the other signals&#xD;
      from the same eye were deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal Astigmatism (Cyl), Anterior Chamber Depth (ACD), Corneal Volume at 3mm (CV3), at 5mm&#xD;
      (CV5), and overall (CV), Central Corneal Thickness (CCT), Thinnest Corneal Thickness (TCT)&#xD;
      and TCT co-ordinates (TCTx, TCTy) were obtained using Pentacam. KISA index was calculated&#xD;
      using Pentacam derived topography. Pentacam is based on a rotating Scheimpflug camera and&#xD;
      monochromatic slit light source (a blue light emitted diode at 475 nm) which rotate together.&#xD;
      After proper alignment of the patient's head, a fixation target is shown which guides the&#xD;
      patients gaze. A real time image of the patient's eye is shown to the examiner on the&#xD;
      computer screen, and the image is manually focused and centered. Acceptable maps had at least&#xD;
      10.0mm of corneal coverage. Moreover, images with extrapolated data in the central 9.0mm zone&#xD;
      were excluded. Regarding the measuring procedure itself, patients were asked to blink and&#xD;
      then look at the fixation device. In case of low-quality image, the procedure was repeated&#xD;
      until the acceptable criteria were met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the FFKG were compared with those from the CG in separate series analyses.&#xD;
      Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were applied to determine the overall&#xD;
      predictive accuracy of the test for each studied parameter, as described by the area under&#xD;
      the curve. We also used this approach to identify the cut-off points for studied parameters&#xD;
      to maximize sensitivity and specificity in discriminating FFK cases from normal corneas.&#xD;
      Logistic regression was used to support the cut-off point identified in the ROC curve&#xD;
      analysis. We determined a cutoff value that will gave us the best predictive fit for our&#xD;
      sample data. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the&#xD;
      predictive capability of a model that combined both corneal biomechanical properties and&#xD;
      pentacam derived anterior segment parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between groups were evaluated using the Welch modified Student's two sample&#xD;
      t-test and Mann-Whitney U test, according to normality of distribution for each parameter. A&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality was applied to all variables of each group. The level of&#xD;
      significance for each parameter was set at p&lt;0.05. The Pearson and Spearman tests were&#xD;
      performed in order to assess correlations between anterior segment parameters and&#xD;
      biomechanical properties, depending on their parametric evaluation.&#xD;
