  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic skin reaction can be produced by the combination of a chemical product applied to&#xD;
      the skin and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (a type of invisible light that comes from the sun&#xD;
      and other light sources and can hurt your skin and eyes) received by the person. The&#xD;
      researchers in this study wanted to find out if cream V61-044 might cause an allergic skin&#xD;
      reaction to sunlight when applied to the skin in healthy participants. Cream V61-044 (brand&#xD;
      name: LOTRIMIN ULTRA) is an approved drug used to treat infections caused by fungi (small&#xD;
      growing organisms such as mold, mildew, yeast or mushrooms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants joining this study underwent two study phases: in Induction phase, participants&#xD;
      received the test cream and UV radiation twice a week for 3 weeks; after 10 days of rest, in&#xD;
      Challenge phase participants received the test cream and UV radiation once again. In both&#xD;
      phases, the test cream was applied to two test areas on the upper back of the participants&#xD;
      and to one of the test area UV radiation was applied. Evaluation on the skin rash was&#xD;
      conducted two days after each UV radiation.&#xD;

    <description>During the Induction Phase, participants received Butenafine HCl 1% on the treated irradiated skin test site followed by UV irradiation and on the treated non-irradiated skin test site without UV radiation, two times per week for three consecutive weeks. After 10 days of Rest Phase, during the Challenge Phase, participants received same procedure on the two virgin sites (treated sites) as in Induction Phase, and two additional sites with no Butenafine HCl 1% (untreated sites) were also occluded. Test sites were evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 hours after irradiation using the same grading scale used during Induction Phase.</description>

    <description>To each of two test sites, approximately 20 μl/cm^2 of the Butenafine HCl 1% was applied directly to the skin and covered with a 25 mm Hilltop chamber with a Webril pad (2 cm in diameter, within an area of approximately 3 cm^2), and tape was applied over the chamber to secure the occlusive patch to the skin. On the next day, the chambers were removed and both test sites were lightly wiped. Approximately 2 μl/cm^2 of Butenafine HCl 1% was reapplied directly to the skin and lightly spread over the treated irradiated test site. The treated non-irradiated test site did not receive a similar reapplication. Between 5 and 15 minutes after application, the treated irradiated test site was irradiated with two times the subject's Minimal Erythema Dose (MED). Evaluation of the test sites occurred two days after the irradiation. This procedure was repeated two times per week for three consecutive weeks for a total of 6 induction exposures per test site.</description>

    <description>5 μl/cm^2 of the Butenafine HCl 1% was applied directly to each of the two virgin sites (treated sites) adjacent to the induction patch sites and covered with Hilltop chambers with Webril pad and tape was applied over the chambers to secure the occlusive patches to the skin. Two additional sites with no Butenafine HCl 1% (untreated sites) were also occluded. Sites were at least 2.5 cm apart. The patches were removed 24 hours later and the sites were lightly wiped. Test sites were evaluated. Butenafine HCl 1% (2 μl/cm^2) was applied to the treated irradiated site. After 15 minutes, the treated irradiated site and the untreated irradiated site were irradiated with 0.5 MED of UVA/UVB irradiation followed by 10 Joules/cm^2 of UVA from a xenon arc solar simulator equipped with a Schott WG345 to eliminate UVB radiation. The remaining sites served as the treated non-irradiated site and untreated non-irradiated site.</description>

          <description>During the Induction Phase, participants received Butenafine HCl 1% on the treated irradiated skin test site followed by UV irradiation and on the treated non-irradiated skin test site without UV radiation, two times per week for three consecutive weeks. After 10 days of Rest Phase, during the Challenge Phase, participants received same procedure on the two virgin sites (treated sites) as in Induction Phase, and two additional sites with no Butenafine HCl 1% (untreated sites) were also occluded. Test sites were evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 hours after irradiation using the same grading scale used during Induction Phase.</description>

        <title>Photoallergic Reaction Evaluation Reported as Number of Test Site With Different Erythema Score During Challenge Phase - All Treated Subjects</title>
        <description>Evaluation of the test sites after irradiation used following scoring system: score 0=normal skin (no visible reaction); score 1= faint, barely perceptible to moderate redness with poorly defined margins (not clinically significant); score 2=moderate to intense redness with well defined margins; score 3=redness with well defined edema; score 4=redness with papules, vesicles, or ulceration. During Challenge Phase, each subject had the following four virgin test sites: Treated irradiated test site; Treated non-irradiated test site; Untreated irradiated test site; Untreated non-irradiated test site. All four test sites were evaluated according to the above scoring system at 24, 48, and 72 hours following patch application (3 different time points), and the number of test sites with available scores from all these time points were reported for all treated subjects.</description>

Two additional sites with no Butenafine HCl 1% (untreated sites) were also occluded. Sites were at least 2.5 cm apart. The patches were removed 24 hours later and the sites were lightly wiped. Test sites were evaluated. Butenafine HCl 1% (2 μl/cm^2) was applied to the treated irradiated site. After 15 minutes, the treated irradiated site and the untreated irradiated site were irradiated with 0.5 MED of UVA/UVB irradiation followed by 10 Joules/cm^2 of UVA from a xenon arc solar simulator equipped with a Schott WG345 to eliminate UVB radiation. The remaining sites served as the treated non-irradiated site and untreated non-irradiated site.</description>

        <title>Development of Erythema on the Treated Non-irradiated Test Sites During Challenge Phase Reported as Number of Test Site With Different Erythema Score - All Treated Subjects</title>
        <description>Evaluation of the test sites after irradiation used following scoring system: score 0=normal skin (no visible reaction); score 1= faint, barely perceptible to moderate redness with poorly defined margins (not clinically significant); score 2=moderate to intense redness with well defined margins; score 3=redness with well defined edema; score 4=redness with papules, vesicles, or ulceration. During Challenge Phase, each subject had the following four virgin test sites: Treated irradiated test site; Treated non-irradiated test site; Untreated irradiated test site; Untreated non-irradiated test site. All four test sites were evaluated according to the above scoring system at 24, 48, and 72 hours following patch application (3 different time points), and the number of test sites with available scores from all these time points were reported for all treated subjects.</description>

Two additional sites with no Butenafine HCl 1% (untreated sites) were also occluded. Sites were at least 2.5 cm apart. The patches were removed 24 hours later and the sites were lightly wiped. Test sites were evaluated. Butenafine HCl 1% (2 μl/cm^2) was applied to the treated irradiated site. After 15 minutes, the treated irradiated site and the untreated irradiated site were irradiated with 0.5 MED of UVA/UVB irradiation followed by 10 Joules/cm^2 of UVA from a xenon arc solar simulator equipped with a Schott WG345 to eliminate UVB radiation. The remaining sites served as the treated non-irradiated site and untreated non-irradiated site.</description>

            <description>5 μl/cm^2 of the Butenafine HCl 1% was applied directly to each of the two virgin sites (treated sites) adjacent to the induction patch sites and covered with Hilltop chambers with Webril pad and tape was applied over the chambers to secure the occlusive patches to the skin. Two additional sites with no Butenafine HCl 1% (untreated sites) were also occluded. Sites were at least 2.5 cm apart. The patches were removed 24 hours later and the sites were lightly wiped. Test sites were evaluated. Butenafine HCl 1% (2 μl/cm^2) was applied to the treated irradiated site. After 15 minutes, the treated irradiated site and the untreated irradiated site were irradiated with 0.5 MED of UVA/UVB irradiation followed by 10 Joules/cm^2 of UVA from a xenon arc solar simulator equipped with a Schott WG345 to eliminate UVB radiation. The remaining sites served as the treated non-irradiated site and untreated non-irradiated site.</description>

          <title>Development of Erythema on the Treated Non-irradiated Test Sites During Challenge Phase Reported as Number of Test Site With Different Erythema Score - All Evaluable Subjects</title>
          <description>Evaluation of the test sites after irradiation used following scoring system: score 0=normal skin (no visible reaction); score 1= faint, barely perceptible to moderate redness with poorly defined margins (not clinically significant); score 2=moderate to intense redness with well defined margins; score 3=redness with well defined edema; score 4=redness with papules, vesicles, or ulceration. During Challenge Phase, each subject had the following four virgin test sites: Treated irradiated test site; Treated non-irradiated test site; Untreated irradiated test site; Untreated non-irradiated test site. All four test sites were evaluated according to the above scoring system at 24, 48, and 72 hours following patch application (3 different time points), and the number of test sites with available scores from all these time points were reported for all evaluable subjects.</description>

          <description>During the Induction Phase, participants received Butenafine HCl 1% on the treated irradiated skin test site followed by UV irradiation and on the treated non-irradiated skin test site without UV radiation, two times per week for three consecutive weeks. After 10 days of Rest Phase, during the Challenge Phase, participants received same procedure on the two virgin sites (treated sites) as in Induction Phase, and two additional sites with no Butenafine HCl 1% (untreated sites) were also occluded. Test sites were evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 hours after irradiation using the same grading scale used during Induction Phase.</description>
