    <textblock>
      The current internationally accepted treatment method for familial adenomatous polyposis is&#xD;
      prophylactic total colorectal resection combined with endoscopic follow-up. However, total&#xD;
      colorectal resection will bring a sharp decline in the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, how to improve treatment methods and improve the quality of life for such patients&#xD;
      under the premise of medical quality is the current medical focus. This study intends to&#xD;
      establish three parallel observation cohorts, namely the surgical treatment group, the&#xD;
      intensive colonoscopy treatment group, and the autonomous monitoring group. During the&#xD;
      three-year study period, the investigators observed changes in the number of adenomas,&#xD;
      carcinogenesis, and medical expenses in each group during the 3-year study period, and&#xD;
      compared the groups to determine whether the intensive colonoscopy therapy has the&#xD;
      possibility of delaying or replacing preventive surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial adenomatous polyposis is a kind of colorectal cancer syndrome, which belongs to rare&#xD;
      diseases. It is estimated that the number of patients in China is about 100,000, accounting&#xD;
      for about 1% of all colorectal cancer patients. This type of patients onset between the ages&#xD;
      of ten and thirty years old. The typical manifestation is the growth of tens to thousands of&#xD;
      colorectal adenomas, and the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is close to 100%, accompanied&#xD;
      by multiple extraintestinal manifestations . Without treatment, the average life span is&#xD;
      40-50 years. The current internationally accepted treatment method is prophylactic total&#xD;
      colorectal resection combined with endoscopic follow-up. This program has a significant&#xD;
      effect and can extend life expectancy by 10-20 years. However, total colorectal resection&#xD;
      will bring a sharp decline in the quality of life of patients. The patients will lose many&#xD;
      abilities (working ability, social ability, fertility, etc.) from the age of 20, and the&#xD;
      prolonged survival period also brings more misery. This, in turn, also reduces the compliance&#xD;
      of treatment. Many patients refuse to accept surgery and turn to endoscopic treatment or even&#xD;
      give up treatment. However, there is currently no evidence that methods other than&#xD;
      prophylactic surgery can effectively control the risk of colorectal cancer in such patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, how to improve treatment methods and improve the quality of life for such patients&#xD;
      under the premise of medical quality is the current medical focus. This study intends to&#xD;
      establish three parallel observation cohorts, namely the surgical treatment group, the&#xD;
      intensive colonoscopy treatment group, and the autonomous monitoring group. Among them, the&#xD;
      intensive colonoscopy treatment group will be treated with colonoscopy intensive treatment&#xD;
      (that is, colonoscopy treatment is performed every 3 months, Carry out colorectal tumor&#xD;
      reduction in segments, and continue to control the growth of adenomas several times) for&#xD;
      patients who refuse surgery. During the three-year study period, the investigators observed&#xD;
      changes in the number of adenomas, carcinogenesis, and medical expenses in each group during&#xD;
      the 3-year study period, and compared the groups to determine whether the intensive&#xD;
      colonoscopy therapy has the possibility of delaying or replacing preventive surgery, so as to&#xD;
      explore ways to improve the quality of life of such patients.&#xD;
