  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators planned to compare the effectiveness of an intravenous&#xD;
      ibuprofen against an intravenous dexketoprofen among patients (18-65 years) who were admitted&#xD;
      to the emergency department (ED) with acute migraine-related headaches and diagnosed migraine&#xD;
      without aura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients who presented with migraine-related headache to emergency departments&#xD;
      will be included in this study. Two different therapy option are created; first, 400mg&#xD;
      intravenous ibuprofen with 10mg intravenous metoclopramide Hcl , second, 50 mg intravenous&#xD;
      dexketoprofen with 10mg intravenous metoclopramide Hcl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients's headache scores will be measured with visual analog score (VAS) at the&#xD;
      pretreatment and post-treatment periods (0. minutes, 30. minutes, and 60. minutes.) 60&#xD;
      minutes after treatment, as a rescue therapy, 100mg tramadol will be given to patients whose&#xD;
      headache score does not decrease by more than 50% from pretreatment-VAS score.&#xD;
