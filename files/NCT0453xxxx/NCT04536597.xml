    <textblock>
      Background: In various experimental or clinical studies, it has been reported that the jelly&#xD;
      made from the quince seed is effective in healing wounds (attributed to the antioxidants,&#xD;
      which increased fibroblast activity and collagen production, facilitated the formation of&#xD;
      granulation tissue and increased blood circulation) and has no side effects or&#xD;
      contraindications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To evaluates the effects of quince seed jelly and breast milk on nipple fissures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomised controlled experimental study.&#xD;

    <description>Quince seed jelly, prepared by the researcher, was given to the mothers belonging to this group. Briefly, 3 g (2-3 pieces) of quince seeds are placed in 100 mL water and heated to boiling for 10 min. The prepared quince kernel was used for 3 days, immediately after cooling.14,15 On the 1st day postpartum, the researcher provided the mothers with practical training at the hospital, regarding the application of quince seed jelly to the nipple and areola and leaving it to dry. This training was repeated on the 3rd, 7th and 10th days, to ensure that the mothers followed it precisely. The training process was completed in 5-10 min, including questions and answers. Every 3-4 days (days 1, 3, 7 and 10), quince seed jelly prepared by the researcher was given to the mothers to continue applying, according to the procedure. The mothers were asked to apply it after every breastfeeding.</description>

    <description>Mothers in this group received practical training, conducted by the researcher on the 1st day postpartum at the hospital, on applying a few drops of their breast milk to the nipples and areola after each breastfeeding and leaving it to dry. This training lasted 5-10 min. Breast milk application of mothers in this group was recorded on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 10th days, by the researcher.</description>
