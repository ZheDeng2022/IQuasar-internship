  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate if the level of hearing aid (HA) technology has an impact on&#xD;
      self-reported outcomes in patients with presbycusis in terms of overall IOI-HA scores, Factor&#xD;
      1, Factor 2 scores, SSQ scores, and the SSQ domains. The study explores if presbycusis&#xD;
      patients report better outcomes with premium level HA technology compared to basic level HA&#xD;
      technology. Further, the study investigates if premium level HAs provide more high-frequency&#xD;
      gain than basic HAs using Real Ear Measurements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In hearing rehabilitation clinics today, the choice of hearing aid (HA) technology level is&#xD;
      primarily based on the individual hearing care providersÂ´ preferences. There is a lack of&#xD;
      knowledge in which level of HA technology should be chosen for patients with presbycusis and&#xD;
      if these patients will report higher benefit from more technologically advanced hearing aids.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to investigate if level of hearing aid technology has an impact on&#xD;
      self-reported outcomes measures as the IOI-HA, SSQ, and 15-D questionnaire in patients with&#xD;
      presbycusis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial. A subgroup of&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with presbycusis and participating in the Danish National Better hEAring&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (BEAR) project was invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected from the Department of Audiology at Odense University Hospital (OUH),&#xD;
      Region of Southern Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a hearing examination which consisted of a pure-tone audiometry,&#xD;
      bone-conduction thresholds at 250 Hz to 4 kHz, and a measure of word recognition scores (WRS)&#xD;
      and speech reception thresholds (SRT) detecting the threshold at the 50% correct response&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires were sent to all patients two weeks prior to the first visit in clinic and&#xD;
      included; a non-standardized health-related questionnaire containing questions on demographic&#xD;
      details such as sex, age, HA experience, motivation and the SSQ questionnaire. The IOI-HA&#xD;
      questionnaire was sent if patients were experienced HA users at the time of inclusion. All&#xD;
      questionnaires were compiled and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)&#xD;
      tools developed by Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States (Harris et al.&#xD;
      2009, 2019) and is hosted by Odense Patient Explorative Network (OPEN) in the Region of&#xD;
      Southern Denmark. Patients received the questionnaires through an online link generated by&#xD;
      REDCap, but a paper-and-pencil version was also available if necessary when they entered the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized into two groups based on age, sex and WRS, and fitted with either a&#xD;
      high-end or a basic level hearing aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately two months after hearing aid fitting, a follow-up visit was scheduled where a&#xD;
      Real Ear Measurement (REM) was carried out. The IOI-HA and SSQ questionnaires were re-sent to&#xD;
      all patients two weeks prior the follow-up visit.&#xD;
