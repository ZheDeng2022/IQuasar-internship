  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled study in which we aim to include 60 persons with&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis and 30 healthy controls. Two different learning strategies, an explicit&#xD;
      and an implicit one, will be compared on effects on dual task performance. Further, clinical&#xD;
      profile associated with these effects, and brain activity measured by functional&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy during dual tasking will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the study will cover 4 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: examine clinical profile; Day 2: baseline dual task measures; Day 3: experimental&#xD;
      learning paradigm with subjects randomly assigned to either the implicit or the explicit&#xD;
      learning condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 4: delayed retention dual task and fNIRS measures.&#xD;

    <description>participants will step as fast as possible on a tile that lights up in a goal-directed stepping task on a platform consisting of 21 stepping tiles. Concurrently, they will perform a cognitive task in which they continuously subtract sevens, starting from a 3-digit given start number. Duration of the task depends on the speed of the participant (42 steps).</description>

    <description>a block-design test with 3 tasks (cognitive ST, motor ST and DT) of 25 seconds per task-block (repeated 5 times) will be conducted with a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging system to measure hemoglobin changes during performance of the task and compared between single task and dual task conditions and between groups. Besides, fNIRS will be used during 1 task related to the learning-paradigm.</description>

    <description>participants perform a goal-directed stepping task and try to react as fast as possible by stepping on a tile that lights up. Response time (the time between the tile lighting up and the participant stepping on the tile) is the outcome measure of the task. The implicit learning conditions and the explicit learning condition differ from each other in the instructions given prior to the task. The latter group will get more knowledge on the task than the former.</description>
