  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a sub-study of a 5-year study designed to investigate how antibody and T cell responses&#xD;
      following influenza vaccine compare among lung transplant patients, patients waiting for lung&#xD;
      transplantation, and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to investigate influenza vaccine-induced antibodies in lung transplant&#xD;
      patients beyond the season of vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year influenza infection causes significant morbidity and mortality in the general&#xD;
      population making it a serious public health concern. Among those at highest risk for&#xD;
      complications from infection are the immunocompromised. Effective influenza immunization that&#xD;
      confers protection throughout the season is critical for lung transplant recipients because&#xD;
      in addition to aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, infection directly affects the&#xD;
      transplanted organ. Studies of influenza vaccine response rates in lung transplant patients&#xD;
      show generally lower antibody concentrations, but acceptable influenza vaccine response rates&#xD;
      compared with healthy individuals. However, little is known about the persistence of&#xD;
      influenza vaccine-induced antibody concentration in either healthy or immunosuppressed&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza antibody concentrations persist at seroprotective levels (defined as antibody&#xD;
      concentrations at least 40 hemagglutination units) up to a year post vaccination. However,&#xD;
      the investigators could find no information regarding persistence beyond one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the high rates of persisting influenza vaccine antibody in&#xD;
      immunosuppressed lung transplant individuals would match the rates of persisting&#xD;
      vaccine-antibody in healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza antibody concentrations against viruses no longer included in the vaccine were&#xD;
      measured in serum by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) annually (individual&#xD;
      participants followed for 3 years). Samples were collected at 2-4 weeks post-vaccination.&#xD;
      Seroprotection was defined as a titer of â‰¥ 1:40 and was compared between groups over the&#xD;
      measured term using Fisher's exact tests.&#xD;
