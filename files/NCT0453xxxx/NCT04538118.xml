  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disability was evaluated with Patient-Specific Functional Scale.Patients nominate 3 to 5 activities that they are unable to do or having difficulty doing because of their injury or problem. These activities are rated on an 11-point scale, where 0 is unable to perform the activity and 10 is able to perform the activity at preinjury level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity Limitation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activity limitation was evaluated with The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand. Scale score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disability was evaluated with Upper-Extremity Functional Index.Twenty prescribed upper extremity activities are rated by patients according to a 5-point scale, where 0 is extreme difficulty or unable to perform the activity, and 4 is no difficulty. Higher scores mean better outcome scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was evaluated with Numeric Pain Rating Scale. It requires the patient to rate their pain on a defined scale. 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion</measure>

    <description>Shoulder disability was evaluated with Patient-specific functional scale, the disabilities of the shoulder, arm and hand questionnaire, and the upper extremity functional index.&#xD;
First assessment was applied when patients came to physical therapy clinic at first.&#xD;
Second assessment was repeated after 6 weeks.</description>
