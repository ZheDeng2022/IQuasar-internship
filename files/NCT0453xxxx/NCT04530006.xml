  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain tumor in adults. The strikingly poor&#xD;
      survival for patients with GBM (average survival 14-16 months following diagnosis) is due in&#xD;
      part to limited early detection methods and an absence of effective therapeutic options. The&#xD;
      study proposed would establish important evidence for the use of Health Canada approved drugs&#xD;
      such as amantadine as a safe, effective and affordable way to monitor GBM. The method is&#xD;
      based on the overproduction of a key enzyme in GBM cells called spermine/ spermadine n-acetyl&#xD;
      transferase (SSAT1). The increased SSAT1 expression in GBM results in increased metabolism of&#xD;
      the drug which is detected in the blood or urine of patients with GBM. The levels of&#xD;
      acetyl-amantadine captured will be correlated with the tumor burden as seen on the MRIs of&#xD;
      these patients. Thus, the study aims to determine the usefulness of amantadine as a&#xD;
      diagnostic biomarker for GBM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with a median&#xD;
      age of onset of 55 to 60 years. Most patients are treated with postoperative radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy following their initial surgery. For newly diagnosed, high grade gliomas, the&#xD;
      first post-radiation cycle of temozolomide (an oral chemotherapy drug) typically begins four&#xD;
      weeks after completion of radiation therapy1. During radiation, temozolomide or lomustine is&#xD;
      given daily (seven days per week). Assessment of response and progression is made through&#xD;
      brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, which is typically obtained within one&#xD;
      month after completion of radiation therapy and then every two months during adjuvant&#xD;
      temozolomide to assess disease status1. With the available standard of care, the median&#xD;
      overall survival of patients with glioblastoma remains very low - approximately 10 to 12&#xD;
      months2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The poor prognosis with GBM is a result of an absence of early detection and ineffective&#xD;
      treatment options. The proposed exploratory pilot project attempts to addresses the problem&#xD;
      of accurate tumor progression monitoring in GBM through the development of a drug biomarker&#xD;
      that monitors spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) activity. SSAT1 is an&#xD;
      important enzyme involved in polyamine regulation in the cell. As polyamines are essential&#xD;
      for tumor proliferation, SSAT1 is over-expressed in many different cancers, as shown in a&#xD;
      number of non-clinical trials3,4,5. These trials provide a rationale for our project: if&#xD;
      SSAT1 is overexpressed in cancers including glioblastoma, then a substrate of SSAT1 could&#xD;
      serve as a biomarker for determining the cellular activity of SSAT1. An effective substrate&#xD;
      is amantadine, and following its acetylation by SSAT1, N-acetylamantadine levels excreted in&#xD;
      the blood and urine samples of patients with glioblastoma could be used to indicate the&#xD;
      presence of upregulation of SSAT1, and therefore, indicative of cancer. Recently published&#xD;
      clinical trials involving investigators here at University of Manitoba and CancerCare&#xD;
      Manitoba have reported a method for assessing tumor progression in lung and breast cancer&#xD;
      patients based on acetyl- amantadine levels in blood and urine6,7,8. The assay is predicated&#xD;
      on the selective acetylation of the drug amantadine by SSAT1. Published studies indicate&#xD;
      increases in acetyl-amantadine in blood and urine from patients receiving a single oral dose&#xD;
      of amantadine was predictive of tumor burden. Tappia et.al.7 reported that human cancer is&#xD;
      associated with high urinary concentration of acetyl-amantadine with receiver-operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) for acetyl-amantadine demonstrated to be 0.689 (CI: 0.591-0.786, 95%) in&#xD;
      lung cancer and 0.717 (CI: 0.577-0.858, 95%) for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the use of acetyl-amantadine as an early biomarker for lung and breast cancer, the&#xD;
      present study protocol examines the extent to which acetyl-amantadine levels in blood and&#xD;
      urine can be used to detect glioblastoma progression, particularly tumor recurrence which&#xD;
      happens in the majority of patients and is considered inevitable after a median survival time&#xD;
      of 32 - 36 weeks1. There are currently no studies that have attempted to determine the&#xD;
      diagnostic value of acetyl-amantadine in glioblastoma patients, and therefore, this would be&#xD;
      a pilot project. Under this protocol, patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (newly or&#xD;
      recurrent) who are following the standard of care (surgical resection and&#xD;
      radiation/chemotherapy) will be enrolled in the study. An initial assessment of the&#xD;
      participant's baseline acetyl-amantadine levels in blood will be determined at the first&#xD;
      visit. Thereafter, participants will be administered a standard 200 mg dose of the Health&#xD;
      Canada approved drug amantadine at every visit in which MRI based imaging assessments are&#xD;
      being performed (typically, every 8 - 12 weeks). Blood and urine samples will be taken at&#xD;
      each visit to assay for acetyl-amantadine levels. These resulting acetyl-amantadine levels&#xD;
      will be correlated with MRI based image findings to determine the extent to which this&#xD;
      biomarker can be used for treatment monitoring in glioblastoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the hypothesis is that acetyl-amantadine levels in blood or urine can be used to track&#xD;
      tumor progression, an increase in acetyl-amantadine level would not indicate per se what type&#xD;
      of tumor was present. For this reason, a metabolic profile on blood and urine samples&#xD;
      collected from glioblastoma patients will be performed, to determine if there is a metabolic&#xD;
      signature that can be established for glioblastoma.&#xD;

    <description>Samples of plasma and urine will be analyzed by established analytical methods (as developed by Biopharmaceutical Research Inc., Vancouver, B.C.; Health Canada and FDA approved). Quantitative analysis of amantadine and acetyl-amantadine in plasma and urine samples will be performed using liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). Samples (50 µl) will be spiked with 50 µl of internal standard, deuterated acetyl-amantadine (d3-Ac-amantidine), and proteins precipitated with 0.5 ml of ice-cold methanol. The lyophilized deproteinated samples are reconstituted in 0.1 ml of 0.1% formic acid. Samples are injected onto a C-18 stationary column and eluted using a gradient mobile phase consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (B). The run time for each sample is 9 minutes with the mobile phase starting at 5% B and increasing to 95% B during sample elution.</description>
