  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The thoracic epidural block (TEB) and thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) are the most&#xD;
      commonly used techniques for analgesia after thoracic surgery. However, TEA has several&#xD;
      adverse effects, such as hypotension, motor blockade, hematoma, and abscess and TPVB has a&#xD;
      chance of epidural spread and pneumothorax, and multiple injections are needed if more than 4&#xD;
      dermatome analgesia is required. Recently, erector spinae plane block (ESPB) was reported as&#xD;
      a treatment for thoracic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPB is a relatively simple technique with easily identified sonographic landmarks, and a&#xD;
      catheter is easily inserted into the plane after distention induced by the injection.&#xD;
      Additionally, the ESPB has the potential to provide both somatic and visceral sensory&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selectivity of dexmedetomidine to the α2-receptors is eight times of its prototype,&#xD;
      clonidine. Accordingly, dexmedetomidine is a more powerful sedative and analgesic drug than&#xD;
      clonidine with less hemodynamic derangements from the α1-receptor activation. Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      has been primarily used for intra- venous sedation in intensive care settings. The unique&#xD;
      analgesic properties of dexmedetomidine have encouraged the anesthesiologists to use it&#xD;
      perineurally. Previous studies have declared that dexmedetomidine potentiates local&#xD;
      anesthetic effect when administered by neuroaxial route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effect ultrasound erector spinae plane block with&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine infusion in management of acute and chronic post thoracotomy pain.&#xD;
