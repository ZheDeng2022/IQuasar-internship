  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to determine the feasibility of a stationary aerobic cycling&#xD;
      intervention and explore if aerobic exercise independently promotes remyelination in people&#xD;
      with multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-traumatic disabling neurologic condition of&#xD;
      young adulthood, affecting more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Permanent disability in MS&#xD;
      is caused by recurrent demyelination due to episodic inflammation, followed by neuronal&#xD;
      damage, axonal degeneration, and progressive failure of remyelination. There is an urgent&#xD;
      need to restore activity and participation in people with MS (pwMS), and remyelination is the&#xD;
      most promising therapeutic strategy to accomplish this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remyelination in pwMS will likely require integration of pharmacologic and rehabilitative&#xD;
      approaches to ensure effective remyelination of appropriate neural pathways. Aerobic exercise&#xD;
      is an ideal complement to remyelinating medications because aerobic exercise 1) improves&#xD;
      walking function in pwMS, and 2) promotes remyelination in animal models both independently&#xD;
      and synergistically with medications. However, there are many unknowns that need to be&#xD;
      addressed before aerobic exercise can be explored in multimodal clinical trials for&#xD;
      remyelination. First, it is imperative to understand how myelination impacts disability in&#xD;
      MS, as many other factors could contribute to reduced activity and participation.&#xD;
      Additionally, as remyelination occurs over 12 to 24 weeks, it is imperative to establish the&#xD;
      feasibility of similar duration of aerobic exercise interventions, and explore if exercise&#xD;
      independently influences established remyelination outcomes before integration into&#xD;
      multimodal strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, single-blind, parallel clinical trial of a 24-week aerobic stationary&#xD;
      cycling intervention to determine feasibility and explore if aerobic exercise independently&#xD;
      promotes remyelination in pwMS.&#xD;
