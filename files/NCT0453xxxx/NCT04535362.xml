  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine if switching from menthol to non-menthol cigarettes will change the dose-effect&#xD;
      curves for positive subjective effects and alleviation of smoking urges as a function of&#xD;
      nicotine delivery rate in smokers.&#xD;

      A placebo-controlled study that will recruit male and female menthol nicotine dependent&#xD;
      smokers. Following screening and evaluation as described above, eligible participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study which will last about 4 weeks. Eligible, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to menthol or non-menthol smoking condition for 2 weeks (Phase 1) and then will be&#xD;
      switched to the alternative condition for another 2 weeks (Phase 2). The smoking condition&#xD;
      will be open label. Participants will be provided with free cigarettes in Phases 1 and 2. For&#xD;
      the menthol condition, participants will be provided their usual brand of menthol cigarettes&#xD;
      and for the non-menthol condition, they will be provided a matched-brand non-menthol&#xD;
      cigarette (e.g., Newport Non-Menthol Gold 100s for those who smoke Newport Menthol Gold&#xD;
      100s). In week 2 of each Phase, participants will have a test session. Each session will&#xD;
      include 3 infusions in the same order: nicotine (1 mg per 70 kg body weight) delivered over 5&#xD;
      minutes, saline and nicotine (1 mg/ 70 kg) delivered over 2.5 minutes. Once the participants&#xD;
      complete the test session, participants will be crossed-over to the alternative treatment.&#xD;
      The period between the 2 Phases will not be longer than one week.&#xD;

    <description>The SAFTEE is a technique for the systematic assessment of side effects in clinical trials developed by National Institute of Mental Health (Levine &amp; Schooler, 1986). It is a questionnaire that rates the current severity of a wide range of somatic, behavioral and affective symptoms in general and specific inquiry formats. It is designed to report adverse health events, regardless of whether or not they are suspected to be drug related, in order to reduce the under-reporting of unanticipated events compared with &quot;known or expected&quot; events.</description>
