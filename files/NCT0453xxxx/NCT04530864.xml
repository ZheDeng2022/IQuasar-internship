  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study will use a self controlled design for 35 eyes. Patients scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo routine cataract surgery in at least one of their eyes will have their pre-surgical&#xD;
      measurements performed, IOL calculated and surgery planned. Then they will receive insertion&#xD;
      of an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert into the inferior punctum. At 2 weeks (+/- 2&#xD;
      days) post-insertion, patients will return for an identical set of measurements. The IOL will&#xD;
      be calculated and the surgery planned based on post-insert data. The insert will be removed&#xD;
      if present (manually or via saline irrigation). This self controlled design allows for&#xD;
      greater control of potential confounders tied to participants' systemic and ocular health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocular surface optimization is a pre-operative necessity. In cataract surgery patients, an&#xD;
      unstable tear film reduces the quality of corneal reflections and therefore can compromise K&#xD;
      readings, which in turn can affect the accuracy of IOL calculations and result in suboptimum&#xD;
      refractive results. To obtain accurate measurements, patients are routinely pre-treated with&#xD;
      a variety of medications and therapies. However, these therapies can take time, which may&#xD;
      lead to surgical delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroids can positively impact the stability of the tear film by inhibiting and preventing&#xD;
      ocular surface inflammation. Punctal plugs are also widely used for the treatment of dry eye&#xD;
      manifestations, by blocking the tear drainage, increasing tear film and eye moisture.&#xD;
      Dextenza is a sustained-release dexamethasone intracanalicular insert recently approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for pain and inflammation post ophthalmic surgery. It is placed into the canaliculus&#xD;
      via the lower punctum and is designed to release steroid medication for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated that ocular surface disease affects the reliability of IOL&#xD;
      calculations, potentially affecting outcomes. The insert of a punctal plug that can deliver a&#xD;
      sustained release of dexamethasone to the eye 2 weeks (+/- 2 days) prior to final&#xD;
      preoperative measurements may provide adequate therapy, improving the ocular surface status&#xD;
      and, therefore, improve the reliability of IOL selection in patients undergoing cataract&#xD;
      surgery, in a comparatively short amount of time, without introducing patient compliance&#xD;
      barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-surgical measurements, IOL calculations, and surgical plans prior to the insertion of the&#xD;
      insert will be compared to measurements, IOL calculations, and surgical plans at 2 weeks&#xD;
      following intracanalicular dexamethasone insertion. Surgery will proceed with data from the&#xD;
      post-insert measurements. Final refractive outcomes at one month from the second eye surgery&#xD;
      will be compared to pre-insert data to determine refractive accuracy.&#xD;

    <description>The Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness Questionnaire (SPEED) evaluates both the frequency and severity of symptoms. The patient grades the severity of her symptoms on a scale of zero to four with zero being no symptoms and four being intolerable symptoms. The numeric value for each answer is simply added with scores ranging from zero to 28. 0-4 MILD dry eye symptoms, 5-7 MODERATE dry eye symptoms, + SEVERE dry eye symptoms.</description>
