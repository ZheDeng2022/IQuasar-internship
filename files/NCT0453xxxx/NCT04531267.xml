    <textblock>
      Although the epidemiological studies indicate how magnesium and calcium may interact to&#xD;
      affect cardiovascular risk, current clinical trials have not elucidated the associations,&#xD;
      particularly among hypertensive patients. To address the research gap, we have to examine how&#xD;
      magnesium may influence cardiovascular profile of hypertensive patients via the modification&#xD;
      of calcium homeostasis. Meanwhile, large-scale cohorts in China suggested keeping dietary&#xD;
      calcium: magnesium ratio within 2.3 can reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality. The&#xD;
      results indicate the potential for individualized nutrition. This study will recruit&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertensive patients taking single drug and investigate whether&#xD;
      calcium-magnesium combined supplements help to control their blood pressure. In standardized&#xD;
      manner, subjects in the intervention group and the control group (each with 21 subjects) will&#xD;
      be assessed for their dietary calcium and magnesium intake in the previous three months, so&#xD;
      that researchers can provide calcium and/or magnesium supplements to maintain a&#xD;
      calcium/magnesium ratio as 2.3. The effect of supplementation will be evaluated by the blood&#xD;
      pressure changes in the 12th week of intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, the prevalence of hypertension in Chinese adults was 25.2%, which can be translated&#xD;
      into 25 million people with hypertension in Guangdong Province. Hypertension is also related&#xD;
      to narrowing and occlusion of the cardiovascular vessels. In China, coronary heart disease&#xD;
      and stroke are the main causes of death in many provinces, and the early prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertension has become a research direction&#xD;
      dedicated to the whole population. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular ion in&#xD;
      the body, which can regulate vascular tone, and together with calcium leads to changes in&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle tone and contractility. Magnesium deficiency is associated with&#xD;
      oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, platelet aggregation, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, and hyperglycemia; in the long run, dietary magnesium deficiency also increases&#xD;
      the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and&#xD;
      cancer. However, the impact of nutrients on health is affected by different dietary factors.&#xD;
      Calcium and magnesium share different ion receptors or channels, including Calcium-sensing&#xD;
      receptor (modulates parathyroid hormone levels, thereby increasing the production of vitamin&#xD;
      D), as well as TRPM6 and TRPM7 (modulates the absorption of calcium and magnesium ions). In a&#xD;
      large meta-analysis, there is also evidence that calcium supplements may reduce blood&#xD;
      pressure in healthy people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in epidemiological studies, we can see the interactive relationship between&#xD;
      calcium and magnesium. In the American population, when the ratio of calcium to magnesium is&#xD;
      &lt;2.8, dietary intake of calcium and magnesium can reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma.&#xD;
      However, when the ratio of calcium to magnesium is too low (&lt;2.0), it may also cause adverse&#xD;
      effects. According to data from more than 130,000 people in the Shanghai Women's Health Study&#xD;
      and the Shanghai Men's Health Study, the median calcium-magnesium ratio (1.7) in the Chinese&#xD;
      population is much lower than the calcium-magnesium ratio (3.0) in the US population. When&#xD;
      the calcium-magnesium ratio is &gt; 1.7, calcium and magnesium intake can reduce the mortality&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease; but when the calcium-magnesium ratio is &lt;1.7, magnesium intake&#xD;
      increases the risk of cardiovascular death in women. Although the interaction between&#xD;
      magnesium and calcium can influence cardiovascular risk in epidemiological studies, the&#xD;
      current clinical evidence have not fully verified the relationship, especially among&#xD;
      hypertensive patients . To substantiate the research findings, it is necessary to explore how&#xD;
      calcium-magnesium intervention can improve the cardiovascular risk factors of hypertensive&#xD;
      patients. In addition, personalized nutrition intervention is also a research direction to be&#xD;
      explored. Unlike the unified dosage in the past, it may be more important to formulate&#xD;
      supplements according to individual dietary habits. In 2018, Vanderbilt University's team&#xD;
      conducted a clinical trial among 180 healthy adults with personalized magnesium supplements&#xD;
      and examined on the effects of blood vitamin D. They adjusted the dose of supplements&#xD;
      according to the calcium-magnesium ratio in the diet at baseline to achieve a&#xD;
      calcium-magnesium ratio of 2.3, and tested changes in various types of vitamin D in the&#xD;
      blood. They found that the effect of magnesium supplements on vitamin D levels varied&#xD;
      according to the baseline 25(OH)D concentration. When 25(OH)D levels are higher, magnesium&#xD;
      supplements reduced the levels of 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3. But when 25(OH)D is low,&#xD;
      magnesium supplements increased the level of 25(OH)D3. This is the first study to use&#xD;
      baseline dietary intakes for personalized nutrition interventions, but they have not explored&#xD;
      whether interventions can affect cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive patients. More&#xD;
      randomized trials are needed to verify the efficacy of intervention, especially in high-risk&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer the above questions, this study is a randomized trial to ensure that the highest&#xD;
      level of evidence is obtained and will recruit hypertensive patients in Guangdong Provincial&#xD;
      People's Hospital. The intervention and control group have the same number of people.&#xD;
