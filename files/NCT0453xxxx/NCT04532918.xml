  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study aims to quantify the effects of cyclosporine, a broad transporter&#xD;
      inhibitor, and rifampicin, an OATP1B1/3 inhibitor, on verinurad pharmacokinetics (PK). The&#xD;
      study is conducted in accordance with Food and Drug Administration guidance on Clinical Drug&#xD;
      Interaction Studies, 2020. Verinurad will be developed as a fixed combination since it will&#xD;
      always be administered together with allopurinol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study will be an open-label, 3-period, 3-treatment, fixed-sequence study in&#xD;
      healthy subjects (males and females of non-childbearing potential), performed at a single&#xD;
      Clinical Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of the following periods (visits):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period (Visit 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fixed sequence of 3 Treatment Periods during which subjects will be resident at the&#xD;
           Clinical Unit from one day prior to administration of verinurad+allopurinol (Day -1) of&#xD;
           Treatment Period 1 until the morning of Day 5 of the Treatment Period 2, and similarly&#xD;
           for Treatment Period 3. There will be a washout period between Treatment Periods 2 and 3&#xD;
           dosing. The 3 Treatment Periods, include the washout period (Visits 2 to 3);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Visit, after the last administration of verinurad+allopurinol (Visit 4).&#xD;
