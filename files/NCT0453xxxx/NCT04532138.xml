  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An Anticipated difficult tracheal intubation is recommended to be managed performing the so&#xD;
      called &quot;Awake tracheal endoscopic intubation&quot; (ATI) with the maintenance of patient's&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing after an adequate sedation and topical anesthesia of upper airways,&#xD;
      providing supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially only flexible bronchoscope was considered the device of choice (the gold standard)&#xD;
      for ATI but in the last decade videolaryngoscopes with hyper-angulated blade have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be an efficacy technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently, endoscopic rigid stylets such as Bonfils (Carl Storz™) and Sensacope&#xD;
      (Acoutronic™) have been proposed as alternative techniques for ATI in the event of expected&#xD;
      difficult tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to date, no comparison studies have been carried out between these two kind of&#xD;
      devices, alternative to flexible fiberscope, for ATI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical prospective randomized-controlled trial of non inferiority. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the intubation success rate between two different devices (C-MAC&#xD;
      Video Laryngoscope and VS-CMAC fiberoptic stylet) in patients with severe predicted difficult&#xD;
      airways scheduled for elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the comparison of success rate for the tracheal intubation,&#xD;
      demonstrating the non inferiority of videostylet efficacy compared to the most consolidated&#xD;
      technique based on videolaryngoscope.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical prospective randomized-controlled trial of non inferiority, set in the&#xD;
      operating theatre of a terziary university hospital in Ancona (Ospedali Riuniti Ancona).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the intubation success rate, defined as correct&#xD;
      positioning of the tracheal tube inside the trachea, between Videostylet (VS-Carl Storz™) and&#xD;
      videolaryngoscope with hyperangulated blade (C-MAC - Carl Storz™) in patients with severe&#xD;
      predicted difficult airways scheduled for elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study, examined in the pre-operative visit, will be asked for&#xD;
      informed consent and will undergo the same anesthetic protocol consisting in upper airways&#xD;
      topicalization with Lidocaine and in smooth/moderate sedation (targeted on Ramsay sedation&#xD;
      scale ≦ 3) by i.v. administration of midazolam 0,03 mg/kg and Fentanyl 100 mcg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival in the operating room, nasal oxygen (5 L/min) and routine monitoring of vital&#xD;
      signs will be applied to all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded at the beginning of the procedure and every 3&#xD;
      minutes until the intubation will be performed, while arterial oxygen saturation is&#xD;
      continuously recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled will be randomly divided into 2 groups regarding to the device used for&#xD;
      ATI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Videolaryngoscope (C-MAC) with Hyperangulated blade (D-blade)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Videostylet (VS) Endotracheal tube will be 6,5-7,0 mm for female and 7,5-8,0 mm for&#xD;
           male.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be registered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  success rate of the procedure defined as correct positioning of the tracheal tube in the&#xD;
           trachea confirmed both endoscopically and through the capnographic curve EtCO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  average time of intubation procedure expressed in sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  operator's assessment of the subjective difficulty / handling of the device by means of&#xD;
           a special analogue numerical scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessment of the patient's tolerance to the procedure by means of a special analogue&#xD;
           numerical scale checked after patient's awakening from anesthesia at the end of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  occurrence of any complications or adverse event during the procedure (desaturation&#xD;
           episodes, hemodynamic changes, oral-pharynx and larynx traumatism)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the comparison of success rate for the tracheal intubation in&#xD;
      patients with anticipated difficult airways, demonstrating the non inferiority of videostylet&#xD;
      efficacy compare to the most consolidated technique based on videolaryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Null Hypothesis will be the following: The rate of Awake tracheal intubation failure with&#xD;
      the VS video stylet is &gt; 10% compared to video-laryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering an unsuccessful intubation rate with the two devices at 10%, a sample of 34&#xD;
      patients (17 per group) is necessary to demonstrate with a power of 90% and alpha error of&#xD;
      0.05 that the rate of intubation failure using the videosylet (study method) does not exceed&#xD;
      10% of the rate of failed intubations through the use of the video laryngoscope (reference&#xD;
      method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally distributed data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation and 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval, while data with non-normal distribution will be expressed as median and&#xD;
      interquartile range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between means will be studied by parametric tests (e.g. Student's t) if the&#xD;
      data are normally distributed and by nonparametric tests (e.g. Wilcoxon) if the distribution&#xD;
      is not normal. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to evaluate the normality of&#xD;
      continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of the patients in the two groups will be compared using the Fisher test&#xD;
      or the Chi-square test for the nominal variables and the Student t test or the Mann - Whitney&#xD;
      U test for the continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each test p &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. For the primary endpoint: The&#xD;
      difference in awake tracheal intubation success rate in the two groups will be assessed using&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. The non-inferiority of the use of the videostylet (VS) compared to the&#xD;
      standard method (videolaryngoscope with D-Blade blade) will be confirmed if the difference,&#xD;
      for 95% confidence interval, is less than the margin of non- inferiority established &quot;a&#xD;
      priori&quot; as 10% after analysis of the literature (Alhomary et al. Anaesthesia 2018; 73:&#xD;
      1151-61)9 and according to clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary endpoints of the study a purely analytical-descriptive evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
