      To compare safety and efficacy between open and robotic partial nephrectomy in treatment of&#xD;
      organ confined complex renal tumors (R.E.N.A.L score more than 7) as regarding surgical&#xD;
      results, morbidity, clinical as well as oncological and functional outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although radical nephrectomy was considered as the only effective treatment for malignant&#xD;
      kidney tumors and maintained the prime solution for such tumors throughout the nineteenth&#xD;
      century, partial nephrectomy became the preferred method in managing tumors of solitary&#xD;
      kidneys, bilateral or hereditary renal tumors and in renal tumors of renal insufficiency&#xD;
      patients. The shift to preserve sufficient as well as functioning renal volume, the improving&#xD;
      experience with renal vasculature, proliferation of energy sources that achieved sufficient&#xD;
      tissue cleavage and haemostatic power and refinements in hypothermia techniques helped the&#xD;
      shift towards nephron sparing surgeries. Partial nephrectomy aimed at achieving complete&#xD;
      removal of renal tumor with preservation of renal function, minimizing ischemia time as well&#xD;
      as operative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open partial nephrectomy was the standard management strategy for organ-confined renal tumors&#xD;
      in many centers worldwide. It is still the preferred method in most situations of complex&#xD;
      tumors. Yet, open surgery has the inherent problem of poorly cosmetic scar, the need for&#xD;
      analgesics, long hospital stay and wound related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) has largely replaced open partial nephrectomy&#xD;
      worldwide as it combines the benefits of nephron sparing surgery (preserving the renal&#xD;
      function) and laparoscopy (decreasing morbidity). The increasing experience of LPN enabled&#xD;
      surgeons to operate not only small, peripheral, exophytic renal tumors, but also larger&#xD;
      infiltrating tumors have been managed similarly. On the other hand, LPN still has technical&#xD;
      difficulties that need steep learning curve to be mastered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic partial nephrectomy has become the surgery of choice not only for most renal tumors&#xD;
      but also for benign kidney lesions. The minimally invasive nature of robotic surgery offers&#xD;
      numerous advantages to the patient over open surgery including minimal tissue trauma, smaller&#xD;
      scars, and faster recovery. Unlike laparoscopy, robotic surgeries grantee a three-dimensional&#xD;
      view. The complex operative steps can be easily done due to the wider range of motion of the&#xD;
      surgical instruments that the robot provides. Moreover, recent studies showed that robotic&#xD;
      partial nephrectomy has shorter ischemia time, less blood loss and faster recovery than&#xD;
      laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the multiplicity of studies done for comparing between open and robotic partial&#xD;
      nephrectomy in cases of small renal tumors, there are fewer studies comparing between open&#xD;
      and robotic partial nephrectomy in management of complex renal tumors, which are not based on&#xD;
      randomized bases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assiut University Hospitals are intending to be in a leading position in the field of minimal&#xD;
      invasive surgery by constructing the first robotic surgery center in Upper Egypt. So, in our&#xD;
      study, although robotic surgery seems to be more expensive, investigators suppose that&#xD;
      robotic partial nephrectomy will yield better surgical and functional results than open&#xD;
      partial nephrectomy in managing complex renal tumors. The promising technology will lead to&#xD;
      decrease the robotic industry cost which, till now, remains the major drawback of robotic&#xD;
      surgery worldwide spread. Another priority of our intended study is that it will alleviate&#xD;
      any selection bias between the two techniques by being a prospective randomized one.&#xD;
