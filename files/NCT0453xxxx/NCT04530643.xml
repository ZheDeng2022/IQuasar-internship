    <textblock>
      A composition containing G Protein Coupled Receptor 19(GPCR19) agonist HY209 and a derivative&#xD;
      thereof is found to have a considerable effect in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and is&#xD;
      proposed as a pharmaceutical ingredient for prevention, treatment and improvement of atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis. The GPCR19 agonist, HY209, is superior to conventional steroid ointment and&#xD;
      immunosuppressant ointment in the treatment and improvement of allergic dermatitis. It&#xD;
      directly reduces the amount of serum immunoglobulin E, which is a major factor of allergic&#xD;
      dermatitis, It increases the T helper type 1(TH1) cytokines that alleviate allergic&#xD;
      dermatitis pathologies, reduces the T helper type 2(TH2) cytokines that aggravate allergic&#xD;
      dermatitis pathologies, and reduces the infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils and&#xD;
      neutrophils into the dermal cells. Thus it can be utilized as a therapeutic drug composition&#xD;
      for atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
