  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study of a 5-year study designed to investigate how antibody and T cell&#xD;
      responses following influenza vaccine compare among lung transplant patients, patients&#xD;
      waiting for lung transplantation, and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, parallel study was done to investigate the responses to influenza vaccine&#xD;
      in consecutive years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplant patients may be at an incrementally higher risk of influenza infection than&#xD;
      other transplant patients. Factors that predispose them to respiratory infection include high&#xD;
      degree of immunosuppression, altered mucociliary clearance, repeated airway instrumentation,&#xD;
      bronchial anastomotic obstruction, disruption of lymphatic drainage, and the exposure of the&#xD;
      transplanted organ to the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influenza vaccine used for those at high risk for influenza morbidity and mortality is an&#xD;
      inactivated trivalent preparation. Influenza vaccine contains 2 type A viruses and 1 type B&#xD;
      virus. The vaccine is reformulated each year based on the viruses expected to circulate&#xD;
      during the upcoming season. A protective antibody response to influenza vaccine is considered&#xD;
      an antibody titer of at least 1:40. Seroconversion following influenza immunization implies&#xD;
      at least a 4-fold increase in antibody concentrations. Although these indicators of a&#xD;
      positive response to influenza immunization have significant overlap, they are not exactly&#xD;
      the same. One must consider that a person may have antibodies before immunization because of&#xD;
      previous exposure to a vaccine virus or an antigenically similar influenza strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seroconversion rates following influenza vaccination are lower in lung transplant patients&#xD;
      than in healthy persons. Clearly, immunization elicits an antibody response in this&#xD;
      population, but the response is not as vigorous as in immunocompetent persons. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that only the B/HongKong virus was associated with a lower seroconversion rate,&#xD;
      and this virus was the only one to change from the previous year's vaccine. Seroconversion&#xD;
      rates decrease with subsequent exposure to the same influenza vaccine viruses, but&#xD;
      seroprotection rates remain the same. It is conceivable that the seroconversion response is&#xD;
      more affected by immunosuppression than is the seroprotection response. Stated another way,&#xD;
      the ability to mount a high spike in antibody production is hindered. It is difficult to&#xD;
      fully ascertain the exact degree of immune impairment in lung transplant recipients because&#xD;
      both studies investigating influenza vaccine response used healthy persons as the comparison&#xD;
      group. Healthy persons may have less experience with influenza vaccine than do persons with&#xD;
      severe respiratory conditions. An immunologically naive host is more likely to mount the&#xD;
      large change in antibody concentration and increase the likelihood of seroconversion.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients waiting for lung transplantation were used as a comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, parallel study was done to investigate the responses to influenza vaccine&#xD;
      in consecutive years. All participants had a blood sample taken for measurement of influenza&#xD;
      antibody titers before receiving the influenza vaccine. Subsequently, the 2004-2005-A/New&#xD;
      Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like, A/Wyoming/3/2003(H3N2), and B/Shanghai/361/2002-like&#xD;
      antigens-and/or 2005-2006-A/New Caledonia/ 20/00(H1N1)-like, A/California/7/2004 (H3N2)-like,&#xD;
      and B/Shanghai/361/2002-like antigens-influenza vaccine was administered intramuscularly.&#xD;
      Serum was stored at -80Â°C until the day of analysis. A second blood sample was obtained 2 to&#xD;
      4 weeks later to measure antibody response.&#xD;
