  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal intubation and general anesthesia has been considered a safe and conventional&#xD;
      routine methodology for thoracic surgery, include multiple rib fratcure. However,adverse&#xD;
      effects such as sore throat, pain, hoarseness, and respiratory complications are common after&#xD;
      that. In this study, we decide to perform surgical stabiliazation of rib fractures by&#xD;
      paravertebral block surgical stabiliazation of rib fractures under awake or appropriate&#xD;
      sedation without endotracheal intubation keeping spontaneous respiration to investigate its&#xD;
      safety and feasibility.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rib fracture is common in the world,especially in chest trauma. Conservative treatment is&#xD;
      used to it for many years but the effect is not well because of continuous pain caused by the&#xD;
      dislocation of broken rib. Surgical stabiliazation of rib fractures can relieve the pain&#xD;
      rapidly and help patient recover to work early. This kind of surgery is constantly conducted&#xD;
      with tracheal intubation and general anesthesia. However,adverse effects such as sore throat,&#xD;
      pain, hoarseness, and respiratory complications are common after that. So we think perform&#xD;
      surgical stabiliazation of rib fractures under awake or appropriate sedation without&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation keeping spontaneous respiration to investigate its safety and&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;
