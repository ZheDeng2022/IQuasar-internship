  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial investigates the efficacy and safety of brodalumab against guselkumab in treatment&#xD;
      for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who still have some remaining symptoms&#xD;
      after ustekinumab treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brodalumab is an anti-interleukin 17 receptor A antibody (IL-17RA) and blocks the&#xD;
      inflammatory effects of different IL-17 cytokines (IL-17A, IL-17C, IL-17F, IL-17A/F&#xD;
      heterodimer, and IL-17E) in the skin. With increasing availability of novel biologics with&#xD;
      new targets, the complexity of choosing the appropriate biologic treatment is ever more&#xD;
      challenging for physicians. Therefore, the primary objective of this trial is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of brodalumab versus guselkumab in adult participants with moderate to severe plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis and inadequate response to ustekinumab, thereby providing new scientific&#xD;
      information that could support decision making in the clinical setting. The study will run&#xD;
      approximately 32 weeks for each participant (including a 2- to 4-weeks screening period and a&#xD;
      28-week treatment period), with the primary endpoint measurement at Week 16. Participants&#xD;
      receive subcutaneous injections of brodalumab or guselkumab. Dummy injections are also given,&#xD;
      so participants, assessors, and investigators are unaware of which treatment is given.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Having 100% improvement from baseline in PASI score. The PASI is the most widely used tool in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of psoriasis. The assessment is done based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation and not in relation to the condition at a previous visit. The investigator assesses the severity of 3 psoriasis disease characteristics (redness, thickness, and scaliness) on each of the 4 body regions (head/neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) according to a severity scale. The investigator also assesses the extent of psoriasis within each of the 4 body regions. This gives a composite score ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating a more severe and/or more extensive condition.</description>

    <description>The DLQI is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the participant's perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their quality of life over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = 'not at all/not relevant'; 1 = 'a little'; 2 = 'a lot'; 3 = 'very much'). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor quality of life.</description>

    <description>The SF-36v2 is a 36-item general health status assessment. Participants answer each question by selecting 1 of 3 to 6 categorical response options. The SF-36v2 yields scores for 8 health domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health) and 2 psychometrically derived summary scores (a physical component summary and a mental component summary).</description>
