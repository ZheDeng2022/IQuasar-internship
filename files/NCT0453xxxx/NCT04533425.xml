  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope, or transient loss of consciousness, is a common reason for visit to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department and often leads to extensive testing and hospitalization. Using objective risk&#xD;
      scores to determine which patients with syncope will actually benefit from these&#xD;
      interventions, and which can be safely discharged home with minimal testing, is critical to&#xD;
      providing sensible medical care. This study will evaluate the validity of two syncope&#xD;
      risk-stratification tools and investigate their impact on healthcare utilization and patient&#xD;
      safety, thus improving the quality of care for the 1-2 million patients who experience&#xD;
      syncope every year in the United States&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to improve risk-stratification for patients who present to the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) with syncope (transient loss of consciousness), in order to better&#xD;
      delineate which patients require admission and which can be safely discharged home. Syncope&#xD;
      and pre-syncope (the sensation of impending loss of consciousness) are common reasons to&#xD;
      present to the ED, representing over 1.3 million visits per year in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although syncope is most often benign, it can occasionally be caused by serious&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary diseases such as cardiac arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, or pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism. Despite thorough evaluation in the ED, the cause of syncope remains unknown in over&#xD;
      50% of cases, which leads to a large number of syncope patients being admitted for&#xD;
      observation and/or further testing. These admissions to the hospital or observation unit are&#xD;
      low-yield, costly, and expose patients to the possibility of iatrogenic harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to this, two groups of researchers have developed distinct syncope&#xD;
      risk-stratification tools: the US Syncope Risk Score (FAINT) and the Canadian Syncope Risk&#xD;
      Score. These scores use a combination of clinical, electrocardiographic, and laboratory&#xD;
      variables to predict the risk of serious clinical outcomes at 30 days. While promising, these&#xD;
      two risk scores require external validation prior to widespread clinical implementation. The&#xD;
      study team will prospectively collect data on ~1,270 ED patients with syncope/pre-syncope and&#xD;
      follow them for 30 days to validate the predictive accuracy of these two risk scores. The&#xD;
      study team will then assess the impact of implementing these scores by measuring their&#xD;
      potential effect on healthcare utilization and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If validated and shown to safely reduce healthcare utilization, these syncope risk scores&#xD;
      could play a major role in improving emergency syncope care by reducing low-yield admissions&#xD;
      and identifying patients who are unsafe for discharge from the ED. This study, entitled&#xD;
      PACES: Practical Approaches to Care in Emergency Syncope, will help increase the quality and&#xD;
      value of emergency care, and advance the field of syncope research.&#xD;
