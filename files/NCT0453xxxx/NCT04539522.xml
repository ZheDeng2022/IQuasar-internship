  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is one of the most prevalent spinal deformity that may progress&#xD;
      sharply during growth. It is recommended that the physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific&#xD;
      exercises should be the first step to treat idiopathic scoliosis to prevent/limit progression&#xD;
      of the deformity. Three-dimensionally corrective exercise for scoliosis is based the theory&#xD;
      of physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises, which focuses on 3-dimension&#xD;
      self-correction and consists of two parts:1)outpatient treatment including stretching,&#xD;
      three-dimensional self-correction, balance and stability training, combined with manual&#xD;
      fascia relaxation therapy, and and breathing training; 2)family rehabilitation: combines&#xD;
      self-correcting gymnastics with daily posture management, etc., forming the individual&#xD;
      exercise approach for each patient. Nevertheless, the evidence concerning three-dimensionally&#xD;
      corrective exercise for scoliosis is inadequate. Therefore, the objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of three-dimensionally corrective exercise intervention on the change of&#xD;
      Cobb angle, trunk rotation, sagittal profile, lung function, exercise endurance and health&#xD;
      related quality-of-life, compared to conventional exercise therapy for patients with mild and&#xD;
      moderate AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from each patient and one of their parents prior to&#xD;
      inclusion. Eligible subjects will be divided into two groups(experimental group or control&#xD;
      group) according to their wishes. Subjects in experimental group will perform&#xD;
      three-dimensionally corrective exercise for scoliosis (moderate patients combined with a&#xD;
      brace) and those in the control group will receive conventional exercise therapy (moderate&#xD;
      patients combined with a brace).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded assessments at baseline and immediately post 12-month intervention will include&#xD;
      radiographic measurement, trunk rotation, sagittal profile, lung function, exercise endurance&#xD;
      and health related quality-of-life.&#xD;

      Idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is one of the most prevalent spinal deformity that may progress&#xD;
      sharply during growth. According to the severity of the curve, the major treatment approaches&#xD;
      for patient with AIS include exercises, bracing and surgery, to correct, prevent or stop the&#xD;
      progression of the deformity.In North America, Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) has been&#xD;
      published the standard of care for AIS: patients with curves between 10 and 25Â° should be&#xD;
      observation who are still growing. While in the Europe, the International Scientific Society&#xD;
      on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) has recommended that the&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises should be the first step to treat idiopathic&#xD;
      scoliosis to prevent/limit progression of the deformity. Three-dimensionally corrective&#xD;
      exercise for scoliosis is based the theory of physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises,&#xD;
      which focuses on 3-dimension self-correction and consists of two parts:1)outpatient treatment&#xD;
      including stretching, three-dimensional self-correction, balance and stability training,&#xD;
      combined with manual fascia relaxation therapy, and and breathing training; 2)family&#xD;
      rehabilitation: combines self-correcting gymnastics with daily posture management, etc.,&#xD;
      forming the individual exercise approach for each patient. Nevertheless, the evidence&#xD;
      concerning three-dimensionally corrective exercise for scoliosis is inadequate. Therefore,&#xD;
      the objective of this study is to determine the effect of three-dimensionally corrective&#xD;
      exercise intervention on the change of Cobb angle, trunk rotation, sagittal profile, lung&#xD;
      function, exercise endurance and health related quality-of-life, compared to conventional&#xD;
      exercise therapy for patients with mild and moderate AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a single-center prospective non-randomised controlled trial conducted at&#xD;
      the department of rehabilitation medicine, Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong&#xD;
      University School of Medicine. The demographic data (height, weight), menarche status for the&#xD;
      girls, family history, will be recorded by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from each patient and one of their parents prior to&#xD;
      inclusion. Eligible subjects will be assigned by a 1:1 allocation ratio either to the&#xD;
      experimental group, in which they will perform three-dimensionally integrated exercise for&#xD;
      scoliosis, or the control group, in which they will receive the standard of care with&#xD;
      observation according to the Scoliosis Research Society criteria. Blinded assessments at&#xD;
      baseline and immediately post 12-month intervention will include radiographic measurement,&#xD;
      trunk rotation, sagittal profile, lung function, exercise endurance and health related&#xD;
      quality-of-life.&#xD;
