    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the side effects and determines the best dose of an immune&#xD;
      cell therapy called GD2CART, as well as how well it works in treating patients with&#xD;
      osteosarcoma or neuroblastoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. The T&#xD;
      cells given in this trial will come from the patient and will have a new gene put in them&#xD;
      that makes them able to recognize GD2, a protein on the surface of tumor cells. These&#xD;
      GD2-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill GD2 positive tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility of producing T cells modified to express a GD2-specific chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (GD2-CAR-expressing autologous T-lymphocytes [GD2CART]) meeting established&#xD;
      release criteria using a dasatinib containing culture platform and retroviral vector in the&#xD;
      Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy system II. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) via administration of escalating doses of autologous&#xD;
      GD2CART in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma&#xD;
      following cyclophosphamide-fludarabine based lymphodepletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine clinical activity in a preliminary fashion of autologous GD2CART in children&#xD;
      and young adults with relapsed, refractory osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure persistence of adoptively transferred GD2CART and correlate this with antitumor&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably, or likely related to GD2CART,&#xD;
      assess the capacity for rimiducid (AP1903), a dimerizing agent, to mediate clearance of the&#xD;
      genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe the feasibility and tolerability of a second infusion of GD2CART in select&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare persistence of GD2CART administered in this trial to that observed in a previous&#xD;
      trial using GD2.OX40.28.z.iCasp9 CAR T cells (NCI 14-C-0059) and assess features of the T&#xD;
      cell product and the expanded T cells in vivo that correlate with persistence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Conduct exploratory studies measuring levels of circulating myeloid cells including&#xD;
      myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in patients treated on this trial and compare levels&#xD;
      to those observed in NCI 14-C-0059.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore GD2 expression in patients with neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma, including&#xD;
      patients who have previously received anti-GD2 antibodies, from tissue and/or bone marrow&#xD;
      samples at study entry and if available, after cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of GD2CART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) daily&#xD;
      on days -5 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -4 to -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GD2CART: Patients receive GD2CART cells IV on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up three times weekly until day&#xD;
      14, twice weekly until day 28, at months 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12, every 3 months until the end of&#xD;
      the second year, then annually for up to 10 years.&#xD;

             the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L) =&lt; 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) for age. Patients&#xD;
             with Gilbert's syndrome are excluded from the requirement of a normal bilirubin and&#xD;
             patients will not be excluded if bilirubin elevation is due to tumor involvement.&#xD;
             (Gilbert's syndrome is found in 3-10% of the general population, and is characterized&#xD;
             by mild, chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver disease or&#xD;
             overt hemolysis). Note: Adult values will be used for calculating hepatic toxicity and&#xD;
             determining eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age, maximum serum creatinine (mg/dL):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1 month to &lt; 6 months: 0.2 (male), 0.4 (female)&#xD;

                  institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac ejection fraction &gt;= 45% or shortening fraction &gt;= 28%, no evidence of&#xD;
             physiologically significant pericardial effusion as determined by an echocardiogram&#xD;
             (ECHO). No clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) findings&#xD;

          -  Pulmonary status: No clinically significant pleural effusion. Baseline oxygen&#xD;
             saturation &gt; 92% on room air at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurologic status: Baseline neurotoxicity equal to grade 1 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
             The effects of autologous GD2CART on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because the chemotherapy agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in&#xD;
             this trial are known to be teratogenic, females of child-bearing potential and males&#xD;
             of reproductive potential who are sexually active must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of&#xD;
             chemotherapy preparative administration or until chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is no&#xD;
             longer detectable, whichever is later. Should a female become pregnant or suspect she&#xD;
             is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are past the&#xD;
                  onset of menarche and are not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral salpingectomy,&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy, complete hysterectomy) or post menopausal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients &gt;= 18 years of age must be able to give informed consent or if unable to&#xD;
             give consent have a legal authorized representative (LAR) who can give consent for the&#xD;
             patient. For patients &lt; 18 years old their LAR (i.e., parent or legal guardian) must&#xD;
             give informed consent. Pediatric patients will be included in age appropriate&#xD;
             discussion and verbal assent will be obtained for those &gt; 7 years of age, when&#xD;
             appropriate, according to local policy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any other current investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of anaphylactic reactions attributed to anti-GD2 antibodies or to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to GD2CART, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or&#xD;
             other agents used in this study. History of hypersensitivity to dornase alfa, Chinese&#xD;
             hamster ovary cell products, or any of the components of pulmozyme&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. (A&#xD;
             one-week washout from systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy is&#xD;
             permitted.) Use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 3 mg/m^2/day prednisone&#xD;
             equivalent) are permitted. Use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intra-nasal, or&#xD;
             inhaled corticosteroids are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of additional malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ (e.g., cervix, bladder, breast) unless untreated and stable or disease free for&#xD;
             at least 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Patients with previous CNS tumor&#xD;
             involvement that has been treated and is stable for at least 6 weeks following&#xD;
             completion of therapy are permitted. Patients who are clinically stable as evidenced&#xD;
             by no requirements for corticosteroids, no evolving neurologic deficits, and no&#xD;
             progression of residual brain abnormalities without specific therapy, are permitted.&#xD;
             Patients with asymptomatic subcentemeric CNS lesions are permitted if no immediate&#xD;
             radiation or surgery is indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNS disorder such as cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar&#xD;
             disease, or autoimmune disease with CNS involvement that in the judgement of the&#xD;
             investigator may impair the ability to evaluate neurotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is uncontrolled. Urinary&#xD;
             tract infection (UTI), uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis, cellulitis, or pneumonia&#xD;
             is permitted if responding to active treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen [HBsAg] positive), or hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV positive) as the&#xD;
             immunosuppression contained in this study will pose unacceptable risk. A history of&#xD;
             HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C is permitted if the viral load is undetectable per&#xD;
             quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or nucleic acid testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary immunodeficiency or history of systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., Crohns,&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus) requiring systemic immunosuppression/systemic&#xD;
             disease modifying agents within the last 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant females are excluded from this study because the effects of autologous&#xD;
             GD2CART on the developing human fetus are unknown and because the chemotherapy agents&#xD;
             used in this trial (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) are category D agents with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Additionally, because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with cyclophosphamide/fludarabine, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with cyclophosphamide/fludarabine. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known GD2 negative tumors by validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) will&#xD;
             be excluded from enrollment given the change in risk profile&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's judgment, unlikely to complete protocol-required study visits or&#xD;
             procedures, including follow-up visits, or comply with the study requirements for&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
