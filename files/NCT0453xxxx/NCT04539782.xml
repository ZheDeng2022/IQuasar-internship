  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
      investigates the effects of pelvic floor training on recurrence in pelvic organ prolapse&#xD;
      surgeries. This will be achieved by measuring POP-Q stage and by a validated questionnaire&#xD;
      before surgery and one year after. Women having POP surgery at Landspitali will be offered to&#xD;
      participate if they meet the criteria of the research. Participants will be randomized into&#xD;
      two groups, interventions and control group that gets standard care at the hospital. The&#xD;
      intervention group will meet a physiotherapist 6 weeks post-op for targeted physiotherapy&#xD;
      with pelvic floor training, conventional advice and support. Over 16 weeks period&#xD;
      participants in intervention group will get physiotherapy four times and get two follow up&#xD;
      phone calls. Pelvic floor activity will be measured with EMG and symptoms collected with&#xD;
      questionnaire before surgery and year post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent surgeries are common problem shortly after the first one. POP symtoms can be&#xD;
      bothersome for women and reduce their quality of life. More knowledge is needed to figure out&#xD;
      if targeted physiotherapy with pelvic floor training can help reduce recurrency and&#xD;
      bothersome symptoms.&#xD;

      A feasibility study to assess the practicality of physiotherapy treatment after pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse (POP) surgery and the effect on recurrent POP symptoms, pelvic floor activity and&#xD;
      general physical fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem among women and many do need surgery. Little is&#xD;
      known about recurrence of POP surgeries. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) has positive&#xD;
      effects on POP symptoms and quality of life. Research shows PFMT can reduce stage of the&#xD;
      prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery POP-Q stage will be measured by urogynocologist. Pelvic floor muscle activity&#xD;
      will be measured with EMG vaginal probes. General physical fitness will be tested with 30s&#xD;
      chair-stand and core strenght with prone bride test. An Icelandic version of The Australian&#xD;
      Female PelvicFloor questionnaire will be used to assess symptoms and affect on quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two groups, intervention and control group. The control&#xD;
      group gets standard care at the hospital. The interventional group gets physiotherapy with&#xD;
      PFMT, conventional advise and support. During 16 weeks intervention participants get four&#xD;
      sessions with specialized physiotherapist and two follow up phone calls. Follow up measures&#xD;
      will be made at 12 months.&#xD;
