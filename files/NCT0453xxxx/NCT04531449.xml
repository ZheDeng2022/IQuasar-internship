  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether the Inflammacheck™ device is easy to use by healthcare&#xD;
      professionals who would be using it in a clinic setting or in primary care. The data&#xD;
      collected during this study will be used as part of the evidence needed to get the CE&#xD;
      (Conformité Européenne) marking for the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CE marking is a certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and&#xD;
      environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA).&#xD;
      CE marking is essential for any medical devices used in the UK or the EU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study has been designed to evaluate the ability of healthcare providers to&#xD;
      use the Inflammacheck™, an investigational medical device, to measure participants exhaled&#xD;
      breath condensate (EBC) H2O2. The data will be used to support the CE marking of the&#xD;
      Inflammacheck™ device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A measure of the participants' EBC H2O2 will be measured on the Inflammacheck™ device to&#xD;
      demonstrate usability and comprehension of the instructions for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no control measurements involved in the study, all of the participants' EBC H2O2&#xD;
      measurements will be performed using Inflammacheck™ only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only healthcare providers naïve to the Inflammacheck™ device will be eligible to take part in&#xD;
      the assessment of usability. This is to ensure that the usability assessment will not be&#xD;
      biased by prior knowledge of the device or its instructions. The only training provided will&#xD;
      be an introductory presentation explaining the Clinical Investigation objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time for participant involvement is one session comprising of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information &amp; consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EBC H2O2 measurement with Inflammacheck™&#xD;
