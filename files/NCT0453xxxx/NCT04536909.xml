  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degeneration, iatrogenic-/idiopathic causes and fractures can lead to kypho- scoliotic&#xD;
      deformities potentially resulting in pain and loss of function. The surgical strategies rely&#xD;
      on surgeon preferences and type of deformity as well as clinical symptoms. The complication&#xD;
      rate of surgical treatment is high. The aim of this study is to elucidate the indications for&#xD;
      surgical treatment of kyphoscoliosis and evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and&#xD;
      non-surgical outcome clinically and radiologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for the PROMs and x-ray is at 12 months, but the investigators will also&#xD;
      follow the patients with the PROMs and x-rays after 2,5 and 10 years.&#xD;

      Detailed description 1 Indications and Treatment of Adult Kypho- Scoliosis (INTRAKS Study) 2.&#xD;
      Background:New surgical techniques for osteotomies and promising equipment has led to a&#xD;
      renaissance with broader indications, evoking the need for well-founded studies and quality&#xD;
      registration of the adult kyphoscoliosis treatment to evaluate the risk of major&#xD;
      complication, the benefit for the patients and socioeconomic burden. Prior randomized studies&#xD;
      have had high crossover rates to surgical treatment, questioning the result of the studies.&#xD;
      As a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be difficult, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      propensity match two cohorts and then compare the correctional surgery and non- surgical&#xD;
      treatment at a 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Needs description:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify predictors for unsatisfactory outcome in adult kyphoscoliosis. This study aims&#xD;
           to create a predictive model for unsatisfactory outcome after deformity surgery in adult&#xD;
           kyphoscoliosis. A prospective multicenter observational effectiveness study is&#xD;
           constructed to detect a &lt; 30% improvement from baseline in Oswestry Disability Index&#xD;
           (ODI) score at 12 months follow up. The predictive model can be a helpful tool in&#xD;
           accessing the complexity of this patients and aid in shard decision making and improved&#xD;
           surgical planning. Patients are grouped in: 1) unsatisfactory result (UR) &lt; 30% increase&#xD;
           from baseline ODI score, 2) satisfactory result (SR) ≥ 30% increase from baseline ODI&#xD;
           score. A predictive model will be calculated for both kyphosis and scoliosis together&#xD;
           and separately. The same criteria for inclusion are set in the non-surgical group as&#xD;
           well as all the data collected, a predictive model will be created if the difference in&#xD;
           outcome is significant. The investigators will also look at the patients with a &gt; 10%&#xD;
           worsening from baseline in ODI score at 12 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A prospective multicenter observational effectiveness study of adult kyphoscoliosis&#xD;
           treatment, surgical and non-surgical outcome with a 12 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. This part of the study will be looking at the effectiveness of surgery vs&#xD;
                non-surgical treatment using the PROMS described in the protocol. It is outcome&#xD;
                related, the planned follow up time is 12 months, but the investigators have&#xD;
                ethical approval (REK) to continue the data recording for 24 months and more for a&#xD;
                sufficient follow up time. It exceeds the time limit for the PhD candidates listed,&#xD;
                but others will continue the work. It will contain all the patients included.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The subgroups of iatrogenic/degenerative kyphosis and scoliosis will be studied&#xD;
                separately as it is known that the mainly scoliotic patients do better than the&#xD;
                kyphotic once. Around 30-40 patients will be sufficient in each surgical subgroup,&#xD;
                the same in the non-surgical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The kyphotic healed high energy fracture. One of the subgroups to be investigated is the&#xD;
           high energy fractures healed in kyphosis. High energy fractures are typical males in the&#xD;
           age of 25-50. The fractures healed in kyphosis with a regional kyphotic angle of &gt;20&#xD;
           degrees and a positive sagittal vertical axis of &gt;4 cm can be included (the rest of the&#xD;
           inclusion or exclusion criteria listed will be followed as for the whole study). As this&#xD;
           is a subgroup, around 30-40 surgical patients will be sufficient. The investigators hope&#xD;
           to have the same number in the non-surgical group to compare with. The main outcome&#xD;
           parameter is ODI, but the investigators will also look into the results of the EQ-5D,&#xD;
           SRS22 and the numeric rating scale (NRS). As this is a fracture resulting in a secondary&#xD;
           deformity, the PROMS listed should be addressing the patient problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. XLIF vs anterior-/transforaminal interbody fusion/pedicle subtraction osteotomy/Smith&#xD;
           Petersen/Ponte (ALIF/TLIF/PSO/SP/Ponte).&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a trend towards using XLIF and OLIF procedures for deformity cases. The&#xD;
           investigating party will look into the patients operated using the lateral approaches&#xD;
           and compare it towards the dorsal applied interventions (TLIF, PSO, Ponte/SP), if&#xD;
           possible also ALIF patients. It should be at least 30-40 patients undergoing the lateral&#xD;
           intervention to be able to make a comparison that could be statistical significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Socioeconomic study; surgery vs non-surgical for adult kyphoscoliosis. The correctional&#xD;
           surgery is often of long duration with expensive implants and highly complicated with&#xD;
           high risk of complications. It is costly and the investigators intend to evaluate the&#xD;
           socioeconomic burden. The duration of surgery, cost of implants and duration of hospital&#xD;
           stay will be registered, the readmission due to complications will be registered for the&#xD;
           first 12 months. As EQ-5D is used as a PROM in this study, it will be used for the&#xD;
           socioeconomic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Identify differences in indication, examination and treatment between a European and&#xD;
           Asian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is an international multicenter study in cooperation with the Kyoto University&#xD;
           Hospital in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators have already detected some vital differences in the surgical approach&#xD;
           for the patient group and further comparison will be of interest. The patients,&#xD;
           indications, examination as well as the non-surgical and surgical treatment will be&#xD;
           examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Changes in urination and sexual function in a surgical and non- surgical cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Few studies address this issue, for spine patients it is of great importance and highly&#xD;
           underreported. There are few suitable PROMS, so the investigators will use a PROM from a&#xD;
           prior study. It is slightly different for men and women due to the differences in sex&#xD;
           and it has no scoring system. It has not been validated, so the outcome will be slightly&#xD;
           unsatisfactory, the positive sides convinced us to take use of the non-validated form.&#xD;
           The investigators have had it translated into Japanese and Swedish and are interested in&#xD;
           the Japanese contribution in regard of their cultural differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality control of the Norwegian Quality Register for Spinal Surgery. The investigators&#xD;
           will be conducting x-ray measurements (sagittal vertical axis and pelvic parameters,&#xD;
           lumbar lordosis) and compare it with the values that the surgeons have entered into the&#xD;
           Norwegian quality register for spinal surgery. The measurements will be conducted by an&#xD;
           independent radiologist at Haukeland or Oslo University Hospital in Norway and by the&#xD;
           PhD student in Norway. It will be an inter-and intra-observer study. The values&#xD;
           mentioned above have been used for the last year in the register and a quality control&#xD;
           would be of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Spinal stiffness after spinal fusion using the Lumbar spine disability index (LSDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lumbar spine disability index (LSDI) is developed by our Japanese colleges at the Kyoto&#xD;
      University Hospital and they are motivated to test it on the deformity patient. It is the&#xD;
      second (2/2) non validated PROMS in this study and have been translated from Japanese to&#xD;
      Norwegian and Swedish. It has been published in peer review papers by our Japanese colleges.&#xD;
      Most likely it will be of most interest to our Japanese colleges and they will go forward&#xD;
      with the publishing of the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Project methodology 4.1 Project design, method selection and analyses Patients to be&#xD;
      operated for the correction of spinal deformity during the following two-tree years at Oslo&#xD;
      University Hospital Ullevål in Norway, Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen Norway, Malmö&#xD;
      University Hospital in Sweden, Örebro University Hospital in Sweden and Kyoto University&#xD;
      Hospital in Japan. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be difficult, so the&#xD;
      investigators plan to propensity match the two cohorts and compare correctional surgery and&#xD;
      non- surgical treatment at 1 year follow-up. During the 1 year follow-up period the&#xD;
      non-surgical patients will attend an intensive and structured physio-logical training&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient inclusion will follow at the polyclinic by the surgeon; the patient will be&#xD;
      presented to the &quot;Intraks.org&quot; homepage for the study. An information leaflet will be handed&#xD;
      out and the patient will be given time to decide. If the patient is eligible to the study and&#xD;
      agrees to join, a study number will be created using google Sheet, then the patient will be&#xD;
      introduced to the informed consent form, paper form in Sweden and Japan, in Norway it can be&#xD;
      signed using &quot;Nettskjema&quot; an &quot;Bank ID&quot;. Nettskjema is an internet form used to create&#xD;
      questionnaire, it is secure, but not secure enough for sensitive patient data, so the data&#xD;
      from the forms will be imported directly to &quot;service for sensitive data&quot; (TSD). TSD is a&#xD;
      service from Oslo University, secure for all sensitive data and in use for several&#xD;
      prospective studies. In the homepage, the patients will, in addition to the informed consent,&#xD;
      find the patient reported outcome measures (PROMS). The home page can be found using&#xD;
      smartphone, tablet or computer and all forms can be filled out using the homepage. 12 months&#xD;
      after surgery or inclusion to non-surgical treatment, the patient need to fill out the forms&#xD;
      again. For the non-surgical treatment the homepage (Intraks.org) contains specific text,&#xD;
      illustrations and videos with training instruction for the non-surgical treatment, developed&#xD;
      with dedicated physiotherapists from Oslo University Hospital. The training-program consists&#xD;
      of 3 levels of muscle core training and stretching to be exercised 1-3 times a week for 12&#xD;
      months. They will have a training diary to follow up the compliance that will be controlled&#xD;
      at the 3 months follow up. The exercises are available at intraks.org as illustration, text&#xD;
      and video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      See the protocol for detailed data collection. 4.2 Project management See protocol. 4.3 Plan&#xD;
      for implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      See protocol, in addition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;intraks.org&quot; homepage will be updating the public on published articles and other&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Statistical analysis Altogether 75-100 patients are expected eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
      the surgical group of WP2 annually. For the non-surgical treatment, approximately the same&#xD;
      number will be needed. By using alfa=5% and power=80% to detect 30% ODI improvement from&#xD;
      baseline and 30% improvement in proportion of patients that improved and calculating for 10%&#xD;
      crossover, 10% mismatch in the propensity score matching and sufficient power for the&#xD;
      subgroup analyzes, the study will need a total of 300 patients. Considering drop outs, the&#xD;
      study would have enough patients after 2-3 years of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictive analysis: Frequency analyses for categorical variables will be conducted via&#xD;
      Pearson's c2 analysis. All analysis will be conducted using commercially available software&#xD;
      (SPSS version 24, IBM Inc.) and the level of significance is set to p&lt;0.05 in a two-sided&#xD;
      test. For the predictive model, missing values within the database will be imputed using&#xD;
      standard techniques such as mean and median imputation. Once a complete data set is&#xD;
      constructed, an ensemble of decision trees will be constructed with a binary target variable&#xD;
      that includes patients with: 1) unsatisfactory result (UR) &lt; 30% increase from baseline ODI&#xD;
      score (code = 0), 2) satisfactory result (SR) ≥ 30% increase from baseline ODI score (code =&#xD;
      1). The decision-tree algorithm is C5.0 and 5 different bootstrapped models will be built.&#xD;
      Internal validation is accomplished via a 70/30 data split for training and testing the&#xD;
      model, respectively. Final overall predictions from the models will be combined and chosen by&#xD;
      voting with random selection for tied votes. Overall accuracy and the area under the receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic (AUROC) curve will be calculated as well as predictor importance as&#xD;
      determined by the model. The model will be built using commercially available software (SPSS&#xD;
      Modeler version 24, IBM Inc.). A sensitivity analysis will be performed 1-2 years into the&#xD;
      study period, the MCID/&quot;satisfactory result&quot; and power will be adjusted accordingly&#xD;
