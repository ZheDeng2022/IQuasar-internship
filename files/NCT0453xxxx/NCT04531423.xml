  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation that is mediated by microglia activation plays an important role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of depression. Microglia activation can lead to an increase in the levels of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, which leads to neuronal apoptosis in the specific&#xD;
      neural circuits of some brain regions, abnormal cognition, and treatment-resistant depression&#xD;
      (TRD). Protein kinase C (PKC) is a key regulator of the microglia activation process. The&#xD;
      investigators assume that the abnormality in PKC might be the serum biomarkers of depression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PKC activation might reduce M1 microglia activation and the release of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines such as TNF-α, finally alleviating depressive symptoms in TRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: This study was designed to address the role of PKC-mediated microglial&#xD;
      activation in the clinical outcome of first episode depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To illustrate the impact of PKC-mediated microglial activation on&#xD;
      impaired cognition, social function and neuronal plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators adopted randomized design to test placebo-controlled antidepressant&#xD;
      augmentation. Patients were randomized (1:1) into one of the following 2groups: &quot;SSRI&#xD;
      +golimumab&quot;,&quot; or &quot;SSRI +placebo&quot;. The total study duration is 12 weeks&#xD;
