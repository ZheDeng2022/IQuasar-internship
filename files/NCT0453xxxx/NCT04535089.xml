    <textblock>
      Perioperative pain control is necessary in children as inadequate treatment may lead to&#xD;
      progression of perception of pain and development of chronic pain in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetists tend to adopt approach to perioperative control of pain by non-opioid drugs that&#xD;
      mediate pain modulation. Its use as opioid sparing analgesia in different surgeries leading&#xD;
      to mixed results.&#xD;

      Site of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in neurosurgical operating rooms of Zagazig University&#xD;
      Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Sample size: A pilot study was done to estimate percent of children need intraoperative&#xD;
      fentanyl was (10%) for dexmedetomidine group, and ( 40%) for lidocaine group, at 0.05 α error&#xD;
      and 0.2 β error . Sample size was calculated using Open Epi software, is 32 children in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

    <time_frame>immediately on arrival to PACU, and at 5, 10, 15 minutes till the child will be discharge from PACU postoperative.</time_frame>
    <description>In the Post Anesthesia Care Unite( PACU), the intensity of pain will be assessed using The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPS) . The scale shows a series of faces ranging from a happy face at 0, or &quot;no hurt&quot;, to a crying face at 10, which represents &quot;hurts like the worst pain imaginable&quot;. The child is instructed to choose the face that best describes their intensity of pain currently being experienced immediately on arrival to PACU, and at 5, 10, 15 mintues till the child will be discharge from PACU. The child will be ready for discharge from PACU when attained an Aldrete score ≥9 and free from pain, nausea and vomiting. Protocol for pain management, IV paracetamol 15mg/kg every 6h. maximum daily dose 60mg/kg not exceeding 2grams.&#xD;
Child with WBFPS score &gt; 4 will be treated with nalbuphine 0.1mg/kg as rescue analgesic</description>

    <description>Assessment of level of sedation by 6-point Pediatric Sedation State Scale (PSSS) in the PACU :The six activity states are as follows:&#xD;
State 5: Movement impedes procedure and requires forceful immobilization State 4: Movement requires gentle immobilization for positioning State 3: Facial expression of pain or anxiety State 2: Quiet, not moving, no frown, no verbalization of complaint (ideal state) State 1: Deeply asleep with normal vital signs, but requires airway intervention or assistance (e.g., central or obstructive apnea) State 0: Deeply asleep with abnormal physiologic parameters that require acute intervention (e.g., O2 saturation &lt;90%, hypotension, bradycardia).</description>
