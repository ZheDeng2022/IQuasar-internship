  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      use of platelet rich plasma (PRP) treatment in female breast cancer survivors with&#xD;
      genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is a term that encompasses a collection of symptoms&#xD;
      and signs associated with a decrease in estrogen and other sex steroids involving changes to&#xD;
      the labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibule/introitus, vagina, urethra and bladder. The&#xD;
      syndrome may include but is not limited to genital symptoms of dryness, burning, and&#xD;
      irritation; sexual symptoms of lack of lubrication, discomfort or pain, and impaired&#xD;
      function; and urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria and recurrent urinary tract infections.The&#xD;
      primary goal of treatment of GSM is symptom relief which may include non-hormonal and&#xD;
      hormonal treatments. GSM is a challenging issue for breast cancer survivors on aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors due to symptomatic treatments that usually include estrogen which is&#xD;
      contraindicated after treatment for breast cancer. GSM symptoms typically do not resolve&#xD;
      without treatment and may worsen with time. PRP has been studied as a treatment option for&#xD;
      various gynecological disorders and wound healing after cesarean sections and gynecological&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
