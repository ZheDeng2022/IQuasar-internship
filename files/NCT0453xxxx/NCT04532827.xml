      Persistent physical symptoms (PPS) might diminish studying or work ability and daily&#xD;
      functioning without clear medical or environment-related explanation. Psychosocial,&#xD;
      patient-involving treatments that support individuals' abilities managing with the PPS and&#xD;
      health behaviors have shown promising effects in treating PPS but the acceptability of these&#xD;
      treatments among symptomatic individuals is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an Ehealth intervention based on&#xD;
      relational frame theory and acceptance and commitment therapy on PPS with two focus groups,&#xD;
      among participants with indoor air associated disabling symptoms or persistent, chronic&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare web program enhanced with video-based individual case formulation&#xD;
      with treatment as usual. The web program includes 6 two weeks modules. In addition to patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes, ecological momentary assessments are conducted to provide real time data&#xD;
      on functioning and national registers are used to obtain information of health-care use and&#xD;
      social benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection begins in August 2020 and will continue until 2022.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Frequent physical symptoms are common in general population with over 90 percent&#xD;
      of population reporting symptoms at some level. In some cases they become persistent&#xD;
      diminishing work ability and daily functioning and associate with increased healthcare usage&#xD;
      and sick leaves independently of other somatic or psychiatric comorbidity. Persistent&#xD;
      physical symptoms (PPS) challenge health care systems as it is estimated that up to 4-30&#xD;
      percent of primary health care visit are due to PPS without clear medical explanation.&#xD;
      Psychosocial, patient-involving treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT),&#xD;
      that support individuals' abilities managing with the PPS and health behaviors have shown&#xD;
      promising effects in treating PPS but so far, evidence-based treatments have resulted only in&#xD;
      small to moderate effect sizes. The acceptability of these treatments among symptomatic&#xD;
      individuals is also low - presumably because of the stigma related to the ambiguity of the&#xD;
      PPSÂ´ status as a medical condition. A stronger orientation to personalized treatment&#xD;
      protocols are needed to improve the treatment efficacy and applicability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the effects of an Ehealth intervention based on relational frame&#xD;
      theory and acceptance and commitment therapy on PPS with two focus groups, among participants&#xD;
      with indoor air associated disabling symptoms or persistent, chronic fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Using a randomized controlled design (RCT) with two parallel groups in 1:1 ratio,&#xD;
      the investigators will compare ACT/RFT-based web program enhanced with individual case&#xD;
      formulation with treatment as usual. The web program intervention includes 6 modules that&#xD;
      each ask to complete the module and included training in two weeks. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete outcome questionnaires at baseline before the interview for inclusion,&#xD;
      after the interview (randomization) and at 3, 6- and 12-months' follow-up after the&#xD;
      randomization. The intervention group receives also a questionnaire four weeks after the&#xD;
      beginning of the web program. In addition, ecological momentary assessments are also&#xD;
      conducted to provide real time data on functioning and national registers are used to obtain&#xD;
      information of health-care use and social benefits to complete patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to either the intervention or to TAU. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be health related quality of life. The secondary outcome measures are symptoms,&#xD;
      illness perceptions, psychological flexibility and work ability. Further, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess whether any effect of intervention on the primary outcome is mediated by the case&#xD;
      formulation. Data collection begins in August 2020 and will continue until 2022.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The randomization will be pre-programmed and the allocation sequence will be carried out and concealed by a researcher who is not otherwise involved in trial at FIOH. This study compares eHealth intervention with treatment as usual. Thus it is not possible to blind the study participants. However, eHealth therapists are blinded for study participant compared with patients in eHealth intervention for other reasons, I.e. study participants and patients referred to the program as treatment as usual by their physician. Further, data analyst will be blinded to intervention arms.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Chance from baseline (i.e. at self-referral) to after randomisation (i.e. after clinical assessment), and to 6 and 14 weeks and to 6 and to 12 months after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The 15D is a utility-based generic, standardized measure, comprising the following 15 dimensions that describe physical, mental, and social well-being: mobility, vision, hearing, breathing, sleeping, eating, speech, excretion, usual activities, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress, vitality, and sexual activity. Each dimension is graded by the respondent on a scale ranging between 1 and 5, where 1 indicates an experience of no problems at all with the dimension and 5 indicates severe problems. Thus, the 15D can be used to measure a vast number of health states. We will use the 15D data both to derive 15D overall scores with values from 1 (full health) to 0 (being dead), and to obtain dimensional symptom profiles.</description>

    <description>The intervention will start with two video meetings with a psychologist to build up and present an individual case formulation, based on behavioral analysis, and to build up a shared decision of individual goals for the web program. The intervention continues with web program consisting of six manualized web-based modules, each at two-week intervals based on relational frame theory (RFT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).&#xD;
Both participants in the intervention arm and in the treatment as usual arm will receive usual care, meaning that TAU will be enhanced with the study intervention in the intervention arm.

    <description>The first meeting includes an interview to establish understanding on the participantÂ´s symptomatology and current life situation, a case formulation (CF) will be build based on it. The CF is presented in the second session and modifications can be made to ensure acceptability for the participant. Goals for web program (WB) are set based on the CF and understanding of the factors contributing to the participantÂ´s wellbeing.&#xD;
WB modules are instructed to complete during the first week and to continue to integrate the content into daily life during the second week. Modules include psychoeducation, experiential exercises and training aimed at improving wellbeing and psychological flexibility. Web-therapist will offer written feedback. The participants can contact the therapist via the WB and al messages will be replied within one week. Automatic reminders will be sent if a participant has not been active in the WB, the therapists will call participants who have discontinued using the WB.</description>
