      The aim of the study was to assess the diet and the effect of probiotic therapy on reducing&#xD;
      the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders and selected parameters determining the&#xD;
      inflammation of the body, body composition, cardiopulmonary efficiency and selected serum&#xD;
      biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 competitors took part in the study. The research was carried out at the Department of&#xD;
      Dietetics and Clinical Nutrition (Medical University of Bialystok), Fitness Club Maniac Gym&#xD;
      in Bialystok, as well as at the Hematological Diagnostics Department and the Biochemical&#xD;
      Diagnostics Department of the University Teaching Hospital in Bialystok.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was randomized using a double-blind trial. 35 persons selected in the draw were G1&#xD;
      group and the remaining G2 group (n=35). The intervention factor was the SANPROBI BARRIER&#xD;
      multi-strain probiotic or placebo. Competitors used probiotic/ placebo for three months at a&#xD;
      dose of 2x2 capsules daily (2.5 x 10 9 CFU / g (1 capsule)). The consent of the Bioethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Medical University, no. RI-002/81/2017, was obtained for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of two stages (W1 and W2), and each stage was associated with three&#xD;
      visits by the participants. The first of these (W1) included qualification for the study,&#xD;
      completing the questionnaire and 3-day nutrition diaries. At the second visit, body&#xD;
      composition analysis and cardiopulmonary efficiency test on a medical treadmill were&#xD;
      performed. For morphological tests (blood count with smear, lipid profile, fasting glucose,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein and ionogram) at the third visit for each competitor was collected blood&#xD;
      from the vein in the amount of 10 ml. The final stage (W2) included similar three visits,&#xD;
      where the first visit was made after 3 months of taking product A or B. 66 competitors took&#xD;
      part in it.&#xD;

      The aim of the study was to assess the diet and the effect of probiotic therapy on reducing&#xD;
      the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders and selected parameters determining the&#xD;
      inflammation of the body, body composition, cardiopulmonary efficiency and selected serum&#xD;
      biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approved of the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University, no. RI-002/81/2017, was&#xD;
      obtained for the study. 70 people meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the&#xD;
      intervention and observational study. The research was carried out at the Department of&#xD;
      Dietetics and Clinical Nutrition at the Faculty of Health Sciences of the Medical University&#xD;
      of Bialystok, Fitness Club Maniac Gym in Bialystok, as well as at the Hematological&#xD;
      Diagnostics Department and the Biochemical Diagnostics Department of the University Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital in Bialystok.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study took place in the spring (March-June 2018) and autumn (September-December 2018),&#xD;
      i.e. during of the most intense period in terms of participation in runners' competitions.&#xD;
      The study was randomized using a double-blind trial. 35 persons selected in the draw were G1&#xD;
      group and the remaining G2 group (n=35). The tests were completely anonymous, the competitors&#xD;
      gave their informed written consent to carry them out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional study was conducted using a probiotic or placebo. The observation period&#xD;
      lasted three months. The intervention factor was the SANPROBI BARRIER multi-strain probiotic&#xD;
      (commonly available in pharmacies) or placebo (created on the model of a probiotic capsule,&#xD;
      specially for the needs of research, by Sanprobi Sp. z o.o.). Competitors used probiotic/&#xD;
      placebo for three months at a dose of 2x2 capsules daily (2.5 x 10 9 CFU / g (1 capsule)).&#xD;
      The probiotic used in the study contained bacterial strains, i.e. Bifidobacterium lactis W52,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus brevis W63, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactococcus lactis W19, Lactococcus lactis&#xD;
      W58, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Lactobacillus salivarius&#xD;
      W24. Players and researchers were not informed about the type of capsule taken (probiotic or&#xD;
      placebo). Competitors were asked to use product A or B after blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each player had 3 visits during the preliminary stage (W1) and 3 visits of the final stage&#xD;
      (W2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary stage (W1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first visit took place in the Department of Dietetics and Clinical Nutrition at the&#xD;
           Medical University of Bialystok. It included qualification for the study based on the&#xD;
           criteria for inclusion in the study group, discussion of the purpose of the study and&#xD;
           signing the written consent for the study by the participants, as well as information&#xD;
           about the protection of their personal data and full anonymity. Each participant&#xD;
           received an individual code (e.g. A01, A02, B01, B02 etc.), which was used to identify&#xD;
           the subject in further stages. Athletes were asked not to use other probiotic strains&#xD;
           than those used in the study. All competitors completed a survey regarding demographic&#xD;
           data, information on dietary supplementation used, the incidence of gastrointestinal&#xD;
           disorders, and 3-day nutrition diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second visit took place after a week. Each player was invited to the Maniac Gym&#xD;
           Fitness Club in Bialystok. Body composition analysis was performed using an InBody 770&#xD;
           analyzer (InBody, Korea). To determine the level of cardiopulmonary efficiency using the&#xD;
           Bruce protocol test on a medical treadmill were performed. Then, competitors were issued&#xD;
           a referral for laboratory tests. During this meeting, in accordance with the simple draw&#xD;
           product A (group G1) was given to every second person, and product B (group G2) for the&#xD;
           remaining persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For morphological tests (blood count with smear, lipid profile, fasting glucose,&#xD;
           C-reactive protein and ionogram) at the third visit for each competitor was collected&#xD;
           blood from the vein in the amount of 10 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final stage (W2) The final stage consisted of three visits (similar to the preliminary&#xD;
      stage). The first visit was made after 3 months of taking product A or B by the competitors.&#xD;
      66 people took part in the final stage of the study (G1 = 34 people, G2 = 32 people). One&#xD;
      person from group G1 (product A) did not report for the final visit without providing a&#xD;
      specific reason. Three people from the G2 control group (product B) did not participate in&#xD;
      the final stage of the study (W2) due to injury (2 people) and without providing a specific&#xD;
      reason (1 person).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first visit took place at the Department of Dietetics and Clinical Nutrition&#xD;
           (Medical University of Bialystok) where competitors were completed the questionnaires to&#xD;
           determine the changes in the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second visit was conducted at the Fitness Club Maniac Gym, where the cardiopulmonary&#xD;
           fitness test and body composition analysis were carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third visit took place at the Hematological Diagnostics Department of the University&#xD;
           Teaching Hospital in Bialystok, where from each participant the blood was collected&#xD;
           (from the vein) in an amount of 10 ml for biochemical tests (as during the initial stage&#xD;
           at visit 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3-day nutrition diary: Each participant described customary meals consumed for the next&#xD;
           three days, including two working days and one day off. The food diary includes hours of&#xD;
           meals, the weight of products and dishes, and the amount of fluids consumed during the&#xD;
           day. The competitors were asked to use the standard, current diet, without any&#xD;
           significant changes. The energy value of the daily nutritional plan, the content of the&#xD;
           main nutrients, vitamins, minerals, cholesterol and dietary fiber were taken into&#xD;
           account in the evaluation of the three-day nutrition diary. Then, the percentage of&#xD;
           compliance with the norm for the energy supply of diet and nutrients was assessed by&#xD;
           comparing the results to Polish norms for healthy, adult men and women, and based on&#xD;
           scientific research on the discipline of long-distance running.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition analysis All competitors underwent body composition analysis using the&#xD;
      InBody model 770 analyzer (South Korea). The body composition analyzer, using the electrical&#xD;
      bioimpedance principle, uses low current flow using 6 frequencies and subsequent measurement&#xD;
      of the resistance of individual tissues to determine body composition. The following&#xD;
      parameters were assessed: body weight (kg), body fat content in kilograms and percent,&#xD;
      visceral fat content (cm2), skeletal muscle mass (kg), body water content (kg). Before the&#xD;
      test, the participants were informed about the need to stay fasting 8-12 hours and a minimum&#xD;
      of 24 hours after physical activity. They were asked to avoid drinking liquids 1 h before the&#xD;
      test. None of the competitors had an implanted pacemaker, which is an absolute exclusion&#xD;
      criterion in the study of body composition analysis by electrical bioimpedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of cardiopulmonary efficiency In order to determine the cardiopulmonary efficiency&#xD;
      of competitors, the Fitmate MED device (Cosmed, Italy) was used, which comprehensively&#xD;
      determined cardiopulmonary efficiency and a medical treadmill adapted to this type of&#xD;
      HpCosmos analysis (Germany). The Fitmate MED device is equipped with a sensor that enables&#xD;
      the measurement of inhaled and exhaled air as well as a mask containing disposable&#xD;
      mouthpieces and antibacterial filters. To monitor cardiac contractions, a Garmin sporttester&#xD;
      model HRM-Tri 010-10997-09 (United States) was used. In cardiopulmonary fitness tests, a&#xD;
      walking treadmill test was used according to Bruce's protocol. The exercise test included&#xD;
      effort progression to increase walking speed and incline of the treadmill. The study was&#xD;
      divided into 5 stages (3 minutes each). In the first of them, the walk took place at a speed&#xD;
      of 2.7 km/h and a 10% incline of the treadmill. In the second stage, the treadmill&#xD;
      accelerated to 4 km/h, and the incline increased to 12%. The third stage is a speed of 5.5 km&#xD;
      / h and a incline 14%. The fourth stage is the speed increase to 6.8 km / h and the treadmill&#xD;
      inclination 16%, and the last stage 5 is the speed of 8 km / h and the inclination of the&#xD;
      treadmill 18%. Participants were informed that the cardiorespiratory fitness test should take&#xD;
      place for a minimum of 2 weeks after intense physical effort (marathon, ultramarathon).&#xD;
      During the test, the maximum test procedure was used to obtain more test parameters, and the&#xD;
      test condition was considered to be 90% HRmax by the test subject, or the test could not be&#xD;
      continued by interrupting it at the test subject's request. None of the competitors tested&#xD;
      completed the test alone, they all reached the 90% HR max limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests The tests were performed after venous blood collection (from a vein in the&#xD;
      arm) in the amount of 10 ml. Twice (during the initial and final stages) the following&#xD;
      measurements were taken: complete blood count with smear, fasting glucose, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      HDL, LDL and triglycerides, sodium, iron, potassium, magnesium, serum calcium, determination&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In order to determine pro-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      blood was collected on a clot, it was subjected to centrifugation, and after clot separation,&#xD;
      the obtained serum was stored at -80 degrees Celsius (until the tests were performed). To&#xD;
      determine the concentration of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha),&#xD;
      the ELISA method (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was used, using R&amp;D System kits&#xD;
      (Bio-Techne, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
