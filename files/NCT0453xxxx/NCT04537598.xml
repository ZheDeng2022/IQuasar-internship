      Acute postoperative pain proper management is important not only for patient satisfaction but&#xD;
      also for patient outcome. In addition to its early effects, poorly controlled acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain may predispose patients to chronic post-surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open nephrectomy is still conducted, although the use of laparoscopic or robotic surgery has&#xD;
      increased recently. A flank approach with an eleventh rib partial resection, which is the&#xD;
      main method for open nephrectomy at our institution, could make for better dissection of the&#xD;
      renal pelvis and the pedicles, and provide the best circumstances for nephrectomy; however,&#xD;
      it induces more persistent pain compared with other approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several modalities have been implemented for acute postoperative pain control. Intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) opioids is one of the earliest and most widely used method, it is insufficient only for&#xD;
      managing postoperative pain in some patients with severe pain. In addition, opioids have many&#xD;
      side effects like respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting and constipation hence it is&#xD;
      important to decrease opioids use and the transition to other modalities such as regional&#xD;
      blocks, nerve blocks, NSAIDs and multimodalities.ESPB is a relatively simple technique with&#xD;
      easily identified sonographic landmarks. Additionally, the ESPB has the potential to provide&#xD;
      both somatic and visceral sensory blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The erector spinae muscle (ESM) is a complex formed by the spinalis, longissimus thoracis,&#xD;
      and iliocostalis muscles that run vertically in the back. The ESP block is performed by&#xD;
      depositing the local anesthetic (LA) in the fascial plane, deeper than the ESM at the tip of&#xD;
      the transverse process of the vertebra. Hence, LA is distributed in the cranio-caudal fascial&#xD;
      plane.Additionally, it diffuses anteriorly to the paravertebral and epidural spaces, and&#xD;
      laterally to the intercostal space at several levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different case studies about the use of erector spinae block in nephrectomy but&#xD;
      there is no randomized controlled study about it until now so it will be one of the earliest&#xD;
      studies that investigate the effect of ESPB to relief acute postoperative pain in patients&#xD;
      undergoing open nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of ESPB in acute postoperative pain and&#xD;
      opioid consumption in patients undergoing open nephrectomy in renal cancer patients.&#xD;
