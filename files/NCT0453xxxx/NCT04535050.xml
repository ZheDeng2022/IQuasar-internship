    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of renal denervation&#xD;
      using DENEX System in patients with hypertension without antihypertensive medication,&#xD;
      compared with the sham group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DENEX system developed by Kalos Medical Inc. is a renal denervation system to efficiently&#xD;
      block the sympathetic nerve of the kidney with minimal invasive procedure. It was developed&#xD;
      to block the sympathetic nerves distributed in blood vessel wall by delivering high frequency&#xD;
      energy to the renal artery for the purpose of treating hypertension.&#xD;
