  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of osteoporosis (OP) education on OP patients and the normal population studied&#xD;
      and described in numerous studies. But the effects of OP education on Parkinsonian patients&#xD;
      have not been sufficiently elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of OP education on the OP knowledge&#xD;
      level and daily life in Parkinsonian patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is; to Parkinsonian patients; there is a statistically significant difference&#xD;
      in terms of OP knowledge level and daily life between giving only informative leaflets about&#xD;
      OP and also providing structured OP education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      54 participants aged 50 and older with Parkinson's Disease were randomized to the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups. While only leaflets were given to the control group,&#xD;
      structured OP education was also given to the experimental group. Patients were evaluated&#xD;
      with the same structured face-to-face interviews at the entrance and 12 weeks later.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OP education was performed in groups of 4-5 people by a single physician in the form of&#xD;
      verbal expression via slide, with a duration of 20 minutes and in the form of a single&#xD;
      session. Our leaflets contained the same information as the OP education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Face-to-face interviews include; Revised 2011 Osteoporosis Knowledge Test (rOKT) (0-32&#xD;
      points) for OP knowledge levels; National Osteoporosis Foundation daily calcium intake scale&#xD;
      [NOF, (mg)], Physical Activity Scale For The Elderly (PASE, 0-763 points), smoking and&#xD;
      alcohol use status (Yes/No) and quantities (cigarette pack/per week, alcohol unit/per week),&#xD;
      frequency of falls (times/last 1 month) were questioned for effects on daily life.&#xD;
