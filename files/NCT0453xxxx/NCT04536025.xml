    <textblock>
      This study is designed to learn more about decision making for prosthetic design, with the&#xD;
      goal of producing a decision making aid for prosthetic design decisions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis of this work is that the lack of shared decision making (SDM) for&#xD;
      prosthetic design and failure to match patient expectations with a prosthetic design plan&#xD;
      result in poor health outcomes for patients with LLA. Shared decision making (SDM) is where&#xD;
      clinicians and patients share the best available evidence for comparing options in order to&#xD;
      achieve informed preferences for making health decisions. A patient's involvement in their&#xD;
      health care process is known to affect their satisfaction, adherence to care programs, and&#xD;
      health outcomes. Clinical decision aids (DAs) support patients in SDM and making informed&#xD;
      health decisions, by providing information on the available options and associated outcomes.&#xD;
      DAs are intended to help patients clarify their values associated with the options and&#xD;
      potential outcomes, to create a platform for communication with healthcare providers. DAs&#xD;
      have been shown to improve patient knowledge and realistic expectations for given health&#xD;
      options. This project aims to examine how to better align patient and clinician values and&#xD;
      expectations by developing a DA for prosthetic design decision options, to support SDM&#xD;
      between patients receiving their first prosthesis and prosthetic care providers. This&#xD;
      proposal will be guided by the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Qualitatively define the key determinants and decisional needs of new prosthetic&#xD;
      patients (n=14) and prosthetic care providers (n=20- 24) during prosthetic design, via semi&#xD;
      structured interviews with patient participants and focus groups with prosthetist&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Result 1.1: Key determinants and decisional needs for prosthetic design will be&#xD;
      defined using content analysis guided by the Ottawa Decision Support framework9 for patients&#xD;
      making health decisions, and the Model for Shared Decision Making in Clinical Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Result 1.2: Key stakeholders who contribute directly to prosthetic design decisions&#xD;
      (e.g., patients with LLA, prosthetists, physicians, caregivers, close friends or family&#xD;
      members) will be identified via purposive sampling, to inform the target end users of a DA&#xD;
      prototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Synthesize the evidence for prosthetic design decision options to develop a DA&#xD;
      prototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Result 2.1: Via systematic literature review, a DA prototype will be developed from&#xD;
      the evidence on prosthetic design decision options associated with decisional needs&#xD;
      identified in Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the DA prototype's accuracy, comprehensibility, and usability through alpha&#xD;
      testing with an expert working group of patients with LLA and prosthetic care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Result 3.1: Quantitative results from a Likert scale measurement of the DA&#xD;
      prototype's accuracy, comprehensibility and usability will inform revisions to the DA prior&#xD;
      to use in a pilot clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Result 3.2: Qualitative feedback on the DA prototype's accuracy, comprehensibility,&#xD;
      and usability will inform directed iterative revision for the DA prototype and implementation&#xD;
      methods for use in a pilot clinical trial.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Data collection at baseline time point only</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy of the Decision Aid will be determined by the percentage (ranging 0% to 100%, with a higher percentage representing greater accuracy) of expert working group members who perceive the presented risks and benefits in the Decision Aid to align with the scientific evidence available on the prosthetic design decision outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Comprehensibility of the decision aid prototype, as measured by a Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collection at baseline time point only</time_frame>
    <description>Comprehensibility of the Decision Aid will be classified as the degree to which the Decision Aid content covers information necessary for making an informed decision about prosthetic design, and will be evaluated using a Likert scale (ranging 1-10, with a higher score representing greater comprehensibility) for each component of the Decision Aid.</description>

    <measure>Usability of the decision decision aid prototype, as measured by a Likert scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collection at baseline time point only</time_frame>
    <description>Usability will be qualified as the extent to which the information presented in the Decision Aid is clear, understandable, and effective, and will be evaluated using a Likert scale (ranging 1-10, with a higher score representing greater usability) for each component of the Decision Aid Prototype.</description>

    <description>A survey measurement of patient or prosthetist preferences regarding participation in healthcare decisions. The survey has 5 questions about separate parts of a prosthesis, rated on a Likert scale (Scores ranging 5-25, with lower scores representing greater control preference). Answers to each question will range from 1) I prefer to make the final decision about the prosthesis to 5) I prefer to leave all decisions about the prosthesis to my patient/prosthetist.</description>
