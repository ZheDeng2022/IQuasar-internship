      The purpose of this study is to conduct an open, randomized controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
      evaluating the effects of different dosage forms of glucocorticoid on the Recovery of&#xD;
      Reproductive Function in Patients With 21α-hydroxylase Deficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, about 120 patients who are more than 14 years old and diagnosed with&#xD;
      21-hydroxylase deficiency will be enrolled from Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong&#xD;
      University School of Medicine in China. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified&#xD;
      by subtype and gender. After screening, eligible subjects will be randomly treated with&#xD;
      equivalent dose of hydrocortisone, prednisone or dexamethasone for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment regimen was as follows. Firstly, at least one month washout period (withdrawal)&#xD;
      was performed before treatment. The initial dose of hydrocortisone (20mg/tablet) was&#xD;
      15mg/m2/day to the maximum dose of 60mg, which was orally administered in three times, with&#xD;
      the dose ratio of 2:1:3, and the administration time was 8:00-15:00-21:00. The initial dose&#xD;
      of prednisone (5mg/tablet) was 3mg/m2/day to the maximum dose of 15mg. The dosage ratio was&#xD;
      1:2 and the administration time was 8:00 and 21:00. The initial dose of dexamethasone&#xD;
      (0.75mg/tablet) was 0.3mg/m2/day to the maximum dose of 0.75mg and the administration time&#xD;
      was 21:00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of different dosage forms of glucocorticoid&#xD;
      on the recovery of reproductive function in patients with 21α-hydroxylase deficiency. The&#xD;
      primary end point is to evaluate menstrual cycles with ovulation in female patients&#xD;
      (including menstrual period, menstrual frequency per year) and sperm count in male patients&#xD;
      among the three groups. The secondary endpoint were: 1) The levels of progesterone, 17OHP,&#xD;
      testosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone binding protein were measured at follicular phase&#xD;
      in female patients and male unlimited in the first month and every three months thereafter;&#xD;
      2) The change of BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, visceral and subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      area, body and liver fat content after one year treatment; 3) The change of blood pressure,&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, blood lipid profile after one year treatment;&#xD;
      4) The change of bone mineral density after one year; 5) The change of mental health status&#xD;
      compared with baseline after one year follow-up.&#xD;
