  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis patients display among the lowest level of daily activities and decline of&#xD;
      functional abilities is highly correlated with mortality. Perdialytic exercise during&#xD;
      hemodialysis procedure is now part of the patients' routine care and appears to be a solution&#xD;
      to struggle against the functional skills decrease. Our team was able to demonstrate that&#xD;
      beyond muscle mass, muscle strength and physical activity were essential determinants of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of dialysis patients. The AIDER Santé medical team has set up an&#xD;
      assessment of physical activities and muscle strength in the Montpellier and Nimes centers.&#xD;
      In order to rehabilitate muscle strength and endurance, perdialytic exercise may be&#xD;
      prescribed. Its effectiveness can be appreciated by measuring the SPPB score (Short Physical&#xD;
      Performance Battery). Recent studies established that combined training including resistance&#xD;
      and endurance exercises was the most effective to improve functional performance. In AIDER&#xD;
      Santé dialysis centers, the two mainly used exercise approaches are distinguished by the time&#xD;
      distribution of the two types of exercise: the first plans to practice both types of exercise&#xD;
      at each session (continuous program), the second plans to alternate a week of resistance&#xD;
      exercise with a week of endurance exercise (discontinuous program). It is established that&#xD;
      the rehabilitation of the hemodialysis patient must include both resistance and endurance&#xD;
      exercises, but the combination of these exercises during the same session is potentially at&#xD;
      the origin of an interference phenomenon, limiting neuromuscular adaptations specific to each&#xD;
      effort. Therefore, the main hypothesis of the project is that the temporal separation of&#xD;
      resistance and endurance exercises in a discontinuous program could optimize the functional&#xD;
      gains of combined rehabilitation and therefore be more effective than a continuous program&#xD;
      generating a phenomenon of interference.&#xD;
