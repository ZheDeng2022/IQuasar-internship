  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Hormonal therapy is one of the&#xD;
      major treatments for hormone receptor positive breast tumors. It is prescribed to 70% of&#xD;
      breast cancer patients. Hormonal therapy can be responsible for sexual dysfunction induced by&#xD;
      hormonal changes. Extended adjuvant hormonal therapy over 5 years increases these adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the third &quot;Plan Cancer&quot; (2014-2019), sexual dysfunction prevention and screening&#xD;
      must be systematic as an integral part of supportive care. Nevertheless, sexual quality of&#xD;
      life remains too rarely considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigator propose to evaluate sexual quality of life of women less than&#xD;
      51 years old during the adjuvant endocrine therapy for localized breast cancer. The&#xD;
      investigator also intend to collect the supportive measures or interventions used by women to&#xD;
      overcome sexual dysfunction. Finally, this study aims to evaluate the need for sexual trouble&#xD;
      specific management and acceptability of different methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a hot topic as the interest for oncosexuality is growing, and the need for&#xD;
      specific management is increasing with still insufficient access to specific care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide, affecting approximately one&#xD;
      in eight women during her lifetime in Western countries. (chiffres Globocan). Approximately&#xD;
      two thirds of BC are hormone receptor-positive and the multimodal treatment will therefore&#xD;
      include hormone therapy during 5 years or even longer (Burstein et al. 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have described a wide range of disruptions in day to day living after breast&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis and treatment. These physical, psychological and social concerns for the&#xD;
      patients, related to the disease and its treatment, are now recognized as important outcomes&#xD;
      in clinical trials and are evaluated in standardized Health-related quality of life (HRQL)&#xD;
      questionnaires like the general EORTC QLQ-C30 dedicated to all cancer patients (Aaronson et&#xD;
      al. 1993) or the EORTC QLQ-BR23 dedicated to breast cancer patients (Sprangers et al. 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexual dysfunction is frequent during and after treatment for breast cancer (Ananth et al.&#xD;
      2003; Krychman et al. 2006; Pup et al. 2019) and is not specifically evaluated in these&#xD;
      general HRQL questionnaires. Recently, the EORTC SHQ-C22 has been developed as a standardized&#xD;
      instrument to evaluate sexual quality of life (QoL) in cancer patients to address and&#xD;
      evaluate in more detail the sexual dysfunction related to the disease and the&#xD;
      treatment(Oberguggenberger et al. 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a prospective longitudinal assessment of the sexual functioning of women during&#xD;
      the first year of adjuvant hormonal therapy using global HRQL questionnaires as well as the&#xD;
      new SHQ-C22 questionnaire specifically dedicated to sexual QoL for cancer patients.&#xD;
