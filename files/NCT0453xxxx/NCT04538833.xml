  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) caused by albumin-bound paclitaxel is a&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity. The main symptoms of discomfort are numbness, tingling, and burning&#xD;
      sensations in the glove-sock-like distribution of the limbs. At present, there are few&#xD;
      effective methods for clinical treatment of TIPN, and there is no widely agreed consensus on&#xD;
      effective treatment in the world. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance and&#xD;
      practical value to carry out clinical research to explore drugs to relieve TIPN.&#xD;
