  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personalized medicine in which each patient would receive the ideal personalized treatment&#xD;
      and regimen, holds great promise to improve patient's care. However, previous studies failed&#xD;
      to establish validated predictors of response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs&#xD;
      (DMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). JAK inhibitors is a new class of DMARDs&#xD;
      with great efficacy that might be even superior to anti-TNF drugs. As there are chemicals,&#xD;
      their production cost is much cheaper than biological therapies and they will probably be&#xD;
      central in patient's care in the coming years. Two are currently available: tofacitinib&#xD;
      (TOFA) and baricitinib. Our study will focus on TOFA. Clinical outcomes mainly depend on i)&#xD;
      factors influencing drug metabolism &amp; concentrations and ii) adequacy between drug target and&#xD;
      the inflammation pathways involved in the patient's disease. Humans carry in their gut&#xD;
      trillions of germs, which are now known to be key players in health and disease. Those germs&#xD;
      possess many enzymes and strongly modulate human enzymes expression. Gut-microbiota can,&#xD;
      indeed, directly metabolize oral drugs and control the expression of the cytochrome P450 3A4&#xD;
      (CYP3A4), the main enzyme metabolizing TOFA. We showed, in a preliminary mouse experiment,&#xD;
      that modifying gut-microbiota composition changes TOFA effects on signaling pathways. We thus&#xD;
      believe that models including gut-microbiota composition together with markers of immune&#xD;
      activation will predict clinical outcomes in RA patients treated with TOFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main and secondary objectives: To build predictive models for clinical outcomes (efficacy and&#xD;
      safety) of RA patients treated with TOFA based on microbiota analysis and markers f immune&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodolgy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentric longitudinal prospective study will include 60 patients with RA and&#xD;
      inadequate response to methotrexate. The clinical outcomes studied will be EULAR non-response&#xD;
      at 3 months as defined by the European league against rheumatism EULAR (primary outcome),&#xD;
      achievement of low-disease activity at 6 months or incident adverse events (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes). Gut microbiota will be assessed at baseline and M3 from thawed fecal samples. DNA&#xD;
      will be purified using QIAamp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen) and qualify using Qubit and&#xD;
      TapeStation 4200 (Agilent). Library will be prepared by amplification of V1-V2 and V3-V4&#xD;
      regions from the bacterial 16S rRNA genes and will be qualified by q-PCR and amplicons will&#xD;
      be sequenced by MiSeq (Illumina). Initial bioinformatic analysis and taxonomies will be&#xD;
      carried out using the QIIME2 software. Immune activation will be assessed through JAK-STAT&#xD;
      pathway activation by JAK STAT signaling pathway RT² profiler PCR Array (Qiagen) which&#xD;
      profiles expression of 84 genes related to Jak and Stat-mediated signaling. TOFA&#xD;
      concentrations will be assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)&#xD;
      at baseline and 3 months. Statistical classifiers (Neural network algorithm, Linear and&#xD;
      Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Random forests, Shrinkage Methods,&#xD;
      or Nearest Neighbors) incorporating microbiome, JAK STAT signaling pathway gene expression&#xD;
      and clinical data, will be used to determine profiles associated with TOFA clinical response&#xD;
      and safety. Patients who will prematurely stop TOFA (before 3 months) for adverse events or&#xD;
      loss of follow-up will be considered as non-responders.&#xD;

      Gut microbiota is becoming an important predictor of response and tolerance with anti-cancer&#xD;
      drugs. However, its potential of prediction in other fields has poorly been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug metabolism and concentrations of tofacitinib depend on body mass index, liver function&#xD;
      and cytochrome P450 activity (especially CYP3A4). Humans carry in their gut trillions of&#xD;
      germs, which are now known to be key players in health and disease. Those germs can strongly&#xD;
      impact drug metabolism and concentrations based on 3 mechanisms. First, gut bacteria possess&#xD;
      a huge pool of enzymes which catalyzes drug metabolism reactions. Second, gut microbiota&#xD;
      regulates bile acid metabolism which play critical role in drug metabolism. Third, gut&#xD;
      microbiota modulates the expression of cytochrome P450, especially CYP3A4, the main enzyme&#xD;
      catabolizing Tofacitinib (TOFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to drug metabolism, gut microbiota is a key driver of immune activation. Clinical&#xD;
      response to CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 strongly depends on gut microbiota in different cancers. The&#xD;
      experiments performed to decipher the mechanisms involved suggested that microbiota&#xD;
      composition affects immune responses, which will facilitate or not anti-tumoral efficacy of&#xD;
      checkpoints inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA is a heterogeneous disease with predominant inflammation pathways varying dependent on&#xD;
      patients. Some RA seem to be more dependent on IL-6 whereas others rely more on TNF-alpha, B&#xD;
      or T cells. Gut microbiota was shown to affect all those different targets. Assessing&#xD;
      baseline levels of JAK STAT signaling pathway gene expression will help us to link immune&#xD;
      activation, gut microbiota and clinical response to TOFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that gut-microbiota composition impacts TOFA metabolism, immune activation,&#xD;
      and thus clinical response and has a great potential to predict clinical outcomes in patients&#xD;
      with RA treated with TOFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           To construct a model based on gut-microbiota composition, immune activation markers&#xD;
           (JAK-STAT signalling pathway) and clinical data to predict TOFA non-response at 3 months&#xD;
           in RA patients with inadequate response to methotrexate.&#xD;
