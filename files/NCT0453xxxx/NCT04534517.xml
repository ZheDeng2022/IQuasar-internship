  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study is a bilateral, single-masked (partial), single-arm, clinical trial. A&#xD;
      total of approximately 60 eligible subjects both near-sighted and far-sighted, will be&#xD;
      targeted to complete the study. Subjects will be fit in the study lens for approximately 2-4&#xD;
      days then undergo lens optimization, if required. Subjects will then be given a new pair of&#xD;
      lenses that will be worn for approximately 2 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CLUE Overall Quality of Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort scores will be assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE™ scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE™ score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for population of soft contact lens wearers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distance Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Distance visual acuity will be measured using high and low contrast charts in bright illuminance conditions at 4 meters using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Charts.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intermediate Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Intermediate visual acuity will be measured using high and low contrast charts in bright illuminance conditions at 64 cm using reduced Guillon-Poling charts.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Near Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Near visual acuity will be measured using high and low contrast charts in bright illuminance conditions at 40 cm using reduced Guillon-Poling charts.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Slit Lamp Findings (SLF)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Slit Lamp Findings (Grade 3 or higher) will be assessed for each subject eye. SLFs will be evaluated and classified using the FDA Grading scale rating from 0 to 4, where Grade 0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing successively worse findings (i.e. Grade 1=trace, Grade 2= mile, Grade 3=moderate and Grade 4= severe). The percentage of eyes with Grade 3 or higher slit lamp findings will be analyzed and will include corneal infiltrates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unacceptable Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Unacceptable lens fit will be assessed for each subject eye. Unacceptable fit is a binary response where Y=1 if lens fit is unacceptable and Y=0 otherwise. Unacceptable fit was defined as unacceptable if any one of the following criteria:&#xD;
limbal exposure at primary gaze or with extreme eye movement;&#xD;
edge lift;&#xD;
excessive movement in primary up gaze;&#xD;
insufficient movement in all three of the following conditions: primary gaze, up gaze, and push up test.&#xD;
Eyes with multiple unacceptable fitting events was counted only once.</description>
