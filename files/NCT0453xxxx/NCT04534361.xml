  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific evidence available at present regarding the alterations suffered by the&#xD;
      alveolar ridge after the explantation of implants that have been considered to be abandoned&#xD;
      due to periimplantitis, as well as the remaining sequelae from said treatment, is scarce and&#xD;
      inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding this background, it is speculated that the different types of peri-implant defects&#xD;
      present different bone remodeling and different sequelae after the explantation of the&#xD;
      implants affected by peri-implantitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it has been hypothesized that the peri-implant defect configuration has an influence on&#xD;
      the radiographic bone alterations that occur after explantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this hypothesis, a retrospective study has been designed as it follows:&#xD;
      Patients who have undergone implant placement procedure and suffer from peri-implantitis will&#xD;
      be consecutively included in the study. In addition, patients should present at least 2 CBCTs&#xD;
      taken before and after explantation, 4-6 months apart. Linear measurements will be taken in&#xD;
      order to assess dimensional changes of the alveolar ridge at 1, 3, 5 and 7 mm from the bone&#xD;
      crest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implant diseases have been a growing problem for the last decades. A recent&#xD;
      cross-sectional study conducted in the Spanish population has shown a prevalence of mucositis&#xD;
      and peri-implantitis at the implant level of 27% and 20%, and of 27% and 18% at the patient&#xD;
      level, respectively (Rodrigo et al. 2018). As the peri-implant disease progresses, it has&#xD;
      been observed that it generates different types of defects around implants affected by this&#xD;
      pathology. Recently, Monje et al. 2019, have classified these defects according to their&#xD;
      morphology (infrabony defects, supracrestal/horizontal defects or combined defects) and&#xD;
      according to the depth of the defect and total bone loss/total implant length (3-4mm/&lt;25% of&#xD;
      implant length, 4-5mm/≥25-50% of implant length, &gt;6mm/&gt;50% of implant length (Monje et al.&#xD;
      2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone remodeling, as well as the sequelae or morphological alterations suffered by the&#xD;
      alveolar ridge after tooth extraction have been widely described in the literature (Amler et&#xD;
      al. 1960, Evian et al. 1982, Cardaropoli et al. 2003). In an animal model, Araujo and&#xD;
      coworkers described the alterations of the alveolar ridge following tooth extraction;&#xD;
      observing that bone height reduction of the buccal plate was more pronounced than the&#xD;
      lingual, and that vertical bone loss was always associated with horizontal bone loss (Araujo&#xD;
      et al. 2005). In contrast, the evidence available nowadays regarding the alterations suffered&#xD;
      by the alveolar ridge after the explantation of implants that have been considered to be&#xD;
      removed due to peri-implantitis, as well as the remaining sequelae from said treatment, is&#xD;
      scarce and inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the the primary objective of this study will be to evaluate radiographically the&#xD;
      influence of the peri-implant defect configuration on the radiographic bone alterations after&#xD;
      implant explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, a retrospective observational study will be design. The protocol of which will&#xD;
      be approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Extremadura (Badajoz, Spain), and&#xD;
      will follow the Declaration of Helsinki on human studies. In addition, this study will be&#xD;
      reported in accordance with the Analysis Strenghtening the Reporting of Observational Studies&#xD;
      in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment will be obtained from a private practice exclusively dedicated to&#xD;
      periodontics and implantology. Edentulous patients, either total or partial, who previously&#xD;
      underwent implant placement procedure will be consecutively included in the study. A&#xD;
      prerequisite for being eligible for the study was to have at least 2 CBCts, one taken before&#xD;
      explantation in order to diagnose peri-implantitis; and the other taken after explantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to define a peri-implantitis case, it will be based on the consensus report of&#xD;
      Workgroup 4 of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant&#xD;
      Diseases and Conditions (Berglundh et al., 2018), in which it was stated that, in the absence&#xD;
      of baseline information, the diagnosis of peri-implantitis required: presence of bleeding&#xD;
      and/or suppuration on gentle probing, probing depth ≥6 mm and bone level ≥3mm apical to the&#xD;
      most coronal portion of the implant or at the rough-smooth interface in transmucosal&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once defined, several variables will be recorded, including both patient- and implant-related&#xD;
      ones. The former will include age, gender, type of edentulism (total/partial), history of&#xD;
      periodontal disease (mild, moderate or severe), tobacco smoking (heavy smoker &gt;10&#xD;
      cigarettes/day; light smoker &lt;10 cigarettes/day, former smoker 0 cigarette/day or&#xD;
      non-smoker), numbers of implant per patient, and keratinized mucosa (0, &lt;2 or ≥2 mm).&#xD;
      Implant-related variables will include position (mandible / maxilla / anterior / posterior),&#xD;
      implant system (brand, diameter, length and type of connection), implant macrodesign&#xD;
      (transmucosal/bone level), type of prosthesis (single/multiple; screw/cement-retained), as&#xD;
      well as explantation method (trephine, tweezers, forceps or implant removal kit). In&#xD;
      addition, whether regeneration was performed or not after explantation will be recorded, as&#xD;
      well as the material used for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the radiographic assessment, images were acquired by CBCT i-CAT Model 17-19 (Imaging&#xD;
      Sciences International LLC, Hatfield, PA, USA). The imaging parameters were set at a width&#xD;
      and depth of 16 × 13 mm, 120 kVp, 20.27 mAs, scan time 14.7 seconds, resolution 0.25 voxel&#xD;
      and a field of view (FOV), which varied based on the scanned region. Defect morphology and&#xD;
      severity were determined using the OnDemand3D software (Cybermed, Seoul, Korea) by one&#xD;
      previously calibrated examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the assessment of the different radiographic variables, two reference lines will be&#xD;
      established: longitudinal axis of the implant and a perpendicular line to it tangent to a&#xD;
      reference point (sinus floor in the maxilla and mandibular base in the mandible). Several&#xD;
      parameters will be assessed before and after explantation in each implant, including:&#xD;
      bone-to-implant contact (BIC) at 4 sites (mesial, distal, buccal, lingual), defined as the&#xD;
      first contact between the bone and the implant surface, assessed from the most coronal part&#xD;
      of the intraosseous component of the implant; bone plate thickness (BPT), assessed at buccal&#xD;
      and lingual in mm. The reference point will be the bone crest and bone thickness will be&#xD;
      recorded at 1, 3, 5 and 7 mm from the crest. In addition, ridge width (RW) will be also&#xD;
      recorded at 1, 3, 5 and 7 mm from the bone crest. If there is any discrepancy between buccal&#xD;
      and lingual bone crest, the most apical one will be chosen as the reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess changes in bone crest height, the distance between the most coronal point&#xD;
      of the bone crest (buccal and lingual) and the reference line tangent to a fixed reference&#xD;
      point was calculated in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPT and RW at 1, 3, 5 and 7 mm will be also assessed when the implant has been already&#xD;
      explanted, recording the months that have passed from the explantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the characterization of the peri-implantitis defects, the defect morphology and severity&#xD;
      classification by Monje and coworkers will be followed (Monje et al. 2019):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morphology:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Class I: Infraosseous defect. Class Ia: Buccal dehiscence. Class Ib: 2-3 walls&#xD;
                defect. Class Ic: Circumferential defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Class II: Supracrestal/horizontal defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Class III: Combined defect. Class IIIa: Buccal dehiscence + horizontal bone loss.&#xD;
                Class IIIb: 2-3 walls defect + horizontal bone loss. Class IIIc: Circumferential&#xD;
                defect + horizontal bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity: based upon the defect depth from the implant neck and ratio of bone loss/total&#xD;
           implant length&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade S: Slight: 3-4 mm/&lt;25% of the implant length&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade M: Moderate 4-5 mm/ ≥25%-50% of the implant length&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade A: Advanced: &gt;6 mm/&gt;50% of the implant length&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the statistical analysis, the statistical package (SPSS 15.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA, STATISTICS, version 7.1StatSoft, Inc. will be used for this purpose. The Pearson&#xD;
      correlation test will be applied for the assessment of confounding factors and Linear&#xD;
      regression models based on generalized estimating equations (GEEs) will be used to analyze&#xD;
      the differences in the mean values of the post-extraction bone changes during the 2 time&#xD;
      phases. This model will consider the correlations of within-subject repeated measures.&#xD;
