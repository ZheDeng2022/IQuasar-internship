  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized controlled experimental study to examine the effects&#xD;
      of peer-interaction group support in adolescents with celiac disease (CD) in the 13-18 age&#xD;
      group on the quality of life, friendship relations, and coping levels of adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six peer interactive group sessions were held with one week intervals with adolescents (n =&#xD;
      18) in the study group included in the sample for a period of 3 months. In the sessions, all&#xD;
      participants were asked questions about the purpose of the session and a discussion&#xD;
      environment was created. No training and counseling were provided to the adolescents in the&#xD;
      control group (n = 18). Before and after the peer interactive group support, adolescents in&#xD;
      the intervention and control group were asked to complete the quality of life, friendship&#xD;
      qualities, and coping scales.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled experimental study conducted to examine the effect of&#xD;
      peer interactive group support on quality of life, peer relationships and coping (coping)&#xD;
      levels in adolescents aged 13-18 years with celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted on adolescents with a diagnosis of celiac disease in the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic of the Department of Child Health of Afyon Kocatepe University in Afyonkarahisar. This&#xD;
      change took place after research permissions were obtained. Patients are served in the&#xD;
      polyclinic between 09:00 and 17:00 on weekdays. Gastroenterology Specialist, who monitors the&#xD;
      patients with Celiac diagnosis, works as a physician. There are no nurses in the polyclinic&#xD;
      and individual training is not given to celiac patients according to their needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 85 patients with a diagnosis of celiac disease in the 0-18 age group who were&#xD;
      followed up in the Department of Child Health and Diseases of Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences&#xD;
      University, where the study will be conducted. It was determined from the patient records&#xD;
      that there were 36 patients with a diagnosis of celiac disease in the 13-18 age group. The&#xD;
      universe of the study consisted of patients with a diagnosis of celiac disease in the 13-18&#xD;
      age group who were followed up in the Pediatric Outpatient Clinic of Afyonkarahisar&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools Introductory Information Form, Quality of Life Scale for Children&#xD;
      (13-18 age group), Friendship Qualities Scale and Coping Scale for Adolescents prepared by&#xD;
      the researcher for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introductory Information Form In this form prepared by the researcher, there are 14 questions&#xD;
      regarding the demographic characteristics of the mother, father, family and child. After&#xD;
      randomization, an introductory information form (before peer interactive group support) was&#xD;
      administered to all adolescents in the research and control groups in a classroom of the&#xD;
      Pediatric Outpatient Clinic where the study was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's Quality of Life Scale - PedsQL (13-18 age group) The quality of life scale for&#xD;
      children was developed by Varni et al. (1999) to measure the quality of life of children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 2-18 years. The internal consistency coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) of the&#xD;
      section prepared for children of the scale developed by Varni et al. Was found to be 0.93.&#xD;
      Memik et al. (2007) conducted a study on the validity and reliability of the adolescent form&#xD;
      of the PedsQL (13-18 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the World Health Organization defines health, it covers the areas of physical,&#xD;
      emotional and social functionality. Scoring is made for these three areas in the scale. In&#xD;
      the scale, a fourth area under the name of school functionality is questioned. The&#xD;
      psychosocial health total score (PSTP) is calculated by calculating the total score (STP),&#xD;
      physical health total score (FSTP), emotional, social and school functionality item scores in&#xD;
      the scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Quality of Life Scale for Children (PedsQL) is a scale suitable for use in healthy or ill&#xD;
      children and adolescents in settings such as schools and hospitals. The scale consists of 23&#xD;
      items in total. The scale is in the form of a 5-point Likert scale and is scored between 0-4.&#xD;
      The items are scored between 0-100. The scale gives 100 points for never answer, rarely 75&#xD;
      points for its answer, sometimes 50 points for its answer, often 25 points for its answer,&#xD;
      and almost always 0 points for its answer. The Turkish validity and reliability study of the&#xD;
      PedsQL for the 13-18 age group was conducted by Memik et al. (2007). The internal consistency&#xD;
      coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) of the form prepared for adolescents in the study of Memik et&#xD;
      al. Was found to be 0.82.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Friendship Qualities Scale The friendship qualities scale aims to evaluate the relationships&#xD;
      of 10-18 year old children and adolescents with their best friends. The scale was created by&#xD;
      Bukowski et al. (1994). The internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) according to&#xD;
      the sub-dimensions of the scale were: 0.72; conflict: 0.68; proximity: 0.76; help: 0.81; and&#xD;
      protection: found to be 0.58. The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was&#xD;
      conducted by Erkan Atik et al. (2014). Participants included in the study are secondary and&#xD;
      high school students. The internal consistency coefficient of the whole scale in the study of&#xD;
      Erkan Atik et al. Was found to be 0.85. The scale includes 22 items and five sub-dimensions.&#xD;
      The scale is graded from 1 to 5. &quot;1&quot; is not right for your friendship, &quot;2&quot; may be correct,&#xD;
      &quot;3&quot; is usually correct, &quot;4&quot; is very correct, &quot;5&quot; is completely correct. The sub-dimensions of&#xD;
      the scale are togetherness, conflict, assistance, protection and closeness. Togetherness&#xD;
      sub-dimension, items 1, 2, 3 and 4, conflict sub-dimension 5,6,7 and 8 items, help&#xD;
      sub-dimension 9,10,11,12 and 13 items, protection sub-dimension 14,15,16 and 17th items,&#xD;
      proximity sub-dimension is calculated by evaluating items 18,19,20,21 and 22. All items in&#xD;
      the conflict sub-dimension of the scale are calculated by reverse coding. The scores that can&#xD;
      be obtained vary between 4-20 in the Togetherness, Conflict and Protection sub-dimensions,&#xD;
      and 5-25 in the Assistance and Proximity sub-dimensions. If the scale score to be obtained&#xD;
      from both the total score and the sub-dimensions is high, this is considered as positive peer&#xD;
      relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coping Scale for Adolescents (KIDCOPE) The scale, which was created by Spirito et al. (1988)&#xD;
      under the name of KIDCOPE (multidimensional coping strategies for children scale), consists&#xD;
      of two forms for children (5-13 years old) and adolescents (13-18 years). The internal&#xD;
      consistency coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale was 0.62. The Coping Scale for&#xD;
      Adolescents consists of 11 items in total. This scale includes ten coping strategies. These&#xD;
      strategies include social distancing, distraction, desiring thinking, problem solving,&#xD;
      withdrawal, cognitive restructuring, social support, emotion regulation, self-criticism, and&#xD;
      blaming others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10 strategies included in KIDCOPE are; distraction (played a game to watch or forget TV),&#xD;
      withdrawal (left alone), desiresing thinking (wanted to be able to do things differently),&#xD;
      self-criticism (blamed myself), blaming others (blaming someone else for causing the&#xD;
      problem), problem solving (I tried to solve the problem by thinking about the answers),&#xD;
      emotion regulation (tried to calm myself or yelled, screamed), cognitive restructuring (tried&#xD;
      to see the good side of things), social support (tried to feel better by spending time with&#xD;
      family or friends) and social distancing (I didn't want to spend time with my family or&#xD;
      friends) The 10 strategies included in KIDCOPE are; distraction (played a game to watch or&#xD;
      forget TV), withdrawal (left alone), desiresing thinking (wanted to be able to do things&#xD;
      differently), self-criticism (blamed myself), blaming others (blaming someone else for&#xD;
      causing the problem), problem solving (I tried to solve the problem by thinking about the&#xD;
      answers), emotion regulation (tried to calm myself or yelled, screamed), cognitive&#xD;
      restructuring (tried to see the good side of things), social support (tried to feel better by&#xD;
      spending time with family or friends) and social distancing (I didn't want to spend time with&#xD;
      my family or friends) In the implementation phase of the study, a classroom belonging to the&#xD;
      Child Health and Diseases Polyclinic of Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences University Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine Hospital was used. All sessions in the research were held in this classroom. The&#xD;
      sessions lasted an average of 90 minutes in two 45-minute sections. Gluten-free products were&#xD;
      presented during the 20-minute break between sessions. During the break, adolescents were&#xD;
      given the opportunity to interact with each other by chatting. The pre-test application of&#xD;
      the introductory information form and scale forms of all the participants in the research&#xD;
      group was applied at the beginning of the first session, and the post-test application at the&#xD;
      end of the last session, which was the sixth session. The pre-test application of the&#xD;
      participants included in the control group was applied on the same day separately from the&#xD;
      research group, and the post-test application (only scales) was applied in the same classroom&#xD;
      at the end of all sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Group Interactive peer group support was implemented for 3 months, one week apart. A&#xD;
      total of 6 sessions were held with the research group. Group meetings were planned to be held&#xD;
      at the weekend in order to prevent adolescents' attendance at school. However, as the data&#xD;
      collection phase is in the summer and schools are closed, the sessions were held on weekdays&#xD;
      and bi-weekly. The adolescents in the study group were reached by phone before each session.&#xD;
      One day before the session, all participants were sent a text message informing the meeting&#xD;
      and its place and time and they were invited. Each session lasted 1.5 hours on average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contents of the first and second sessions of the research were prepared beforehand.&#xD;
      However, the contents of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth sessions were arranged after the&#xD;
      first two sessions. Table of contents of the 6 sessions held is presented in Table 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the sessions, all participants were asked questions regarding the target determined for&#xD;
      the session. By creating a discussion environment based on these questions, it was ensured&#xD;
      that the participants shared their problems and solutions with each other. The responses of&#xD;
      the participants to the questions were noted and reported by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group No peer interactive group support was provided to the control group. In the&#xD;
      control group, in a classroom belonging to the University's Child Health and Diseases&#xD;
      Polyclinic where the study was conducted, the Introductory Information Form, the Quality of&#xD;
      Life Scale for Children, the Friendship Qualities Scale, the Adolescent Coping Scale were&#xD;
      applied after the adolescents and parents were informed about the subject of the study and&#xD;
      written permission was obtained. Three months later, the Adolescents in the control group&#xD;
      were administered the Quality of Life Scale for Children, Friendship Qualities Scalee, and&#xD;
      the Adolescent Coping Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adolescents in the control group were not informed about the routine education they&#xD;
      received from the hospital during the study. A separate training meeting was held for the&#xD;
      control group on 11.10.2018, after all sessions of the peer interactive group support of the&#xD;
      study were completed. The training lasted about one hour in the classroom of the University's&#xD;
      Child Health and Diseases Polyclinic. The definition, symptoms and signs of celiac disease,&#xD;
      treatment and dietary rules were discussed in the training content. At the end of the&#xD;
      meeting, an information booklet titled &quot;Living with Celiacs&quot; was given.&#xD;
