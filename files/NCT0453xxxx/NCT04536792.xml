  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AG-946 in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers after oral administration of single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending&#xD;
      doses (MAD) of AG-946 over 14 or 28 days of dosing, and to identify a range of doses that are&#xD;
      safe and pharmacologically active in participants with sickle cell disease. The SAD and MAD&#xD;
      parts of the study will be randomized and double-blinded, and will assess the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of AG-946 as well as the effect of food (SAD&#xD;
      only) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG-946. The sickle cell disease (SCD) part of the study&#xD;
      will be non-randomized and open-label, and is designed to identify 1 or more safe and&#xD;
      tolerable dose(s) of AG-946 with potential activity in the treatment of participants with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
