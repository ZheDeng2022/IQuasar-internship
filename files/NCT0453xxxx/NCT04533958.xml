  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the first cancer in men. The treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with&#xD;
      chemotherapy is based on the intravenous administration of docetaxel chemotherapy. Symptoms&#xD;
      of anticipatory nausea, linked to anxiety caused by the treatment, may occur. Hypnosis is&#xD;
      already used to treat the anxiety of people with cancer and can help treat the symtoms of&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting of women with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of medical hypnosis in virtual reality on&#xD;
      the anxiety of patients with metastatic prostate cancer receiving Docetaxel chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment in comparison with a control group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After verifying the patient's eligibility criteria and obtaining the signed informed consent&#xD;
      form, the patient is randomized to the arm receiving hypnosis in virtual reality or to the&#xD;
      control arm. The study ends after the 12 courses of docetaxel or premature termination of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <measure>Demonstrate a modification in anxiety after each infusion of Docetaxel in the HypnoVR arm compared to the control arm.</measure>
    <time_frame>For up to 6 months, every 2 weeks (before and after the 12 infusions), starting on day of first infusion until day of the last twelfth infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of anxiety by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score before and after each docetaxel infusion (i.e. 24 questionnaires) between the HypnoVR arm and the control arm. The score is a quantitative variable with values ranging from 20 to 80. The higher the score is, the more important the anxiety is.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test the hypothesis that medical hypnosis in virtual reality is accompanied by a decrease in nausea before and after the Docetaxel cures</measure>
    <time_frame>For up to 6 months, every 2 weeks (before and after the 12 infusions), starting on day of first infusion until day of the last twelfth infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of nausea (Analogical Visual Scale-VAS) before and after each infusion and at the end of treatment (i.e. 24 questionnaires) between the two arms. The analogical visual scale of nausea is a 6-point scale from &quot;no nausea&quot; to &quot;maximum nausea&quot;. The higher the score is, the more important nausea are.</description>

    <measure>Test the hypothesis that medical hypnosis in virtual reality is accompanied by a decrease in vomiting before and after the Docetaxel cures</measure>
    <time_frame>For up to 6 months, every 2 weeks (before and after the 12 infusions), starting on day of first infusion until day of the last twelfth infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the number of vomiting episodes (n) before and after each infusion and at the end of treatment (i.e. 24 questionnaires) between the two arms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test the hypothesis that medical hypnosis in virtual reality is accompanied by an increase in the quality of life by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire for the health state description part after the end of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>For up to 6 months, one assessment questionnaire on day of inclusion and one assessment questionnaire at the end of study visit (month 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the quality of life by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire before the start of treatment with Docetaxel and after the end of treatment (after 12 infusions, ie two questionnaires) between the two arms. The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire has two components: health state description and evaluation. In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L).</description>

    <description>Comparison of the quality of life by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire before the start of treatment with Docetaxel and after the end of treatment (after 12 infusions, ie two questionnaires) between the two arms. The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire has two components: health state description and evaluation. In the evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analogic scale (EQ-VAS) from 0 (the worst state of health imaginable) to 100 (the best state of health imaginable).</description>

    <description>Comparison of the quality of life by the FACT-P questionnaire before the start of treatment with Docetaxel and after the end of treatment (after 12 infusions, ie two questionnaires) between the two arms. The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-report quality of life instrument specifically designed for use with prostate cancer patients. It consists of 27 core items which assess patient function in four domains: Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being, which is further supplemented by 12 site specific items to assess for prostate related symptoms. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each item on a 5-points scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</description>

    <description>The HYPNO VR® device is a software application of medical hypnosis in the treatment of pain and anxiety. It is associated with equipment: a virtual reality headset and a headphone.&#xD;
Before each Docetaxel infusion, the nursing staff offers patients the choices: visual universe, musical theme, male or female voice. The nursing staff selects the chemotherapy program, selects a duration of 20 minutes and presses start to start the medical hypnosis session in virtual reality.&#xD;
After completing the hypnotic trance sequence, as in a classic session, the patient is brought back to the &quot;return&quot; and exit hypnosis phase under the supervision of the nursing staff.</description>
