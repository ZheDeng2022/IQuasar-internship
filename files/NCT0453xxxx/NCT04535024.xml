  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical trial. This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in&#xD;
      combination with Sintilimab, and to examine the impact of the combination therapy on tumor&#xD;
      control, long-term survival and quality of life in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS)&#xD;
      oligometastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 MSS oligometastatic colorectal cancer patients will be recruited and receive&#xD;
      multisite SABR followed by immunotherapy of Sintilimab within one week from completion.&#xD;
      Sintilimab will be given at a fixed dose of 200mg (100mg if weight &lt; 50 kg) via intravenous&#xD;
      infusion on the first day of each cycle, repeated every three weeks. The dosing will continue&#xD;
      for up to two years until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal.&#xD;
      The tumor regression, disease control, adverse events and long-term survival will be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with metastatic cancer, as proved by improved survival and durable responses in a group of&#xD;
      these patients. However, the response rates to ICI when given alone are limited. In&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer, patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch&#xD;
      repair deficient (dMMR) tumors shown a response rate of approximately 40% to ICI, while&#xD;
      patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) or mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) tumors respond&#xD;
      poorly to ICI. Such observations have spurred efforts to expand the benefit of immunotherapy,&#xD;
      especially in these immune &quot;non-sensitive&quot; tumors, by combining ICI with treatments that&#xD;
      induce T-cell associated immune response such stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose ablative radiation was showed to facilitate immunotherapy through promote the&#xD;
      activation of innate and adaptive immune responses against tumors in preclinical model and&#xD;
      early phase clinical trials. However, a large portion of trials which were launched to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of radiotherapy and immunotherapy produced suboptimal results. One important&#xD;
      reason could be that majority of these trails were designed with single lesion irradiation,&#xD;
      which is insufficient to unveil enough tumor antigens and/or to break the barrier of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that irradiation to multiple or all sites of diseases is more&#xD;
      likely to produce an optimized regimen with ICI by broadly stimulate anti-tumor immunity and&#xD;
      reduce tumor burden. Therefore, this study plans to administrate SABR to as many metastatic&#xD;
      lesions as possible, in combination with ICI (Sintilimab) in patients with MSS&#xD;
      oligometastatic colorectal cancers, to assess safety and tolerability of the regimen, and&#xD;
      evaluate its early efficacy as well.&#xD;
