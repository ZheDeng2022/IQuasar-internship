    <textblock>
      Residual limb (RLP) and phantom limb pain (PLP) affects most amputees at some point in their&#xD;
      life1. The incidence of PLP has been estimated to range between 50 - 80%. RLP prevalence has&#xD;
      been estimated to be 43%. The peak of onset is bimodal and often appears within the first&#xD;
      month and second year after amputation. RLP is more common in the first year after&#xD;
      amputation, with PLP becoming the predominate amputee pain complaint after one-year&#xD;
      post-amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both RLP and PLP fall under the umbrella term &quot;post-amputation pain.&quot; While these conditions&#xD;
      are frequently found in combination, their clinical features and underlying causes are&#xD;
      distinct. PLP is a painful sensation in the distribution of the missing limb. Following&#xD;
      amputation, abnormalities at multiple levels of the neural axis have been implicated in the&#xD;
      development of PLP; changes include cortical reorganization, reduced inhibitory processes at&#xD;
      the spinal cord, synaptic response changes and hyperexcitability at the dorsal root ganglion,&#xD;
      and retrograde peripheral nerves shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual limb pain has been called &quot;neuroma pain&quot; and is mechanistically distinct from PLP11.&#xD;
      Neuromas may form as early 6-10 weeks after nerve transection, and are thought the produce&#xD;
      ectopic neural discharges resulting in severe pain. Evidence suggests RLP and PLP commonly&#xD;
      co-occur and patients may struggle to differentiate between these pain types. Risk factors&#xD;
      include female sex, upper extremity amputation, pre-amputation pain, residual pain in&#xD;
      contralateral limb, and time since amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression, anxiety, and stress are known to exacerbate PLP / RLP. Patients experiencing PLP&#xD;
      and RLP also experience a higher incidence of indecisiveness, suicidal ideation, and thoughts&#xD;
      of self-harm8. Current guidelines for treatment of PLP and RLP are not standardized.&#xD;
      Treatments includes pre-operative analgesia, neuromodulation mirror therapy, imagery,&#xD;
      acupuncture, transcranial stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and medications (including,&#xD;
      but not limited to: TCAs, SSRIs, gabapentinoids, sodium channel blockers, ketamine, opioids,&#xD;
      and NSAIDs). Many agents have been injected in neuromas. These include local anesthetic,&#xD;
      phenol, alcohol, and botulinum toxin. These oral, intravenous, and nonpharmacological&#xD;
      modalities have demonstrated limited success in the treatment of PLP / RLP. Neuroma&#xD;
      cryoablation has been used, but this method of neural destruction poses technical challenges&#xD;
      related to cumbersome needle placement and the requirement for time-intensive freeze-thaw&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional RFA has been studied on RLP. Zhang et. al treated 13 patients with painful stump&#xD;
      neuromas. The study started with alcohol neurolysis before using ultrasound-guided RFA for&#xD;
      refractory cases. The frequency of sharp pain was reduced in all RFA-treated patients. Kim&#xD;
      et. al described a case in which ultrasound-guided RFA was successfully used to treat a&#xD;
      sciatic neuroma of an above-knee amputee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No outcome literature on the effectiveness of C-RFA technology has been published. C-RFA is&#xD;
      similar in mechanism to conventional RFA: a thermal lesion is created by applying&#xD;
      radiofrequency energy through an electrode placed at a target structure. In C-RFA, a constant&#xD;
      flow of ambient water is circulated through the electrode via a peristaltic pump, maintaining&#xD;
      a lowered tissue temperature by creating a heat sink. By removing heat from tissues&#xD;
      immediately adjacent to the electrode tip, a lower lesioning temperature is maintained,&#xD;
      resulting in less tissue charring adjacent to the electrode, less tissue impedance and more&#xD;
      efficient heating of target tissue. The volume of tissue heated, and the resultant thermal&#xD;
      lesion size is substantially larger with C-RFA, conferring an advantage over conventional&#xD;
      RFA. Further, given the spherical geometry and forward projection the C-RFA lesions beyond&#xD;
      the distal end of the electrode, the RFA probe can be positioned at a range of possible&#xD;
      angles and still capture the target neural structure, whereas more fastidious, parallel&#xD;
      positioning is required with conventional RFA. These technical advantages increase the&#xD;
      probability of successful denervation of neural pain generators that have variability in&#xD;
      anatomic location. Additionally, a longer lesion of the RLP-generating nerve may be more&#xD;
      reliably achieved with C-RFA compared to conventional RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the present study aims to define the attributable effect of cooled RFA on pain,&#xD;
      physical function, and health-related quality of life in patients with post-amputation&#xD;
      neuroma-associated residual limb pain. This prospective single-arm pilot study is intended to&#xD;
      inform a future properly powered randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <description>RFA procedures will be performed with modification accounting for appropriate C-RFA technique. Participant will be positioned prone and skin prepped with chloroprep. Ultrasound probe will be placed on residual limb at a transverse angle in order to view the nerve and associated neuroma in long-axis. The probe will be advanced to the site of the stump neuroma. C-RFA electrode will be placed adjacent to neuroma. Needle will be connected via wire to a cooled radiofrequency generator. Motor and sensory testing will be performed to reproduce or exacerbate the RLP and / or PLP. At the site of the neuroma, 2 mL of local anesthetic will be injected through the needle. C-RFA lesions will be created by using the typical C-RFA protocol. Upon completion needle will be removed. Following ablation, 0.5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected at the site of the ablated neuroma to provide post procedure analgesia.</description>
