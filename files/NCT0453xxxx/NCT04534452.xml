  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this study want to find out whether participants with a history of stuffy&#xD;
      nose due to allergic reactions in the nose would intend to buy drug Phenylephrine&#xD;
      Hydrochloride (Phenylephrine HCl) extended release tablet (a pill is formulated so that the&#xD;
      drug is released slowly over time) after receiving it once in this study. Phenylephrine HCl&#xD;
      is an over-the-counter (OTC) drug (a medicine that can be bought without a prescription) used&#xD;
      to provide temporary relief of stuffy nose caused by cold or allergies in mouth, nose and&#xD;
      throat. Phenylephrine HCl immediate-release tablet (a pill with drug released rapidly without&#xD;
      special rate controlling) was already approved to be used for adults and children and the&#xD;
      recommended dose for adults and children 12 years or older is 10mg every 4 hours.&#xD;
      Phenylephrine HCl 30mg extended release tablet used in this study is not yet approved but&#xD;
      under development with a goal to relieve stuffy nose for every 8 hours. Researchers also want&#xD;
      to find out if participants have any medical problems during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be asked to record their stuffy nose symptoms in a diary&#xD;
      before and after drug intake. At 8 hours after drug intake, participants need to assess&#xD;
      whether they intends to buy the drug or not and their overall satisfaction of the stuffy nose&#xD;
      relief. At the end the participants will complete a questionnaire about their job, learning&#xD;
      background, income and medical history of stuffy nose.&#xD;
