  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, open trial of trauma-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy for&#xD;
      LGBT-identifying individuals who meet for DSM-5 defined post-traumatic stress disorder and&#xD;
      are interested in receiving a research psychotherapy intervention. A sample of at least 15&#xD;
      therapy completers will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite high prevalence of PTSD among LGBT individuals, there are no data characterizing the&#xD;
      disorder in this population, nor its treatment. This represents an important under-researched&#xD;
      area in LGBT care and treatment. The purpose of this study is: (a) to preliminarily&#xD;
      characterize PTSD within an LGBT sample; and (b) to test out the preliminary effects and&#xD;
      acceptability of a novel PTSD psychotherapy, trauma-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy, in&#xD;
      this group. Participants identifying as LGBT and meeting DSM-5 criteria for PTSD per a&#xD;
      structured, reliable clinical interview for PTSD will receive 20-24 sessions of twice-weekly&#xD;
      TFPP at no cost. Participants will receive four detailed clinical research assessments, at&#xD;
      baseline/study entry, Week 5 of treatment, treatment termination/end (Week 12), and 3-months&#xD;
      after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TFPP is adapted from the only empirically supported, non-exposure focused psychodynamic&#xD;
      therapy for panic disorder and anxiety disorders, panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy.&#xD;
      TFPP aims to improve patients' ability to understand and manage strong, intense emotions that&#xD;
      appear seemingly &quot;out of the blue,&quot; which links to their tendency to reexperience traumatic&#xD;
      events in the here-and-now. TFPP addresses the psychological meanings of symptoms and their&#xD;
      relationship to traumatic events to help the patient understand underlying emotions&#xD;
      triggering their symptoms and the ways in which trauma influences their current experiences.&#xD;
      TFPP was developed for patients with complex PTSD, who often have multiple prior trauma&#xD;
      exposures with no clear &quot;index&quot; trauma. Moreover, TFPP also explicitly considers&#xD;
      opportunities for patients to explore the broader context of their symptoms and difficulties,&#xD;
      including but not limited to LGBT identity or experiences of oppression.&#xD;

    <description>The CAPS is the gold-standard measure for PTSD symptoms and diagnosis given by trained research assistants; lower scores denote less severe PTSD symptoms; a decline of at least 30% from an individual's baseline CAPS score is defined as a treatment response on the CAPS.</description>

    <description>Failure to complete experimental psychotherapy intervention (defined as attending at least 16 out of 24 TFPP sessions within the 12-week period OR patient declaring intention to not attend any further TFPP sessions during the 12-week period).

    <description>This psychotherapy addresses disruptions in narrative coherence and affective dysregulation by exploring the psychological meanings of symptoms and their relation to traumatic events. The therapist works to identify intrapsychic conflicts, intense negative affects, and defense mechanisms related to the PTSD syndrome using a psychodynamic formulation that provides a framework for intervention. The transference provides a forum for patients to address feelings of mistrust, difficulties with authority, fears of abuse, angry and guilty feelings, and fantasies.&#xD;
This treatment will be provided in-person or over teletherapy as the public health situation demands.</description>
