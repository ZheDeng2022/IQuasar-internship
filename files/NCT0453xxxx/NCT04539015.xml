  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study to establish the efficacy of Prevena™ Plus in preventing surgical site&#xD;
      infection after complex abdominal wall procedures and major laparotomies as compared to SOC&#xD;
      dressing. We hypothesized that use of Prevena Plus will significantly decrease the incidence&#xD;
      of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) and subsequently may have an impact over reducing hospital&#xD;
      cost. Study data will be analyzed for clinical outcomes through 30 days. The patients will be&#xD;
      followed every day during the hospital stay and study follow-up visits will be conducted in&#xD;
      the clinic at 2 weeks and 1 month from the date of discharge.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative wound complications are a frequent cause of surgical morbidity and a&#xD;
      large-scale health problem. Surgical site infection leads to excess morbidity, prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization and increased strain on healthcare resources. It is estimated that the total&#xD;
      annual cost for hospital-acquired infections was $9.8 billion, with SSIs contributing 33.7%&#xD;
      to overall cost (approximately $20,785 per case). Patients undergoing major laparotomy such&#xD;
      as elective colorectal procedures, bowel resections, solid organ tumor resection and complex&#xD;
      abdominal wall repair (CAWR) are at high risk of developing wound complications. As a&#xD;
      tertiary care teaching hospital, the volume of surgical cases is high which includes but not&#xD;
      limited to Complex Abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR) with biological mesh, elective&#xD;
      colorectal procedures, solid organ tumor resection and organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have started using Prevena™ incision management system over primarily closed&#xD;
      surgical incision after all the above mentioned procedures and subjectively observed the&#xD;
      decrease in surgical site infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Prospective, Randomized, Controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of applying&#xD;
      Prevena Plus to closed surgical incision in patients who had or undergone Complex Abdominal&#xD;
      Wall Reconstruction with biological mesh and other major laparotomies (treatment Group) as&#xD;
      compared to Standard of Care (SOC) surgical incision dressing (dry sterile dressing/gauze,&#xD;
      steri-strips) in preventing surgical site infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Baseline: The subjects who are scheduled and or admitted at our institution for&#xD;
      complex abdominal wall reconstruction procedure with biological mesh and other major&#xD;
      laparotomies will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study and screening will&#xD;
      start whenever patient comes for pre-operative visit usually 1- 3 weeks prior to and&#xD;
      including the day of surgery. If patient agrees to participate in the study and signs the&#xD;
      consent he/she will be randomized in the study intra-operatively. Baseline information like&#xD;
      past medical history, past surgical history, comorbid conditions, concomitant medications,&#xD;
      will be collected and subjects will be asked to complete the questionnaires at screening&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the consent form, subjects will be assigned a unique, consecutive screening&#xD;
      number for screening log tracking purposes and the screening log will also include reason for&#xD;
      screen failure. Screening log will be filed in regulatory binder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen Failure: Any eligible patient who met all the inclusion criteria and signed the&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study but later decides not to participate in the study or if&#xD;
      they meet any of the intra-operative exclusion criteria, randomization will not be performed&#xD;
      and they are considered as screen failures. There will be no further study related contacts&#xD;
      with these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur intra-operatively after surgical incision closure and after&#xD;
      confirmation of all the intra-operative inclusion criteria and none of the intra-operative&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are met. After subjects have been assessed for eligibility and randomized&#xD;
      in the study, they will be randomly allocated to any one of the groups in the ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
      Randomization means that the researcher does not control which subject gets put in which&#xD;
      group. Each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to each group. The participant&#xD;
      will be assigned to a group by chance to eliminate bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group assignments will be contained in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes to&#xD;
      conceal allocation from participants and investigators. Each subject will be provided with&#xD;
      unique four digit number (1001 etc) so the data that is collected during the study&#xD;
      participation will be saved under that unique four digit number. Once a subject number is&#xD;
      assigned, it is not re-assigned to another subject. If subject is randomized but does not&#xD;
      receive study treatment, he/she will be withdrawn from the study and the enrollment log will&#xD;
      be completed with assigned subject number and includes reason for withdrawal. Enrollment log&#xD;
      will be filed in regulatory binder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: Study Intervention: Subjects will receive PREVENA Plus after surgery and will apply&#xD;
      for at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: Standard of Care (SOC): Postoperative Surgical incision dressing (dry sterile&#xD;
      dressing/gauze, steri-strips) which is currently the standard of care at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group-I subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the Group-I will receive PREVENA Plus, which is currently being used&#xD;
      at our institution (Prevena, KCI) and it is FDA-approved device. Dressings will be applied&#xD;
      under sterile conditions at the end of the surgery while still in the operating room and will&#xD;
      continuously apply for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Prevena Plus Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Continuously applied up to 5 days (removed earlier if there is a suspicion for wound&#xD;
      infection or bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group-II: Standard of Care Dressing Subjects randomized to SOC surgical incision dressing arm&#xD;
      will receive SOC dressing for 4 days immediately following surgery. The closed incision will&#xD;
      be covered with materials which may include sterile gauze pieces, surgical tape and tegaderm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any material used for the SOC dressing will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening: starts at Pre Admission Testing visit and includes day of surgery (subjects&#xD;
           undergoing elective or emergent procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prevena Group: 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SOC Group: 4 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Phase: After randomization -Day 0 through 30 days (+ 7days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Subject Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects Approximate number of subjects to be enrolled in this study is 170 (85 in&#xD;
      each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender of Subjects There will be no gender based restrictions for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age of Subjects Adults 18 years of age and above will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Racial and Ethnic Origin There will be no enrollment restrictions based upon race or ethnic&#xD;
      origin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Time Periods Data will be gathered from the patients and the medical record.&#xD;
      Data will be collected on factors such as medical history, comorbid conditions, prior&#xD;
      surgeries, pre-operational factors, surgical technique, functional status and other items as&#xD;
      indicated in the data collection form. This data collection will be broken down into three&#xD;
      main time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics: age and gender Social History: recreational drug use, smoking and alcohol.&#xD;
      Vitals: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      temperature (temp), respiratory rate (resp. rate), height, weight and BMI (body mass index)&#xD;
      Lab reports: the lab tests that are done as standard of care during the hospital stay will be&#xD;
      collected. The following lab values will be collected for the study only if they are&#xD;
      available in subject's medical record: hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood count&#xD;
      (differential), sodium, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), lactate, pH, glucose, creatinine, platelet&#xD;
      count, serum albumin, coagulation profile (PT (prothrombin time)/PTT (partial thromboplastin&#xD;
      time) /aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), if available, cultures from blood,&#xD;
      urine, sputum, trachea, wound and peritoneal fluid will be collected as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbid Conditions: Obesity, history of Diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD), Cardiac disease, malignancy, solid organ transplant, peripheral vascular disease,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accident, immunosuppression, functional dependency, cirrhosis, history of&#xD;
      acute or chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, ascites and nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications: all medications including antimicrobial medications that the subject&#xD;
      is taking from the time subject signed the informed consent through the duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of surgery: start time and end time Amount and type of fluids Received: IV fluids&#xD;
      and blood products received General: ASA score, Number of drains, planned/unplanned&#xD;
      procedures and amount of blood loss Type of surgery and technique: Investigators will note&#xD;
      the type and placement of incision , measurements of the incision, location of the mesh&#xD;
      placement (sublay, underlay, overlay or bridge), size of mesh in cm2, anterior/posterior&#xD;
      component separation, number of drains placed, setting of surgery (elective vs&#xD;
      emergent/urgent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for monitoring heart rate and blood pressure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per standard of care, if a patient is in the intensive care unit blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate is monitored every hour. If patient is on the floor heart rate and blood pressure is&#xD;
      monitored every 4hours. Arrhythmia is monitored by placing a multi-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) on the patient. As long as monitoring for arrhythmia is not hindered in any way, having&#xD;
      a PREVENA dressing on the body does not pose any risk to the patient. Since this study does&#xD;
      not involve any Cardiothoracic procedures and positioning of multi lead ECG for monitoring of&#xD;
      Arrhythmias will not pose any risk to the patients. Arrhythmia is not a contraindication or a&#xD;
      non-indicated application, it's more of PREVENA dressing placement issue when other&#xD;
      interventions are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General: date of discharge, time of discharge, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit&#xD;
      length of stay, (ICU LOS), ventilator days, transfer back to ICU, time of drain removal and&#xD;
      mortality Complications: any of these postoperative complications will be collected and&#xD;
      reported based on Clavien-Dindo classification- wound infection, Pneumonia, MI, stroke,&#xD;
      Seroma, fistula, sepsis, urinary tract infection, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
      adult respiratory distress syndrome, and paralytic ileus. Post-operative seroma will be noted&#xD;
      and documented according to Morales-Conde classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also note other surgical site occurrence (SSO) dehiscence: primary and&#xD;
      secondary. Surgical site infection: superficial and deep SSI-purulent drainage from incision,&#xD;
      fluid accumulation, purulent fluid that is drained or positive culture with signs/symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organism isolated from aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue, antimicrobials,&#xD;
      Percutaneous or open drainage by surgeon. Debridement, hospital and ICU length of stay&#xD;
      Disposition: home, acute rehabilitation center or subacute rehabilitation center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Follow-up Visits Duration of the study is 30 days and all the follow-up visits are&#xD;
      standard of care. Wounds will be assessed postoperatively at regular intervals until wound&#xD;
      healing is achieved. This will occur at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after surgery, which are standard&#xD;
      intervals in our current postoperative protocol. Investigators will analyze stitch line, pain&#xD;
      at the incision site, any evidence of surgical site occurrence such as infection, necrosis,&#xD;
      seroma, bulge or recurrence. All enrolled subjects are in the study for only 4 weeks and&#xD;
      after that there will be no additional study visits but patients randomized to group-I or&#xD;
      group-II will be followed in the clinic regularly per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the Study: Study will end after the last enrolled subject completes the 30 day&#xD;
      follow-up visit and the final study report will be submitted to IRB after manuscript or other&#xD;
      publications are submitted and accepted.&#xD;
