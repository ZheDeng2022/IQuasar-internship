      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by poor attention,&#xD;
      impulsivity, hyperactivity and emotional-motivational dysregulation. Here, we will test if&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can reduce the symptoms of ADHD.&#xD;

      1. Background &amp; Rationale Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized&#xD;
           by poor attention, impulsivity, hyperactivity and emotional-motivational dysregulation.&#xD;
           It has an estimated prevalence of 5% in children. Usually, ADHD in children is treated&#xD;
           with stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate. However, these pharmacotherapy&#xD;
           treatments have numerous unwanted side effects, including sleep disturbances, appetite&#xD;
           changes, and emotional lability, and do not prove to be effective in every case.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A promising and alternative option for reducing ADHD symptoms is non-invasive brain&#xD;
           stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a form of&#xD;
           non-invasive brain stimulation which involves the application of a magnetic field to the&#xD;
           skull to change the behaviour and function of underlying brain areas. In turn, rTMS&#xD;
           leads to positive long-term changes in neurochemical activity, and while studies are&#xD;
           limited, some have shown that rTMS can reduce ADHD symptoms in adolescents with ADHD. In&#xD;
           two separate neuroimaging studies, our team has shown that cortical thickness of the&#xD;
           right superior frontal gyrus (r-SFG) is different in children with ADHD compared to&#xD;
           those without (unpublished). Intriguingly, thinner r-SFG was associated with increased&#xD;
           inattention and hyperactive behaviour, as measured by the Conners-3 Parent Rating Scale.&#xD;
           Another recent study, in adults with ADHD, showed that high frequency rTMS to the right&#xD;
           prefrontal cortex (which shares cortical space with the r-SFG) reduced ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
           Moreover, studies have shown hypoactivity of the right superior frontal gyrus in&#xD;
           individuals with ADHD. Therefore, in keeping with our findings, the primary aim of this&#xD;
           study is to use rTMS to stimulate the r-SFG in children and adolescents with ADHD,&#xD;
           hypothesizing that stimulating the r-SFG will lead to a reduction in ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
           Parts of the superior frontal gyrus are anatomically and functionally connected to the&#xD;
           cognitive control network. In line with this, cognitive control impairments are&#xD;
           prevalent in individuals with ADHD. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 4&#xD;
           weeks of active or sham (non-active) rTMS. Active and sham rTMS look and sound the same;&#xD;
           the difference is that sham rTMS has no magnetic field emitted from the TMS coil,&#xD;
           thereby acting as a placebo condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Question &amp; Objectives Furthermore, this study will examine brain chemistry&#xD;
           before and after rTMS treatment as we recently showed that children with ADHD have&#xD;
           decreased concentrations of glutamate in their right prefrontal cortex compared to&#xD;
           typically developing children. This previous study also showed that gamma-Aminobutyric&#xD;
           acid (GABA) concentrations in the supplementary motor area (part of the superior frontal&#xD;
           gyrus) were significantly higher in children with ADHD compared to typically developing&#xD;
           controls. Thus, as the secondary aim, we will examine the impact of rTMS on the&#xD;
           participant's neurobiology (i.e. brain chemistry (e.g. glutamate/GABA concentrations)).&#xD;
           Finally, most studies only investigate the effects of treatment on ADHD symptom severity&#xD;
           and do not look further at the effects on everyday functioning. The core symptoms of&#xD;
           ADHD (hyperactivity and inattentiveness) are biologically and functionally intertwined&#xD;
           with downstream effects on overall daily functioning including academic success and peer&#xD;
           relationships. Therefore, the third exploratory aim of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
           behavioural outcomes of rTMS on several aspects of cognitive functioning and academic&#xD;
           performance, and quality of life of children with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods Design: Sham-TMS controlled trial. (Sham rTMS vs Active rTMS) Primary Outcome:&#xD;
           To examine the effect of active rTMS over the right superior frontal gyrus on ADHD&#xD;
           symptoms, as measured by the Conners-3 Parent Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: To examine the impact of rTMS treatment on the neurobiology (glutamate&#xD;
      and GABA concentrations) of the right superior frontal gyrus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline Assessment (MRI Scan, assessment scales, neuropsychological testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. rTMS intervention: 5 x week for 4 weeks. Active repetitive TMS parameters will be&#xD;
           intensity 120% resting motor threshold (RMT), 40 pulses over 4 seconds (frequency 10Hz),&#xD;
           inter-trial interval of 26 seconds, 75 trains, 3000 pulses/session to the right superior&#xD;
           frontal gyrus, duration of 37.5 minutes per session. For sham rTMS, set-up, duration,&#xD;
           and sound (i.e. clicking sound) will be the same, but no magnetic field will be emitted&#xD;
           from the rTMS coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-intervention Assessment (MRI Scan, assessment scales, neuropsychological testing).&#xD;
