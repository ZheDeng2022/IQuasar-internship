  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this research study is to achieve a better understanding of the&#xD;
      rectal mucosal effects of feminizing hormones in people assigned male sex at birth and&#xD;
      currently taking feminizing hormones who have sex with men. Better understanding the rectal&#xD;
      mucosa in this population will allow for the optimization of current biomedical HIV&#xD;
      prevention interventions and enhance design of future interventions, including an effective&#xD;
      HIV vaccine. This study will recruit approximately 520 transgender women who have receptive&#xD;
      anal intercourse with men (TGWSM) and cis-gender men into one of two cohorts. Cohort 1 is a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study and Cohort 2 is a longitudinal study; enrollment into each cohort is&#xD;
      based on participant characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transgender women who have receptive anal intercourse with men (TGWSM; assigned male sex at&#xD;
      birth and taking/planning to take feminizing hormone therapy) are at high risk of HIV, and&#xD;
      many HIV infections occur due to exposure to the rectal mucosa. In this study, the&#xD;
      researchers will examine the biologic effects of feminizing hormone therapy on the mucosal&#xD;
      immune milieu of the rectum. A better understanding of rectal HIV transmission among TGWSM&#xD;
      will lead to the development of improved biomedical prevention interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, TGWSM have been grouped with men who have sex with men (MSM) in HIV prevention&#xD;
      studies due to presumed similar risks of rectal HIV exposure despite their unique&#xD;
      psychosocial, biologic, and prevention needs. From a biologic perspective, many TGWSM use&#xD;
      feminizing hormone therapy with uncertain rectal mucosal effects. The effects of endogenous&#xD;
      and exogenous hormones in the human and animal-model female genital tract has been described&#xD;
      with estrogen generally being seen as hindering HIV transmission and progesterone&#xD;
      facilitating transmission; however, few studies report effects on the rectal mucosa. In&#xD;
      addition, the intestinal mucosa is known to be steroidogenic, and colonic epithelial cells&#xD;
      express estrogen receptor β, suggesting that exogenous hormone therapy likely has an effect&#xD;
      on the rectal mucosa that could influence HIV transmission. For this project, the researchers&#xD;
      will build upon our successful translational mucosal immunology program with a highly&#xD;
      successful clinical research and retention infrastructure that was designed to understand&#xD;
      factors that may influence rectal HIV transmission and propose to examine the effects of&#xD;
      feminizing hormone therapy on the rectal mucosal resident cellular populations,&#xD;
      transcriptome, and microbiome in TGWSM. In the rectal mucosa, the researchers will compare&#xD;
      HIV target cell availability, the transcriptome, and microbiome in a cross-sectional cohort&#xD;
      of 1) TGWSM on using feminizing hormone therapy (n=300) and 2) cisgender MSM (n=150). The&#xD;
      researchers will also examine HIV target cell availability, the transcriptome, and microbiome&#xD;
      in a longitudinal study of TGWSM (n=70) before and after initiating feminizing hormone&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cohorts of HIV-negative TGWSM will be enrolled in this study. Cohort 1 will be a&#xD;
      cross-sectional study where the researchers will enroll 300 TGWSM who are on feminizing&#xD;
      hormone therapy and a control group of 150 sexually active cisgender men (assigned male sex&#xD;
      at birth and currently identify as male) who have sex with men. Individuals in Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      participate in study activities for up to 12 weeks. Cohort 2 is a longitudinal study where 70&#xD;
      TGWSM who are naïve to feminizing hormone therapy or have not taken feminizing hormone&#xD;
      therapy for &gt; 6 months and plan to initiate feminizing hormone therapy will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Individuals in Cohort 2 will participate in study activities for 18 months.&#xD;
