  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a sub-study of a 5-year study designed to investigate how antibody and T cell responses&#xD;
      following influenza vaccine compare among lung transplant patients, patients waiting for lung&#xD;
      transplantation, and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to investigate two different definitions of influenza vaccine&#xD;
      seroprotection at mid-season in lung transplant patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the significant risk of morbidity and mortality, it is critical and highly recommended&#xD;
      that lung transplant patients receive annual influenza immunizations that confer protection&#xD;
      throughout the influenza season. Previous studies have demonstrated that transplant&#xD;
      recipients and nonimmunocompromised populations display similar rates of seroprotection&#xD;
      between 3 and 5 weeks after influenza vaccination, despite the transplant population&#xD;
      achieving generally lower antibody concentrations. Two studies show influenza vaccine&#xD;
      antibody persistence at reasonable rates at 1 year, but not 2 years, after immunization.&#xD;
      However, there are no studies comparing seroprotection rates 6 months after vaccination,&#xD;
      reflecting adequate coverage throughout the entire influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seroprotection has traditionally been defined as an antibody concentration of at least 40&#xD;
      hemagglutination units (HAU) after vaccination, which is the criterion for influenza vaccine&#xD;
      licensure. This concentration of antibody provides protection from infection at a rate of&#xD;
      about 50% in typically healthy individuals. Protection from infection improves with higher&#xD;
      antibody concentrations. For this study, a HAU of at least 160 was selected as a more&#xD;
      conservative definition of seroprotection, where protection may reach up to 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that seroprotection, defined as 40 HAU or greater, will persist up to 6&#xD;
      months at high rates in lung transplant patients and that these rates will be comparable to&#xD;
      the rates in healthy individuals. As a secondary outcome, seroprotection rates are compared&#xD;
      when 160 HAU or greater was used to define seroprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza vaccine responses in lung transplant patients and healthy control subjects without&#xD;
      lung disease will be compared over the course of the 2008 to 2009 influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum collected from participants before immunization, 2 to 4 weeks after immunization&#xD;
      (postimmunization), and 6 months after immunization.&#xD;
