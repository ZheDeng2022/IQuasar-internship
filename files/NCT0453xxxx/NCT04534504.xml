  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among various bariatric procedures, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass&#xD;
      (RYGB) are the most frequently performed procedures worldwide. Though SG provides similar&#xD;
      weight loss effect to RYGB in short-term follow-up, its long-term and very long-term weight&#xD;
      loss effect was reported to be inferior to RYGB. Weight regain after SG remains the major&#xD;
      concern after 2-year follow-up due to gradual loss of appetite suppression and lack of&#xD;
      malabsorption function. SG plus procedures have been developed to strengthen the effect of SG&#xD;
      on diabetes control. It has been reported that SG plus jejunojejunal bypass (SG - JJB)&#xD;
      offered better weight loss than SG and similar weight loss to RYGB. The present study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of sleeve gastrectomy plus uncut jejunojejunal bypass (SG -&#xD;
      uncut JJB).&#xD;

&#xD;
      For SG-JJB procedure, after SG was finished, the jejunum was transected 20-cm distal to Treiz&#xD;
      ligament. After that, another 200-cm jejunum was measured and side-to-side jejunojejunal&#xD;
      anastomosis was made. The anastomotic and mesenteric defects were closed by hand suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For SG-uncut JJB procedure, the jejunum was not transected, only 200-cm jejunum 20-cm distal&#xD;
      to Treiz ligament was measured and side-to-side jejunojejunal anastomosis was made. And the&#xD;
      jejunum 3-5cm distal to the anastomosis was ligated with 10# suture.&#xD;
