  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a common cancer, associated with a high mortality rate. Pleural effusions are&#xD;
      common in lung cancer, developing in up to 40% of patients. Ascites is common in patients&#xD;
      with abdominal malignancies and can be the presenting feature in up to 50% of patients. There&#xD;
      is a need for new techniques to improve our diagnostic ability of cancer. FTIR technology&#xD;
      could enable a point-of-care test that would provide an initial diagnosis that may determine&#xD;
      a change in treatment at the time of the investigation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer accounts for 13% of all new cancer cases in the UK and is the third most common&#xD;
      cancer1. However, lung cancer has the highest mortality rate9, thought partly related to late&#xD;
      diagnosis. Pleural effusions develop in up to 40% of patients with lung cancer2, and can be&#xD;
      the first presenting sign. Current methods of analysing pleural fluid are based on using&#xD;
      Light's criteria to distinguish between exudates and transudates depending on the protein and&#xD;
      LDH component of the fluid. However, this system does not discriminate between causes of&#xD;
      exudative effusions for example malignant effusions vs infective causes. Pleural fluid&#xD;
      cytology can identify malignant effusions but gives an average yield of 60%3 through a labour&#xD;
      intensive and time consuming process. If pleural fluid cytology is non-diagnostic, patients&#xD;
      require further invasive investigations such as local anaesthetic thoracoscopy, lymph node&#xD;
      biopsies or image-guided biopsies to gain a tissue diagnosis. Therefore, determining an&#xD;
      alternative, accurate method of diagnosing cancer at the earliest opportunity would reduce&#xD;
      the need for further invasive investigations and would provide patients with increased&#xD;
      treatment options, thereby increasing survival rates. There are differences in the&#xD;
      biochemical composition of malignant and non-malignant effusions thereby offering an&#xD;
      opportunity to develop alternative techniques of investigating the cause of these&#xD;
      effusions10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascites is a common symptom of patients with various underlying cancers; most commonly breast&#xD;
      cancer, colon cancer, gastrointestinal cancer and ovarian cancer4,5 and is often associated&#xD;
      with significant morbidity. However, up to 50% of patients with malignant ascites present&#xD;
      with ascites as the first feature5. This symptom is not specific to any type of cancer;&#xD;
      current investigations including using serum tumour markers have a low diagnostic specificity&#xD;
      and there is a need for new techniques to improve our diagnostic ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a reproducible and relatively simple&#xD;
      investigation used to analyse the structural components of tissue or cells. As infrared light&#xD;
      is passed through a sample, some light is absorbed and some transmitted through. The&#xD;
      resulting signal at the detector presents as a spectrum, representing a 'molecular&#xD;
      fingerprint' of the sample. Each chemical structure produces a unique spectral fingerprint&#xD;
      making FTIR a useful tool for identifying components of tissue or cells6,7,8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attenuated Total Reflection Linear Variable Filter (ATR-LVF) spectroscopy is a variant of IR&#xD;
      spectroscopy in which samples can be examined directly with no preparation needed. ATR-LVF&#xD;
      spectroscopy can be performed on benchtop spectrometers with minimal operator training and an&#xD;
      immediate result can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both FTIR and ATR-LVF are non-invasive, reproducible, do not damage the sample and have the&#xD;
      benefit of only requiring a small sample size to generate results all of which are desirable&#xD;
      qualities in developing a new investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FTIR has been used to successfully discriminate between malignant and non-malignant lung&#xD;
      tissue6, and also to identify spectral differences in samples of pleural fluid from malignant&#xD;
      and non-malignant participants11. There is currently ongoing work investigating FTIR in&#xD;
      diagnosing malignant pleural mesothelioma and initial results have shown significant spectral&#xD;
      differences in this population too12. There is very little information regarding the use of&#xD;
      FTIR in assessing ascitic fluid. However, despite the technology, it is not available as a&#xD;
      bedside point-of-care test for clinicians. The differences and discrimination of the model&#xD;
      has not been tested prospectively to determine sensitivity and specificity of the FTIR test.&#xD;
      A mobile point-of-care devices that may be able to provide rapid diagnostic results. This&#xD;
      study aims to confirm that the spectral changes between malignant and non-malignant samples&#xD;
      are present in a UK population in both pleural effusions and ascites.&#xD;
