    <textblock>
      The surgical management of penetrating bowel and intestinal injuries, inflicted via a gunshot&#xD;
      or knife stabbing, has long been a topic of debate [1-3]. The surgical management principally&#xD;
      consists of: (i) primary repair; (ii) primary diversion or (iii) an initial abbreviated so&#xD;
      called &quot;damage control&quot; operation followed by a definitive surgical intervention once the&#xD;
      patient is stabilized [4-9] . Different classifications systems have been proposed to help&#xD;
      determine the best operative option [2,3,10-14], but intestinal injuries can be difficult to&#xD;
      manage and despite improvements in the diagnostics and treatment of penetrating abdominal&#xD;
      trauma, high mortality and morbidity rates are prevalent [15,16]. In order to determine the&#xD;
      correct surgical option an accurate determination of intestinal viability is essential. But&#xD;
      clinically assessing regional perfusion is challenging and surgeons' clinical risk assessment&#xD;
      of anastomotic leaks have shown a low predictive value [17]. Hence, there is a need for more&#xD;
      precise diagnostic tool helping the surgeon in assessing intestinal viability the extent of&#xD;
      intestinal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA) is an applied method for to&#xD;
      assessing visceral perfusion worldwide. The obtained fluorescent signal after intravenous&#xD;
      injection, is considered proportional to blood flow, thus aiding the surgeon to detect and&#xD;
      address inadequate regional perfusion, despite satisfactory macroscopic appearance,&#xD;
      intraoperatively [18-21]. Hence, the use of perioperative ICG-FA, has reduced the risk of&#xD;
      anastomotic leaks after esophageal and colorectal surgery [22-25] and in the setting of acute&#xD;
      mesenteric ischemia, significantly reduced the extent of intestinal resection [26]. In&#xD;
      retrospective review of 186 war related trauma cases the use of ICG-FA was deemed useful&#xD;
      however only 9 of these cases were truncal/abdomen/gastrointestinal and no objective&#xD;
      definition of usability was provided [27]. Hence, data on the usability and feasibility of&#xD;
      ICG-FA for in penetrating abdominal trauma is limited and to our knowledge has not been&#xD;
      investigate in a civilian population previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aimed to investigate the usability and feasibility of ICG-FA in patients&#xD;
      undergoing open abdominal exploration for penetrating abdominal trauma&#xD;

      The surgical management of penetrating bowel and intestinal injuries has been the topic of&#xD;
      debate since before the second world war [1-3]. The injury is most often inflicted via a&#xD;
      gunshot or knife stabbing. Different classifications systems have been proposed to help&#xD;
      determine the best operative option: (i) Flint Grading System (FGS); (ii) Penetrating&#xD;
      Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI); (iii) Colonic/Rectal Injury Scale (CIS/RIS); and (iv)&#xD;
      destructive/non-destructive colonic injuries; (v) Stone and Fabian's criteria [2,3,10-14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principally, a penetrating injury of the intestine can be managed by: (i) primary repair&#xD;
      (suturing the hole in the intestine); (ii) primary diversion (the intestine, above the&#xD;
      injury, is brought through the abdominal wall as a &quot;stoma&quot;) or (iii) an abbreviated primary&#xD;
      operation (laparotomy, where large bleeding is stopped and destroyed tissue is removed) and&#xD;
      planned reoperation, within 24-48 hours, for definitive treatment (final treatment, for&#xD;
      example reconnecting intestinal ends). The concept of abbreviated primary operation, also&#xD;
      known as &quot;damage control surgery&quot;, is today well established in trauma care [4-6]. A damage&#xD;
      control operation with regards to intestinal injury, entails a primary resection/removal of&#xD;
      the affected intestinal segment in which the remaining intestinal ends are closed off and not&#xD;
      surgically connected (anastomosed) in the first operation.[4-9]. The abdomen is left &quot;open&quot;&#xD;
      (the incision through the abdominal wall is not sutured closed but covered with a temporary&#xD;
      dressing), and a relaparotomy (re-operation) is conducted once the patient is stabilized (at&#xD;
      the end of which the abdominal wall is closed), usually after 24-48 h [4-9]. During the&#xD;
      re-laparotomy, the intestines will then either be anastomosed (re-connected), or a stoma will&#xD;
      be created if the intestine is deemed too damaged to be re-connected [4-9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-destructive colonic injuries (Flint grades 1 &amp; 2 and CIS grades I to III) are generally&#xD;
      treated with primary repair, which involves the identification, debridement and single-layer&#xD;
      suture repair of perforation and then dressing the repaired site with omentum (an&#xD;
      intra-abdominal layer of fat and vessels) [1,2,10,12]. Primary repair is generally considered&#xD;
      the better option in this setting [1-3,28].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Destructive colon wounds (Flint grade 3 or CIS grades IV and V) encompass those injuries that&#xD;
      require segmental resection (parts of the large intestine have to be removed) due to&#xD;
      extensive damage or loss of blood supply or both [10,12]. The management of destructive colon&#xD;
      wounds is less clear and is still debatable. However, primary repair has been deemed as a&#xD;
      safe option, while primary diversion has been opted for in particular cases [1-3,9,11,29-33].&#xD;
      In unstable patients; those with hypovolemic shock (large blood loss), blood-poisoning due to&#xD;
      intestinal content leaking into the abdominal cavity, systemic hypothermia (low body&#xD;
      temperature), and complex intra-abdominal injuries; an abbreviated laparotomy is considered&#xD;
      to be an appropriate course of action [7,11,30,32-34].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In colonic trauma, the anastomosis leak rate (the connection between to intestinal ends&#xD;
      breaks down) is reported between 4-27% [34-37]. A leak in the sight of intestinal connection&#xD;
      is a severe complication which greatly increases the length of hospitalization, increases&#xD;
      patient morbidity and has a significant negative impact on patient's recovery. The mortality&#xD;
      rate for an anastomotic leak around 10-15% [38,39]. Factors associated with anastomotic&#xD;
      failure include co-morbid immune-compromising disorders such as diabetes mellitus, acquired&#xD;
      immunodeficiency syndrome, cirrhosis and a transfusion requirement of more than six units of&#xD;
      blood [36]. Other potential risk factors appear to be shock, significant associated injuries,&#xD;
      and delay of operation [35,36].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In firearm injuries the tissue damage is proportionate to a variety of factors: Projectile&#xD;
      velocity, -entrance profile, -calibre, -design, distance travelled within the body&#xD;
      (penetrating projectiles deliver their total kinetic energy to the body, whereas perforating&#xD;
      projectiles transfer significantly less), biologic characteristics of the impacted tissue and&#xD;
      the mechanisms of tissue disruption (e.g. stretching, tearing, crushing) [40]. The extent of&#xD;
      damage in the tissue surrounding the entered organ can be difficult to assess, and despite&#xD;
      improvements in diagnostics and treatment of abdominal gunshot wounds, high mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity rates are still found [15,16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, intestinal injuries can be difficult to manage. A primary repair is preferable&#xD;
      but there is a need for more precise diagnostic tools helping the surgeon to access the&#xD;
      extent of intestinal injury. Also, reducing the extent of intestinal removal has a high value&#xD;
      for the patient as extensive resections can lead to nutritional difficulties even after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence guided surgery Assessing intestinal blood supply is a challenging task even for&#xD;
      experienced surgeons. One of the biggest concerns is the blood supply of the anastomosis (the&#xD;
      surgical connection between to intestinal ends) since poor blood supply is regarded as a&#xD;
      significant risk factor for anastomotic leak [41-44]. As mentioned above, an anastomotic leak&#xD;
      is a severe complication in gastrointestinal surgery and has a significant negative impact on&#xD;
      patients recovery with the mortality rate for an anastomotic leak around 10-15% [38,39].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) enables visualization of structures that are otherwise&#xD;
      hidden from the naked human eye. A fluorescent contrast agent is used, most often indocyanine&#xD;
      green (ICG), and by illuminating the tissue with near-infrared light, the excited ICG can be&#xD;
      detected by a camera with an optical filter. ICG is a tricarbocyanine dye with very few&#xD;
      adverse events, a short half-life, and exclusively metabolized in the liver and excreted&#xD;
      unchanged in the bile [45,46]. The safety of ICG well established and the contrast is used&#xD;
      routinely in surgical settings worldwide, just as it has gained popularity in oncological&#xD;
      surgery in recent years [45-47].&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG binds to plasma proteins in the blood after intravascular injection, and by illuminating&#xD;
      the tissue with near-infrared red light, the fluorescence intensity during the first passage&#xD;
      in tissue is considered proportional to blood flow (perfusion). This real-time visualization&#xD;
      of visceral perfusion (blood flowing to a given organ) may reduce the rate of anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage because inadequate vascularization can be detected during the operation [18-20].&#xD;
      Also, the option for intraoperative visual assessment of blood flow to the intestine, stomach&#xD;
      and surrounding tissues, allowing for modification to the surgical plan, may eliminate&#xD;
      anastomotic break down or leak due to inadequate vascularization despite satisfactory blood&#xD;
      supply on naked-eye appearance [20,21,48], (Figure 1).&#xD;

      combination of images A and B (&quot;overlay&quot;) allowing the surgeon to evaluate intestinal blood&#xD;
      supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective observational study on patients with a left-sided colorectal cancer, ICG&#xD;
      fluorescence angiogram (FA) altered operative decisions in 34.5% of the cases (n=111) i.e.&#xD;
      the site of resection was adapted after tissue perfusion evaluated with ICG FA. Also, the use&#xD;
      of ICG FA significantly reduced the anastomotic leak rate in patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer [49]. In patients undergoing esophagectomy, the use of ICG FA with&#xD;
      intervention was found to have a risk reduction for complications of 69% and a significantly&#xD;
      lowered risk of anatomic leaks [25].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ICG FA has been shown to improve patient outcome and reduce patients risks in&#xD;
      elective settings, however, there is much need for evaluation in the acute/emergency setting.&#xD;
      The risk of complications, patient morbidity and mortality are inherently higher in an&#xD;
      emergency surgical setting compared to an elective/planned setting [50]. Thus, it is feasible&#xD;
      to believe that the use of ICG FA in an emergency setting will improve patient outcome and&#xD;
      reduce risk of complications. There is to date little literature on the use of ICG FA in an&#xD;
      emergency/trauma setting. However, a recent retrospective study by Karampinis et al. 2018&#xD;
      deemed the use of ICG FA as a feasible and technically reliable technique in patients&#xD;
      undergoing emergency surgery for acute mesenteric ischemia. Indocyanine Green FA provided&#xD;
      additional information regarding intestinal perfusion in 18 of their 53 cases (35%). In 11&#xD;
      patients the surgical strategy was amended by ICG angiography, showing adequate perfusion,&#xD;
      and thus no indication for intestinal resection. No further resections were performed on&#xD;
      these patients during the second- and third- look laparotomies [26]. In March 2015, Green et&#xD;
      al. presented a retrospective review of all war-related traumatic and reconstructive cases&#xD;
      employing the intraoperative use of indocyanine green angiography within the US army over a&#xD;
      three year period [27]. They concluded that - Intraoperative fluorescent angiography is an&#xD;
      objective, useful tool to assess various war-related traumatic injuries [27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Surgical Gastroenterology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, have developed an ICG&#xD;
      quantification algorithm which has been validated and described earlier [51]. This algorithm&#xD;
      has now been incorporated into a touch screen tablet, allowing for live perioperative&#xD;
      quantitative perfusion assessments with ICG (Q-ICG). A color-coded map of perfusion intensity&#xD;
      is provided as an overlay on the white light visualized tissue (Figure 2). In a feasibility&#xD;
      study of ten patients undergoing surgery for stomach cancer, significant alterations of&#xD;
      optimal perfusion points selected by surgeons were found when comparing points selected in&#xD;
      white light, ICG FA and Q-ICG (Nerup, in review).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 2. The remaining stomach (gastric conduit) viewed by white light, Near-Infrared Light&#xD;
      (ICG FA) and with Q-ICG overlay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As ICG FA can assess micro-perfusion, we believe that it has the possibility to improve&#xD;
      intraoperative evaluation of tissue integrity and as such improve the surgical plan and&#xD;
      outcome in patients suffering gunshots to the abdominal viscera. We also believe that the&#xD;
      quantification tool provided by Rigshospitalet will further assist the surgical&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of perfusion assessment with traditional&#xD;
      visual, visual ICG FA and Q-ICG.&#xD;
