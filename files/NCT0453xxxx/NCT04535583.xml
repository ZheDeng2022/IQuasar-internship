  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing digital health&#xD;
      technology with opioid use disorder (OUD) patients as measured by a 12-week period of&#xD;
      continuous assessment using smartphone surveys and digital sensing. In addition, we will&#xD;
      examine the utility of 3 types of digital data (Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA);&#xD;
      Digital sensing; and social media data) in predicting OUD treatment retention and&#xD;
      buprenorphine medication adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study designed to (1) evaluate the feasibility and utility of&#xD;
      digital health technology in a Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) treatment&#xD;
      population, and (2) capitalize on the availability of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to&#xD;
      relate passive and active sensing data to treatment retention and medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are identified through EHR records, sent an invitational letter through&#xD;
      secure message, and then called to recruit and screen. Following verbal consent to screen,&#xD;
      research staff will perform a screening assessment over the phone/video to determine&#xD;
      preliminary study eligibility prior to scheduling the baseline phone/video appointments.&#xD;
      Following electronic signed informed consent, participants will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      interviewer administered Baseline assessment. In addition to the screening and baseline&#xD;
      assessments, the participants will be asked to wear a smartwatch and carry a smartphone&#xD;
      continuously for a period of 12 weeks. Smartphone and smartwatch data will be passively&#xD;
      collected. In addition, participants will be prompted to respond to questions through a&#xD;
      smartphone (i.e., Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)) 3 times daily for 12 weeks. In&#xD;
      addition to the EMA prompts, individuals will be asked to self-initiate EMAs if substance use&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 12-week active study phase, participants will be asked to complete a follow-up&#xD;
      phone/video appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EHR and medical claims data will be extracted 16 weeks after study completion (data will be&#xD;
      collected 12 months prior to EMA start through 12 weeks after EMA start).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who consent to the optional social media component, social media data will be&#xD;
      downloaded by the participant directly from the social media platform to a secure server&#xD;
      using a remote desktop at the beginning of the study and at the end of the study.&#xD;
