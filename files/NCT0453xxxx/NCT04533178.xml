      A clinical trial will be conducted comparing healing of a posterior lumbar vertebra stress&#xD;
      reaction in children treated either with cessation of sports activities for a period of six&#xD;
      weeks and wearing a soft spinal brace 16 hours per day or cessation of sports activities&#xD;
      only. Primary outcome is the change in stress reaction on MRI at 6 weeks compared to&#xD;
      pre-treatment MRI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A clinical trial will be conducted comparing healing of an acute posterior lumbar vertebra&#xD;
      stress reaction in children treated either with cessation of sports activities for a period&#xD;
      of six weeks and wearing a soft spinal brace 16 hours per day or cessation of sports&#xD;
      activities only. Inclusion criteria will be a child or an adolescent aged between 8 and 18&#xD;
      years with a posterior lumbar vertebra stress reaction uni- or bilaterally in one or more&#xD;
      lumbar vertebra. Bone marrow edema in the dorsal parts of the lumbar spine must be confirmed&#xD;
      in a recent (under 3 weeks) MRI examination. Exclusion criteria will be a fracture line&#xD;
      (spondylolysis), spondylolisthesis or other abnormalities on lumbar CT examination. Other&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are skeletal disorder or not consenting to be a patient in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      110 Patients/ participants are randomized into two groups. The first group of 55 patients is&#xD;
      treated with cessation of all sports activities and a soft spinal brace. The other group is&#xD;
      treated only with cessation of sports activities. Treatment in both groups is 6 weeks,&#xD;
      starting at doctor's appointment after all necessary examinations are complete. Minimum&#xD;
      follow-up will be 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the beginning of this study a blood plasma vitamin D values will be measured from all our&#xD;
      patients. Patients with D-vitamin values below 50 nmol/l will receive vitamin D prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral x-ray picture of the lumbar spine is taken with axial loading (standing) from all&#xD;
      study patients at the beginning and at the end (6 months) of the study. This enables to see&#xD;
      the possible change in sacral slope during the 6-month follow-up. The possible change will&#xD;
      then indicate a change in lumbar posture during this time. This is important to clarify&#xD;
      whether lumbar posture has a role in the etiology - and treatment - of lumbar vertebra stress&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to statistical power analysis a total of 110 patients - 55 in each group- will be&#xD;
      needed to provide evidence for the effectiveness or no effectiveness of a soft spinal brace&#xD;
      on the natural history of pars interarticularis stress reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the change in stress reaction on MRI at 6 weeks compared to pre-treatment&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SRS-24 - (Scoliosis Research Society) score at the beginning of the treatment and during&#xD;
           the six-month follow-up ( at 0, 6 weeks, 6 months appointments)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Back and lower extremity pain at the beginning of the treatment and during the six&#xD;
           months follow-up (pain drawing including VAS-score (Visual Analogue Pain Score) in&#xD;
           children under 16 years old, Oswestry disability index including VAS-score in patients&#xD;
           over 16 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relapse of symptoms during the six months follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vitamin D values at the beginning of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. &quot;Pain time table&quot; during the 6-week period of treatment - to clarify the moment of&#xD;
           ending of pain during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Change in sacral slope on lateral lumbar x-ray with axial loading during the 6 months of&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pain in one-legged back extension test at 0, 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up appointments&#xD;

This is to ensure adequate Vitamin D levels for all study subjects required for bone fracture healing.</description>
