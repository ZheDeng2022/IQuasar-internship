  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although alternative dosing strategies can improve antimicrobial exposure in critically ill&#xD;
      patients, the high PK variability in this population means that some may still receive&#xD;
      sub-optimal antibiotic exposure leading to unfavourable clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic drug management (TDM) guided dosing is the only safe and effective way to ensure&#xD;
      that all critically ill patients achieve therapeutic antimicrobial exposures and to minimise&#xD;
      the likelihood of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For experts, TDM should be a standard of care, in particular for β-lactams. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      because of the assay method for β-lactams and the need for bioanalytical experts, delays in&#xD;
      obtaining results frequently occurred. These barriers, combined with difficulties in the&#xD;
      interpretation of TDM results, need to be addressed in order to increase its routine&#xD;
      utilization. Consequently, study aiming at identify which subgroup of patients or infection&#xD;
      are more likely to benefit from TDM are urgently warranted This prospective observational&#xD;
      study aimed at evaluating target attainment of piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/TAZ) and cefepim&#xD;
      (CEF) with the use of a Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) in critically patients during the&#xD;
      routine care&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>to determine the percentage of patients who met the PK/PD targets at 24 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>PK/PD target was defined as follows:&#xD;
Concentration of piperacillin or cefepim between a lower and a upper limit:&#xD;
The lower limit was defined as estimated free concentration above 4 times the epidemiological cut-off value of suspected bacteria&#xD;
The upper limit was based on known limit of neurotoxicity, namely 35 and 160 mg/L for cefepim and piperacillin, respectively&#xD;
Consequently :&#xD;
for piperacillin : the PK/PD target is considered to be reach if the free concentration of PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM is between 32 and 160 mg/l&#xD;
for cefepim : the PK/PD target is considered to be reach if the free concentration of CEFEPIM is between 4 and 35 mg/l</description>

Consequently :&#xD;
for piperacillin : the PK/PD target is considered to be reach if the free concentration of PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM is above 32 mg/l&#xD;
for cefepim : the PK/PD target is considered to be reach if the free concentration of CEFEPIM is above 4 mg/l</description>
