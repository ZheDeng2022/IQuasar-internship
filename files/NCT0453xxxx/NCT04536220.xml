      EUS-FNA combined cytology detection is an important method for clinical diagnosis of squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. However, due to factors such as sampling method, smear making, staining&#xD;
      technique, lower levels of the pathologists and other factors, its diagnostic sensitivity is&#xD;
      still not very satisfactory. Poor diagnostic efficacy usually means another puncture, longer&#xD;
      hospital stay, more medications and a higher incidence of adverse events. Missed diagnosis&#xD;
      continuously directly delays the treatment time of the disease and seriously affects the&#xD;
      patient's prognosis. Therefore, how to use new technologies to improve the differential&#xD;
      diagnosis efficiency of benign and malignant pancreatic occupants is the key to improving the&#xD;
      prognosis of diabetic cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The portal vein blood comes from the venous tract, including the blood flowing from the&#xD;
      plasma to the liver. By collecting blood samples from the patient's portal vein, clinicians&#xD;
      can separate more information from the patient. Studies have shown that the portal vein blood&#xD;
      can be collected by ultrasound endoscopic puncture. This method is less traumatic, convenient&#xD;
      and safe, and more information about the retinal tissue can be obtained. It is an important&#xD;
      way to improve the efficiency of patient diagnosis. This study intends to use ultrasound&#xD;
      endoscopic puncture technology to obtain portal vein blood, and use big data and ctDNA,&#xD;
      metabolomics, exosomes and other different omics methods to screen the potential value of&#xD;
      volume-occupying benign and malignant differential diagnosis markers in portal vein blood.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will simultaneously be collected to evaluate the efficacy of these newly&#xD;
      developed markers.&#xD;
