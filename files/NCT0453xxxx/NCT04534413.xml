      Accessing nodules located in the most outer part of the lung is challenging. Tissue that will&#xD;
      be removed from the lung will be used to see if we can reach and see the nodule with a very&#xD;
      small camera. This camera that may reach in the smaller and outer airways is called a&#xD;
      composite optical fiberscope (COF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate insertion ability of the COF and visualization of&#xD;
      the lung tumor by the COF. In order to do so, we plan to evaluate 50 patient samples from the&#xD;
      University Health Network over the span of 2 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs), which include pulmonary nodules and masses, are a common&#xD;
      problem in pulmonology practice. The incidence of PPLs will likely increase given the growing&#xD;
      adoption of chest CT screening for lung cancer. There are several guidelines available for&#xD;
      management of PPLs. If bronchoscopy is selected as the method of diagnosis, conventional&#xD;
      bronchoscopy has been one platform used for decades to diagnose PPLs. However, conventional&#xD;
      bronchoscopic techniques have significant limitations and overall low diagnostic yield for&#xD;
      most PPLs. As a result, innovative bronchoscopic techniques and technologies have evolved&#xD;
      over the last decade to diagnose PPLs more accurately. However, accessing to PPLs located in&#xD;
      the most peripheral part is still challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a new method to diagnose and localize cancers, photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) has been&#xD;
      gaining attention. PDD is a new technique where a photosensitizer injected intravenously&#xD;
      accumulates in the abnormal lesion, then its fluorescence can be detected by a detector. To&#xD;
      conduct PDD for PPLs, we collaboratively developed a parallel-type composite optical&#xD;
      fiberscope (COF) with an outer tip diameter of 0.97 mm with OK Fiber Technology (Kyoto,&#xD;
      Japan). Its small size and flexibility of the tip enable it to be inserted into animal&#xD;
      ultrasmall airways. The outer membrane of the fiberscope is made from polytetrafluoroethylene&#xD;
      in the COF's insertable section and is hydrophilic coated, which reduces frictional forces&#xD;
      when in the contact with the bronchial wall resulting in smooth insertion of the fiberscope.&#xD;
      As the COF has illumination fibers and a laser fiber inside, simultaneous white-light and&#xD;
      fluorescence imaging with real-time monitoring can be performed to confirm the tip position&#xD;
      of the fiberscope during laser irradiation. In this study, we want to evaluate the COF&#xD;
      regarding the quality of white-light images and the accessibility of lung tumors located in&#xD;
      the peripheral area of the lung.&#xD;
