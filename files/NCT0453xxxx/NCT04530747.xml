  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if metformin improves metabolism in patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Metformin is&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      diabetes. It is not approved for use in patients with OSA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positive airway pressure (PAP) is standard therapy for OSA, but has shown mixed results for&#xD;
      improvement of insulin sensitivity, and does not reduce CV events and mortality, even in&#xD;
      patients with established CV disease. Hence, eliminating IH alone with standard PAP therapy&#xD;
      may not be sufficient to restore metabolism. Additional adjunct strategies (such as&#xD;
      metformin) known to improve metabolism may be required to reduce metabolic burden and CV risk&#xD;
      in OSA patients. The aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal changes in metabolism&#xD;
      of OSA patients receiving both PAP and metformin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MET-OSA study will last about 4 months. After screening the participants to determine&#xD;
      eligibility, baseline study measures will be obtained and the participants will be provided&#xD;
      with standard PAP for OSA treatment. Participants will also be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      placebo or metformin treatment for 3 months. Compliance to study drug will be determined&#xD;
      during monthly follow-up visits. Final study visit will include assessment of all baseline&#xD;
      study measures.&#xD;
