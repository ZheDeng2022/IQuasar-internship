  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of inspiratory muscle training(IMT) in patients with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease(COPD) were reported.But in severe COPD patients, benefit from IMT may be&#xD;
      limited.There is need for further research in new and complementary modalities to improve IMT&#xD;
      efficiency in severe COPD patients.Manual therapy(MT) additional over IMT may be such a new&#xD;
      approach that has not yet been investigated in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To investigate effects of MT additional over IMT on functional capacity,respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength,pulmonary function,dyspnea, fatigue and quality of life in severe COPD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: It was a prospective single-blind randomized trial. 40 patients with COPD in Global&#xD;
      Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease(GOLD) stage III-IV were included. Patients&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to receive either MT additional over IMT at 40% of maximal inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure(MIP)(n= 20) or only IMT(n= 20) for 12 weeks. MT group received MT during 12 weeks&#xD;
      for 40 minutes additional to IMT. Pulmonary function using spirometry, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength using mouth pressure device, functional capacity using six minute walk test, dyspnea&#xD;
      using Modified Medical Research Council(MMRC) dyspnea scale, fatigue using fatigue severity&#xD;
      scale and quality of life using St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire(SGRQ) were evaluated.&#xD;

    <measure>Pulmonary Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Before the pulmonary function test, all subjects rested to avoid fatigue. The lung function test including forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and vital capacity (VC) was performed in a seated position using a portable spirometer according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For respiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were evaluated using an electronic pressure transducer. MIP was measured at residual volume, and MEP was measured from total lung capacity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>6 minute walk test (6MWT) was applied to measure exercise capacity. The patient's heart rate, breathing frequency, and oxygen saturation were monitored with the pulse oximeter, and the values were recorded before and after the test. The distance was expressed both as metres.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea perception</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea perception was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale, Levels of dyspnea are graded 0 (absence of dyspnea during strenuous exercise), to 4 (dyspnea during daily activities).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue perception</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue perception was assessed with Turkish version of Fatigue Severity Scale. A high score indicates increased fatigue intensity and the maximum score of the scale is 63.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>St.George Respiratory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was measured using the Turkish version of St.George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). It is a specific quality of life questionnaire for respiratory diseases. SGRQ consists of three subscale and 50 items; symptoms (8 items), activities (16 items), effects of the disease (26 items). Each subscale is scored ranging from 0 to 100 points. High scores indicate that worsened the quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants receive manual therapy protocol session three times a week for 12 weeks. The manual therapy protocol session lasts 30 minutes and included of the following manual therapy techniques: suboccipital decompression, gliding of the cervical vertebral articulations in the anterior/posterior direction, myofascial release of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, gliding of sternoclavicular joint in the anterior/posterior direction, myofascial release of intercostal muscles and paravertebral muscles, diaphragmatic release, rib raising, mobilization of scapulothoracic joint, and gliding of the thoracic vertebral articulations in the anterior/posterior direction. And all participants receive inspiratory muscle training.</description>
