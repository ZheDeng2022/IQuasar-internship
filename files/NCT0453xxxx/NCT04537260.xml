  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have created a brief, 3-minute video that discusses the induction of labor&#xD;
      process. The aim of this study is to evaluate, via a randomized method, how this educational&#xD;
      video impact's patients' knowledge and satisfaction with the induction of labor process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: Evaluate how an educational video impacts patients' knowledge and satisfaction with&#xD;
      the induction of labor process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does a brief educational video improve patients' baseline knowledge of the induction of&#xD;
           labor process when compared to patients' who receive traditional care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does a brief educational video improve patients' overall satisfaction with their&#xD;
           delivery course when compared to patients' who received the standard care? Hypothesis:&#xD;
           Those patients' shown a brief educational video will have a higher baseline knowledge&#xD;
           about the induction process and higher satisfaction with their delivery course compared&#xD;
           to patients who received the standard in-office counseling.&#xD;

      Recruitment and Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were screened for study enrollment during routine prenatal visits at the George&#xD;
      Washington University Hospital. A trained research team member met with and spoke to eligible&#xD;
      patients about the randomized study at the time of their scheduled induction of labor visit.&#xD;
      There was an induction of labor schedule that is created monthly, which the research team&#xD;
      members had access to and determined when eligible participants had their induction of labor&#xD;
      visit scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent was obtained from the patient if they were interested in participating.&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality were assured as approved team members were the only individuals&#xD;
      with access to patient records and maintained strict confidentiality. All consent forms were&#xD;
      kept in a locked cabinet and survey responses were de-identified. Patients were able to ask&#xD;
      questions and/or opt out of the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team member assessed patient's understanding of the information and&#xD;
      participation by asking them to describe in their own words what they were consenting to.&#xD;
      Signed informed consent were obtained prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient was enrolled, they were randomized to the control group (no intervention) or&#xD;
      the intervention group (3-minute educational video intervention). The randomization schedule&#xD;
      was predetermined. The enrolled participant was given a pre-randomized study envelope that&#xD;
      contained a unique Study ID number, randomization group, and paper surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group took the knowledge-based survey. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after&#xD;
      delivery, at a time convenient to the participant during the postpartum stay at GW, a&#xD;
      research team member asked the participant to fill out a second survey, focused on&#xD;
      satisfaction with the labor and delivery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group had the opportunity to watch the 3-minute educational video. The video&#xD;
      shown to these participants is linked here: https://youtu.be/Pc9tcIV4Dm8. After watching the&#xD;
      video, the participant was asked to take the knowledge-based survey. Twenty-four to&#xD;
      forty-eight hours after delivery, at a time convenient to the participant during the&#xD;
      postpartum stay at GW, a research team member asked the participant to fill out a second&#xD;
      survey, focused on satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient ultimately chose not to participate in the study following the signing of&#xD;
      informed consent, all their data was destroyed. All of the surveys were stored in a locked&#xD;
      cabinet, secured. No one but the research team members had access to the collected data and&#xD;
      none of the stored paper copies had any identifying information. The basic demographic&#xD;
      information, as well as the outcome of the induction of labor process, was collected using&#xD;
      the hospital's electronic medical record. Some of the information (race and ethnicity) was&#xD;
      collected by self-report. Emails were obtained by self-report on a voluntary basis. They were&#xD;
      only collected if patients wished to be entered into the raffle for the Amazon gift card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At minimum, the goal was an n= of 106 total, 53 per arm. This was powered based on an alpha&#xD;
      of 0.05, 80% power, 10% attrition rate to accurately detect a 20% difference given 96%&#xD;
      correct in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment and completion of study surveys, a member of the research team entered in&#xD;
      all of the information collected into a de-identified Redcap database using the unique Study&#xD;
      ID numbers. The research team also collected data from the patient's electronic medical&#xD;
      record about the enrolled participant's induction of labor process, including gravity,&#xD;
      parity, pregnancy complications, induction agents utilized, and delivery method (vaginal vs&#xD;
      cesarean delivery). All of this data was entered into the de-identified Redcap database.&#xD;
      Access to the participant's medical record was only available to the research team through&#xD;
      the MFA's HIPAA compliant, password protected, firewalled electronic medical record&#xD;
      (Allscripts) and GW hospitals' EMR (Cerner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the data was entered into Redcap, a second and different member of the research team&#xD;
      re-checked the entry to ensure the answers were correctly captured into the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used specific methods to address our hypothesis: Those patients' shown a&#xD;
      brief educational video will have a higher baseline knowledge about the induction process and&#xD;
      higher satisfaction with their delivery course compared to patients who received the standard&#xD;
      in-office counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does a brief educational video improve patients' baseline knowledge of the induction of&#xD;
           labor process when compared to patients' who receive the traditional care?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators used mean, standard deviation, and analysis via Mann-Whitney U tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does a brief educational video improve patients' overall satisfaction with their&#xD;
           delivery course when compared to patients' who received the standard care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used mean, standard deviation, and analysis via Mann-Whitney U, Chi-Square,&#xD;
      and Fisher's exact tests.&#xD;
