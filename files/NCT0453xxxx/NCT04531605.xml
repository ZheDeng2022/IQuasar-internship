  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV has now become the leading cause of death amongst adolescents in Africa with over 2.1&#xD;
      million adolescents (aged 10-19 years old) living with HIV today. Poor adherence to&#xD;
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) leads to suppressed immune function, treatment failure,&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality with significant costs to households and health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to undertake a feasibility study of an intervention targeting&#xD;
      adolescents living with HIV in Rwanda built on two components.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Life-skills training: Adolescents receive training on economic empowerment, financial&#xD;
           literacy, healthy relationships and adherence during the peer group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Financial incentives: Combined short-term and long-term incentives for clinic attendance&#xD;
           and suppressed viral load that will be delivered through mobile banking.&#xD;

      HIV has now become the leading cause of death amongst adolescents in Africa with over 2.1&#xD;
      million adolescents (aged 10-19 years old) living with HIV today. Increased mortality amongst&#xD;
      HIV-infected adolescents is primarily caused by poor adherence to anti-retroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART). Adherence to ART is critical to suppress HIV viral load, sustain immune function, and&#xD;
      avoid opportunistic infections and death. Poor adherence leads to suppressed immune function,&#xD;
      treatment failure, increased morbidity and mortality with significant costs to households and&#xD;
      health systems. In our clinic population in Rwanda, 29% of 12-19 years olds have a&#xD;
      non-suppressed viral load due to poor adherence. These findings have been reflected in&#xD;
      studies throughout the US, Europe and sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence base for effective adherence interventions that successfully address the&#xD;
      multiple barriers to adherence is very limited. Conditional cash transfers have shown promise&#xD;
      as a potential strategy. The investigators aim to undertake a feasibility study of an&#xD;
      intervention targeting adolescents living with HIV in Rwanda built on two components.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Life-skills training: Adolescents receive training on economic empowerment, financial&#xD;
           literacy, healthy relationships and adherence during the peer group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Financial incentives: Combined short-term and long-term incentives for clinic attendance&#xD;
           and suppressed viral load that will be delivered through mobile banking. On admission to&#xD;
           the program adolescents are provided with a bank account. The rewards delivered to the&#xD;
           adolescent are divided into a long-term and short term component. The long-term&#xD;
           incentive accrues and can only be accessed on graduation from the program. The&#xD;
           short-term component can be accessed immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this preliminary study is not to assess for efficacy of the intervention&#xD;
      (virological suppression and clinic attendance). This preliminary study aims to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of the program and data collection strategy in preparation for a large scale&#xD;
      multi-center evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with adolescents, caregivers and two health workers randomly selected from each site during and directly following the 12-week intervention period. Themes to be explored in the interviews include experiences with receiving incentives and attending trainings, the impact of the intervention on caregivers and adolescents, and how the incentives will be spent. Face-to-face interviews will be conducted in Kinyarwanda or French by trained interviewers.</description>

    <description>12-week program of combined life-skills training and financial incentives (YBank program) described in more detail below.&#xD;
Life-skills training: Every 4 weeks through the 12 week program, life-skills training sessions will be delivered during peer-group sessions at the clinic. Topics include economic empowerment, financial literacy, healthy relationships, and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence.&#xD;
Financial incentives: The incentives program combines an immediate financial reward with a long-term savings opportunity. For clinic attendance, 500 RWF (~$0.50) will be deposited into participants' mobile money short-term account, where funds will be immediately accessible, and 1500 RWF (~$1.50) will be deposited into their savings account upon completing the program. If participants demonstrate a suppressed viral load at a clinic appointment, an additional 1000 RWF (~$1) will be deposited to their short-term account and 3000 RWF (~$3) into their saving account.</description>
