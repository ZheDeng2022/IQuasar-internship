  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a structured exercise program on&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain of patients in face-down posture after retinal surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study, patients who are planning to get vitrectomy for macular&#xD;
      hole or retinal detachment are going to be randomly assigned into two groups; exercise group&#xD;
      and control group. All patients are going be admitted to the hospital prior to the surgery.&#xD;
      After the surgery is done, the patients are going to maintain a face-down position in the&#xD;
      ward until postoperative day 3. After returning to the ward after surgery and completed the&#xD;
      pain scoring forms, exercise training is going to be conducted for patients assigned to the&#xD;
      exercise group by a physical therapist. Three times of daily self-exercise sessions are going&#xD;
      to be performed according to the training provided to the patients. Pain score will be&#xD;
      measured on the first, second and the third postoperative days. Patients will be discharged&#xD;
      on the third postoperative days.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the interventions participants and researchers cannot be blinded to group allocation. The treating healthcare professionals (i.e. the Research Nurse and Clinical Research Fellow) will also not be masked due to nature of the service. The surgeon will be masked to allocation. The data manager and trial statistician will be masked to allocation throughout the study.</masking_description>

    <description>Exercise training will be conducted by a physical therapist which will take about 10 to 15 minutes. Patient education will include how to keep face down in various postures, and how to actively exercise the related muscles and joints while maintaining face-down posture through video clip and brochure. Patients will go through three times of self-exercise sessions everyday according to the training provided to the patients. Active exercise for the FDP patients will include exercise in a hands and knees position, limb exercise in an FDP, and exercise in a standing position. The exercises were performed within the range of individual muscle strength and fitness.</description>
