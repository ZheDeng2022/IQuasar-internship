      Third in-human study for the AtaCor Extravascular (EV) Temporary Pacing Lead System to&#xD;
      collect initial safety and performance data for the latest AtaCor System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to generate safety and performance data of the latest AtaCor EV&#xD;
      Temporary Pacing Lead System 1) to support the development a future pivotal study with an&#xD;
      indication limited to a maximum of 7 days, and 2) to obtain early clinical data for future&#xD;
      research related to longer-term use.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The original intent of the study was to evaluate 3 StealthTrac Leads (Models AC-1010,&#xD;
      AC-1020, and AC-1030) to support the development of a future pivotal study. In the most&#xD;
      recent revision of the study, an additional fourth StealthTrac Lead (Model AC-1021) will be&#xD;
      evaluated to support use in a larger pivotal study. Additionally, the length of time for lead&#xD;
      retention was increased from 7 to 14 days for the purpose of gathering preliminary&#xD;
      performance data on longer-term use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a feasibility study serving dual purposes: 1) to generate developmental&#xD;
      clinical data in support of a subsequent pivotal clinical study and marketing application for&#xD;
      temporary pacing (in patients that retain the lead for a maximum of 7 days); and 2) to obtain&#xD;
      early data for future research related to longer-term use (in patients that retain the lead&#xD;
      for a maximum of 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are assigned non-randomly to receive one of the 4 StealthTrac Leads. Following Study&#xD;
      Lead insertion (Day 0), Subjects must remain in the hospital at least through Day 2. Subjects&#xD;
      provided with wound care instructions may be discharged with a non-active Study Lead on or&#xD;
      after Day 2. Subjects must return to the Site for a follow-up visit no longer than 3 days&#xD;
      after discharged or last follow-up. Study Leads must be removed no later than 14 days after&#xD;
      insertion. Subjects must complete the last follow-up within 27-33 days after the Study Lead&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum follow-up duration specified by this protocol is initially 7 days. This maximum&#xD;
      follow-up duration will transition to 14 days after a minimum of 8 subjects across at least 3&#xD;
      sites have been enrolled with the Model AC-1021 StealthTrac Lead. The Sponsor shall notify&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator at all participating sites in writing when the maximum follow-up&#xD;
      period has transitioned to 14 days. Prior to receiving this written notification, Subjects'&#xD;
      participation is limited to 7 days with the Study Lead. After receiving this written&#xD;
      notification, Subjects may choose to participate for a maximum of 14 days with the Study&#xD;
      Lead. The transition of the maximum follow-up duration from 7 to 14 days and the transition&#xD;
      condition shall be included in the consent information provided to all Subjects.&#xD;
