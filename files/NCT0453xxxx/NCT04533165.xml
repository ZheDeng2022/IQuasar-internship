  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to establish the feasibility and initial effectiveness&#xD;
      of a novel exercise program for rural cancer survivors in Colorado suffering from cancer&#xD;
      related fatigue. Participation in an exercise program has regularly been shown to reduce&#xD;
      fatigue in cancer survivors, though in-person, supervised participation has a greater effect&#xD;
      on fatigue than home-based programs with no supervision. Access to these supervised programs&#xD;
      are limited in rural areas, restricting the ability of rural cancer survivors to experience&#xD;
      the fatigue-reducing benefits of exercise. The proposed program will use information on&#xD;
      improvements in fatigue from participants in the BfitBwell Cancer Exercise Program to monitor&#xD;
      improvements in fatigue in rural cancer survivors performing a home exercise program and&#xD;
      trigger a telehealth session with a cancer exercise specialist to adapt the exercise&#xD;
      prescription when improvements are less than expected. The BfitBwell Program is an&#xD;
      established exercise program at the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center which has worked with&#xD;
      over 600 cancer survivors and is highly effective at reducing cancer related fatigue. The&#xD;
      goal of the program is to replicate the effects of a successful supervised exercise program&#xD;
      in rural cancer survivors who do not have access to this type of program. This investigation&#xD;
      will recruit 20 rural cancer survivors experiencing fatigue and assess their ability to&#xD;
      participate in the program, as well as how well the program improves their fatigue.&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted with participants after the program to determine how future&#xD;
      versions of the program could be improved. The investigators anticipate that this program&#xD;
      will be feasible and effective, providing preliminary data to pursue a large-scale clinical&#xD;
      trial of the program following this project's completion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed exercise program utilizes a novel reference chart system to monitor&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and trigger necessary interventions. This reference chart has&#xD;
      been developed from CRF data collected in 173 cancer survivors participating in the BfitBwell&#xD;
      Program, a highly effective supervised exercise program pioneered at the University of&#xD;
      Colorado. The reference chart estimates the continuous trajectory of fatigue improvement&#xD;
      during the three-month program. The focus of this study is to extend the benefits of an&#xD;
      effective, supervised exercise program to rural Coloradoans via a home exercise program&#xD;
      supported by CRF monitoring and symptom-triggered telehealth sessions. Deviations from&#xD;
      estimated improvements in CRF will trigger telehealth sessions with a cancer exercise&#xD;
      specialist (CES) to adapt the exercise prescription, in real time, as in a supervised&#xD;
      program. The intent is to replicate the effects of a supervised exercise program in cancer&#xD;
      survivors in rural areas without access to such programs. The feasibility, effectiveness, and&#xD;
      design of the program will be assessed with two specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the proposed exercise&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1a: Assess the enrollment rate of patients able and willing to participate in the&#xD;
      program and the adherence of patients enrolled in the program to their prescribed exercise,&#xD;
      CRF monitoring, and telehealth session participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1b: Assess the effect of the proposed program on CRF improvements in enrolled&#xD;
      participants and compare this effect to that of the supervised BfitBwell exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective 1: Assess the feasibility of the semi-continuous remote monitoring of&#xD;
      fatigue (ecological momentary assessment) to better tailor the program to more acute changes&#xD;
      in CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess participant perspectives of barriers and facilitators to participation in the&#xD;
      prescribed exercise and CRF monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Gather qualitative data on barriers and facilitators to participation from all&#xD;
      participants enrolling in the program using semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an innovative program, being the first exercise intervention to implement real time&#xD;
      adaptations for rural patients, with decisions anchored against a novel symptom monitoring&#xD;
      system. Qualitative data will be collected to improve the next iteration of the program and&#xD;
      to inform a future, large-scale clinical trial of program implementation in rural&#xD;
      populations. The long-term goal is to develop a feasible and effective exercise program for&#xD;
      rural cancer survivors which replicates the benefits of supervised exercise programs to which&#xD;
      access may be restricted in rural settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-arm pilot intervention trial. It will collect objective data on&#xD;
      the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention, as well as qualitative data to inform&#xD;
      how the intervention could be improved in future iterations. The exploratory aim will collect&#xD;
      data on &quot;in-the-moment&quot; fatigue that could also inform novel future versions of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will recruit adult cancer survivors treated at the University of Colorado&#xD;
      Cancer Center (aged 18 years and over) who live in rural Colorado, have completed cancer&#xD;
      treatment, and report moderate-to-severe CRF (&gt; 3 on a 0-10 scale, per NCCN definition).&#xD;
      Cancer type will be limited to the three types with the highest anticipated new cases in&#xD;
      Colorado in 2020: breast, prostate, and lung. Only survivors who have completed medical&#xD;
      treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiation), with curative intent, within the past 12 months,&#xD;
      and have no additional treatment planned for the next four months, will be recruited. Rural&#xD;
      participants will be defined as those who have greater than a 1-hour commute to the major&#xD;
      front range cities (Denver, Fort Collins, and Colorado Springs). Participants must have home&#xD;
      internet access and smartphones to allow participation in telehealth sessions and remote&#xD;
      monitoring of exercise participation and fatigue. Participants with medical conditions that&#xD;
      would impact the safety of, or participation in, an exercise program will be excluded. Twenty&#xD;
      participants will be recruited in one year, with the goal of retaining at least 15 through&#xD;
      the final assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete assessments (baseline and final) and exercise sessions virtually.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -&#xD;
      Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) scale. Other assessment items will include measures of physical&#xD;
      fitness and function. CRF will be assessed by questionnaires every two weeks, and&#xD;
      semi-continuously with a smartphone application. The exercise program is 12 weeks long, and&#xD;
      includes 2 mandatory virtual exercise sessions, and up to 5 triggered virtual exercise&#xD;
      sessions. Participants will be mailed equipment to complete the study upon enrollment.&#xD;
