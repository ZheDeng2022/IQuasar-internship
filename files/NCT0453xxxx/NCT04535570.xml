  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment before bone marrow transplantantion is initiated by chemotherapy associated or&#xD;
      not with radiotherapy, both of which cause various side effects on the patient as symptoms&#xD;
      that impair food intake. The nutritional status of the patient is one of the factors related&#xD;
      to the success of the transplant, so a complete nutritional assessment before transplantation&#xD;
      is necessary in order to identify patients at nutritional risk, nutritional disorders and to&#xD;
      perform appropriate and early intervention to promote recovery and / or health maintenance.&#xD;
      Will be used for nutritional assessment: arm perimeter, arm muscle area; electrical&#xD;
      bioimpedance, phase angle, and Indirect Calorimetry, a standard method of noninvasive&#xD;
      nutritional assessment that expresses the nutritional demand and rate of utilization of&#xD;
      energy substrates from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production through the air&#xD;
      inhaled and exhaled by the individual's lungs.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after protocol termination</time_frame>
    <description>The energy expenditure will be analyzed by the volume of oxygen (VO2) consumed, the volume of carbon dioxide (VCO2) produced and the respiratory quotient (VO2 / VCO2). The values analyzed will be the results of the measures of energy expenditure (BMR) before and after the transplant, in calories (Kcal), to verify changes caused by chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutritional status of patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after protocol termination</time_frame>
    <description>We'll use ASG for this parameter. Patients will have nutritional status classified as malnourished, nourished or overweight, in the periods before and after transplantation to verify changes caused by chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caloric and protein adequacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after protocol termination</time_frame>
    <description>The caloric and protein adequacy will be analyzed by the amount of calorie (kcal / kg / day) and protein (g / kg / day) intake, compared to calorie and protein required before and after transplantation, to verify changes caused by chemotherapy and / or radiation therapy.The caloric and protein adequacy will be presented with g/kg/day (protein) or kcal/kg/day (calories)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after protocol termination</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will have the following outcomes:&#xD;
constipation or diarrhea - Bristol stool scale pontuation (7 points scale)&#xD;
mucositis (grade I-IV) - Dentistry report with grade of mucositis in grade I,II,III or IV&#xD;
graft versus host disease (grade I-IV) - Medical report with grade of GVHD in grade I, II, III or IV&#xD;
presence of Cytomegalovirus infection - Blood test Positive or Negative&#xD;
colonization of Clostridium difficile - Feces Test Positive or Negative&#xD;
infection by Candida - Laboratory test positive or negative&#xD;
another diagnosis of infection - Medical report/ Yes or no for presence of this complication&#xD;
presence of febrile neutropenia - Medical report / Yes or no for presence of this complication&#xD;
length of hospital stay - number of complete days of hospitalization&#xD;
death during the hospital stay - number of death during hospitalization</description>
