  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by early vascular&#xD;
      endothelial involvement. SSc is a rare and devastating multi-visceral disease when fibrotic&#xD;
      lesions extend to the skin and other tissues (heart, lungs, kidneys). The severity of skin&#xD;
      involvement in SSc is correlated with functional prognosis and survival. To date, there is no&#xD;
      validated tool for a reliable quantitative assessment of skin fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an innovative non-invasive skin imaging technique that&#xD;
      allows micrometric analysis of the superficial layers of the skin. Previous study showed that&#xD;
      OCT could detect the loss of the dermal-epidermal junction in an objective and non-invasive&#xD;
      way, which is correlated with severity of skin fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of OCTISS study is to evaluate the skin involvement of patients with early SSc using&#xD;
      OCT imaging. This will be early diagnosis of fibrosis lesions and help identify patients at&#xD;
      an early stage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disorder. It is characterized by fibrosis and&#xD;
      vascular obliteration in the skin and other organs. Skin damage, manifested by thickening of&#xD;
      the skin tissue, is often one of the first signs of the disease. Pathogenesis is dominated by&#xD;
      early microvascular changes targeting endothelial cells and with the release of several&#xD;
      mediators promoting an inflammatory response and vascular remodeling. This inflammatory&#xD;
      cascade results in fibrosis lesions. Early diagnosis of fibrosing skin lesions is essential&#xD;
      in SSc since their severity is correlated with functional prognosis and survival. To date,&#xD;
      there is no validated tool to reliably quantify skin fibrosis. The semi-quantitative Modified&#xD;
      Rodnan score (mRSS), based on clinical assessment of skin thickening at 17 anatomical areas,&#xD;
      is widely used. The main limitation of this method is its inter-operator variability. The&#xD;
      histopathological analysis of the skin biopsy is interesting but invasive. The new&#xD;
      non-invasive and reproducible tools are needed to evaluate skin fibrosis for early diagnosis&#xD;
      of SSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an innovative imaging technique that uses a light wave&#xD;
      to capture 3D images of a material that scatters light. OCT allows real-time, direct and&#xD;
      high-resolution imaging of the morphology of the biological sample (such as skin) without&#xD;
      ionizing radiation. In SSc, the cutaneous fibrosis is characterized by a deregulated&#xD;
      production of the components of the extracellular matrix, in particular collagen. Previous&#xD;
      results showed that the dermal-epidermal junction could be observed in healthy subjects using&#xD;
      OCT. In patients with SSc and skin involvement, the visualization of this junction could be&#xD;
      reduced. The results suggest a possible correlation between the intensity of visualization of&#xD;
      the dermo-epidermal junction and the severity of cutaneous fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we would like to compare the skin involvement of the dorsal surface of a&#xD;
      finger between patients with early SSc and control subjects using non-invasive OCT imaging.&#xD;
      The study population meets the criteria for early SCS, with onset of disease less than 2&#xD;
      years and without clinically detectable skin involvement. In a second time, other imaging&#xD;
      techniques (HD ultrasound) or fluid silicone molding technique will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      progression of skin fibrosis or the morphological characteristics of the skin or vascular&#xD;
      network of the patient with early SSc. To complete the work, these parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated in other anatomical sites (outer and inner side of the forearm) or in another group&#xD;
      of patients (Established SSc patients with clinical cutaneous sclerosis) or at another&#xD;
      timepoint (M24). The hypothesis of this study is that OCT can be used to identify SSc&#xD;
      patients at a stage where the lesions are still early and reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, monocentric, comparative, open-label and longitudinal patient study&#xD;
      with duration of 36 months. The duration of the inclusion period will be 12 months. The&#xD;
      participation of each subject is from 1 hour (for group 2 and 3) to 24 months (for group 1).&#xD;
      We planned to include 60 patients in the Department of Rheumatology of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Strasbourg (20 patients from each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different measures in the study are not invasive. No specific biological sampling of the&#xD;
      study will be conducted. There will be no change for the treatment of patients either.&#xD;
