  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare pain scores during laceration repair with first suture placement using&#xD;
      standardized visual analog scale (VAS) between 2 different topical local anesthetic&#xD;
      application techniques for using LET gel. Specifically, the investigators are studying if&#xD;
      applying LET gel 3 times, spaced 10 minutes apart (triple LET) provides superior anesthesia&#xD;
      to one 30 minute application (single LET). Single LET is the current standard method of&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

      To compare pain scores during laceration repair with first suture placement using&#xD;
      standardized visual analog scale (VAS) between 2 different topical local anesthetic&#xD;
      application techniques for using LET gel. Specifically, the investigators are studying if&#xD;
      applying LET gel 3 times, spaced 10 minutes apart (triple LET) provides superior anesthesia&#xD;
      to one 30 minute application (single LET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare provider satisfaction scores using a Likert scale between the triple LET and&#xD;
           single LET application techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare parental satisfaction scores using a Likert scale between the triple LET and&#xD;
           single LET application techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the need for additional local anesthetic infiltration between the triple LET&#xD;
           and single LET application techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients are identified and consent is obtained, they will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      groups. One group will have LET gel applied to the laceration one time for a duration of 30&#xD;
      minutes. The other group will have LET gel applied 3 times, at 10 minute intervals. Between&#xD;
      applications, the excess gel on the surface of the skin will be gently wiped off, and a new&#xD;
      strip of LET gel will be applied. The laceration repair will proceed in a normal sterile&#xD;
      fashion, using standard irrigation and debridement techniques. Laceration repair will occur&#xD;
      within the 15 minutes following the 30 minute period of LET application to the wound. The&#xD;
      patient will be asked to rate his/her pain immediately after the first suture is placed or&#xD;
      attempted using the visual analogue scale (VAS, range 0-10). The decision to use any&#xD;
      additional anesthetic infiltration will be left to the performing provider. There will be 2&#xD;
      nurses involved in the study. One nurse will be the patient's primary nurse and will be&#xD;
      administering the LET gel (so will not be blinded, but will not be involved in data&#xD;
      collection). The other nurse will be obtaining the VAS immediately (Appendix 3) after the&#xD;
      first suture is placed, using a pre-prepared script (Appendix 3) and standardized technique.&#xD;
      The nurse or research assistant will also be blinded as to the method of LET gel application.&#xD;
      The provider performing the laceration repair will be blinded. The research assistant will&#xD;
      not be blinded and will coordinate all involved providers and nurses, will ensure correct&#xD;
      timing in LET gel administration, and laceration repair timing.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>The VAS to rate pain will be collected during laceration repair, immediately after the first suture placement or attempt. The VAS score is estimated to take up to 1 minute to collect. The VAS scale will be collected for each enrolled subject.</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) asks subjects to rate pain marking an X on a line between two ends: &quot;No pain&quot; (on the left) and &quot;Pain as bad as it could possibly be&quot; (on the right). The distance will be measured from &quot;No pain&quot; to the X placed by the subject. A higher measurement indicates more pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare provider satisfaction scores</measure>
    <time_frame>The provider satisfaction Likert scale will be collected immediately after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Likert scale will be used in 3 questions asking providers to rate their satisfaction, preference for Single LET application, and preference for Triple LET application. For the satisfaction question, the likert scale offers options from Dissatisfied to Extremely Satisfied, as well as Not Applicable. The preference for Single LET is a likert scale with options ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree, as well as a Not Applicable. The preference for Triple LET is a likert scale with options ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree, as well as a Not Applicable. It will take approximately 3 minutes to administer. This measure will be completed once for each enrollment prior to discharge from the Emergency Department.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare parental satisfaction scores</measure>
    <time_frame>The parental satisfaction Likert scale will be collected immediately after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Parent satisfaction will be measured using a single question as a Likert scale with options from Dissatisfied to Extremely Satisfied, as well as Not Applicable. It will take approximately 1-2 minutes to administer. This measure will be completed once for each enrollment prior to discharge from the Emergency Department.</description>
