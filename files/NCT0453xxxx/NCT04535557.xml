  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide expanded compassionate use access to mobocertinib, in&#xD;
      participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR in-frame exon 20&#xD;
      insertion mutations and who have received at least 1 prior line of therapy for locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called mobocertinib. Mobocertinib is being tested to&#xD;
      treat people who have NSCLC with EGFR exon-20 insertion mutations who have failed the current&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) have no approved treatment therapies. Participants will be treated&#xD;
      with mobocertinib until they experience progressive disease (PD) that requires an alternate&#xD;
      therapy in the opinion of the physician, intolerable toxicity, or another discontinuation&#xD;
      criterion. Treatment may be continued after PD if, in the opinion of the physician, the&#xD;
      participant continues to experience clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 100 participants. Enrollment will be based on unsolicited&#xD;
      participant requests. All participants will be assigned to receive-&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Mobocertinib 160 milligram (mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose interruptions or reductions (first dose reduction- 120 mg and second dose reduction- 80&#xD;
      mg) will be implemented for participants who experience treatment-related adverse events&#xD;
      (TEAEs), based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this expanded access study is 4 months. The follow-up period for survival&#xD;
      begins at the end of treatment (up to 30 days past last dose) and continues until participant&#xD;
      discontinues.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced (and not a candidate&#xD;
             for definitive therapy) or metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a documented EGFR in-frame exon 20 insertion mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. . Must have received at least 1 prior line of therapy for locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Normal QT interval on screening electrocardiogram (ECG), defined as QT interval&#xD;
             corrected Fridericia (QTcF) of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 450 milliseconds (ms) in&#xD;
             males or &lt;=470 ms in females&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Received small-molecule anticancer therapy (including cytotoxic chemotherapy and&#xD;
             investigational agents) &lt;=14 days prior to first dose of mobocertinib (except for&#xD;
             reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [that is, erlotinib or gefitinib],&#xD;
             which are allowed up to 7 days prior to the first dose of mobocertinib)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Received radiotherapy &lt;=14 days prior to the first dose of mobocertinib or has not&#xD;

             outside the chest and brain, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and stereotactic body&#xD;
             radiotherapy are allowed up to 7 days prior to the first dose&#xD;

             treated with surgery and/or radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have current spinal cord compression or leptomeningeal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including, but not&#xD;
             restricted to:&#xD;

                  multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have prolonged QTcF interval, or being treated with medications known to be associated&#xD;
