  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to describe the evolution of implant stability between the date of&#xD;
      implant placement and 3 months later when the implant is implementated in patients treated&#xD;
      for cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral implantology is widely used during prosthetic rehabilitation in healthy patients but&#xD;
      also in patients presenting cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systems for measuring implant stability using resonance frequency analysis exist and are used&#xD;
      clinically by some practitioners, such as the Ostell® system from W&amp;H. These systems make it&#xD;
      possible to determine the osseointegration of the implant, and thus the appropriate time to&#xD;
      insert the implant, by comparing the value obtained with average values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant survival rates are lower for implants placed in irradiated bone, with an implant&#xD;
      stability quotient value identical to implant placement but lower after osseointegration.&#xD;
      Only one study shows implant stability quotient values&gt; 60 with a success rate of 100% at 41&#xD;
      months on implants placed in patients having received radiotherapy. However, no clinical&#xD;
      study has investigated the kinetics of osseointegration and the stability of implants placed&#xD;
      on a microanastomosis fibula flap as part of aesthetic and prosthetic reconstruction after&#xD;
      cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract.&#xD;
