  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the role of patient&#xD;
      researchers in promoting the resumption of CPAP therapy in apneic patients who had previously&#xD;
      stopped CPAP&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea syndrome (OSA) is one of the most frequent chronic disease&#xD;
      presenting with or without symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and being&#xD;
      accompanied by neurocognitive, cardiovascular and metabolic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first line therapy of obstructive sleep apnoea is continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP). CPAP is highly effective in symptomatic patients for reducing EDS and improving daily&#xD;
      functioning, cognitive function, mood and quality of life. However, success of CPAP treatment&#xD;
      is hampered by long term nonadherence in nearly half of patients. Non adherence to CPAP is&#xD;
      less and less related to technical problems, but rather to users' profile, their&#xD;
      representations of OSA and the benefits experienced from CPAP. Cognitive-behavioural and&#xD;
      motivation enhancement therapies can promote adherence to CPAP treatment. In addition to&#xD;
      health professionals, patients and public involvement (PPI) is more and more advocated in the&#xD;
      field of education and research. Nevertheless, the level of evidence regarding efficacy of&#xD;
      PPI and patient researchers remains to be demonstrated. The aim of this randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate the role of patient researchers in promoting the resumption of CPAP&#xD;
      therapy in apneic patients who had previously stopped CPAP&#xD;
