  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a rheumatic disease that causes serious cartilage damage in the&#xD;
      knee joint. Moderate physical activity can slow cartilage degeneration in moderate OA stages.&#xD;
      Remarkable weakness and atrophy of the quadriceps and hamstrings is a common problem in&#xD;
      patients with chronic osteoarthritis, but in arthritis, it may be difficult to achieve&#xD;
      strength gains due to the pain caused by heavy load-resistant exercises. Exercising with&#xD;
      these high loads may not be possible or may injure painful arthritic knees. For this reason,&#xD;
      lately, blood flow restriction exercises have been directed to achieve the same gain by&#xD;
      exercising with lower loads by restricting the blood flow with a cuff. We aimed to limit the&#xD;
      blood flow in osteoarthritic knees and to provide strength gain and pain reduction provided&#xD;
      by conventional exercises given routinely. Our hypothesis in this study is that exercises&#xD;
      that blood flow restriction exercises will reduce pain and increase strength as well as&#xD;
      conventional exercises.&#xD;

      Knee osteoarthritis is a rheumatic disease that causes serious cartilage damage in the knee&#xD;
      joint. Moderate physical activity can slow cartilage degeneration in moderate OA stages.&#xD;
      Remarkable weakness and atrophy of the quadriceps and hamstrings is a common problem in&#xD;

      by conventional exercises given routinely. Our hypothesis in this study is that exercises&#xD;
      that limit blood flow will reduce pain and increase strength as well as conventional&#xD;
      exercises. Forty patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis by X-ray will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Grade II-III (high rate of exercise therapy) individuals according to the Kellgren&#xD;
      Lawrence classification will be included. Patients diagnosed with orthopedics and&#xD;
      traumatology will be randomly divided into two groups according to the order of entry through&#xD;
      the door. Conventional Exercises that increase muscle strength, flexibility and reduce pain&#xD;
      will be included in the first group. In the second group, the same exercises will be used,&#xD;
      but during the application, a cuff will be placed on the thigh and the blood flow will be&#xD;
      prevented by inflating, therefore, exercises with lower loads will be performed. Exercises&#xD;
      will be practiced for 12 weeks and pre-exercise results will be compared within and between&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
