  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cell rejection is a common complication of lung transplantation. The pathological&#xD;
      diagnosis is based on the performance of transbronchial biopsies which are associated with a&#xD;
      significant risk of potentially severe pneumothorax and hemoptysis. Confocal microscopy&#xD;
      performed during bronchial endoscopy provides real-time images of the lungs on a microscopic&#xD;
      scale. Thus, it is possible to visualize the alveoli, capillaries and intra-alveolar&#xD;
      inflammatory cells. So far, work on the subject has only investigated the ability of this&#xD;
      technique to determine the presence of acute cell rejection on post-fibroscopy analysis. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the absence of airway inflammation seen during the procedure by confocal&#xD;
      microscopy is able to rule out the diagnosis of ACR and avoid the performance of&#xD;
      transbronchial biopsies. Our job is to first assess the feasibility of the per-procedure&#xD;
      evaluation and determine a decision algorithm. If the result is conclusive, a larger study&#xD;
      will be carried out to assess the negative predictive value of this approach for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute cell rejection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the patient's usual follow-up, if an ACR is suspected and it is decided to perform an&#xD;
      endoscopy with transbronchial biopsies, the protocol is presented to the patient by the&#xD;
      doctor in charge. If the patient agrees to participate in the study, consent is obtained.&#xD;
      Collection on arrival of the patient's sex, age, weight, height, respiratory background&#xD;
      leading to the patient's lung transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the department's protocol: carrying out functional respiratory tests, a&#xD;
      biological assessment (CBC, hemostasis and CRP) and a chest x-ray prior to the procedure&#xD;
      except if there is another chest imaging dating less than 24 hours testifying to the absence&#xD;
      of pneumothorax. Premedication with hydroxyzine, insertion of a peripheral venous route,&#xD;
      verification of the patient's identity, anticoagulant or anti-aggregating treatment and&#xD;
      potential allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fibroscopy is carried out according to the usual procedure of the service, namely:&#xD;
      realization of 1 to 2 mg of hypnovel intravenously depending on the patient's tolerance,&#xD;
      introduction of the fiberscope preferably via the nasal route, if impossible or&#xD;
      contraindicated, the oral route is possible with the use of a bite block to protect the&#xD;
      fiberscope. Visualization of the mobility of the vocal cords, trachea, carina and right and&#xD;
      left bronchial tree up to the segmental level. Identification of the quality of the sutures&#xD;
      and the possible presence of bronchial stenosis. Realization of a bronchial trap with&#xD;
      bacteriological and mycological analysis. Performing a bronchoalveolar lavage (90cc of&#xD;
      physiological serum, preferably in the middle lobe) with anatomopathological, virological,&#xD;
      bacteriological, mycological and mycobacteriological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage, the confocal microscopy procedure begins:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking pictures for post-procedure analysis in 4 different territories. For each territory,&#xD;
      the investigator need to get a snapshot of a vascular structure and a snapshot of an&#xD;
      alveolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis per procedure: the same operator analyzes the alveoli deemed to be representative in&#xD;
      real time. It determines the presence of intra-alveolar inflammatory cells and answers the&#xD;
      question of the main criterion: possible interpretation in confocal microscopy? YES / NO, the&#xD;
      clinical researcher immediately notes the answer in the CRF. Based on this per-procedure&#xD;
      analysis, if he deems the interpretation possible, the operator declares if he concludes that&#xD;
      pulmonary inflammation is present YES / NO, the response is noted immediately in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fibroscopy procedure is then resumed as usual in the department, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing 5 to 6 transbronchial biopsies. The number of biopsies depends on the patient's&#xD;
      tolerance and the occurrence of complications such as hemorrhage or pneumothorax. Checking at&#xD;
      the end of the procedure for the absence of active intra-bronchial bleeding, followed by a&#xD;
      frontal chest X-ray to check for the absence of pneumothorax (examination carried out&#xD;
      routinely even in the event of bronchial endoscopy with simple BTB). If there are no&#xD;
      complications and if the pathological analysis of the lung biopsies does not conclude that&#xD;
      there is an acute cellular rejection, the patient can return home at the end of the day. If&#xD;
      the pathologist concludes that there is a rejection or that there is a complication, the&#xD;
      patient remains hospitalized for the time necessary for medical treatment.&#xD;
