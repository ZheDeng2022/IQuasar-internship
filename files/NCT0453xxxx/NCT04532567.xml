  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the safety and tolerability of GLPG1205 in&#xD;
      single and multiple oral doses in healthy male Caucasian and Japanese subjects. This study&#xD;
      will also assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) across different doses of GLPG1205. PK will look&#xD;
      at how the study drug is absorbed, broken down, and eliminated by your body.&#xD;
