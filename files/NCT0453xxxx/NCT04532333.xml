  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, multi-center, positive-controlled study, in which a total&#xD;
      of 236 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive bivalirudin or heparin in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio during coil embolization in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure-related complication, mRS, Activated Clotting Time, ischemic and hemorrhagic&#xD;
      complications, symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, death, Heparin Induced&#xD;
      Thrombocytopenia will be evaluated during procedure, at 24hs, 7days and 30 days after.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular embolization has become an effective modality for the treatment of intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms. Despite advances in technology and techniques, thromboembolic and bleeding events&#xD;
      are still encountered as inherent perioperative complications. Hypercoagulability as a&#xD;
      systemic response to acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may be associated with an increased&#xD;
      incidence of thromboembolic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of anticoagulant may reduce thromboembolic events during the endovascular&#xD;
      embolization, meanwhile, involves the risk of bleeding. Although heparin is commonly used&#xD;
      during the procedure, the safety in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms has not&#xD;
      been established. In contrast to heparin, bivalirudin is a short-lived direct thrombin&#xD;
      inhibitor with an intrinsic antiplatelet activity and more stable pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic properties which has been associated with reduced bleeding and an overall&#xD;
      favorable profile. Bivalirudin administration in patients with high bleeding risk during&#xD;
      coronary intervention is recommended by current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, multicenter, randomized pilot study, which is aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of bivalirudin coil embolization in patients with ruptured intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms.&#xD;
