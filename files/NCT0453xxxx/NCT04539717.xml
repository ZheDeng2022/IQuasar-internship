  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic value of a reconstructed abbreviated&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from a full clinical exam, compared to ultrasound (US) for&#xD;
      screening of liver cancer. Blood markers will be evaluated to determine their correlation to&#xD;
      imaging. This study will help to determine whether abbreviated MRI is superior to ultrasound&#xD;
      for diagnosis of liver cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer death in the United&#xD;
      States and now kills over 30,000 Americans annually. To reduce the morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      caused by this aggressive cancer, current practice guidelines recommend semi-annual abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound in adults with cirrhosis, the leading risk factor for HCC, to detect HCC nodules&#xD;
      when they are small and treatable. Unfortunately, US has poor sensitivity for early-stage HCC&#xD;
      in cirrhosis, failing to detect treatable cancer in over half of affected patients.&#xD;
      Alternatives such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also&#xD;
      not ideal due to ionizing radiation (CT), higher cost (MRI), or long exam time (~30-45 min&#xD;
      for MRI). An optimal and fast HCC screening method is urgently needed and should be more&#xD;
      sensitive and cost-effective than US and avoid ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cross-sectional single arm non randomized multicenter study enrolling&#xD;
      in 4 American centers as follows: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai-ISMMS, University&#xD;
      of California San Diego-UCSD, University of Wisconsin-UW, and Duke University. The composite&#xD;
      reference standard will incorporate the clinical results of the full baseline MRI exam and of&#xD;
      subsequent imaging and pathology data collected over the next 6 months. Routine clinical&#xD;
      follow-up imaging at 6 months will be observed. Patients will then be classified as positive&#xD;
      for HCC, negative for HCC, or excluded.&#xD;

      Blood will be collected to measure AFP, AFP-L3 and DCP (Des-carboxy-prothrombin), ctDNA and&#xD;
      other tumor markers. The research team will not perform whole genome sequencing (i.e.,&#xD;
      sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or&#xD;
      exome sequence of that specimen) as part of this study.&#xD;
