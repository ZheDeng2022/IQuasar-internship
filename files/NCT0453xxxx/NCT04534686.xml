  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the age associated sarcopenia and reduced cardiovascular fitness, frail older adults&#xD;
      experience significant decrease in physical function which comprises of mobility, endurance,&#xD;
      muscle strength and balance control. The impaired physical function results in poor quality&#xD;
      of life and reduced community participation, leading to increased frailty and long-term&#xD;
      disability. Further, compared to cognitively intact frail older adults, cognitively impaired&#xD;
      frail older adults experience greater deterioration of such physical function, specifically&#xD;
      during dual-task performances (i.e., simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor task).&#xD;
      This deterioration occurs due to increased cognitive-motor interference as a result of&#xD;
      dual-tasking and is known to increase exhaustion among frail older adults. Previous studies&#xD;
      have used multicomponent training and have shown to improve physical function and maintain&#xD;
      cardiovascular functioning. However, the capacity of such interventions to improve cognitive&#xD;
      function along with physical function is not known or unclear. Further, the concurrent&#xD;
      comorbidities that occur along with psychosocial issues such as depression present as&#xD;
      barriers and lead to reduced compliance to therapy leaving only a few of them to benefit from&#xD;
      it. Alternate forms of therapy such as exergaming with explicit cognitive training has shown&#xD;
      promising effects in improving motor and motor function in disabled populations. These&#xD;
      studies use a cost-effective, off the shelf device such as Nintendo Wii or Microsoft Kinect&#xD;
      to deliver the training which is easily available and clinically translatable. Further, such&#xD;
      training has demonstrated increase in brain connectivity enhancing cognitive functions&#xD;
      associated with balance control. However, there is limited literature examining the effect of&#xD;
      exergaming in older frail population and the efficacy of such training is unknown. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study proposes a randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility of CogXergaming&#xD;
      program with an aim to improve locomotor-balance control, cognition, muscular system and&#xD;
      cardiovascular fitness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population of adults aged 60 years and older has been growing with around half of the&#xD;
      people older than 85 years estimated to be frail. Age-related changes in multiple systems&#xD;
      affecting balance, mobility, muscle strength, motor processing, cognition, nutrition,&#xD;
      endurance and physical activity (PA) results in frailty. Studies on frail older adults have&#xD;
      reported improvement in mobility and functional level following exercise interventions.&#xD;
      Regular physical activity in this population has helped improve cardiovascular conditioning&#xD;
      and quality of life, thus allowing these frail older adults a chance at independent living in&#xD;
      the community. In addition to physical comorbidities, the presence of psychosocial issues&#xD;
      such as depression may act as a barrier to community participation. Several PA interventions&#xD;
      have demonstrated limited long-term effect and sustainable behavioral change in this&#xD;
      population. An evidence-based fall prevention program called Matter of Balance (MOB) was&#xD;
      developed to reduce fall risk and improve physical function and maximize activity&#xD;
      participation in older adults. Meanwhile, Exergaming, a task-specific interactive gaming, has&#xD;
      been gaining attention as a novel therapeutic alternative that promotes motor recovery in&#xD;
      healthy and disabled populations. Exergaming involves repetitive-task specific exercises with&#xD;
      movement execution feedback and motivation provided in real time. Studies have shown&#xD;
      Exergaming improved symmetrical weight shifting, multi-directional stepping, single-stance,&#xD;
      rapid movement training and self-initiated postural weight shifts in the participants. This&#xD;
      anticipatory postural control training helps significantly improve balance control and&#xD;
      mobility. In addition to the physical function domains that underlie physical frailty,&#xD;
      executive cognitive domain functions also predict late-life physiological impairments. Thus,&#xD;
      we postulate that PA facilitated through Exergaming and accompanied by simultaneous cognitive&#xD;
      training is a novel approach to counter and inhibit frailty associated with physical function&#xD;
      and cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the feasibility (compliance and effectiveness) of cognitive-motor exergaming&#xD;
      (CogXergaming) in the frail older adults and to compare the improvements in behavioral&#xD;
      biomarkers in this group across balance, muscle fitness, cardiovascular fitness and global&#xD;
      cognition to the group receiving the Matter of Balance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants will respond well to CogXergaming training paradigm and demonstrate&#xD;
      significant improvements in balance, muscular fitness, cardiovascular fitness and global&#xD;
      cognition as compared to the Matter of Balance training group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the effect of CogXergaming on physical activity levels and quality of life&#xD;
      measures post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The participants who received CogXergaming will demonstrate significant&#xD;
      improvement in physical activity and quality of life post-training as compared to their own&#xD;
      pre-training scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine the effect of CogXergaming structural and functional connectivity within&#xD;
      the cognitive-motor areas pre and post training to establish effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Post-training, participants will demonstrate improved memory consolidation,&#xD;
      attention, motor planning and execution compared to pre-training indicating improved&#xD;
      functional connectivity within the cognitive-motor areas.&#xD;
