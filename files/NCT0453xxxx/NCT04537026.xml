  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a large population of patients with lumbosacral radicular pain due to spinal&#xD;
      stenosis who do not respond to physical therapy or oral medication management, yet wish to&#xD;
      avoid spinal surgery or are simply not candidates due to medical co-morbidity. Given the&#xD;
      natural history of lumbar spinal stenosis, these patients typically suffer from chronic pain&#xD;
      and disability. Currently, the typical treatment for this population is serial corticosteroid&#xD;
      injection. The efficacy of the treatment specifically for the indication of spinal stenosis&#xD;
      is in question and is associated with both concerning chronic sequelae and the risk, although&#xD;
      low, of catastrophic neurologic compromise. Alternatively, hAF is a promising new biologic&#xD;
      treatment with neuro-protective and regenerative properties. Early studies demonstrate its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties, with high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, in addition to&#xD;
      its ability to assist with regeneration of peripheral nerves. Furthermore, it has a favorable&#xD;
      side-effect profile without concern for long-term sequelae or potential for neurologic&#xD;
      compromise. The present study aims to determine if epidural injection of hAF compared to the&#xD;
      corticosteroid dexamethasone is more effective for the treatment of lumbosacral radicular&#xD;
      pain due to spinal stenosis, as measured by pain, disability, psychological function, oral&#xD;
      analgesic use, and avoidance of surgery. Evidence for superiority of epidural hAF compared to&#xD;
      dexamethasone injection would change the treatment paradigm for refractory radicular pain due&#xD;
      to spinal stenosis. Furthermore, even if shown to be non-inferior to epidural dexamethasone,&#xD;
      epidural hAF would be favored given its superior safety profile. Thus, this research has the&#xD;
      potential to improve outcomes and patient safety in a very large population with chronic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of chronic pain and disability in older adults and&#xD;
      is the leading reason for spinal surgery in older adults. In this condition, degenerative&#xD;
      changes in intervertebral discs and osseous anatomy of the spine result in narrowing of the&#xD;
      spinal canal and neuroforamen in close proximity to the traversing spinal nerve roots,&#xD;
      causing back and radicular leg pain, paresthesias and weakness. In the absence of a&#xD;
      progressive neurologic deficit, initial treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain includes&#xD;
      physical therapy, activity modification, and oral neuropathic or analgesic medications. If&#xD;
      this conservative approach fails to relieve pain, an image guided epidural steroid injection&#xD;
      (ESI) is the second-line treatment. Surgical decompression may be a treatment option for some&#xD;
      patients who fail conservative therapy, but it is not uniformly effective and is associated&#xD;
      with substantial direct and indirect risks. Further, some patients are unwilling to undergo&#xD;
      invasive surgical treatments, and in others, surgery is contraindicated due to medical&#xD;
      co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural steroid injections are widely used for the treatment of spinal stenosis. Over 25% of&#xD;
      all epidural steroid injection in the Medicare population are administered for the treatment&#xD;
      of pain associated with spinal stenosis, accounting for more than 500,000 injections per&#xD;
      year. When performed with sterile technique and fluoroscopic-guidance, epidural spine&#xD;
      injections of steroid are safe. However, steroid use in the epidural space is associated with&#xD;
      rare but catastrophic sequelae including paraplegia due to spinal cord infarction. The larger&#xD;
      size or aggregation of particulate steroids likely obstructs arteriolar blood flow to the&#xD;
      spinal cord if inadvertently injected into radicular arteries during TFESI. In addition,&#xD;
      epidural steroid use is associated with common immediate/short-term adverse events such as&#xD;
      facial flushing, headache, insomnia, transient hypertension, increased blood glucose in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes. Injections must often be repeated when administered for chronic&#xD;
      radicular pain given a typical natural history of life-long pain associated with this&#xD;
      condition, which increases the risk of long-term sequelae including osteoporosis, adrenal&#xD;
      suppression, hypertension, cataracts, gastrointestinal bleeding, and immune system&#xD;
      dysfunction among many others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the injection treatment paradigm for patients with spinal stenosis has not been&#xD;
      optimized. While transforaminal epidural steroid injection appears to be superior to both&#xD;
      placebo saline injection and lidocaine injection at short-term to intermediate follow-up when&#xD;
      performed for the indication of radicular pain due to acute disc herniation, the highest&#xD;
      quality evidence to date suggests a lesser degree of efficacy for the indication of leg pain&#xD;
      due to spinal stenosis This is particularly problematic given that radicular pain related to&#xD;
      disc herniation is self-limited, whereas spinal-stenosis related radicular pain does not tend&#xD;
      to improve over time. Thus, there is a large group of patients with spinal stenosis who fail&#xD;
      to respond to physical therapy and oral medication management, yet either wish to avoid&#xD;
      spinal surgery or are not eligible, and suffer from chronic pain and debility given the poor&#xD;
      treatment options. Clearly, better treatments with more optimal safety and side-effect&#xD;
      profiles compared to epidural corticosteroids must be investigated in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is therefore a critical need to identify safe and effective treatments for this common&#xD;
      clinical condition, which would allow for improved patient function and pain relief. Amniotic&#xD;
      Fluid (AF) is a promising new biologic treatment with neuro-protective and regenerative&#xD;
      properties. Early after conception and until the mother's water breaks for the delivery of&#xD;
      their infant, the fetus is bathed in amniotic fluid. AF functions as a supportive cushion to&#xD;
      the fetus and provides a protective environment. AF is a rich source of nutrients, cytokines&#xD;
      and growth factors that are required for fetal development and maturation. AF also contains&#xD;
      multiple cell types with the potential to differentiate along multiple cell lineages. The&#xD;
      protective and regenerative properties of AF are achieved via the exchange of water and&#xD;
      solutes with surrounding tissues. This is accomplished via the utilization of different&#xD;
      pathways during the course of a pregnancy that likely contribute to changes in the&#xD;
      composition of AF with gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early evidence demonstrates that concentrates of AF inhibit the development of peritonitis&#xD;
      and accelerate defense-repair mechanisms within damaged joints, demonstrating protective&#xD;
      biological properties. Since these early publications, more sophisticated evaluations have&#xD;
      revealed the presence of antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and growth-promoting activities of&#xD;
      AF. For example, low AF antimicrobial activity is associated with a high incidence of an&#xD;
      infectious syndromes in pregnant women. Components with antimicrobial, antiviral and&#xD;
      antifungal activity that are present in AF include lysozyme, peroxidase, transferrin,&#xD;
      beta-lysin, immunoglobulins and zinc-peptide complexes. Immunomodulatory properties of AF are&#xD;
      evident from studies showing that enteral feeding of AF suppresses the pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      responses in preterm pigs with necrotizing enterocolitis. Further, growth-promoting&#xD;
      activities of AF are supported by both animal studies and in vitro studies, showing that AF&#xD;
      can enhance neochondrogenesis, regenerate peripheral nerves and bone, accelerate&#xD;
      re-epithelialization in corneas, and promote healing of human skin wounds. Some of the&#xD;
      factors that are found in AF that may contribute to these activities include inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators such as TNF-a, IL-6, IL8, and IL-1048 trophic factors that include EGF, IGF-1, FGF,&#xD;
      HGF and TGF-a, and hyaluronic acid, an important factor in promoting re- epithelialization in&#xD;
      human skin wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human AF also contains factors that appear to minimize scarring and adhesions. Ozgenel et al,&#xD;
      describe how adhesions and scarring are reduced or eliminated in a peripheral nerve rat&#xD;
      model. It is interesting that a fetal incision made early in gestation will heal without a&#xD;
      scar whereas one made in late gestation heals with scar formation. Hyaluronic acid, which is&#xD;
      found in high levels in AF, inhibits collagen synthesis. This hyaluronic acid-rich&#xD;
      environment is due to a relative lack of hyaluronidase in AF and to the presence of&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid-stimulating factor in AF. In a study investigating the effect of AF on&#xD;
      proteases important to wound healing, human AF was shown to enhance collagenase activity, but&#xD;
      to inhibit activities of hyaluronidase, elastase, and cathepsin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team has already conducted studies to assess the hypothesis that nutrients, cytokines and&#xD;
      growth factors contained in the non-cellular fraction of AF are useful for reparative and&#xD;
      regenerative treatments in patients. The first aim was to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      consenting and screening volunteer donors for the routine collection of AF from full-term&#xD;
      pregnant women scheduled for caesarean- section (C-sections) and then processing the AF for&#xD;
      clinical applications. The second aim was to develop a processing method that resulted in a&#xD;
      cell-free AF preparation suitable for clinical applications. The third goal was to gain a&#xD;
      better understanding about components of AF procured from full-term pregnancies. Initially,&#xD;
      36 pregnant women consented and passed the donor screening criteria. AF was successfully&#xD;
      collected from 17 individuals. Median AF volumes were 70 mL (range 10-815 mL; n = 17). Fluid&#xD;
      chemistries were similar, but some differences were noted in HA levels and cytokine profiles.&#xD;
      Cytokine arrays revealed that an average of 304 ± 20 (mean ±SD; n=3) of 400 proteins tested&#xD;
      were present in AF with a majority of cytokines associated with host defense. The proteins&#xD;
      examined were annotated in the protein arrays as anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory.&#xD;
      Twelve (12) of 17 (70%) of proteins known to have Anti-inflammatory cytokines were detected&#xD;
      in the AF samples, while only 5 of 14 (36%) pro-inflammatory proteins were detected in AF&#xD;
      samples. There were no (TNF)-α, or IL-1β found in AF samples. Three (3) cytokines were&#xD;
      detected with both pro- and anti-inflammatory activity. Some of the peptides encountered and&#xD;
      classified according to their function are found in Table 1 below:&#xD;
