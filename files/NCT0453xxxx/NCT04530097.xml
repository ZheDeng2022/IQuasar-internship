  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the recommendations of the guidelines, as well as the previous animal studies and&#xD;
      clinical studies of our team, we designed and carried out prospective, randomized controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind clinical studies to further expand the sample size to verify the efficacy of&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation combined with melatonin in the treatment of stage IA NSCLC. It is&#xD;
      hoped that this combined treatment plan can delay the recurrence of lung cancer after RFA and&#xD;
      prolong the survival time of patients.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation combined with melatonin in the treatment of&#xD;
      stage IA non-small cell lung cancer, and explore new directions for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of early stage non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study. Using the same admission&#xD;
      criteria, it is planned to enroll 260 patients, who will be randomly assigned 1:1. The&#xD;
      experimental group: radiofrequency ablation combined with melatonin, and the control group:&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation combined with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Radiofrequency ablation was performed immediately after enrollment, and&#xD;
      melatonin treatment was given for 6 months after 1 week after radiofrequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Radiofrequency ablation was performed immediately after enrollment, and a&#xD;
      placebo treatment program was given for 6 months after 1 week after radiofrequency.&#xD;
