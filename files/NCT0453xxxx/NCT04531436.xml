  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project evaluated the effects of a brief manualized mindful eating intervention as a&#xD;
      treatment for overeating with individuals with overweight and obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overeating leads to overweight and obesity. Effective eating regulation largely depends on an&#xD;
      individual's responsiveness to internal cues of physiological hunger and satiety; this&#xD;
      phenomenon is known as interoceptive awareness and has been shown to be lower in individuals&#xD;
      with overweight or obesity. Mindfulness training may improve interoceptive awareness and thus&#xD;
      may facilitate more effective regulation of eating through increased sensitivity to cues of&#xD;
      hunger and fullness. Mindful eating programs have been shown to increase interoceptive&#xD;
      awareness of hunger and satiety cues and decrease weight in individuals with obesity.&#xD;
      Although these programs are effective, they involve lengthy group sessions, require&#xD;
      extensively trained staff, and are not widely available outside of clinical research. Thus,&#xD;
      the reach and impact of these programs are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study developed and tested a brief mindful eating intervention inspired by&#xD;
      Kristeller &amp; Wolever's (2010) Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training program to increase&#xD;
      interoceptive awareness in individuals with overweight and obesity as a means to increase&#xD;
      mindful and intuitive eating, reduce overeating and facilitate weight loss. The program&#xD;
      consisted of 9 weekly 10-15 minute sessions structured around one simple evidence-based&#xD;
      mindful eating exercise, and was delivered to adult (ages 18-67) employees from a Canadian&#xD;
      university.&#xD;

    <description>Over the 9-week intervention, participants will be introduced to various mindful eating and intuitive eating practices which are aimed at reducing overeating and facilitating weight loss. Each session will focus on one simple, evidence-based message, aimed at modifying a current weight-relevant eating behavior of the patient. The intervention will focus on two key elements: (1) the mindful awareness of body cues (intuitive eating) and (2) the mindful awareness of external cues (mindful eating).</description>
