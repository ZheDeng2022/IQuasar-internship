  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of a multi-ingredient&#xD;
      pre-workout supplement versus an ergogenic dose of caffeine (6 mg/kg) on energy expenditure&#xD;
      during low-intensity exercise. The effects of these substances on substrate utilization, gas&#xD;
      exchange, and psychological factors were also investigated. Twelve males (mean ± SD: age =&#xD;
      22.8 ± 2.4 years) completed three bouts of 60-min of treadmill exercise at 4.8-6.4 km/hr on&#xD;
      separate days after consuming a pre-workout supplement, 6 mg/kg of caffeine, or placebo in a&#xD;
      randomized fashion. The pre-workout and caffeine supplements resulted in significantly&#xD;
      greater energy expenditure (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively), VO2 (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.007,&#xD;
      respectively), VCO2 (p = 0.006, p = 0.049, respectively), and VE (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.007,&#xD;
      respectively), but not rates of fat or carbohydrate oxidation or respiratory exchange ratio&#xD;
      compared to placebo (collapsed across condition). In addition, the pre-workout supplement&#xD;
      increased feelings of alertness (p = 0.015) and focus (p = 0.005) 30-minutes post-ingestion&#xD;
      and decreased feelings of fatigue (p = 0.014) during exercise compared to placebo (collapsed&#xD;
      across condition). Thus, the pre-workout supplement increased energy expenditure and measures&#xD;
      of gas exchange to the same extent as 6 mg/kg of caffeine with concomitant increased feelings&#xD;
      of alertness and focus and decreased feelings of fatigue.&#xD;
