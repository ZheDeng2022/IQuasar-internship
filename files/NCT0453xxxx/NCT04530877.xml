  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the number of patients who reach mucosal healing at the end of treatment in Exclusive enteral nutrition group</measure>
    <time_frame>at the end of 8 week of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>the mucosal healing was defined as Simple Endoscopic Score for CD （SES-CD ）≤4 at the end of treatment . For the SES-CD, the intestine is divided into 5 anatomic segments under the endoscopic vision: rectum, left side of the colon segment, transverse colon, right side of the colon segment, and ileum. Items of interest include ulcer size, estimates of the ulcerated and affected surface, and the presence of luminal narrowing. The SES-CD score is calculated by combining scores of individual segments. Overall SES-CD scores are classified into 4 disease categories: none, 0 to 2; mild 2 to 4; moderate 5 to 15; and severe&gt;16.</description>
