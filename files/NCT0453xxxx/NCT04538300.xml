  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is an unwanted and distressing complication for&#xD;
      patients. PONV affects one-third of untreated patients after general anesthesia. PONV is a&#xD;
      hard state for patients, surgeons, and anesthesiologists and increases the anxiety of&#xD;
      patient. There are many pharmacologic agents efficient in treatment and prophylaxis of PONV,&#xD;
      however, these drugs have many side effects. At the same time, there are many&#xD;
      non-pharmacological strategies for antiemetic therapies. Therefore there is an interest to&#xD;
      nonpharmacologic agents. Such as acupuncture, ginger, peppermint …etc. Mint is a popular&#xD;
      vegetable used as an antispasmodic, analgesic, antimicrobial and anti-vomiting treatment. The&#xD;
      use of mint is safe and no certain side-effects and interactions. Chewing affects on&#xD;
      postoperative bowel functions. Our hypothesis was mint chewing gum is effective on treatment&#xD;
      of PONV. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery has a high risk for PONV in adults. In this&#xD;
      study, our aim is to investigate the effect of mint gum chewing in the treatment of PONV in&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery.&#xD;

      The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from each patient. The study was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics&#xD;
      of the Declaration of Helsinki. 300 patients ASA I-II, between18-65 years old, scheduled for&#xD;
      elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Patients who have pharyngeal or esophageal dysfunction, significant cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      dysfunction, phenylketonuria, inadequate to Turkish language comprehension, allergy to mint&#xD;
      or antiemetic drugs, were not feasible to chew gum were excluded from the study. All patients&#xD;
      were routinely monitored (electrocardiography,SpO2,noninvasive blood pressure). Demographic&#xD;
      datas were recorded. Anesthesia induction was made with propofol 2-3mg/kg iv, fentanyl 1.5mcg&#xD;
      /kg iv and rocuronium 1mg / kg. Anesthesia maintenance was provided with sevoflurane MAC 1.0&#xD;
      in 50% O2 and air mixture. Intravenous10 mg metoclopromide, 50 mg ranitidine was given to all&#xD;
      patients and sugammadex 2 mg/kg were administered for antagonism of neuromusculer block.&#xD;
      Before surgical incision paracetamol 1000 mg intravenous was given and 10 minutes before&#xD;
      extubation diclofenac sodium 75 mg intramuscular was injected.At the end of surgery the&#xD;
      patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group G (Gum group) and Group C (Control&#xD;
      group) with the closed envelope method. Patients were followed up in the recovery unit for at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes. Degree of nausea and Abramowitz Emezis Score were evaluated for all the&#xD;
      patients. In Group G, peppermint gum was chewed for 15 minutes in patients with sufficient&#xD;
      wakefulness (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale of 5). The first gum&#xD;
      application time was recorded. If patient refused chewing gum, ondansetron iv 4mg was given.&#xD;
      If PONV repeated, chewing gum was given again. If PONV was persisted despite chewing gum&#xD;
      twice, ondansetron iv 4 mg, then dexamethasone iv 4 mg, propofol 20 mg iv slowly were given,&#xD;
      respectively. In Group C, ondansetron 4 mg iv was performed to patients whose postoperative&#xD;
      nausea score was bigger than 3 and Abramowitz Emesis score one and above. The first drug&#xD;
      application time was recorded. The time of PONV healed fully was recorded. If PONV was&#xD;
      continued, it was planned to give ondansetron 4mg iv, dexamethasone 4 mg iv and propofol iv&#xD;
      20 mg iv, respectively. Nevertheless, it was planned to repeat ondansetron 0.15mg / kg at&#xD;
      4-hour intervals in patients whose PONV did not improve, with a total dose not exceeding&#xD;
      16mg. The patients were followed up for 24 hours in terms of PONV. In Group C, sufficient&#xD;
      wakefulness was evaluated by Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale of 5.If there&#xD;
      is a complaint of PONV in the Surgical Service, the gum was given in Group G, then&#xD;
      ondansetron 0.15 mg / kg and dexamethasone were given. In Group C,ondansetron 0.15 mg / kg&#xD;
      and dexamethasone were given. Additional antiemetic needs, adverse events were recorded&#xD;
      postoperatively 24 hours. Patient and surgeon satisfaction were recorded for 24 hours.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>300 patients ASA I-II, aged between18-65 years who scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were included. The patients randomly divided into 2 groups (Group G n=150, Group C n=150) with the closed envelope method. In group G peppermint-flavored gum was chewed for 15 minutes in patients with sufficient wakefullness. If PONV persists despite gumming twice, ondansetron iv 4 mg, dexamethasone iv 4 mg, propofol iv 10 mg were given respectively. Patients with moderate and severe nausea in the control group(Group C) were given iv 4 mg ondansetron. If PONV continues, it was planned to give dexamethasone iv 4 mg and propofol iv 10 mg, respectively. In group C(control) degree of nausea and Abramowitz Emezis score were evaluated.</intervention_model_description>
