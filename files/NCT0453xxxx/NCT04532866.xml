    <textblock>
      This study investigates the time course and magnitude of eight months of isolation and&#xD;
      confinement in a spaceflight analog facility on brain changes and cognitive performance. The&#xD;
      study also assesses the feasibility of an immersive and interactive virtual environment (VE)&#xD;
      to enhance positive affect and mental well-being during prolonged isolation and confinement.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the neurobehavioural risks associated with future exploratory space&#xD;
      missions and their mitigation as part of the isolation and confinement program &quot;SIRIUS&quot;&#xD;
      (Scientific International Research In Unique terrestrial Station). The overarching objective&#xD;
      of the study is two-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to investigate the time course and magnitude of eight months of&#xD;
      isolation and confinement in the spaceflight analog facility &quot;NEK&quot; at the Institute of&#xD;
      Biomedical Problems (IBMP) in Moscow on brain changes, cognitive performance, and biochemical&#xD;
      adaptations, and compare these data to a sex- and age-matched control group. To achieve this&#xD;
      aim, multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data before and after the intervention to&#xD;
      assess structural and functional brain changes before, and after the experiment will be&#xD;
      collected. Furthermore, cognitive performance using a series of computer-based tests will be&#xD;
      determined and blood and saliva samples to identify biochemical changes associated with brain&#xD;
      plasticity and learning before, during, and after the experiment will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, to address the need for sensory stimulation countermeasures during prolonged&#xD;
      isolation and confinement, the feasibility of a highly immersive and interactive virtual&#xD;
      environment (VE) to enhance positive affect and mental well-being will be assessed. To&#xD;
      achieve this aim, the acute physiological and behavioral effects associated with the proposed&#xD;
      sensory augmentation measure will be quantified (Does VE elicit immediate physiological&#xD;
      and/or behavioral changes during long-duration isolation and confinement?). It will be&#xD;
      verified whether there is an adaptation to the experience with repeated exposure bouts (Can&#xD;
      VE elicit similar physiological and or behavioral responses after the VE exposure has been&#xD;
      administered recurrently?). The administration rate is optimized relative to crew&#xD;
      burden/compliance and scientific return (one administration once a month). This will also&#xD;
      ensure that the approach will not have any chronic effects interfering with the primary&#xD;
      outcomes of the first objective or any countermeasures foreseen by IBMP. These data will&#xD;
      provide essential insights about the efficacy of a new, highly immersive, and target specific&#xD;
      VR-based sensory stimulation augmentation to mitigate some of the risks associated with&#xD;
      sensory monotony and visual disconnection from Earth during exploration-type missions. The&#xD;
      two objectives will deliver a highly unique and comprehensive set of integrated neuroimaging&#xD;
      and neurocognitive tools for the evaluation and ultimately prevention of adverse effects on&#xD;
      brain plasticity and behavior.&#xD;
