      The aim of this study is creating this platform and investigating whether performance&#xD;
      evaluation of BLS trainings would be more objective compared to conventional OSCE (Objective&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Examination) exams, if these evaluations were carried out with the&#xD;
      platform which is combining OSCE scoring criteria with sensor data retrieved from the&#xD;
      simulator's sensors.&#xD;

      The participants of this study consisted of 25 volunteers among Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar&#xD;
      University students without prior knowledge of basic life support protocol. 11 Participants&#xD;
      (44.0%) were male, 14 (56.0%) were female. The participants were informed about the study and&#xD;
      signed consent forms before participating the study. After a brief introduction of the&#xD;
      serious gaming module, the participants were asked to choose the self-test mode of the&#xD;
      serious game module. The participants' number of attempts was not limited. Following serious&#xD;
      game based training, the hands-on training module combining OSCE scoring criteria with sensor&#xD;
      data retrieved from the simulator's sensors was used for hands-on performance evaluation.&#xD;
      After familiarization with the system using self-training mode, the participants were asked&#xD;
      to proceed the BLS Hands-on training app with the simulator under the supervision of the&#xD;
      educator. The simulation sessions were also recorded in order to use these recordings for&#xD;
      conventional OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination) performance evaluation.&#xD;
      Conventional OSCE score of each participant was obtained by watching the recorded sessions of&#xD;
      BLS trainings.Spearman's rho correlation test was used for calculating the correlation&#xD;
      between serious gaming, hands on training module with including sensor data from the&#xD;
      simulator and OSCE scores.&#xD;

    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Serious gaming module, hands -on module with sensor data and OSCE exam had the same scoring criteria depending European Resuscitation Council Basic Life Support 2015 Algorithm. The scores were calculated over 100 points, whereas higher scores meant better scores. The participants were considered as successful, if at least 80 points out of 100 were obtained.</description>
