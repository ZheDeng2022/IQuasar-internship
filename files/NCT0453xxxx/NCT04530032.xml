      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) represents a significant public health risk in the United States&#xD;

      neurodegenerative diseases. Despite extensive research there are no pharmacological therapies&#xD;
      which have demonstrated significant improvement in neurological or cognitive recovery.&#xD;
      Changes in glucose metabolism are considered the hallmark metabolic response to TBI and&#xD;
      ketosis has been proposed as a therapy to ameliorate metabolic dysfunction.This trial&#xD;

      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) represents a significant public health risk in the United States&#xD;
      leaving many survivors with significant long term cognitive deficits and at risk for&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Despite extensive research there are no pharmacological therapies&#xD;
      which have demonstrated significant improvement in neurological or cognitive recovery.&#xD;
      Changes in glucose metabolism are considered the hallmark metabolic response to TBI and&#xD;
      ketosis has been proposed as a therapy to ameliorate metabolic dysfunction. Further research&#xD;
      is necessary to address the outstanding questions regarding outcome, dose, timing, route and&#xD;
      duration of ketogenic diet (KD) therapy in clinical TBI. Using a multiparametric MRI and MR&#xD;
      spectroscopy approach in conjunction with standardized neurological and neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessments of outcome, disability, cognition, and quality of life, this trial will&#xD;
      investigate the therapeutic potential of a short term (14 day) KD on 6 month outcome&#xD;
      following moderate-severe TBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of KD on cognitive and neurological outcome following moderate -&#xD;
           severe TBI. To date clinical studies of ketone metabolism in TBI are severely limited&#xD;
           and have focused primarily on ketometabolism and its effects on glucose metabolism&#xD;
           without assessing functional or cognitive outcomes. This project directly assesses the&#xD;
           effect of short-term KD on measures of disability, attention, memory, processing speed,&#xD;
           language, and executive function during ketosis and will determine whether its effects&#xD;
           outlast the duration of the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify the effect of KD on cerebral metabolism following moderate - severe TBI. While&#xD;
           the use of ketogenic fuels is receiving greater attention, little is known about the&#xD;
           effect of the KD on neuronal metabolism. This project will use MR spectroscopy to&#xD;
           non-invasively measure NAA, a marker of neuronal metabolism during ketosis and outside&#xD;
           the treatment window, which will deepen our understanding of the neuroprotective&#xD;
           mechanisms of this therapy.&#xD;

    <time_frame>day 0 to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A change in cognitive improvement as a result of the dietary intervention will be assessed across 5 domains using the RBANS:&#xD;
Immediate Memory - List learning and Story Memory Visuospacial/Constructional - Figure Copy and Line Orientation Language - Picture naming and Semantic Fluency Attention - Digit Span and Coding Delayed Memory - List Recall, List Recognition, Story Memory, and Figure Recall The five domain scores are combined as a total scale score. According to the RBANS manual, the possible values for the RBANS scores at the item, domain, and scale level are 0 to 89, 40 to 154, and 40 to 160.</description>

    <description>A change in executive function as a result of the dietary intervention will be assessed over a 6 month period using the verbal fluency and color word interference subtests of the D-KEFS. Achievement scores (total correct responses and total switching accuracy) will be measured using the D-KEFS Scoring Assistant software.</description>

    <description>Changes in quality of life as a result of the dietary intervention will be assessed over a 6 month period using the SF-36. Items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state, with each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively.</description>
