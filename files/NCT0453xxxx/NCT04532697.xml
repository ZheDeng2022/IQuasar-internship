  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a pre-dementia condition commonly occurs in elderly&#xD;
      people. As Hong Kong has become an aged society, the prevalence of dementia and MCI in Hong&#xD;
      Kong has increased substantially in recent decades. To date, no effective pharmacological&#xD;
      therapies are available for MCI, and there exists a need for exploring complementary&#xD;
      treatment for this age-related condition. Preclinical studies have identified Uncaria&#xD;
      rhynchophylla (Gouteng in Chinese) to have promising neuroprotective effect in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease experimental models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the effectiveness and the safety of oral administration of Uncaria&#xD;
      rhynchophylla for MCI in older people in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled pilot study. 56&#xD;
      patients with MCI will be randomized into two groups i.e. Uncaria rhynchophylla and placebo&#xD;
      groups. All subjects will receive treatment twice a day for a consecutive 16 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that U. rhynchophylla may have good therapeutic efficacy for the treatment&#xD;
      of MCI. However, up to now, there exists no clinical data to support the use of&#xD;
      U.rhynchophylla for MCI. To evaluate the efficacy of U. rhynchophylla for MCI, the&#xD;
      investigator will use a fully automatic retinal image analysis (ARIA) method to estimate the&#xD;
      WMH and use this as one of the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a Chinese herbal&#xD;
      preparation U. rhynchophylla for subjects with mild cognitive impairment. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that treatment with U. rhynchophylla is able to significantly improve the cognitive function&#xD;
      of subjects with MCI and reduce the white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in the brain of these&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a treatment of either Uncaria&#xD;
      rhynchophylla or placebo for 16 weeks followed by 8 weeks observation. All subjects, both of&#xD;
      the intervention and control group, will receive standard routine care from the conventional&#xD;
      healthcare system.&#xD;

    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. Scoring of HK MoCA ranges from 0 to 30 points. 3 cutoff percentile will be used: 2nd, 7th, and 16th percentile. The cut-off percentile at 16th above is considered normal and it shows worse with the decreasing percentile.</description>

    <description>White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) is closely associated with multiple brain functions. It is an objective surrogate marker for MCI/dementia. The severity of WMH changes can be estimated by taking the fundus retinal image and put to the ARIA algorithm, the scale ranges from 0 to 3, increasing score means increasing severity.</description>
