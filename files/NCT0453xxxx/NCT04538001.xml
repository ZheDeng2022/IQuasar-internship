    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study aiming to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the rotator cuff function restoration balloon in patients&#xD;
      with irreparable rotator cuff tear compared to partial repair of the rotator cuff.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical study is designed to enroll 112&#xD;
      subjects with irreparable rotator cuff tear and randomly assign them to the trial and control&#xD;
      groups on a 1:1 basis.The experimental group was treated with rotator cuff restoration&#xD;
      balloon, and the control group was treated with rotator cuff partial repair. The main end&#xD;
      point of the study was improvement of the Constant Score at 6 months after the surgery. All&#xD;
      subjects were followed up clinically at 1 day, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after&#xD;
      the surgery, and were followed up with imaging examination at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year&#xD;
      after the surgery.&#xD;
