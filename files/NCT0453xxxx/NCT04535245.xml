      This National Jewish Health (NJH) Investigator Initiated pilot study funded by the Shah&#xD;
      Foundation will prospectively perform a non invasive lung function test called Lung Clearance&#xD;
      Index (LCI) to determine if 50 scleroderma patients without evidence of lung disease who have&#xD;
      evidence of small airway inflammation or impairment to airflow are more likely to develop ILD&#xD;
      than those with normal vales.50 subjects will be enrolled from the Rheumatology practice at&#xD;
      NJH and followed with phone interviews or Electronic Medical Record (EMR) record review&#xD;
      yearly times 5 to determine if they have subsequently developed evidence of ILD or pulmonary&#xD;
      artery hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 scleroderma patients without evidence of lung disease who have been seen by an NJH&#xD;
      Rheumatologist will be invited to participate. They will have their medical records reviewed&#xD;
      to determine eligibility and then perform hand held spirometry and LCI testing. This measures&#xD;
      evidence of small airway airflow obstruction and requires normal breathing while first on&#xD;
      room air followed by inhaling a gas mixture of 100% oxygen. The Oxygen concentration in&#xD;
      exhaled breathing and the number of breaths needed to return to room air concentration of&#xD;
      Oxygen will be analyzed by a computer. Medical information from the EMR will be recorded and&#xD;
      placed in a secure database, REDCap, for statistical analysis to determine if LCI results or&#xD;
      other clinical features are predictive of which Scleroderma patients are most likely to&#xD;
      subsequently develop evidence of Interstitial Lung disease (ILD) based upon yearly phone call&#xD;
      interviews and EMR record reviews within 5 years of baseline testing.&#xD;

    <measure>The Utility of Lung Clearance Index Scores at predicting Interstitial Lung disease ( ILD) development within 5 years among Scleroderma patients without ILD.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years after baseline testing</time_frame>
    <description>Lung clearance index values (LCI) will be measured from all Scleroderma patients at baseline (normal value is &lt; 7 ). The LCI scores from the cohort of Scleroderma patients who subsequently develop ILD based upon physician review of the EMR or phone interviews will be compared to the LCI scores from those scleroderma patients who did not develop ILD. Statistical analysis of LCI scores between both cohorts will determine the potential clinical utility of this non-invasive measurement of lung function in identifying those scleroderma patients who are at greatest risk for the subsequent development of ILD so treatment can be initiated early in their disease before irreversible pulmonary fibrosis develops.</description>
