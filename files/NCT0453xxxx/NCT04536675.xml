  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of perioperative&#xD;
      dual bronchodilator therapy on post-operative pulmonary function and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL) in mild-to-moderate less symptomatic COPD patients undergoing lung cancer&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesized that dual bronchodilator, as compared with placebo, would prevent&#xD;
      reduction of pulmonary function after surgical resection and improve postoperative health&#xD;
      related QoL.&#xD;
