  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is rapidly increasing in low- and middle-income countries, where it is&#xD;
      inexpensive, readily available, poorly regulated, and there are few resources devoted to&#xD;
      promoting safe alcohol use. A Brief Intervention based on a motivational interviewing&#xD;
      framework has been shown to reduce alcohol use and alcohol-related harms. The investigators&#xD;
      have translated and adapted a Brief Intervention for alcohol to the Tanzanian context and&#xD;
      Swahili language called &quot;Punguza Pombe Kwa Afya Yako (PPKAY)/ Reduce Alcohol for Your&#xD;
      Health.&quot; This project will evaluate this intervention in injury patients presenting for care&#xD;
      at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center in Moshi, Tanzania. By using innovative adaptive&#xD;
      clinical trial methods, the investigators will expedite the development of the most effective&#xD;
      way to integrate this intervention into clinical care. By the end of this project,&#xD;
      investigators will have identified the most effective brief intervention components and be&#xD;
      able to characterize the intervention's effect overall. Additionally, investigators will&#xD;
      standardize adaptive trial methods to revolutionize the science of clinical trials for&#xD;
      behavioral sciences in low-resource settings.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Study Phase 1: The investigators will evaluate whether PPKAY with personalized text booster or PPKAY with standard text booster will reduce the quantity or frequency of alcohol use, the number of binge drinking events or the number of alcohol-related consequences based on the Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC) compared to usual care.&#xD;
Study Phase 2: The investigators will evaluate whether a standard or personalized text booster is an inferior supplement to PPKAY.&#xD;
Study Phase 3: The investigators will evaluate if PPKAY alone is more or less effective compared to the superior arm from Study Phase 2 (PPKAY with personalized text booster or PPKAY with standard text booster).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>After discharge from the hospital, a personalized motivational text message will be sent to participant cell phones twice monthly for the duration of the study. In a rotating fashion, one of four personalized motivational texts will be sent to their cell phones. Personalized texts will be created with the content obtained from the motivational interview sessions. At each session, the research nurse conducting the intervention will record four messages based on the content of the session to be sent as the Personalized Booster.</description>
