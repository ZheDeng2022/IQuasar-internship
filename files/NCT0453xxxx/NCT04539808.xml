  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial evaluates whether early switching from modified&#xD;
      fluorouracil/irinotecan/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) chemotherapy regimen to a&#xD;
      combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GA) before surgery is effective in treating&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer that can be surgically removed (resectable or borderline&#xD;
      resectable), or that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes and cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery (locally-advanced unresectable). Chemotherapy drugs, such as fluorouracil,&#xD;
      irinotecan, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. The study will also evaluate the drug losartan&#xD;
      in combination with mFOLFIRINOX or GA.&#xD;

      following treatment using NeoOPTIMIZE adaptive therapy (i.e., FOLFIRINOX alone, or switch to&#xD;
      GA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the PFS of LAPC participants that received NeoOPTIMIZE adaptive therapy&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      mFOLFIRINOX REGIMEN: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, leucovorin&#xD;
      calcium IV over 2 hours, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients&#xD;
      also receive fluorouracil IV over 46 hours starting on day 1. Treatment with mFOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      repeats every 14 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo disease restaging (re-stage I). Patients with&#xD;
      radiographic response and no disease progression receive mFOLFIRINOX for an additional 2&#xD;
      months (approximately 4 cycles). Patients then undergo second re-staging (re-stage II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GA REGIMEN: After re-stage I, patients with disease progression or toxicity to mFOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      (per assessment of the treating physician) switch to receive the GA regimen comprising&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30-40 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo second re-staging&#xD;
      (re-stage II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOSARTAN: Starting cycle 1 day 1, patients also receive losartan potassium orally (PO) once&#xD;
      daily (QD) until completion of RT in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT/SURGERY: Patients with no vascular tumor involvement at re-stage II, undergo surgery 1-4&#xD;
      after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with resolution of tumor contact with pancreatic&#xD;
      vasculature at re-stage II, undergo short-course RT to receive a total of 10 fractions over 5&#xD;
      days weekly (Monday-Friday). Patients with tumor vessel involvement that is persistent at&#xD;
      re-stage II, undergo long-course RT to receive a total of 15-25 fractions over 5 days weekly&#xD;
      (Monday-Friday), and receive capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on Monday-Friday or&#xD;
      fluorouracil IV over 5-7 days weekly until completion of RT. Patients then undergo surgery&#xD;
      1-4 weeks after completion RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      6 months, and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants currently receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or&#xD;
             angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) will remain eligible for study participation. In&#xD;
             such cases, losartan will not be assigned as part of the study intervention. These&#xD;
             participants will continue to receive their ACE inhibitor or ARB per standard-of-care.&#xD;

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations, or any condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would: interfere with evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of&#xD;
             participant safety or study results, or substantially increase risk of incurring&#xD;
             adverse events (AEs), or compromise the ability of the patient to give written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if&#xD;
