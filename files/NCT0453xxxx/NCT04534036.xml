  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data support the use of specific probiotic strains in a pediatric population. However,&#xD;
      given the wide number of commercial products available, and contradictory data in the&#xD;
      literature, healthcare providers and consumers are uncertain about whether or not to use&#xD;
      probiotics in children and which one(s) to choose. While much progress has been made in&#xD;
      understanding the gastrointestinal microbiota and its role in the balanced development of the&#xD;
      infant immune system, the tolerability and efficacy of introducing beneficial microbes into&#xD;
      the pediatric gastrointestinal tract remain underexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a 9 strain synbiotic consortium&#xD;
      comprised of strains with previous pediatric clinical data for use in modulating airway&#xD;
      sensitivity, gastrointestinal discomfort, dermatological inflammation, and reduction in the&#xD;
      duration and severity of upper respiratory tract infections in a pediatric population.&#xD;

      During infancy and childhood, environmental factors including the maternal vaginal and skin&#xD;
      microbiomes, breast milk microbiota, breast milk, geographic location, and use of antibiotics&#xD;
      will exert significant influence over the offspring's microbiota and have a determinant&#xD;
      impact on their health later in life. Unfavorable environmental exposures, coupled with an&#xD;
      immature immune system in early life can, therefore, confer suboptimal immune responses that&#xD;
      can lead to the development of extra-gastrointestinal conditions such as allergic rhinitis,&#xD;
      asthma, and atopic dermatitis-which affects 15-20% of the world's population. Furthermore,&#xD;
      while the indiscriminate use of antibiotics has decreased, they remain standard-of-care for&#xD;
      most childhood infections, and unfortunately, often result in short- or long-term disruption&#xD;
      of the patient's microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constipation is a common childhood gastrointestinal disorder, with a worldwide prevalence&#xD;
      between 0.7-29.6%. Its etiology is multifactorial and usually not due to underlying&#xD;
      conditions. Few studies have explored the implications of the intestinal or fecal microbiota&#xD;
      in childhood constipation, yet some have shown benefits of various probiotic compositions in&#xD;
      reducing transit time and improving bowel movement frequency. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome&#xD;
      may play an important role in functional constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDS-08™ is a novel synbiotic, comprised of nine probiotic bacterial strains and&#xD;
      fructooligosaccharide with inulin (FOS-inulin) as a prebiotic. A synbiotic is defined as a&#xD;
      probiotic (&quot;live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health&#xD;
      benefit on the host&quot;) plus an established prebiotic (&quot;a substrate that is selectively&#xD;
      utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit&quot;)-or, an untested live microbe&#xD;
      co-administered with a substrate that it selectively utilizes. The selected probiotics and&#xD;
      prebiotic in the PDS-08 formulation have shown to improve antibiotic-associated diarrhea,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis,&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, and/or microbiota modulation. The positive outcomes&#xD;
      of these respective studies warrants further investigation of the strains as part of a&#xD;
      probiotic consortium with the potential to modulate the microbiota, regulate dysbiosis, and&#xD;
      confer a benefit to host health. There is a need for additional systematic studies on&#xD;
      probiotic administration in pediatric populations, with a focus on measuring shifts in the&#xD;
      fecal microbiota and markers of gut health and function. Therefore, the objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of a novel synbiotic in healthy&#xD;
      children with occasional constipation, over 12 weeks, as compared to a sensory-matched&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, 12-week study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of PDS-08 in a&#xD;
      cohort of 100 healthy children with constipation. 50 subjects will receive PDS-08™ over 12&#xD;
      weeks, and 50 subjects will receive a placebo. Subjects will provide stool samples at&#xD;
      baseline and week 12. Safety is a paramount concern in the study design and will be monitored&#xD;
      carefully throughout the study. Parents or direct relative guardians of study subjects will&#xD;
      receive extensive education on synbiotic use.&#xD;

    <measure>Average increase from baseline of Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) score by ≥ 1 point (stool characterized as an increase to either type 2 or 3 or 4) in the intervention group, compared to the placebo group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by daily stool characteristics reported using the seven-point ordinal BSFS score. The BSFS classifies human stool into seven types and scores them accordingly. Type 1: Separate hard lumps (hard to pass) Type 2: Sausage-shaped and lumpy Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface Type 4: Like a sausage, smooth and soft Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily) Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation, with 3 through 5 represent the ideal stool form, and 6 and 7 tend towards diarrhea.&#xD;
For a given assessment week, the weekly stool consistency is defined as the sum of non-missing stool consistency score for spontaneous bowel movements during that week divided by the number of non-missing stool consistency scores for spontaneous bowel movements during that week. The parameter will be analyzed using a linear mixed model.</description>
