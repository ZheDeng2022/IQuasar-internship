      Determine the feasibility of adapting Fit &amp; Strong!, an evidence-based group physical&#xD;

      The specific aims of this pilot are to use a small RCT with a waitlist control design to: 1)&#xD;
      Determine the feasibility of adapting Fit &amp; Strong! to include affect and mood-related&#xD;
      content and of employing this intervention among older adults with a range of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. 2) Begin to determine whether Fit &amp; Strong! is efficacious as an approach for&#xD;
      improving positive affect, reducing negative affect, decreasing symptoms of depression, and&#xD;
      improving cognition among older adults. 3) Explore the relationship between negative/positive&#xD;
      affect and symptoms of depression and maintenance of physical activity between baseline and 2&#xD;
      months, in order to determine whether improved positive affect and reduced negative affect&#xD;
      and depression and improved cognition are associated with an increase in physical activity.&#xD;

    <description>The 8-week intervention will consist of the Fit &amp; Strong! program adapted to address the impact of exercise on enhancing positive affect and reducing negative affect and depressive symptoms. Exercise classes will meet three times per week for 90 minutes per session for eight weeks. Each class is divided into 60 minutes of strength training, flexibility, and cardiovascular exercise and 30 minutes of group education/discussion, which has been adapted to include affect-oriented content.</description>
