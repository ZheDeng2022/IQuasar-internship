  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the biomarker of a-synuclein aggregate in CSF detected by protein&#xD;
      misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and its sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease at H-Y stage I and disease duration less than 1 year, compared with that&#xD;
      from age-matched controls without neurodegeneration, those with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)&#xD;
      as a disease control with a-synucleinopathy, and those with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy&#xD;
      (PSP) as a control with non-a-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an observational study aiming to develop the protein misfolding cyclic&#xD;
      amplification (PMCA) technology that detects minute amounts of αSyn aggregates circulating in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a novel assay with high sensitivity and specificity for the&#xD;
      early diagnosis of PD. To achieve this goal, we will apply the PMCA to detect the αSyn&#xD;
      aggregates in the CSF samples acquired from a discovery cohort that consist of&#xD;
      well-characterized early PD patients (disease duration ≤1 year and Hoehn and Yahr Stage I,&#xD;
      and DAT-PET and FDG-PET meet the imaging features of PD, n=75) and gender, age-matched&#xD;
      healthy controls (n=38). Furthermore, we will confirm the findings in a separate confirmatory&#xD;
      cohort with well-characterized early PD patients (disease duration ≤1 year and Hoehn and Yahr&#xD;
      Stage I, and DAT-PET and FDG-PET meet the imaging features of PD, n=75), early multiple&#xD;
      system atrophy (MSA) patients (disease duration ≤1 year, n=38), early progressive&#xD;
      supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients (disease duration ≤1 year, n=38) and age-matched healthy&#xD;
      controls (n=38). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive&#xD;
      value, and area under curve of the PMCA for the early diagnosis of PD will be calculated in&#xD;
      the discovery cohort and be confirmed in the confirmatory cohort, respectively. In addition,&#xD;
      the clinical characteristics, including motor and nonmotor symptoms of early PD, MSA and PSP&#xD;
      patients in the two cohort will be comprehensively assessed at baseline and during&#xD;
      followed-up. To assess the value of the PMCA technology in the evaluation of the disease&#xD;
      severity and progress, we will perform the partial correlation analysis between clinical&#xD;
      features of early PD patients and the PMCA T50 defined as the time needed to reach 50% of the&#xD;
      maximum aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misfolded αSyn aggregates have the potential to serve as a biomarker for early PD. The PMCA&#xD;
      technology could detect small quantities of misfolded αSyn aggregates by taking advantage of&#xD;
      their ability to nucleate further aggregation, enabling a very high amplification of the&#xD;
      signal. This study examines the effectiveness of using the PMCA as a novel technique for&#xD;
      discriminating early PD from gender, age-matched healthy controls and other early&#xD;
      parkinsonian disorders (MSA, PSP) by detecting small misfolded αSyn aggregates in CSF.&#xD;
