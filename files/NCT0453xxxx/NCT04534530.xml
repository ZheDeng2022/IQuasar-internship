  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of SCADIAB is to assess the real-life efficiency of systematic screening for&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease in T2DM patients at very high cardiovascular risk, without known&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, from the databases of the National Health Data System (SNDS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      overall mortality. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, primarily ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease, which is often early and can occur in asymptomatic diabetic patients, hence&#xD;
      the potential benefit of routine screening to improve their cardiovascular prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a notable disparity between the recommendations of the french High Authority of&#xD;
      Health (HAS) and those of learned societies. The HAS does not recommend routine screening for&#xD;
      silent ischemic heart disease in all asymptomatic T2DM patients without known coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, apart from a resting electrocardiogram (ECG). Functional cardiovascular examinations&#xD;
      should be reserved for situations of high cardiovascular risk, particularly the presence of&#xD;
      history, clinical symptoms or ECG abnormalities in favor of cardiovascular disease. On the&#xD;
      other hand, the main learned societies of diabetology and cardiology recommend systematic&#xD;
      screening for silent ischemic heart disease in a larger T2DM population (age&gt; 60 years,&#xD;
      duration of diabetes&gt; 10 years and at least 2 cardiovascular risk factors). In terms of&#xD;
      current clinical practice, a majority of physicians prescribe screening for silent ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease in diabetic patients by functional examinations (stress test, myocardial&#xD;
      tomoscintigraphy coupled with a stress test, stress echocardiography) . The investigators&#xD;
      carried out two surveys with fellow cardiologists and diabetologists in Bordeaux and at the&#xD;
      national level which confirm this frequent practice of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of scientific evidence currently seems sufficient not to recommend systematic&#xD;
      screening for silent ischemic heart disease in all diabetic patients. Four main randomized&#xD;
      and controlled studies have not shown any benefit from this screening in terms of reducing&#xD;
      major cardiovascular events in all T2DM patients. However, doubt remains in T2DM patients at&#xD;
      very high cardiovascular risk, who may benefit from this strategy, but in whom no studies&#xD;
      have been performed to date.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Among the 3.3 million people treated pharmacologically for diabetes mellitus in France, at&#xD;
        least 3 million would be T2DM. It can be assumed that at least 2.4 million are free from&#xD;
        coronary heart disease (33). This survey also shows that arterial hypertension and&#xD;
        dyslipidemia (the two main cardiovascular risk factors) are present respectively in 58% and&#xD;
        57% of T2DM patients, and renal, neuropathic, or retinal complications are present&#xD;
        respectively in 10%, 11% and 8% of them. Therefore, it can be estimated that at least&#xD;
        90,000 T2DM patients would be eligible (at least 2 cardiovascular risk factors and one&#xD;
        other vascular disease) to be included in the study.&#xD;
