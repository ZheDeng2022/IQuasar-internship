      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the common presentation of low back pain and lower extremities pain is lumbar&#xD;
      radicular pain which may be caused by a herniated intervertebral disc exerting a pressure on&#xD;
      nerve roots, resulting in pain, functional disability, opioid use for pain relief and&#xD;
      consuming health resources (1,2). Radicular pain has a typical shocking, lancinating, or&#xD;
      electric character traveling into the lower limb along a narrow band. In approximately 90% of&#xD;
      cases, radiculopathy is mainly due to a prolapsed disc causing nerve root impingement (3).&#xD;
      Different modalities of treatments are used in managing chronic low back pain and&#xD;
      radiculopathy. Most of the patients will respond well to conservative management. But after&#xD;
      the failure of this conservative treatment, either surgical or nonsurgical modalities such as&#xD;
      epidural injections are going to be considered in the treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (4).&#xD;
      Transforaminal epidural injection (TFEI) is a known approach for treatment of spinal nerve&#xD;
      root pathology. A transforaminal epidural directs medications at the nerve root as it leaves&#xD;
      the spinal cord at the ventrolateral aspect of the epidural space whereas a conventional&#xD;
      (interlaminar) epidural results in a small amount of medication over a wide area at the&#xD;
      posterior epidural space (5). A transforaminal epidural gives us the opportunity to allocate&#xD;
      the medications where they are required (6). Transforaminal epidural injections under&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance have emerged as the preferred approach to the epidural space (7). Many&#xD;
      drugs have been proven to be effective in managing low back pain when they are injected in&#xD;
      the epidural space by transforaminal approach such as local anesthetics, steroids and&#xD;
      adjuvants (7). Magnesium is a physiological blocker of the NMDA receptors (8) because it&#xD;
      blocks NMDA channels in a voltage-dependent manner, and such NMDA antagonist effect can&#xD;
      inhibit the induction of central sensitization from peripheral nociceptive stimulation&#xD;
      (9,10). Magnesium may suppress neuropathic pain (11), enhance morphine analgesia, attenuate&#xD;
      morphine tolerance (12), and improve fentanyl analgesia when magnesium is given intrathecally&#xD;
      (13). Magnesium deficiency produces hyperalgesia (14) and has been related to cause some&#xD;
      acute medical and surgical conditions in which pain or stress is present (15). Magnesium is&#xD;
      proved to be injected safely within the nervous tissue in animals (16) and in 2002 Asokumar&#xD;
      and his colleagues proved that magnesium is safely injected Intrathecal in human (17).&#xD;
      Because of the results of a previous study that indicates that intrathecal administration of&#xD;
      sulfate sault in magnesium has a risk of neurotoxicity (18), investigators preferred to use&#xD;
      preservative free magnesium in our study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of magnesium sulphate as an anti-neuropathic drug in relieving unilateral lower limb&#xD;
      radicular pain due to disc prolapse when it was injected with lidocaine and steroids in the&#xD;
      anterior epidural space using the transforaminal epidural approach. Our primary outcome was&#xD;
      to assess the improvement of pain score post-injection, while, the secondary outcome was to&#xD;
      evaluate the improvement of the functional ability and the satisfaction level of the patients&#xD;
      after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, The study IS approved by the local ethics committee (Fayoum Faculty of Medicine&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee R139 ). This prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blinded&#xD;
      study is going to be carried out in the pain management department of Fayoum University&#xD;
      Hospital. Written consents are going to be taken from all patients. The randomization is&#xD;
      going to be performed via sealed opaque envelopes. All procedures are going to be performed&#xD;
      by one investigator who is blind to the injected drugs used in this study. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      are patients of both gender, aged from 20 up to 70 years old, American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status grade I and II (19), admitted for pain management of&#xD;
      their unilateral lower limb radicular pain due to lumbo-sacral disc prolapse confirmed by&#xD;
      lumbo-sacral magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) after failure of conservative treatments in&#xD;
      the form of drug therapy and physiotherapy to control the pain for 6 weeks. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are patients with axial back pain without leg radiation, patients with motor&#xD;
      neurological deficits, previous spine surgeries, allergy to the study drugs used,&#xD;
      uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or hypertension, local or systemic infection, pregnancy, and&#xD;
      patients with any other neurological deficits as cauda equina. This study is going to be&#xD;
      conducted on 100 patients. Patients are going to be divided according to the injected drugs&#xD;
      into two equal groups (50 patients each):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group (C): where all patients will receive through the transforaminal epidural approach&#xD;
           2 ml of bupivacaine (0.5%), 1ml of methylprednisolone (40 mg) and 1 ml of normal saline&#xD;
           (0.9 %) with a total volume of 4 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group (M): where all patients will receive through the transforaminal epidural approach&#xD;
           2 ml of bupivacaine (0.5%), 1ml of methylprednisolone (40 mg) and 1 ml of preservative&#xD;
           free magnesium (200 mg) with a total volume of 4 ml. Methylprednisolone which is used in&#xD;
           this study is going to be supplied from E.I.P.I.C.O pharmaceuticals -Egypt under license&#xD;
           of UPJOHN s.a Puurs-Belgium (Depo-Medrol). Preservative free magnesium which is used in&#xD;
           the study is prepared in McGuff Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Laboratories and supplied in 50 ml&#xD;
           vials containing magnesium (200 mg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are going to be evaluated pre-operatively by medical history, clinical&#xD;
      examination, and lumbosacral spine MRI. The severity of pain is going to be assessed using&#xD;
      the visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 and 10 were marked on a 10cm linear scale (0- 4 mm = no&#xD;
      pain, 5-44 mm = mild pain, 45- 74 = moderate pain, 75-100 = severe pain) (20). Patients are&#xD;
      going to be evaluated for effective pain relief (defined as ≥50% reduction of pain perception&#xD;
      post-intervention by VAS. Functional assessment is done using Modified Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MODQ), which is formed of a10 item scale with six response categories each.&#xD;
      Each item scores from 0 to 5, higher scores being worse, which is transformed into a 0-100&#xD;
      scale. The ten items include pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting,&#xD;
      standing, sleeping, work, social life and traveling. Patients with scores between 0 to 20&#xD;
      have Minimal Disability, between 21 and 40 have Moderate Disability, between 41-60 have&#xD;
      Severe Disability, 61 to 80 are crippled and 81 to 100 are bed-bound or exaggerating their&#xD;
      symptoms, this questionnaire has been designed to give us information about how back or leg&#xD;
      pain is affecting the ability to manage in everyday life (21). VAS and MODQ are going to be&#xD;
      assessed immediately pre-intervention and at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic data for all patients as regards to age, gender, weight, and height are going&#xD;
      to be recorded and compared between the studied groups. Also, the pre-intervention clinical&#xD;
      examination data of all patients as regards to the level, the site of disc prolapse, and the&#xD;
      side of radiculopathy are going to be recorded and compared between the groups. The&#xD;
      occurrence of side effects is going to be recorded and compared between both groups&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of the intervention (affected nerve root) and the right versus the left sides of&#xD;
      radiating pain are going to be determined by both clinical examination and radiological&#xD;
      findings. Pre-intervention, an intravenous (IV) cannula is going to be inserted with&#xD;
      initiation of normal saline (0.9%) at a rate of 10 ml/kg to prevent hypotension. Emergency&#xD;
      drugs as atropine and ephedrine are going to be prepared. All patients are going to be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the procedure by electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure,&#xD;
      and pulse oximetry throughout the procedure and during the post-interventional time for 2&#xD;
      hours. Patients are going to be placed in a prone position with a pillow under their abdomen&#xD;
      (between the iliac crests) to decrease the lumbar lordosis. Mild sedation is going to be&#xD;
      given with 0.02 mg/kg of midazolam intravenously. TFEIs are going to be done under full&#xD;
      sterile technique using fluoroscopic guidance. After fluoroscopic detection of the desired&#xD;
      intervertebral level, the entry site is identified, and the skin is anesthetized with local&#xD;
      infiltration of 3 ml of lidocaine 1%. TFEI approach is performed under biplane fluoroscopic&#xD;
      guidance. While a patient lying in the prone position, the tube is rotated obliquely&#xD;
      approximately 10-30° toward the affected side to ensure injection at the neural foramen. The&#xD;
      goal of positioning is to allow a perpendicular needle tract toward the classic injection&#xD;
      site below the pedicle (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size has been calculated using the G*Power version 3.1.9 Software (Faul&#xD;
      et al., 2007) (23). The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients achieving&#xD;
      satisfactory response at 12 weeks after the procedure. Satisfactory response is defined as&#xD;
      reduction of the pain score by 50% or more from the pre-procedure value. Since no previous&#xD;
      study has compared the effect of adding magnesium sulfate or steroid to local anesthetic for&#xD;
      transforaminal block in patients with chronic LBP, investigators considered that a medium&#xD;
      effect size corresponding to a Cohen's ω of 0.3 would be clinically relevant. So,&#xD;
      investigators calculated that a sample size of 44 patients in either study group would&#xD;
      achieve a power of 80% to detect statistical significance for an effect size equivalent to&#xD;
      Cohen's ω of 0.3 regarding the proportion of patients achieving satisfactory response at 12&#xD;
      week after the procedure using a two-sided chi-squared test with an alpha error of 0.05.&#xD;
      Considering a drop-out rate of around 10%, 50 patients will be recruited in either group.&#xD;
