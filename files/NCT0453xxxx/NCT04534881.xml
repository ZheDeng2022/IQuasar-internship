      -  Purpose. The purpose of this research is study the effect of progesterone therapy on&#xD;
           testosterone levels in transwomen who are currently on gender affirming treatment with&#xD;
           estradiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration. It is expected that participation will last for 6 months (24 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Procedures. Participants will be asked to sign an informed consent, complete a&#xD;
           medical history, have a physical exam conducted, have a fasting blood sample taken and&#xD;
           asked to take a study drug once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risks. Some of the foreseeable risks or discomforts include temporary discomfort,&#xD;
           bleeding, bruising and/or swelling in the arm from blood draw. There are no known direct&#xD;
           risks with the use of Progesterone in Transwomen for gender affirming therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Benefits. Some of the possible benefits that may be expected include increase in fat&#xD;
           mass, increase in breast size/fullness, decrease in masculine hair patterns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of individuals with gender incongruence who present to their physician for hormone&#xD;
      therapy has increased manifold in the last decade. Testosterone therapy in transgender men&#xD;
      (also known as female-to-male transgender or transmen) and estrogen therapy in transgender&#xD;
      women (also known as male-to-female transgender or transwomen) respectively is the mainstay&#xD;
      of hormone regimen.Transwomen, who are genetically men, receive estradiol replacement with&#xD;
      the aim of suppressing serum testosterone and achieving serum estradiol concentrations that&#xD;
      mimic the serum concentrations of biological women. This leads to an increase in fat mass,&#xD;
      breast growth and decreases in lean mass and masculine pattern hair. However, the results of&#xD;
      these changes are often less than satisfactory and additional therapy is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast development is a major concern for transgender females. There is a great deal of&#xD;
      variability among individuals, as evidenced during pubertal development.Transgender women do&#xD;
      not achieve the same level of breast development as cisgender women do after puberty.&#xD;
      Typically, transgender women plateau at Tanner stage III and half of the transgender women&#xD;
      have a AAA cup size or less.Investigators plan to conduct a randomized, placebo controlled&#xD;
      double blind study evaluating the effect of adding progesterone for 6 months to transwomen&#xD;
      who are being treated with estradiol. The hypothesis is that progesterone will decrease serum&#xD;
      testosterone concentrations as compared to placebo and increase breast size. Investigators&#xD;
      will also assess its role in mood, sleep, scalp hair and androgenic hair growth.&#xD;
