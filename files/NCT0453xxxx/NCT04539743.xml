  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The creation of an abdominal continental cystostomy orifice is an irreplaceable surgical&#xD;
      technique that allows for the simple self-sounding of the bladder in patients with severe&#xD;
      disabilities or malformations, and to obtain urinary continence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This operation, the principle of which was described by Paul Mitrofanoff in 1980, has&#xD;
      benefited from countless descriptions, difficult realization and questionable design, so it&#xD;
      is insufficiently proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faced with this learning difficulty at the beginning of the year, we decided to define a&#xD;
      &quot;step-by-step&quot; technique, in seven well-differentiated steps. This approach has simplified&#xD;
      the teaching and dissemination of this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate its quality, it is necessary to evaluate the expected results of a continental&#xD;
      cystostomy, by answering two simple questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -is the cystostomy opening really continent? Is the cystostomy tube easy to catheterize?&#xD;

      This research consists in highlighting that the Mitrofanoff surgery technique used by the&#xD;
      CHUGA surgeons during a cystostomy is easier to perform while having the necessary same&#xD;
      results as the other methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, we must validate the quality of this method and therefore we will evaluate the&#xD;
      results expected from a continuous cystostomy via a questionnaire. After a first telephone&#xD;
      contact by Dr BOILLOT for a presentation of the study, patient will therefore be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone by the Clinical Research Associate of the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this interview patient will be asked to answer a questionnaire consisting of five&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
