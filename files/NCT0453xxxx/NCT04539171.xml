    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a pain neuroscience education (PNE) and physical exercise&#xD;
      (PE) program in women with fibromyalgia. The intervention group receives PNE and PE program&#xD;
      supervised by a physiotherapist and a Family Doctor and the control group standard care, in&#xD;
      primary care.&#xD;

      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a PNE and PE in patients with fibromyalgia (FM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Quasi-experimental, controlled, non-randomized study, in Primary Care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 6 weekly sessions (2 hours each), and a reminder session one month later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main measurements: Compliance with FM criteria, assessed using the Widespread Pain Index&#xD;
      (WPI) and the Severity of Symptoms (SS) questionnaires, impact of FM in daily life&#xD;
      (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire: FIQ) and quality of live. Assessments are made at&#xD;
      baseline, one month following the 6th session, and during the 6- and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>2010 American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Criteria for fibromyalgia: dichotomous variable (complies or does not comply). A patient satisfies diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia if the following 3 conditions are met:&#xD;
Widespread pain index (WPI) ≥7 and symptom severity (SS) scale score ≥5 or WPI 3-6 and SS scale score ≥9.&#xD;
Symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months.&#xD;
The patient does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the pain.&#xD;
WPI: number of areas in which the patient has had pain over the last week (score between 0 and 19), with 0 = fully active and 5 = dead).&#xD;
SS: sum of the severity of 3 symptoms (fatigue, waking unrefreshed, cognitive symptoms) plus the extent (severity) of somatic symptoms in general (final score between 0 and 12: higher scores mean a worse outcome)</description>
