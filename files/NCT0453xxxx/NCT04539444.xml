  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of CD19/22 CART cells combined with PD-1 Inhibitor in relapsed/refractory B Cell&#xD;
      Lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Though response rates have greatly improved with the development of Chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      T cells (CART) therapy in refractory/relapsed B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R B-NHL), the&#xD;
      response can't usually last long and relapse occurs in a large proportion of patients who&#xD;
      receive CART cells infusion. The main reasons of relapse might be tumor antigen loss and a&#xD;
      lack of CART cell persistence. Currently, preclinical studies have shown that there is a&#xD;
      synergistic effect between CAR-T cell therapy and anti-PD1 pathway, and it did have efficacy&#xD;
      in clinic. In parallel, the combined use of CART-19 and CART-22 cells has a better potential&#xD;
      to reduce antigen escape and increase anti-tumor activity. Therefore, the combination of&#xD;
      CD19/22 CART and PD-1 inhibitor is one of the ways to improve the therapeutic effect of CART&#xD;
      cells. This study was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of CD19/22 CART cells in&#xD;
      R/R B-NHL.&#xD;
