      influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) versus MCM Vaccine BV's&#xD;
      DTaP5-HBV-IPV-Hib vaccine administered to healthy infants and toddlers, between 6 and 12&#xD;
      weeks of age at the time of first vaccination, based on a 2-, 4-, and 12-months of age&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR[s]) who, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g.,&#xD;
             return for follow-up visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written or witnessed/thumb printed informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s)&#xD;
             of the subject prior to performing any study specific procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male or female child between and including 6 and 12 weeks of age (42 to 84 days) at&#xD;
             the time of the first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject born after at least 37 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy subjects as established by the investigator based on medical history and the&#xD;
             clinical examination before entering into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might pose any risk&#xD;
             to the subject due to participation in the study. As with other vaccines,&#xD;
             administration of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib should be postponed in subjects suffering from&#xD;
             acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a&#xD;
             contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Hib&#xD;
             diseases since birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be caused or exacerbated by any&#xD;
             excipient or active component of the vaccine(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including&#xD;
             malignancies, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing&#xD;
             required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major congenital defects, as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or chronic clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal&#xD;
             functional abnormality, as determined via medical history including physical&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical history of neurological disorder, including seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous vaccination for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, HBV, poliomyelitis, Hib&#xD;
             diseases and previous vaccination against pneumococcal infection with pneumococcal&#xD;
             conjugate vaccine, with the exception of a birth dose of HBV vaccine, which may be&#xD;
             given in accordance with local recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug, vaccine, or medical device)&#xD;
             other than the study vaccine(s) during the period starting 30 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of study vaccine(s) (Day -29 to Day 1), or planned use during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol&#xD;
             in the period starting 30 days before the first dose and ending 30 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of vaccine(s) with the exception of administration of vaccines given as part of&#xD;
             the national immunization schedule and as part of routine vaccination practice, e.g.,&#xD;
             rotavirus vaccine, that are allowed at any time during the study period. In case&#xD;
             emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g., a pandemic)&#xD;
             is organized by public health authorities outside the routine immunization programme,&#xD;
             the time period described above can be reduced if necessary for that mass vaccination&#xD;
             vaccine, provided this vaccine/product(s) is licensed and used according to its&#xD;
             Product Information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs in the period starting 30 days&#xD;
             before the first dose and at any time during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products or plasma derivatives from&#xD;
             birth or planned administration during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants&#xD;
             or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting 3 months prior to the first&#xD;
             vaccine. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥0.5 mg/kg/day (for paediatric&#xD;
             subjects), or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study&#xD;
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a&#xD;
             non-investigational vaccine/product (drug or medical device).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child in care.&#xD;
