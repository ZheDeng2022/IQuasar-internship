  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, double-blind, randomised, controlled, multicentre trial of topical&#xD;
      HDIT101 versus placebo. HSV-1-positive patients with at least 6 orolabial herpes lesions in&#xD;
      the last 12 months can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients need to present with 3 herpes lesions within a 9 months observation phase. With&#xD;
      the occurrence of the third lesion, the patients will enter the 12 months treatment phase and&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to topical HDIT or placebo applied over 2 days. A potential&#xD;
      fourth lesion will also be treated with the blinded study medication and additional lesions&#xD;
      will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a 12 months post-trial follow-up phase, further information on the occurence of lesions&#xD;
      will be collected 4 times by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration per patient will be up to 21 months plus 12 months post-trial follow-up by&#xD;
      phone. Patients need to come for study visits up to 9 times.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, double-blind, randomised, controlled, multicentre trial of topical&#xD;
      HDIT101 versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 138 eligible patients will be randomised at a ratio of 2:1 to topical HDIT or&#xD;
      corresponding placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of 3 parts: An observation phase (up to 9 months), a treatment phase of 12&#xD;
      months, and a post-trial follow-up phase of additional 12 months: The observation phase&#xD;
      ensures that the patient develops a minimum number of lesions during the trial. In the 12&#xD;
      months treatment phase, blinded study treatment consisting of topical HDIT101 or placebo is&#xD;
      applied to the patients at the first and second lesion episode. After completion of the&#xD;
      treatment phase, patients are followed for additional 12 months for assessment of the&#xD;
      development of further lesions (post-trial follow-up phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation phase (max. 9 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients suffering from chronic recurrent herpes orolabialis for at least 12 months&#xD;
      and reporting â‰¥ 6 lesions in the last 12 months can enter the observation phase. This part of&#xD;
      the study serves for confirmation that patients develop a minimum number of 3 lesions within&#xD;
      the 9 months observation period. No study treatment is applied in the observation phase, but&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment (SoC) can optionally be applied. Single swabs should additionally&#xD;
      be taken from the lesion for confirmation of HSV-1 positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not developing 3 lesions with an HSV lesion score 3-7 during the 9 months&#xD;
      observation phase are considered screening failures and will not be randomised into the&#xD;
      treatment part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised, double-blind treatment phase (12 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase consists of four scheduled visits (day 30/120/240/365) and unscheduled visits for&#xD;
      treatment of lesion 3 and 4, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have developed 3 outbreaks within the observational phase will enter the&#xD;
      treatment phase. The third of these lesions will already be treated. Notably, patients do not&#xD;
      have to complete the 9 months observation phase if they develop the 3rd lesion earlier -&#xD;
      treatment starts with occurrence of a 3rd lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the occurrence of lesion 3 within the 9 months observation phase, patients need to&#xD;
      schedule a visit at the study site when a vesicle is present. If the patient meets all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, randomisation takes place. An electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO)&#xD;
      tool will be installed on the patients' devices and questionnaires will be answered. The&#xD;
      lesion will be documented in the ePRO app with a photo. A swab of the lesion will be taken&#xD;
      which preferably should contain fluid from the vesicular lesion. Subsequently, blinded IMP&#xD;
      will be applied to the lesion. The investigator will determine the lesion start and end date&#xD;
      based on information provided by the patient. 3 additional vials of study IMP for further&#xD;
      treatment of this lesion will be handed over to the patient for self-application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon occurrence of a fourth lesion in the treatment phase, the same procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated at another unscheduled visit at the site when a vesicle is present. Again, IMP will&#xD;
      be handed over to the patient for further treatment of this lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subsequent lesions occurring during the 12 months treatment phase need to be documented&#xD;
      by the patient by photos and questionnaires. At each lesion episode, single swabs will be&#xD;
      taken, but no further IMP will be applied and no unscheduled visit is necessary, but phone&#xD;
      calls. The investigator will assess and medically confirm the lesion to be herpes-related and&#xD;
      will determine the lesion start and end date based on information and photos provided by the&#xD;
      patient and patient entries in the ePRO. Standard-of-care treatment (SoC) can optionally be&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments and Examinations during the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all phases of the trial, patients need to report disease-specific symptoms and&#xD;
      outbreak impact upon recognition of first symptoms during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orolabial viral shedding of patients is assessed by quantitative real time polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (qRT-PCR) derived from swabs. These will be taken daily for 28 days in the orolabial&#xD;
      region during the 9 months observation period starting after lesion 2, at occurrence of&#xD;
      lesion 3 at visit 3 and 4 months after randomisation (starting at visit 5), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each lesion recurrence has to be documented by the patient in the patient eDiary. In case of&#xD;
      development of new lesions after lesion 3 or 4, patients will be instructed to take a swab of&#xD;
      the lesion and provide this to the site for HSV-1 PCR outbreak confirmation. The patients&#xD;
      must take photos (preferably daily) of the lesion until healing. These photos will be&#xD;
      transferred to the sites' source data. The investigator will assess and medically confirm the&#xD;
      lesion to be herpes-related and will determine the lesion start and end date based on&#xD;
      information and photos provided by the patient and patient entries in the electronic diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions will be rated according to a lesion score. For every lesion episode (outbreak),&#xD;
      patients will be asked to report disease specific symptoms and outbreak impact in electronic&#xD;
      questionnaires on a daily basis, from recognition of first symptoms until complete resolution&#xD;
      of the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-trial follow-up phase (12 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment phase, patients are further followed-up by phone every 3 months for a&#xD;
      total duration of additional 12 months.&#xD;
