  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of entecavir and tenofovir versus entecavir alone in the&#xD;
      antiviral treatment of HBV DNA positive B-cell lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll about 120 participants in total. Recruitment will last for 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study visit will take place on the first day of each cycle of therapy until the end of&#xD;
      the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      entecavir and tenofovir or entecavir alone after signing the informed consent. HBV DNA will&#xD;
      be measured before each cycle of chemotherapy or immunotherapy. When the copy count of HBV&#xD;
      DNA drops below 1*10^3/L, entecavir single agent will be given orally, until one year after&#xD;
      the cycle of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment response will be evaluated routinely after chemotherapy or immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 years after the last participant is enrolled, participants' survival information&#xD;
      will collected by telephone and/or clinical visit every 3 months after the last visit (i.e.&#xD;
      date and cause of death, subsequent cancer treatment, etc.), if there is no withdrawal of the&#xD;
      informed consent form.&#xD;
