  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most General Surgery program directors have expressed the necessity to educate residents on&#xD;
      the business aspect of medicine. However, the literature review did not produce any&#xD;
      interventional studies directly addressing coding and documentation in General Surgery&#xD;
      Residents. The purpose of this study is to address specific coding and documentation mistakes&#xD;
      as identified by surgery coding analysts in the surgical department. Through this&#xD;
      examination, we hope to provide residents with the necessary tools and framework for adequate&#xD;
      documentation throughout their surgical careers.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that residents have limited knowledge on documentation requirements.&#xD;
      However, correct coding and documentation plays a pivotal role in today's health care system.&#xD;
      Inadequate billing and coding in health record documentation can constitute fraud and abuse.&#xD;
      Surgeons that are trained on proper billing and coding can be instrumental to reducing waste&#xD;
      and increasing efficiency throughout the sphere of health care. The low quality of physician&#xD;
      documentation has been widely recognized; however, definitive measures correcting the&#xD;
      situation are absent. Truthfully, most residents are unaware that ICD-9 data is used for&#xD;
      planning, reimbursement, quality rating, Medicare Conditions of Participation, JCAHO Core&#xD;
      Measures thereby reinforcing the lack of understanding regarding the importance of such&#xD;
      codes.Lack of education and time constraints results in poor physician documentation and as a&#xD;
      consequence, inadequate coding leads to delayed or denied reimbursements. Several studies&#xD;
      have shown under-billing and down-coding from resident encounters. However, no interventional&#xD;
      studies directly addressing coding and documentation in General Surgery Residents were&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To educate general surgery residents on proper documentation; therefore,&#xD;
      facilitating coding analyst efficiency by increasing processing time and employee&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Increasing note clarity will improve coding analyst productivity and output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To ensure fair and accurate re-imbursement by appropriate translation of&#xD;
      documentation to ICD-9 and CPT codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Better reimbursement accuracy will result from an increase in precise, clear&#xD;
      and complete medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To increase self-efficacy in surgical trainees. Hypothesis 3: By incorporating&#xD;
      appropriate documentation and coding techniques early on in their careers, we will observe&#xD;
      increase in documentation confidence among residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To initiate this study, surgical coding analysts at the Michael E. DeBakey Department of&#xD;
      Veteran Affairs (MEDVAMC) will be interviewed on the most commonly encountered documenting&#xD;
      mistakes in current practice at the surgery department. We intend to conduct a blinded&#xD;
      randomized, control trial examining documentation entered by surgical trainees who receive no&#xD;
      documentation education compared to trainee documentation after education. Endpoints will be&#xD;
      measured by evaluating coding analyst quota which is defined as the number of charts&#xD;
      translated into ICD-9 and CPT codes per day. Additionally, we will also be evaluating&#xD;
      employee satisfaction as defined by the Maslach Burnout inventory; a well-researched&#xD;
      validated survey. A time range of twelve months, starting from day one of a surgical&#xD;
      rotation, will be used in each arm of the study. Trainees with no education on documentation&#xD;
      will serve as the control group while those who recieve documentation education will make up&#xD;
      the intervention group. Outcomes will be measured by changes in quota, and coder satisfaction&#xD;
      as described above. Randomization: A randomized block design will be employed with each&#xD;
      surgery rotation month as a unit of randomization. In other words, surgery trainees will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the control or intervention group per rotating month. Since residents&#xD;
      rotate through a surgical service every 30 days, randomization will be done per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and allocation concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random month assignment will take place in advance using a pre-sealed envelope containing&#xD;
      the randomization arm that will be opened the day prior to the start of the next surgical&#xD;
      trainee rotation. The coders and surgical trainees will be blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, surgery residents rotating through a surgical rotation at the VA during an&#xD;
      intervention month will be trained on documentation and coding on the first day of their&#xD;
      rotation; the teaching session will be about 20 minutes with high yield information on proper&#xD;
      documentation and coding. The content of the teaching session will be determined through&#xD;
      interviews conducted with the coding analysts. In addition to this session, a note card will&#xD;
      be provided to the residents stressing the importance of proper documentation as well as&#xD;
      serving as a reference tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the rotation, an anonymous survey will be provided to the residents in order to&#xD;
      assess if their documentation skills changed after the intervention. In addition, the coding&#xD;
      analyst will also complete the Maslach Burnout inventory survey, a well-researched validated&#xD;
      survey, to assess their employee's satisfaction in control vs intervention months. In&#xD;
      addition, de-identified generally available data on the surgery department, such as relative&#xD;
      value units and daily analyst quota will be collected. No identifiable provider information&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Analysis Coding Analyst satisfaction will be analyzed with the Maslach&#xD;
      Burnout Inventory (MBI) provided at the end of each month. In addition, residents will be&#xD;
      surveyed on knowledge on coding and documentation confidence pre and post intervention.&#xD;
      Billing and documentation data from the surgical deparment will be collected. Data will be&#xD;
      analyzed using the t-test to determine if increasing the clarity of notes increases&#xD;
      productivity. Secondary outcomes: Coding analyst satisfaction scores and resident surveys&#xD;
      will be analyzed among the intervention and control groups using t-test.The criteria used for&#xD;
      statistical significance will correspond to a P= 0.05 and a confidence interval (CI) of 95%.&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed with STATA IC 13.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX)&#xD;
