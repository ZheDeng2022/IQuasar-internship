    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is between 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at the time the informed&#xD;
             consent form (ICF) is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject is either male, or female of nonchildbearing potential. Females in the&#xD;
             following categories are considered a woman of nonchildbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Postmenopausal female: A postmenopausal state is defined as continuous amenorrhea&#xD;
                  for at least 1 year without an alternative medical cause and a&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement of &gt;40 IU/L. A historical&#xD;
                  pretreatment FSH measurement of&gt;40 IU/L is accepted as proof of a postmenopausal&#xD;
                  state for subjects on hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Surgically sterile female: women who have had a documented permanent&#xD;
                  sterilization procedure (ie, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test on day -1 before IMP can be&#xD;
             administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has a body mass index (BMI) within the range 18 to 30 kg/m2 and body&#xD;
             weight 50 to 100 kg (inclusive) before IMP administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject is able to understand the requirements of the study and provide written&#xD;
             informed consent (including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related&#xD;
             health information), and is willing and able to comply with the study protocol&#xD;
             procedures (including the required study visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is in good physical and mental health, per the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, based on medical history; physical examination findings; ECG recordings;&#xD;
             vital sign measurements; systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) panel results; and&#xD;
             biochemistry, hematology, INR, and urinalysis laboratory test results prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of IMP on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Nonsterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use effective contraception from the signing of the ICF&#xD;
             through 260 days after the last IMP administration. A male subject practicing true&#xD;
             sexual abstinence (as consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle) can be&#xD;
             included. Sterilized male subjects who have had a vasectomy and with documented&#xD;
             absence of sperm post-procedure can be included. Male subjects are not allowed to&#xD;
             donate sperm from signing of the ICF through 260 days after the last dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has abdominal skin that, in the opinion of the investigator, allows for&#xD;
             the absorption and localized safety assessment of SC administration (applicable for&#xD;
             dose levels with SC administration only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject agrees to discontinue and refrain from the use of all medications,&#xD;
             including nonprescription and/or prescription medications, for at least 2 weeks before&#xD;
             the first dose of IMP through the EOS visit on day 260 (Part A [SAD]), day 288 (Part B&#xD;
             [MAD], cohorts 1 through 5). The occasional use of paracetamol at doses up to 2 g/day&#xD;
             with a maximum of 10 g/2 weeks is allowed upon approval from the investigator.&#xD;
             COVID-19 immunization recommendations are described in Section 4.3.1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;

             nonsmoker is defined as an individual who has abstained from smoking for at least 3&#xD;
             months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has a negative urine drug and alcohol screen for amphetamines,&#xD;
             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, opiates, methadone, tricyclic&#xD;
             antidepressants and alcohol at screening and on day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject has a body temperature of 35.5 °C to 37.6 °C at screening and prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of IMP day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the IMP, or, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, a history of a significant allergic reaction to any&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has previously participated in a clinical study with efgartigimod and was&#xD;
             administered an IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has a positive serum test at screening for an active viral infection with&#xD;
             any of the following conditions:&#xD;

             major surgery, or has any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             could confound the results of the study or put the subject at undue risk. The&#xD;
             conditions and diseases that will lead to subject exclusion include recognized&#xD;
             uncontrolled risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
             and death in subjects with COVID-19 (eg, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, or chronic&#xD;

             IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The subject has a history of any of the following:&#xD;
