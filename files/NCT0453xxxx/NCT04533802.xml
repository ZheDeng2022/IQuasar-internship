  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine whether variation in 'risk-taking' personality and linked genetic variants&#xD;
      predicts susceptibility to, and resilience against, stress-induced alcohol misuse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse is a global health issue responsible for over 1 million hospital admissions&#xD;
      per annum in the UK with a combined cost of approximately Â£21 billion. Chronic alcohol misuse&#xD;
      in patients who attend hospital for alcohol-related illness/injury is common, with relapse&#xD;
      and recidivism almost ubiquitous. Patients often report that 'stress' was a catalyst for&#xD;
      their drinking episodes, but we do not know exactly who is most at risk, how stress leads to&#xD;
      drinking, or the genetic basis for this risk. This research aims to seek to identify patients&#xD;
      at higher risk of stress-induced alcohol misuse, or who are more resilient to stress in this&#xD;
      context, using a combination of analyses ranging from genetic variants to personality tests&#xD;
      and clinical follow-up. The ultimate goal is that patients engaging with alcohol services can&#xD;
      receive personalised and focussed treatment and enhance recovery&#xD;
