  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the number of baseline IFN-γ SFUs to the number of&#xD;
      IFN-γ SFUs after a 6-day oral gluten challenge among participants treated with TAK-101 versus&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-101. TAK-101 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have celiac disease. The study has two cohorts planned. The first cohort has 1&#xD;
      dose level and the second cohort may include 1 or 2 dose levels, depending on safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and activity observed in the first cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 108 patients. In the first cohort, approximately 45&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned in 1:2:2 ratio in one of the three arm groups -which&#xD;
      will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is&#xD;
      an urgent medical need). Eligible participants will receive: Cohort 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo: 2 infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-101 2 mg/kg: 1 infusion + placebo: 1 infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-101 2 mg/kg: 2 infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take TAK-101 intravenous (IV) infusion and TAK-101 placebo&#xD;
      matching infusion on Days 1 and 8. After completion of Cohort 1, Cohort 2 may start based on&#xD;
      the review of Cohort 1 data by an external data monitoring committee (DMC). Approximately 86&#xD;
      participants may be randomly assigned in 1:2:2:2 ratio in Cohort 2 to receive: Cohort 2 (1&#xD;
      mg/kg may not be needed based on review of Cohort 1 data):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo: 2 infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-101 4 mg/kg : 1 infusion + placebo: 1 infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-101 4 mg/kg: 2 infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-101 1 mg/kg: 2 infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAK-101 1 mg/kg, 2 infusions may be open based on an interim analysis of the cohort 1&#xD;
      Interferon-gamma Spot Forming Units (IFN-γ SFUs) reviewed by the DMC. If TAK-101 1 mg/kg, 2&#xD;
      infusions is not open, approximately 86 participants will be randomly assigned in 1:2:2 ratio&#xD;
      to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo: 2 infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-101 1 mg/kg: 1 infusion + placebo: 1 infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-101 1 mg/kg: 2 infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in United States and Canada. The overall time to participate in&#xD;
      this study is approximately 26 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,&#xD;
      and will be contacted by telephone OR plus a final visit after receiving their last dose of&#xD;
      study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
