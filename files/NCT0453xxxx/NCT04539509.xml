    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the specific role of an exercise prescription on recovery from&#xD;
      concussion symptoms in the general population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      435 people will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physician will review a participant's medical history to determine if physical activity is&#xD;
      appropriate for them. They will then be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Monitoring- participants will be given a heart rate monitor to wear on their wrist for&#xD;
           the duration of the study (until &quot;recovered&quot;, or until 8 weeks post-concussion, whatever&#xD;
           comes first).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Monitoring + Treadmill Testing- in addition to wearing the heart rate monitor, they will&#xD;
           undergo a treadmill test at each appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Monitoring + Treadmill Testing + Specific Exercise Prescription- in addition to wearing&#xD;
           the heart rate monitor, and treadmill test, they will receive an exercise prescription&#xD;
           based on the results of the treadmill test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization is by chance. Participants have a 40/20/40% respective chance of being&#xD;
      assigned to the study groups above. This means that out of every 5 people: 2 people will be&#xD;
      assigned to the group 1, 1 will be assigned to the group 2, and 2 will be assigned to the&#xD;
      group 3. Both participants and the study doctor will be aware which group participants are&#xD;
      in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the group assigned, participants will receive an exercise prescription form at&#xD;
      each appointment, as per usual care. The prescription will be based on the physician's&#xD;
      judgement. If a participant is in group 3, their prescription will also take into account the&#xD;
      results of the treadmill test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery will be determined using a 3-step approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Self-reported symptoms,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinic physician's opinion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treadmill test results (if applicable).&#xD;

    <description>Measured using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)-18. Global scores, as well as somatization, depression, and anxiety sub-scales will be included.&#xD;
Global scores are calculated by adding up participants self-reported score (0-72), with high scores indicating more psychological distress. These scores are then compared to gender-stratified norms. Sub-scales are scored on a 0-24 scale, again higher scores indicating more psychological distress (sub-scales also compared to gender-stratified norms).</description>
