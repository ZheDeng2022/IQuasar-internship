  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the relevance and appropriateness of&#xD;
      outcome assessments, including biomarkers, within the Wilson disease population to inform&#xD;
      study design and endpoint selection for future clinical studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the limited information on the frequency and spectrum of disease manifestations and&#xD;
      clinical course of Wilson disease, the UX701-CL001 study aims to assess the utility and&#xD;
      feasibility of various assessments and biomarkers to inform endpoint selection for future&#xD;
      clinical studies, better understand the relationship between biomarkers and potential&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, and characterize the clinical presentation of Wilson disease. UX701-CL001&#xD;
      is a clinical survey study. Subjects will complete assessments at the study site and at home&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical manifestations of Wilson disease in clinical and real-world&#xD;
      environments.&#xD;

        Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of Wilson Disease will be enrolled from outpatient&#xD;

        regardless of their current treatment. Subjects who have had a liver transplant for&#xD;
        treatment of Wilson Disease are also invited to participate.&#xD;
