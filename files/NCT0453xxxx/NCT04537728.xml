  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to demonstrate early proof-of-concept for My Healthy Brain, an&#xD;
      8-week group program that directly targets multiple lifestyle factors associated with brain&#xD;
      health and prevention of cognitive decline. The investigators will explore the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and effect sizes of improvement in primary lifestyle outcomes as well as&#xD;
      secondary outcomes of self-determination and subjective well-being.&#xD;
