    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the effects of a non-invasive radiofrequency diathermy device added&#xD;
      to knee exercises on the symptoms of patellofemoral pain syndrome. For this aim, a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial will be carried out with a control group that will perform supervised&#xD;
      exercises and an experimental group that will add radiofrequency diathermy to supervised&#xD;
      exercises. Diathermy treatment will be performed along three weeks, ten treatment sessions in&#xD;
      total, while supervised exercises will be performed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes to measure will include pain, knee function and quality of life&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At first, a meeting will be held with the patients under study where they will be informed&#xD;
      and any doubts that may arise in relation to the investigation will be resolved. In addition,&#xD;
      the correct adaptation of these to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of our study will be&#xD;
      verified. Subsequently, they will be given individually the informed consent prepared&#xD;
      expressly for the present study, the doubts arising with respect to this one will be resolved&#xD;
      and their signature will proceed. At this time, and individually again, we will proceed to&#xD;
      the development of the Clinical History of Physiotherapy where only the information necessary&#xD;
      for our study will be collected. To emphasize in this point that the participants will grant&#xD;
      their consent for the treatment of the data obtained for scientific purposes, according to&#xD;
      the legal norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: control group and experimental&#xD;
      group. The randomization of the sample was done through the EPIDAT software in version 3.1&#xD;
      between the Experimental Group and the Control Group. Subsequently, the evaluations and&#xD;
      measurements of the study variables will be carried out by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL GROUP: them will be provided exclusively therapeutic exercises protocol that you must&#xD;
      be performed supervised by a physiotherapist following a daily activity for three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL GROUP: After the initial evaluation, the first 10 treatment sessions will be&#xD;
      developed at the rate of five daily sessions in the first week, three sessions on alternate&#xD;
      days in the second week and two sessions on alternate days in the third week (3 weeks in&#xD;
      total), applying the monopolar dielectric diathermy by radiofrequency in the anterior aspect&#xD;
      of the knee, in dynamic application in one of the members: affect or randomized (uni or&#xD;
      bilateral pathology, respectively). This diathermy will be combined with the same supervised&#xD;
      therapeutic exercise program of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is administered with a pulsed non-invasive radiofrequency device with 30V peak&#xD;
      power along 12 minutes, with a dose submitis (grade I) for three weeks. The first week, daily&#xD;
      treatment will be perform from Monday to Friday, second week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday&#xD;
      and the third week on Monday and Thursday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the tenth treatment session, all the measurements will be repeated following the same&#xD;
      environmental conditions as at the beginning and by the evaluators themselves to the&#xD;
      components of both groups.&#xD;
