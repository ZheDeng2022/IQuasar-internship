  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An improvement in professional practices on the topic of frailty is desirable as much for&#xD;
      ambulatory care teams (professionals in home care services) than for hospital care teams&#xD;
      (medical and paramedical). Geriatric prevention, screening for frailty, are major challenges&#xD;
      for the years to come and require involvement and a know-how.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that the screening of the frailty of the elderly, by the home care&#xD;
      services is relevant and reliable, therefore making it possible to detect a state of frailty&#xD;
      and organize preventive care at the earliest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this research work are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to demonstrate that the use of a questionnaire, simple and already validated for a&#xD;
           medical use, can be administered by home care services with just as much relevance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to democratize the detection of frailty by demonstrating that home care services have an&#xD;
           important role to play in terms of screening and therefore an equally important impact&#xD;
           in terms of public health,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to recall the importance of screening in medical practice, including for the elderly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The continued increase in life expectancy is one of the most significant achievements of&#xD;
      these years in Europe: while in 1960 life expectancy was 73.6 years for women and 67 years&#xD;
      for men, in 2010 it was significantly higher, respectively 84.8 years and 78.1 years. Total&#xD;
      life expectancy is increasing, but disability-free life expectancy is declining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the years of life gained would now be accompanied by functional limitations, activity&#xD;
      restrictions and degradation of autonomy. One of the challenges of our society, promoted as&#xD;
      part of the European Innovation Partnership for Active and Healthy Aging as well as in the&#xD;
      National Health Strategy 2018-2022, is the prevention of disabilities and age-related&#xD;
      dependence by ensuring that our patients can not only live longer, but also lead a healthy,&#xD;
      active and independent life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of older people live at home without significant disability, including in&#xD;
      the most advanced age groups. These elderly pauci- or mono-pathological persons evolve in a&#xD;
      manner comparable to younger adults in acute illness, hospitalization or during physical and&#xD;
      / or psychological stress, the so-called &quot;fragile&quot; elderly unmask an underlying state of&#xD;
      vulnerability and may enter into dependency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the French Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SFGG) adopted the following&#xD;
      definition of frailty: &quot;Frailty is a clinical syndrome. It reflects a decrease in&#xD;
      physiological capacity reserve which alters the mechanisms of adaptation to stress. Its&#xD;
      clinical expression is modulated by comorbidities and by psychological, social, economic and&#xD;
      behavioral. Frailty syndrome is a marker of risk of mortality and pejorative events,&#xD;
      including disabilities, falls, hospitalization and institutionalization. Age is a major&#xD;
      determinant of frailty [â€¦]. Addressing the determinants of frailty can reduce or delay its&#xD;
      consequences. Thus, fragility would be part of a process potentially reversible &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the latest data from the SHARE survey (Survey on Health, Aging and Retirement in&#xD;
      Europe) which is a multidisciplinary longitudinal Survey involving more than 80,000 Europeans&#xD;
      aged over 50 with collection of data on health status, social situation (family, mutual aid,&#xD;
      social networks) and economic (employment, retirement, wealth), frailty represents in France&#xD;
      3.2% of people aged 50 to 64, and 15% of people over 65. Other data of interest, 43% of&#xD;
      people over 65 are &quot;pre-fragile&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, being able to identify fragility early is a major issue in order to implement&#xD;
      corrective actions and avoid or at least delay entry into addiction. To do so, several simple&#xD;
      primary care screening tools have been developed, like self-assessment such as the FiND8&#xD;
      self-questionnaire or tools intended to be used by physicians such as the FRAIL tool from&#xD;
      Morley or the tool for identifying the frailty of the gerontopole of Toulouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These screening strategies remain mainly for the time in the medical field while home care&#xD;
      services (SAD), daily actors in the elderly person life, are still too little involved. The&#xD;
      development of Home Care Frailty Scale, a 29-item multidimensional assessment tool for the&#xD;
      risk of decline to dependency, based on data from the interRAI (Resident Assessment&#xD;
      Instrument), however, demonstrates that SAD represent an interesting screening strategy.&#xD;
