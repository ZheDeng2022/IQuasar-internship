  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herpes zoster causes significant morbidity on over 1 million Americans every year. Although&#xD;
      the majority of herpes zoster pain will self-resolve within one week, a significant&#xD;
      proportion of patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which is characterized by&#xD;
      debilitating pain that persists more than three months after the initial symptoms. Nerve&#xD;
      blocks have been previously studied as a method to control herpes zoster pain in outpatient&#xD;
      pain clinics and inpatient settings. This study aims to investigate whether emergency&#xD;
      department ultrasound guided nerve blocks can prevent PHN and effectively treat acute herpes&#xD;
      zoster pain.&#xD;

      Study Objectives The goal of this study is to evaluate the rate of PHN development in&#xD;
      emergency department patients who receive ultrasound guided nerve blocks using bupivacaine&#xD;
      and dexamethasone for acute herpes zoster. The investigators will also study the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the block in managing acute herpes zoster pain. The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      percentage of patients who have significant herpetic pain at 1 month and 3 months after&#xD;
      receiving the nerve block. Secondary outcomes measured are pain scores at 1 hour, 1 month,&#xD;
      and 3 months post-nerve block. The amount of opioids used after discharge as well as the&#xD;
      number of return visits for herpetic pain will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis is that patients who receive nerve blocks will decrease the&#xD;
      occurrence of PHN development at 1 month and 3 months post-treatment. The secondary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that nerve blocks will decrease pain scores at 1 hour, 1 month, 3 months, as&#xD;
      well as reduce the amount of opioids used and number of return visits for herpetic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IStudy Design This study will be a single center prospective observational study that will be&#xD;
      conducted in the emergency department of an urban hospital center. A trained emergency&#xD;
      medicine physician will screen and assess the patient for eligibility. Once the patient is&#xD;
      determined to be eligible, informed consent will be obtained. A trained EM physician will&#xD;
      then administer a nerve block using bupivacaine and dexamethasone to a patient with acute&#xD;
      herpes zoster. The patient will be started on Acyclovir 800 mg five times daily for seven&#xD;
      days. For mild to moderate breakthrough pain, the patient will be prescribed a 5-day course&#xD;
      of Tylenol 650 mg and Ibuprofen 400 mg taken up to every 8 hours together. For severe&#xD;
      breakthrough pain, the patients will be prescribed a two-day course of 7.5 mg morphine&#xD;
      sulfate immediate release to be taken up to every 6 hours. The location of the nerve block&#xD;
      and dosage of injected medications will depend on the distribution of the affected dermatome.&#xD;
      The dermatomal distributions with their associated nerve blocks and medication dosages are&#xD;
      shown the table below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herpes Zoster Distribution Nerve Block Type Medication T2-T9 Serratus Plane 30 mL 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine and 8 mg Dexamethasone C2-C3 Greater Occipital Nerve 2 mL 0.25% bupivacaine and 4&#xD;
      mg dexamethasone C3-C4 Superficial Cervical Plexus 10 mL 0.25% bupivacaine and 4 mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone Anterior Abdominal Wall T6 - L1 Transversus Abdominis Plane 30 mL 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine and 8 mg dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
      A numerical verbal rating scale will be used to assess the patient's pain pre-injection and&#xD;
      at 1-hour post nerve block. We will then call the patient at the 1 week, 1 month, and 3-month&#xD;
      post-nerve block time intervals to assess the patients' pain. The investigators will also&#xD;
      record the number of follow-up visits for herpetic pain and the amount of additional pain&#xD;
      medications used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When called the patient will be asked a series of questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do you continue to have pain associated with your herpes zoster infection?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If so, how would you rate your pain from a scale of 0-10? 10 being the worst pain you&#xD;
           have ever had in your life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. About how much pain medication have you been using since the initial nerve block? How&#xD;
           many doses of Ibuprofen or Tylenol per day for how many days? How many doses of morphine&#xD;
           sulfate immediate release or other opioids were taken per day for how many days?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If you used other forms of pain controllers, what were they and how often and for how&#xD;
           long did you use them?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Have you seen your primary care doctor, pain clinic, emergency department, or other pain&#xD;
           management follow-up visits for management of your herpes pain? If so, how many visits&#xD;
           have you made?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What side effects have you had since the nerve block?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is Maimonides Medical Center emergency department patients older than 18&#xD;
      years of age presenting with acute herpes zoster patient with characteristic dermatomal&#xD;
      vesicular skin lesions within 30 days of initial symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the percentage of patients who have significant herpetic pain at 1&#xD;
      month and 3 months after receiving the nerve block. Secondary outcomes measured are pain&#xD;
      scores pre-injection, and 1 hour, 1 month, and 3 months post-nerve block. The number of&#xD;
      tablets of opioids and other analgesics used after discharge as well as the number of return&#xD;
      visits for herpetic pain will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The numerical verbal rating scale pain score will be recorded by a research staff member at 1&#xD;
      hour after administration of nerve block. The patients will then be called at 1 week, 1&#xD;
      month, and 3 months post nerve block for assessment of NRS as well as number of follow-up&#xD;
      visits and amount of analgesics used. A medication track form/log will be given to the&#xD;
      patients to help record the amount of medications taken in the first week. The patients will&#xD;
      be stratified by age: those under 50, 50-59, 60-69, and 70 and older as well as herpes zoster&#xD;
      vaccination status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that patients undergoing ultrasound guided nerve block will have&#xD;
      decreased incidence of subacute herpetic neuralgia and PHN. We also expect pain to be well&#xD;
      controlled at 1 hour, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post nerve block.&#xD;
