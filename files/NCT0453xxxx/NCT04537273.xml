  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced cervical cáncer continues to be a public health problem in emergent&#xD;
      economies, even though treatment is very well standardized, recurrence rate is still high,&#xD;
      making necessary to evaluate prognostic clinical and pathological factors. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate clinical and pathological prognostic factor in terms of treatment&#xD;
      outcomes, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in a retrospective cohort of&#xD;
      patients with LACC treated with standard chemoradiotherapy in a reference center in México.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a retrospective study, the data were obtained from clinical files of cervical cancer&#xD;
      patients with clinical stages IB2-IVA(FIGO2009) treated at the Instituto Nacional de&#xD;
      Cancerología in Mexico City from January 2005 to December 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1954 patients with LACC confirmed by pathology, clinical exams and computed&#xD;
      tomography scan (CT) were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, clinical, pathological and follow-up as well as survival status of all patients&#xD;
      was recorded. Treatment outcome was classified as complete response if the patient had no&#xD;
      signs of tumor activity after 6 months of finishing treatment, persistence of disease was&#xD;
      defined if tumor could be identified after treatment or before six months of treatment&#xD;
      termination, progression was defined if tumor growth occurred or metastatic disease appeared.&#xD;
      Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the period between finishing treatment and the&#xD;
      occurrence of relapse, which was confirmed by pathological study and/or CT. Overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) was defined as the time period between diagnosis and death or date at last visit.&#xD;
      Quantitative variables were described with central tendency and dispersion measures and&#xD;
      analyzed with Student's t or Mann-Whitney U test. Normality was determined with&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk's test, Chi-squared for categorical comparisons between groups, Kaplan-Meir with&#xD;
      the log-rank test for survival analysis were performed. The multivariate analysis was&#xD;
      performed using Cox proportional Hazard regression model. Statistically significant&#xD;
      differences were defined as a p value &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS, version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y.,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
