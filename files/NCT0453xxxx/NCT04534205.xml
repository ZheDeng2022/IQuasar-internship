&#xD;
      This trial has two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A, an initial non-randomized Safety Run-In Phase to confirm the safety and tolerability&#xD;

&#xD;
      Part B, the Randomized part of the trial to generate pivotal efficacy and safety data of&#xD;
      BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first line&#xD;
