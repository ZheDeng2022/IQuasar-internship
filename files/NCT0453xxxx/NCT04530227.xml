    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the treatment of adult participants with medically inoperable Stage I or IIA&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of camrelizumab in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, followed by camrelizumab alone after 4-6 cycles of combination in participants&#xD;
      with medically inoperable stage I or IIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary&#xD;
      objective of this pilot study is to determine the Camrelizumab plus chemotherapy improves&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) . All the efficacy and safety are assessed by investigator :&#xD;
      1) response rate (ORR), 2) disease control rate (DCR); 3) overall survival (OS), 4) PFS rate&#xD;
      of 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year; and 5) OS rate of 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore objective is potential biomarker associated with efficacy.&#xD;
