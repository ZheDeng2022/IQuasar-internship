  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      disability with 251 million cases per anum reported worldwide. COPD ranks fourth among the&#xD;
      common causes of mortality with an estimated 3 million annual deaths worldwide that is&#xD;
      projected to be third by 2020. COPD deaths are more prevalent among the low socio-economic&#xD;
      developing countries, estimated up to 90% of the total mortality rate across the globe. In&#xD;
      Asia, 13.5% of the total population suffers with COPD. Particularly, in Pakistan every 10th&#xD;
      individual suffers with COPD out of which 19.4% are of age above 40 years. Moreover, the&#xD;
      problem has been identified as a growing public health concern and a challenge for the&#xD;
      clinicians of 21st century. Consequently, the severity of the condition of patients is&#xD;
      contributed by exacerbations or co-morbidities, and significant economic burden due to the&#xD;
      hospitalizations, absence from work and disability; and its management cost from $1544 to&#xD;
      $2335 in Asian countries, annually. However, specific data economic burden for Pakistan is&#xD;
      not reported yet. A number of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment options are&#xD;
      utilized in the management of COPD; however, pulmonary rehabilitation has been conferred as&#xD;
      the corner stone in management of COPD. NICE guidelines emphasize upon the importance of&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation for all individuals presenting with COPD; even those who have&#xD;
      acutely suffered an exacerbation or underwent recent hospitalization. Moreover, pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation consisting of structured exercises regimes and education regarding self-care&#xD;
      has been reported to improve COPD symptoms and exercise tolerance; and reduce expenditure of&#xD;
      resources on recurrent hospitalization and length of stay. Study has reported that resistance&#xD;
      training demonstrated in better improvement in muscular strength than endurance exercise and&#xD;
      causes lesser chances of dyspnea while performing activities and is more tolerable than&#xD;
      endurance exercise regime. Literature is evident upon that the combination of resistance and&#xD;
      endurance training has shown significant improvement in the respiratory parameters. Hence the&#xD;
      present study is aimed to incorporate Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) D2&#xD;
      pattern including different types of resistance training in order to determine the response&#xD;
      of adjunct therapies on the outcome measures.&#xD;

      Data Collection Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be divided into three groups A, B and C on the basis of randomization&#xD;
      performed using an envelope technique. The participants in group A will perform PNF D2 with&#xD;
      free weights (PNF D2 FW), participants of Group B will perform PNF D2 with elastic bands (PNF&#xD;
      D2 ERB) while Group C will be control group and the participants of this group will perform&#xD;
      PNF D2 without resistance (PNF D2 WR). Initially, consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      participants after explaining them the protocols of treatment. The Pulmonary Function Test&#xD;
      (PFT) will be performed to record pre-intervention spirometric values of FEV1/FVC&#xD;
      (Tiffeneau-Pinelli Index), Minute Ventilation (MV), Force expiratory volume in 1 second&#xD;
      (FEV1), Forced Vital capacity (FVC), Total Lung Capacity (TLC) and Residual Volume (RV).&#xD;
      Similarly, 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Score will be&#xD;
      recorded to determine the exercise capacity and health status score of COPD patient&#xD;
      respectively. Following the assessment procedure, both groups will receive 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with frequency of 3 sessions per week lasting for 30 minutes approximately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Protocol Group A Participants in Group A will perform PNF D2 flexion and&#xD;
      extension with free weights (PNF D2 FW) The intensity of exercise will be determined for each&#xD;
      individual by using maximum repetition test (1 repetition maximum 1-RM). The intensity will&#xD;
      be kept 50 % of the maximal load. 3 sets of PNF D2 FW Flexion (flexion-abduction and external&#xD;
      rotation) and PNF D2 FW Extension (extension-adduction-internal rotation) respectively will&#xD;
      be performed on each upper limb with 10 repetitions per set. All exercises will be performed&#xD;
      with a rest interval of 30 seconds to 1 minute between the sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Protocol Group B Participants in this group will perform 3 sets of PNF D2&#xD;
      flexion (flexion-abduction and external rotation) and extension (extension-adduction-internal&#xD;
      rotation) respectively with elastic bands after assessing the 1-RM test starting with a&#xD;
      lightest resistance and gradually progressing to the higher level. Subsequently, 71% to 86%&#xD;
      of 1-RM will be taken as a target range of the resistance for the training . Moreover, each&#xD;
      set will consist of 10 repetitions for both D2 flexion and Extension and a resting interval&#xD;
      of 60 seconds between two consecutive sets. The procedure will be repeated for both limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Protocol Group C The participants in the Group C or control group will perform&#xD;
      the PNF D2 flexion and extension without any resistance. Three sets consist of 10 repetitions&#xD;
      of each pattern for both upper limbs will be performed with an interval of 60 seconds between&#xD;
      two consecutive sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 weeks of training, the pulmonary function test (PFT), 6 Minute Walk Test and George's&#xD;
      Respiratory Questionnaire scores will be recorded for post intervention readings. Results&#xD;
      will be recorded and statistical analysis will be performed.&#xD;
