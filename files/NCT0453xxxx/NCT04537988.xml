  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate an eHealth intervention facilitating weight maintenance&#xD;
      following initial weight loss during a 3-month trial (pilot test)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity rates are rapidly increasing and even with diets and interventions aiding weight&#xD;
      loss, an alarmingly large percentage of people struggle to maintain the lost weight. In the&#xD;
      face of obesity, weight maintenance is therefore arising as a major obstacle and new&#xD;
      innovative approaches are called for. Despite the fact that a substantial number of web-based&#xD;
      diets, health and fitness focused interventions or &quot;apps&quot; already exist, few focus on weight&#xD;
      maintenance, are research based or available post study. In addition, most have yet to show&#xD;
      short- or long-term effect and few, if any, are developed together with users (e.g.,&#xD;
      patients, health care professionals). eHealth solutions may therefore be a &quot;missing link&quot; in&#xD;
      supporting self-regulation and motivation for sustainable health behavior change and weight&#xD;
      loss maintenance. The aim of this study is to evaluate a person-centered, evidence based&#xD;
      interactive eHealth intervention facilitating weight maintenance following initial weight&#xD;
      loss during a 3- month feasibility pilot trial.&#xD;

    <description>14 item scale measuring anxiety and depression. Respondents are asked to indicate which of 4 response options (rated from 0-3; score range, 0-42) comes closest to describing how they have been feeling in the previous week for each item. Scores from 0-7 on the subscales are regarded as being in the normal range; a score of 11 or higher indicates a probable presence of a mood disorder, and a score of 8-10 is suggestive of the presence of the state.</description>
