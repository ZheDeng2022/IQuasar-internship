      This study has purpose to assess the effect of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)-fortified milk&#xD;
      powder with nutrition counseling and nutrition module in body weight and body fat mass among&#xD;
      overweight and obese adult in Indonesia&#xD;

      After being informed of the potential benefits and risks regarding the study, the respondents&#xD;
      were asked to sign the consent. The respondents who met the criteria of overweight/ obese&#xD;
      without any historical diseases will be randomized into intervention or placebo groups. The&#xD;
      intervention will be given for 12 weeks (CLA-fortified milk powder 3.4 gram, once-daily&#xD;
      consumption). Both the intervention and placebo groups will also receive nutrition counseling&#xD;
      and nutrition module.&#xD;
