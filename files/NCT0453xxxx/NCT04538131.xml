  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been suggested by several research for treating PD gait&#xD;
      disturbance. However, the side effects induced by body position change cannot fully addressed&#xD;
      by conventional SCS. Medtronic sensor-driven position-adaptive SCS are capable to monitor the&#xD;
      position change and change the parameters accordingly, so as to reduce the position change&#xD;
      related side effects. Nevertheless, neither the efficacy nor safety of this technique in the&#xD;
      treatment of gait disturbance in PD is ever investigated. Therefore, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized clinical trial to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      sensor-driven position-adaptive SCS in the treatment of gait disturbance in PD. This study&#xD;
      will contribute to find out the safety and efficacy of sensor-driven position-adaptive SCS in&#xD;
      the treatment of PD gait disorder, improve patients' quality of life, and reduce the burden&#xD;
      on family and society.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized double-blind crossover design aiming to test the short-term&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of sensor-driven position-adaptive SCS in the treatment of gait&#xD;
      disturbance in patients with PD. More than 1 month after operation, subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two groups, with one group treated with conventional spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      intervention and the other treated with sensor-driven position-adaptive spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation intervention. Both groups will be followed-up for more than 1 week and receive&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation. A cross-over design will then be applied to eliminate the&#xD;
      individual variability until both groups complete another 1 week follow-up. Stimulation&#xD;
      parameters and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) remained during follow-up in both group.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation is assessed by 6-min walk test (6MWT) and timed up-and-go task (TUG) with&#xD;
      gait analysis. Quality of life is evaluated by The 5-level EQ-5D. The severity of PIGD is&#xD;
      assessed by gait and fall questionnaire (GFQ) , modified fall efficacy scale(MFES),&#xD;
      activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale and the survey of activities and fear of&#xD;
      falling in the elderly (SAFFE ). Within group t test will be made for comparison between two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 and 2 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a self-assessed, health related, quality of life questionnaire. The scale is a composite of a short descriptive system questionnaire and a visual analogue scale. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive systemmeasures quality of life on a 5-component scale including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each state is referred to by a 5-digit code, and the five subscores of the test can be combined to give a summary index value of 0-1, with lower scores representing poorer overall QoLState. The second task component includes a visual analogue scale (VAS) used for rating 'current health state' with a range of 0(worst imaginable health)-100(best imaginable health).</description>

Scores of zero represent no confidence; scores of 100 indicate complete confidence. Overall score is calculated by adding item scores and then dividing by the total number of items. Cut-off score of &lt; 69% is predictive of recurrent falls.</description>
