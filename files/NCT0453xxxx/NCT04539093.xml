  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of HF is highly variable, with overlapping pathogenic mechanisms that&#xD;
      complicates any attempt to create a simple and unified conceptual model. Left ventricular&#xD;
      (LV) ejection fraction (EF), assessed as the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is&#xD;
      ejected upon contraction, has been the cornerstone metric for characterization of LV systolic&#xD;
      function in patients with HF. LVEF demonstrates a strong inverse relationship with clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in HF in patients with reduced EF (HFrEF). Current management options for the&#xD;
      treatment of HFrEF include medical management, mechanical circulatory support, and cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation. In the setting of refractory end stage HFrEF, the standard of care is heart&#xD;
      transplantation. Since limited organ procurement is a significant constraint to the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with advanced disease, durable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with left&#xD;
      ventricular assist devices (LVAD) were developed as a safe and efficacious treatment strategy&#xD;
      for patients with advanced HF that is refractory to medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advances in LVAD engineering and design, tailored towards defined physiological goals,&#xD;
      have resulted in the creation of much smaller continuous-flow (CF) pumps that possess&#xD;
      technical superiority, pump durability, and ease of implantation compared to the older and&#xD;
      larger pulsatile-flow pumps. The addition of speed modulation algorithms to the next&#xD;
      generation centrifugal CF LVADs, has decreased the incidence of device related adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our interest lies in the impact of continuous flow hemodynamics on endothelial function and&#xD;
      the cardiac and end-organ responses to this novel therapy. Current knowledge of the impact of&#xD;
      these specific advances in LVAD therapy is however limited by the relative youth of the&#xD;
      field. Thus, the goal of this research project is to study human LVAD patients and to&#xD;
      determine the impact of speed modulation algorithms in CF physiology on microvascular and&#xD;
      endothelial function and its association with cardiac and peripheral organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that restoration of cardiac output using an LVAD with modern&#xD;
      speed modulation algorithm improves vascular endothelial function. In addition, these changes&#xD;
      would have a positive correlation with functional outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The advances in LVAD engineering and design, tailored towards defined physiological goals,&#xD;
      have resulted in the creation of much smaller CF pumps that possess technical superiority,&#xD;
      pump durability, and ease of implantation compared to the older and larger PF pumps. The&#xD;
      addition of artificial pulsatility to the next generation centrifugal CF LVADs, has decreased&#xD;
      the incidence of device related adverse events. However, given the recent nature of these&#xD;
      advances, the physiologic impact has yet to be fully elucidated. LVADs in general have&#xD;
      demonstrated good outcomes and are rapidly gaining traction towards becoming standard therapy&#xD;
      for refractory end stage HF. The investigators are in a position to study this new technology&#xD;
      and the impact of the resultant altered physiologic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our interest lies in the impact of continuous flow hemodynamics on endothelial function and&#xD;
      the cardiac and end-organ responses to this novel therapy. Basal homeostatic properties of&#xD;
      healthy endothelium are in part based on the effects of hemodynamic forces such as&#xD;
      hydrostatic pressure, cyclic stretch, and fluid shear stress, which occur as a consequence of&#xD;
      blood pressure and pulsatile blood flow in the vasculature. Under ambient conditions, these&#xD;
      forces are generally atheroprotective and increase the expression of nitric oxide synthase&#xD;
      (eNOS) to generate nitric oxide (NO), decrease reactive oxidative species (ROS) and oxidative&#xD;
      stress, decrease expression of proinflammatory adhesion molecules, and maintain an&#xD;
      antithrombotic surface. Increases in shear stress stimulate compensatory expansion of the&#xD;
      vessels and thereby return shear forces to basal levels. Likewise, a decrease in shear stress&#xD;
      can narrow the lumen of the vessel in an endothelium-dependent manner. In essence, the vessel&#xD;
      remodels itself in response to long-term changes in flow, such that the luminal diameter is&#xD;
      reshaped to maintain a constant predetermined level of shear stress. The capacity of the&#xD;
      endothelium to sense shear stress is therefore an important determinant of luminal diameter&#xD;
      and overall vessel structure. Failure to adapt to pathophysiological stimuli may lead to&#xD;
      maladaptive responses that result in seemingly permanent alterations in endothelial phenotype&#xD;
      and promote endothelial dysfunction. This phenomenon plays an integral role in several&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease processes. Endothelial dysfunction (of both microvascular and conduit&#xD;
      arteries) is a component of chronic heart failure and correlates with severity of disease.&#xD;
      Improvement in cardiac function, whether via medical therapy or cardiac output augmentation,&#xD;
      can improve endothelial function and benefit patients through better peripheral vascular&#xD;
      reactivity. However, much of the improvement in endothelial function is thought to be related&#xD;
      to the pulsatile laminar flow that occurs in majority of vascular beds. With the increasing&#xD;
      use of CF pumps, it has become clear that the lack of pulsatility adversely affects the&#xD;
      endothelium by decreasing vessel wall shear stress; reducing cyclic stretch that affects&#xD;
      vascular cell proliferation; disrupting endothelium-dependent vasodilation; activating&#xD;
      extrinsic pathway of thrombosis; and heightening vascular inflammation. The reintroduction of&#xD;
      pulsatility through flow modulation control strategies could help mitigate these device&#xD;
      specific issues and help promote endothelial recovery. Our knowledge of the impact of these&#xD;
      specific advances in LVAD therapy is however limited by the relative youth of the field.&#xD;
      Thus, the goal of this research project is to study human LVAD patients to determine the&#xD;
      impact of artificial pulsatility in CF physiology on microvascular and endothelial function&#xD;
      and its association with cardiac and peripheral organ function.&#xD;
