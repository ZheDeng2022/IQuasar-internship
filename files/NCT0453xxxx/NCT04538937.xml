      Introduction: The etiology and therapy of eosinophilic lung diseases are still poorly&#xD;
      understood. For individual forms of disease, such as eosinophilic asthma or eosinophilic&#xD;
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), new therapeutic approaches exist that block the&#xD;
      interleukin IL-5 or the IL-5 receptor. Eosinophilic manifestations of the respiratory tract&#xD;
      can exclusively affect the lungs or occur as part of a systemic disease. The manifestations&#xD;
      partially overlap and are clinically difficult to differentiate (e.g. eosinophilic asthma,&#xD;
      Samter Triad, EGPA or hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)). It is now known that blood&#xD;
      eosinophil counts correlate with the level of eosinophils recruited to the airways. However,&#xD;
      it is still unclear whether there is a blood eosinophilia without clinical relevance or&#xD;
      whether there is a risk of organ damage (e.g. in HES). Hence, different subtypes of&#xD;
      eosinophils with different polarization are discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: A registry of patients with eosinophilia and respiratory manifestation will&#xD;
      be established at the University Hospital of Innsbruck. The course of disease will be&#xD;
      evaluated prospectively in a non-interventional study. This study stands on three main&#xD;
      clinical pillars with focus on further characterization of eosinophilic cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be included who switch from a previous application of the anti-IL5&#xD;
           antibody mepolizumab (production and administration of the injection from lyophysate&#xD;
           through the doctor) to the pre-mixed pen (self-injection at home).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Furthermore, special focus is set on patients suffering from the so-called Samter Triad.&#xD;
           In these patients, the control of asthma, nasal polyps and NSAID intolerance will be&#xD;
           examined in an interdisciplinary fashion during the course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Previous clinical studies at our Department indicate that some patients with severe&#xD;
           eosinophilic asthma or Samter Triad could represent a mono-organic or limited&#xD;
           manifestation of lymphoid HES. This hypothesis is tested by measuring additional&#xD;
           chemokines, somatic mutations and FACS parameters in this subgroup to verify a clonal&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, translational research will differentiate resident and inflammatory eosinophilic&#xD;
      granulocytes by FACS analysis and further characterize them by fluorescence microscopy,&#xD;
      electron microscopy, gene chip analysis and lipidomics, in the above-mentioned diseases and&#xD;
      in healthy controls, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: All patients suffering from eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement who&#xD;
      are diagnosed with eosinophilic asthma, EGPA, Samter Triad, HES, and eosinophilic pneumonia&#xD;
      with signed consent are included in the prospective registry. Provided, that they are&#xD;
      registered at the outpatient department of pneumology, ENT, haematology or allergology at the&#xD;
      University Hospital Innsbruck. The investigators will collect laboratory analyses, lung&#xD;
      function, imaging, bone marrow biopsies, ENT findings and allergological findings over the&#xD;
      course of the study. Furthermore, additional blood tubes are collected during routine blood&#xD;
      tests, which are used to identify and characterize subtypes of eosinophilic granulocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks for patients: No additional examinations, blood sampling or invasive measures are&#xD;
      required for the patient. Thus, there is no additional risk for study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks for control subjects: In order to be able to compare our results with the healthy&#xD;
      population, volunteer subjects are recruited. After consent has been given, a blood sample is&#xD;
      taken. Despite the low risk, it is theoretically possible that blood sampling may be&#xD;
      accompanied by non-severe complications (such as hematoma, infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: The investigators expect new insights into phenotype and therapy of patients with&#xD;
      eosinophilic manifestations of the respiratory tract.&#xD;
