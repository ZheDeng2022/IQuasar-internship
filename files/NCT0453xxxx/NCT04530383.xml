  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of metformin to improve airway ion&#xD;
      channel function in those with CF-related diabetes (CFRD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 patients with CFRD on highly effective CFTR modulator therapy who meet criteria and&#xD;
      agree to participation in the study will be placed on metformin 500mg twice daily (low) and&#xD;
      1000mg twice daily (normal) in a randomized order (simple randomization). There will be a&#xD;
      dose-escalation with each dosing regimen starting with 500mg twice daily for a week, followed&#xD;
      by 500mg in the AM and 1000mg in the PM for another week and finally followed by 1000mg twice&#xD;
      daily until the end of normal dose cycle (in those in the normal dose portion of the&#xD;
      crossover trial). A matching placebo pill will be utilized so participants do not know which&#xD;
      dosing regimen, low or normal, they are on during each 14-week period. Participants will&#xD;
      continue each dosing regimen of metformin for 14 weeks with a washout period of 2 weeks&#xD;
      between dose changes. To minimize risk of B12 deficiency, a known side effect of long-term&#xD;
      metformin use, we will also provide a supplement of 1000 Âµg oral cyanocobalamin daily for the&#xD;
      duration of the trial.&#xD;
