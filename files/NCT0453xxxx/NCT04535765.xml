      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhoid is one of the most common chronic anorectal diseases. The prevalence rate is about&#xD;
      44%. It occurs in adults aged 45-65 years. Hemorrhoidetomy resection is still the standard&#xD;
      treatment for grade III and IV hemorrhoid. Urinary retention is one of the most common&#xD;
      complications after hemorrhoid surgery, and the complications occur within 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. The warm water sitz bath is a routine nursing care after hemorrhoid surgery in the&#xD;
      clinic. The purpose is to provide moist heat of the perineum and anus to clean, promote&#xD;
      healing and drainage, relieve pain, stimulate urination and promote relaxation. In contrast,&#xD;
      all current studies, warm water sitz bath intervention time is the first day after surgery,&#xD;
      the complications within 24 hours after surgery are not alleviated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose was to use experimental research methods to verify the effect of early warm&#xD;
      water sitz bath on urinary retention after hemorrhoidectomy. The secondary objective was the&#xD;
      effect of early warm water sitz bath on wound pain after hemorrhoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a single-blind randomized trial in which subjects were randomly assigned to an&#xD;
      experimental or control group with symptomatic stage III or IV end hemorrhoid who were&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital for hemorrhoidectomy. The experimental group started the warm water&#xD;
      bath 6 hours after the end of the operation, while the control group started the warm water&#xD;
      sitz bath on the first day after the operation. The investigator assessed the amount of&#xD;
      residual urine and wound pain index before and after each operation of the warm water sitz&#xD;
      bath after surgery, and each subject was evaluated 8 times until 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;

      In order to ensure that the results of the study are not distorted by humans, this study is a&#xD;
      single-blind randomized trial study. The subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental&#xD;
      group or the control group with a permuted block randomization. For the sample number&#xD;
      calculation, refer to Hedeker, Gibbons &amp; Waternaux (1999) Comparing the time-dependent&#xD;
      comparison of the longitudinal design sample size estimates between the two groups, and&#xD;
      considering the 20% sample loss rate, the total number of samples is estimated to be 64 (32&#xD;
      in the control group and 32 in the experimental group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups of patients also received the same conventional treatment, anesthesia and&#xD;
      surgery on the night before and on the day of the operation, and the warm water sitz bath was&#xD;
      performed at different times after the operation. The warm water sitz bath temperature of the&#xD;
      two groups was also 41-43Â°C daily 3 times (9:00, 13:00, 17:00), 5 minutes each time, and&#xD;
      regularly take the same painkillers, stool softeners, and antibiotics. The researchers&#xD;
      evaluated the wound pain index on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 6 hours after the&#xD;
      operation, 7 hours after the operation, and before and after each warm water sitz bath; After&#xD;
      urine, the residual urine volume of the subject was evaluated with a Bladder Scan until the&#xD;
      first day after the operation. A total of 8 evaluations were performed: 6 hours after the&#xD;
      operation, 7 hours after the operation, and the first day after the operation 8:30, 9:30,&#xD;
      12:30, 13:30, 16:30, 17:30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the test, the number of subjects with adverse reactions (vertigo, weakness, sustained&#xD;
      wound bleeding greater than 100ml) was greater than 3% of the total number of cases (2&#xD;
      persons). The trial was terminated immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age over 20 years old, easy to move, can get out of bed and take a bath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptomatic grade III or IV hemorrhoids diagnosed by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Accept epidural anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perform hemorrhoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Those who have clear awareness and are willing to participate in and fill out the&#xD;
           research consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diseases around the anus (fistula, abscess).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Urinary tract problems (prostate hypertrophy in the past medical history; urinary tract&#xD;
           infections on admission routine urine tests, urinary retention as assessed by Bladder&#xD;
           Scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Take painkillers before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Descriptive statistical analysis: Adopt the mean, standard deviation, frequency&#xD;
           distribution and percentage to present the basic attributes of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inferential statistics: Chi-square test was used to analyze the categorical variables,&#xD;
           and independent sample t-test was used to analyze the continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use the independent sample t test to compare the differences in the average degree of&#xD;
           urinary retention and pain between the groups. If the data are not normally distributed,&#xD;
           switch to the Mann-Whitney U test without parental analysis to compare the experimental&#xD;
           group and the control group before and after bathing Whether there is a difference, p&#xD;
           value &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use GEE (Generalized Estimating Equation) to check whether there is any difference in&#xD;
           the degree of urinary retention and pain in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of k-Nearest Neighbours to fill in the missing values is mainly to see that the&#xD;
      relevant data measured by the subject in the same group is similar to those of other&#xD;
      subjects, and then average the data measured by these similar subjects at the same time Value&#xD;
      to fill.&#xD;

    <description>The main purpose was to use experimental research methods to verify the effect of early warm water sitz bath on urinary retention after hemorrhoidectomy.This study is expected to use the bladder scan BVI 6100 as a tool for evaluating urinary retention. It is currently used clinically to measure bladder urine volume. Studies have indicated its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, with results of 94%, 97%, and 91%, respectively (Attia, Hiligsmann, Hellinckx, Wijnen &amp; Evers, 2016).&#xD;
Before investigating the receipt, the researcher must go through three bladder volume tester operation tests and measure the bladder urine volume in accordance with the standard procedures of the instrument operation. Measurement of residual urine volume.</description>

    <time_frame>In this study, the wound pain index was evaluated with a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 6 hours after the operation, 7 hours after the operation, and before and after each warm water sitz bath, a total of 8 times.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective was the effect of early warm water sitz bath on wound pain after hemorrhoidectomy.This study used a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to assess wound pain after hemorrhoidectomy. NRS is the most suitable pain scale for patients after surgery. The patient evaluates his pain on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means no pain; 1-3 mild pain; 4-6 moderate pain; 7-10 severe pain ( Karcioglu et al., 2018; Aryolcu, 2014). Li et al. (2007) studied the reliability and validity of the NRS scale and the quantification scale. The results showed that the current (current) pain, the most severe (worst) pain, the least (least) pain and the average (average) pain The reliability of ICC (Interclass correlation coefficient) is .822.</description>
