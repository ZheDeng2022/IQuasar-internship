  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) in its seasonal and perennial form is a common allergic condition. The&#xD;
      majority of allergic rhinitis sufferers report nasal (congestion, sneezing, itching and&#xD;
      rhinorrhea) and ocular (redness, watery eyes, itching and burning) symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coldamaris akut nasal spray is a Carragelose® containing hyperosmolar solution that is&#xD;
      indicated for supportive treatment in case of blocked nose due to rhinitis of any kind.&#xD;
      Carragelose® is a sulfated polymer from red seaweed also widely used in the food industry and&#xD;
      has GRAS status (FDA). The increased osmolality is based on the addition of sorbitol. This&#xD;
      clinical study has the aim to show that Coldamaris akut has a mild decongestant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, controlled, double-blinded randomized two-way cross-over single&#xD;
      site study in adult subjects (18 to 65 years) who demonstrate a grass pollen specific&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity and have a history of grass pollen induced allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without controlled asthma. In the cross-over setting two&#xD;
      treatments, namely Coldamaris Akut and Coldamaris sine will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the trial is to demonstrate a decongestant effect on the nasal mucosa of&#xD;
      patients treated with Coldamaris akut nasal spray compared to subjects treated with&#xD;
      Coldamaris sine nasal spray in grass pollen induced rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be based on the assessment of nasal congestion symptom during grass&#xD;
      pollen challenge performed in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (environmental exposure chamber).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective of the trial is to demonstrate the clinical performance of Coldamaris&#xD;
      akut nasal spray on nasal symptoms compared to subjects treated with saline nasal spray.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded randomized two-way cross-over&#xD;
      single site study in adult subjects (18 to 65 years) who demonstrate a grass pollen specific&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity and have a history of grass pollen induced allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without controlled asthma. In the cross-over setting&#xD;
      Coldamaris akut nasal spray will be evaluated compared to Coldamaris sine nasal spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one week prior to first treatment block, subjects will be screened for appropriate&#xD;
      allergic response. A total nasal symptom score (TNSS) of at least 6 points out of 12 with a&#xD;
      single symptom score for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; ≥ 2 within the first two hours in the grass&#xD;
      pollen challenge chamber is required to be included into the study. If a screening for&#xD;
      appropriate allergic response was done during the last 6 months, results from this allergy&#xD;
      challenge can be used to fulfil the respective inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the screening provocation the medical and allergic history, safety lab as well&#xD;
      as retrieving inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed via anamnesis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      all safety assessments will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Visit 1 and visit 2 could be done on the same day!&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Day1 of first treatment period Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      the two treatment arms (fully blinded) in the order of appearance and their screening numbers&#xD;
      assigned at visit 1. Subjects will enter the study site about one hour ahead of the start of&#xD;
      allergen provocation. After positive completion of all study relevant assessments, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized and enter the allergy challenge chamber for 6 hours. About one hour&#xD;
      forty-five minutes after entry (after the eighth subjective score), the first treatment with&#xD;
      the respective nasal spray will take place under staff supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjective nasal symptom score will be recorded every fifteen minutes during a 6-hour&#xD;
      allergen exposure challenge. Anterior rhinomanometry will be performed regularily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Day1 of second treatment period Subjects will enter the study site about one hour&#xD;
      ahead of the start of allergen provocation. In the following Visit 4 will be done in the same&#xD;
      way as Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the respective study treatments, a wash-out period of at least 7 days must be adhered&#xD;
      to allowing complete symptom relief from previous challenge. After the wash-out period,&#xD;
      subjects change to the second treatment block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire trial, subjects will be asked to monitor for adverse events (AEs), and they&#xD;
      will record the use of concomitant medications on the provided form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after the final provocation session, subjects will complete the trial after their&#xD;
      follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design is appropriate for the indication studied. Validated methods of data&#xD;
      collection, analysis, and evaluation will be used for the trial.&#xD;
