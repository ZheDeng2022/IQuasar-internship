  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a sub-study of a 5-year study designed to investigate how antibody and T cell responses&#xD;
      following influenza vaccine compare among lung transplant patients, patients waiting for lung&#xD;
      transplantation, and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to investigate influenza vaccine-induced antibodies in lung transplant&#xD;
      patients between seasons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the recent past, immunization policy-making bodies advised against immunizing too early in&#xD;
      the influenza season because vaccine-specific antibody may wane before the end of the&#xD;
      influenza season. This recommendation was based on only a small amount of data in frail&#xD;
      elderly individuals, and further examination of the evidence shows that influenza vaccine&#xD;
      antibody may last much longer. The influenza immunization timing recommendation is now&#xD;
      changed to immunize when vaccine is available and continue throughout the season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes led the investigators to the question of duration of influenza vaccine-induced&#xD;
      antibody in lung transplant patients. No published studies of antibody persistence in this&#xD;
      population could be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a 5-year study of influenza antibody response in lung transplant patients, in&#xD;
      patients awaiting lung transplantation, and in healthy controls, serum was obtained before&#xD;
      and 2-4 weeks after influenza immunization for each season. Therefore, a serum sample was&#xD;
      collected on each participant approximately 11 months after influenza vaccine administration&#xD;
      for each of 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate duration of influenza antibody titers, antibody concentrations to the previous&#xD;
      season's vaccine antigens were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that immunosuppressed lung transplant patients would maintain protective&#xD;
      concentrations of influenza antigen-specific antibodies (an antibody titer of at least 1:40)&#xD;
      beyond the influenza season.&#xD;
