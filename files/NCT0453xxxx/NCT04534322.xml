      patients with triple class refractory (TCR) multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, expanded access program protocol to provide access to melflufen for&#xD;
      patients with RRMM in medical need, who have progressive disease after they received a&#xD;
      minimum of at least two prior lines of therapy, are triple-class refractory to at least one&#xD;
      PI, at least one IMiD and at least one anti-CD38 mAb or intolerant to a specific therapeutic&#xD;
      drug class. Patients with primary refractory MM are eligible to participate as long as they&#xD;
      meet the criteria of being triple class refractory. They may meet these criteria for triple&#xD;
      class refractory MM if they have received at least one PI, at least one IMiD, and at least&#xD;
      one Anti-CD38 mAb in their first line treatment or have had at least 2 prior lines of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
