  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this application is to develop and evaluate Spanish-language hearing&#xD;
      education materials for adults. Our hypothesis is that participants will demonstrate better&#xD;
      understanding of their hearing loss and associated difficulties, and will be better able to&#xD;
      identify options for self-management following delivery of culturally and linguistically&#xD;
      appropriate patient education materials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are documented disparities in hearing healthcare use between Hispanic/Latino adults and&#xD;
      non-Hispanic/Latino Whites, despite similar hearing loss prevalence rates. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that a lack of culturally competent interventions contributes to poor healthcare&#xD;
      delivery and outcomes for those with limited English proficiency. The objective of this&#xD;
      application is to develop and evaluate Spanish-language hearing education materials for&#xD;
      adults. Our hypothesis is that participants will demonstrate better understanding of their&#xD;
      hearing loss and associated difficulties, and will be better able to identify options for&#xD;
      self-management following delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate patient&#xD;
      education materials. The rationale for the proposed research is that findings will contribute&#xD;
      to the development and testing of novel interventions aimed at increasing hearing healthcare&#xD;
      access and utilization in vulnerable populations in a subsequent R01 application.&#xD;

    <measure>Self-Efficacy for Hearing Loss Management (disease-specific primary outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 4-6 weeks post baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Partners in Health Scale-Audiology version. The original Partners in Health scale assesses management of chronic conditions and has been validated in several languages, including Spanish. Items are scored from 0-8 with higher scores indicating better self-management. The Partners in Health Scale-Audiology is an 11-item modified version of the original Partners in Health scale, and assesses the hearing loss-specific domains of actions, psychosocial behaviors, and knowledge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Efficacy for Chronic Health Condition Management (generic primary outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 4-6 weeks post baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Self-Efficacy to Mange Chronic Disease Scale-Spanish language version. The Self-Efficacy to Mange Chronic Disease Scale is a 4-item scale with high internal consistency (α=0.93) that measures changes in self-efficacy following participation in a disease self-management program. Items are scored from 1-10 with higher scores indicating better condition self-management.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hearing Loss Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 4-6 weeks post baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Hearing Beliefs Questionnaire. Assesses participants' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to hearing loss at baseline and post-intervention. The Hearing Beliefs Questionnaire is a 26-item measure segmented into 6 domains: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived self-efficacy, and cues to action. Each domain includes between 3 and 8 visual analog scale items, with a range of adequate internal consistency of α=0.61-0.77. Possible score range for each item is 0 to 10, ranging from two endpoints of &quot;highly agree&quot; to &quot;highly disagree&quot; and &quot;highly likely&quot; to &quot;highly unlikely&quot;. Item responses are averaged across domains as summary scores. As a Spanish-language version has not yet been validated, the Hearing Beliefs Questionnaire will be included as a secondary, exploratory outcome.</description>
