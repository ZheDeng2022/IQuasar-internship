      Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate which cold application is more&#xD;
      effective to regulate skin temperature in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Materials and&#xD;
      Methods: Fifty-four patients with lateral epicondylitis were randomly divided into 2 groups&#xD;
      as cooling gel (n=27) group and cold pack (n=27) group. Cooling gel and cold pack&#xD;
      applications were applied on painful lateral epicondyle region for 15 minutes. Patients were&#xD;
      assessed before and after the application. Assessments included the severity of pain during&#xD;
      wrist extension, evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and thermal imaging of lateral&#xD;
      epicondyle region evaluated by Infrared Thermography (FLIR5 Thermal Camera).&#xD;

    <description>The severity of shoulder pain at rest, night and activity was evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Accordingly, in a line of 10 cm 0 point refers to no pain, 10 point was considered to be the maximum value of pain. Patients were asked to mark the severity of their pain and tape measurement was recorded in cm.</description>

    <description>Infrared thermography (IRT) uses a thermal camera that receives and processes the infrared radiation emitted from the surface of the body. Thus, IRT records the temperature distribution of the skin.</description>
