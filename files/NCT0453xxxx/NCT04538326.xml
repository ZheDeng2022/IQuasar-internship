  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons post stroke executed stepping activities under four conditions: standard of care,&#xD;
      interacting with: an off-the-shelf Microsoft-Kinect game, with a self-paced repeated custom&#xD;
      video game and a game-paced random custom video game. Exercise intensity (neuromuscular and&#xD;
      cardiovascular), enjoyment and perceived effort were measured during and after each&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons post stroke were first familiarized with the four exercise conditions and then&#xD;
      instrumented with a metabolic system and heart rate sensor. They played the games in two&#xD;
      counter balanced blocks: repeated (standard of care and self-paced repeated custom) and&#xD;
      random (Microsoft-Kinect game and game-paced random custom). Games were played for 8.5&#xD;
      minutes with ten minutes of rest in between so they could return to physiological baseline.&#xD;
      During exercise they reported exertion and at the end of teach exercise trial they completed&#xD;
      an enjoyment questionnaire. At the end of the first block, participants removed the metabolic&#xD;
      system's mask and were assessed for motor recovery. Performances were video taped. At the end&#xD;
      of data collection preferences for the activities were ranked and participants answered open&#xD;
      ended questions. Data for neuromuscular and cardiovascular intensity, enjoyment and perceived&#xD;
      effort were reduced and analyzed using a Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (RMANOVA)&#xD;
      with the appropriate post-hoc corrections. Where possible clinically meaningful changes were&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
