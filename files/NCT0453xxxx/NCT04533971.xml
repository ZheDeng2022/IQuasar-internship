  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (Latin: Sclerosis multiplex; MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and&#xD;
      degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterised by a varied course and&#xD;
      symptomatology. The chronic nature of the disease and gradual loss of tissue within the CNS&#xD;
      result in increasing neurological deficits and motor failure over time. Due to the&#xD;
      characteristics of the symptoms and the chronic course of MS, patients with MS use various&#xD;
      forms of physiotherapeutic procedures throughout most of their lives, including especially&#xD;
      often whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) treatments. The aim of this study was to assess potential&#xD;
      changes in bioelectrical muscle activity during rest and contraction after exposure on 20&#xD;
      series of Whole body cryotherapy (WBC) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Assessment&#xD;
      potential relationships between the sEMG parameters and functional state in patients with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis pre and post 20 series of WBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, 114 patients with MS participated in the planned procedures of research. The&#xD;
      participants were randomly assigned to the two groups, WBC and control. The sample size was&#xD;
      60 in WBC, and 54 in control groups. Testing before and after series of WBC consisted of:&#xD;
      clinical assessment of fatigue was performed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), gait speed&#xD;
      using Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25-FW), Hand grip strength (HGS), and surface electromyography&#xD;
      (sEMG) of the dominant hand.&#xD;

    <description>The WBC procedure consisted of 2-3 min walk in the cryogenic chamber at -110â„ƒ. Immediately before the WBC procedures, the patients were provided with a special treatment suit, they were instructed as to how to protect the parts of the body that are particularly vulnerable to frostbite, on the proper way of moving and breathing during the treatment. Excluding Saturdays and Sundays, the WBC treatments were performed daily for the next four weeks. Each time after the WBC the subjects participated in 15-minute kinesitherapy exercises conducted in groups of 5-6 people. The exercises were of general improvement nature and took into account the mobility of the subjects.</description>
