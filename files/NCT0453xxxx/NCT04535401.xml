  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of BAY&#xD;
      1895344 in combination with FOLFIRI in treating patients with stomach or intestinal cancer&#xD;
      that is unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment or has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body (advanced or metastatic). BAY 1895344 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as irinotecan,&#xD;
      fluorouracil, and leucovorin, (called FOLFIRI in short) work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving BAY 1895344 in combination with FOLFIRI may help shrink&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic stomach and/or intestinal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of elimusertib (BAY 1895344) with&#xD;
      leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity by overall response rate (ORR), progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the response and clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response +&#xD;
      stable disease) of BAY 1895344 with FOLFIRI in colorectal and gastric/gastroesophageal&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      damage signaling in the context of the chemotherapy backbone alone and when combined with BAY&#xD;
      1895344.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate the PK profile of BAY 1895344. VI. Evaluate the relationship between ATM status&#xD;
      by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and clinical efficacy of the BAY 1895344/FOLFIRI combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the exposure-response relationship between drug exposures and toxicity and&#xD;
      response, and UGT1A1 genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the relationship between tumor mutations and clinical efficacy of the BAY&#xD;
      1895344/FOLFIRI combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of elimusertib, irinotecan, and fluorouracil with&#xD;
      fixed-dose leucovorin followed by a dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive elimusertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 and&#xD;
      irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, fluorouracil IV over 46 hours,&#xD;
      and leucovorin calcium IV on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 day in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 1 year or until their disease gets worse or they begin a new treatment for&#xD;
      their cancer.&#xD;

               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
                  partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
                  immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
                  adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
                  participation, and 6 months after completion of study treatment administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of prior treatment with an ATR inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of other malignancy that could affect compliance with the&#xD;
             protocol or interpretation of the results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to BAY 1895344, 5-FU, leucovorin, or irinotecan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications that are substrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic window or strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible, if they&#xD;
             cannot be transferred to alternative medication. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical&#xD;
             reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal pathology or history that adversely impact the ability to take or&#xD;
             absorb oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BAY 1895344 as a DNA-damage&#xD;
             response inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with BAY 1895344 breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with BAY 1895344 and for 4 months after end of&#xD;
             treatment. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who were unable to tolerate prior irinotecan treatment are excluded from this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;= 470 msec are excluded from this study&#xD;
