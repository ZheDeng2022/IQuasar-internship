  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a common clinical disease with high disability and mortality, which seriously&#xD;
      threatens human life and health.Carotid atherosclerotic plaque rupture is an important&#xD;
      pathogenic basis of ischemic stroke, so judging the stability of plaque has important&#xD;
      clinical significance in preventing ischemic stroke.Ultrasound, as a convenient, rapid,&#xD;
      noninvasive, radiation-free auxiliary examination technology, is widely used in carotid&#xD;
      plaque stability examination.At present, there are many methods to judge the stability of&#xD;
      carotid plaque based on ultrasound, including two-dimensional ultrasound, contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound, ultrasound elastography and so on. However, the results of plaque stability&#xD;
      judgment by various technologies deviate greatly, which is not conducive to the development&#xD;
      of standardized diagnosis and treatment strategies by clinicians.Studies have shown that&#xD;
      because the neovascular epidermal cells in atherosclerotic plaques are imperfect, they are&#xD;
      easy to rupture after stress, and the ruptured neovasculature will lead to intraplaque&#xD;
      hemorrhage, thus causing plaque shedding, and eventually obstructing the cerebrovascular&#xD;
      cause stroke.Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can sensitively detect the distribution and course&#xD;
      of blood vessels.The plaque's softness and hardness determine its stability, while the&#xD;
      difference of lipids, fibers and calcium in the plaque determines its softness and&#xD;
      hardness.Real-time ultrasound elastography can provide tissue mechanical parameters, express&#xD;
      the soft and hard of tissue with strain value, and provide important reference information&#xD;
      for judging plaque stability.At present, elastography technology is used to reflect the&#xD;
      hardness of plaque, so as to further judge its stability.However, the elastography parameters&#xD;
      are prone to deviations due to the influence of the selected section and the selected region&#xD;
      of interest.It can be seen from the above that there is currently a multi-modality method to&#xD;
      evaluate the stability of carotid plaque using ultrasound, but there is a lack of a unified&#xD;
      and objective reference standard for plaque stability assessment.The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to explore the comprehensive utilization of these modalities under the premise of optimizing&#xD;
      each ultrasound modality to provide a unified and objective criterion for judging the&#xD;
      stability of carotid plaque.&#xD;
