    <intervention_model_description>After completing the relevant laboratory tests and endoscopic examinations at screening, subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria are randomly assigned to X842 capsule low-dose group, X842 capsule high-dose group, and lansoprazole enteric-coated capsule group for 4-week treatment and then receive endoscopy. In the study, the duration of subjects receiving treatment with the test drug or comparator is 4 weeks. If a subject has the reflux esophagitis (RE) uncured under endoscopy at week 4 of treatment, the sponsor will give the subject lansoprazole enteric-coated capsules for free for another 4 weeks' treatment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This trial uses a double-blind double-dummy design, where both the investigator and the subject are blinded to the drug given to the subject. X842 capsules (test group), lansoprazole enteric-coated capsules (control group), and placebo are provided by the sponsor. The physical appearance, shape, specification and dosage of the test drug and comparator as well as the placebo are generally similar.</masking_description>
