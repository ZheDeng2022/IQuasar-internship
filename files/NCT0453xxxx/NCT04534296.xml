  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare the impact of early mobilization and routine care on diaphragm&#xD;
      thickness in critically ill children&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a life-supporting therapy that intrinsically induces diaphragm&#xD;
      rest. Consequently, mechanical ventilation induces time-dependent diaphragm weakness in&#xD;
      animals and in critically ill patients, and is referred to as ventilator-induced diaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction (VIDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases with VIDD, the decrease in diaphragm thickness can be detected by bedside&#xD;
      Ultrasonography. The onset of diaphragm atrophy in the intensive care unit could be very&#xD;
      rapid (fewer than 5 days). Vivier E. defined muscle atrophy as greater than or equal to a 10%&#xD;
      decrease in muscle thickness on day 5 compared to day 1. It's found that diaphragm atrophy&#xD;
      occured in 17/35 (48%). However, There is always some cases presented an increase in&#xD;
      diaphragm thickness. Goligher EC. reported that approximately 20% of mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients exhibit an increase in diaphragm thickness. In our previous study, there were about&#xD;
      46.7%(14/30) of ventilated children had increased diaphragmatic thickness. It's supposed that&#xD;
      the thickening might associated with the diaphragm injury during mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early mobilization may enhance the weaning of ventilated children, so the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the percentile of cases with increase diaphragmatic thickness will decline&#xD;
      by early mobilization. To investigate this hypothesis, investigators are conducting a&#xD;
      randomized trial examining the effects of early mobilization versus routine care on changing&#xD;
      tendency of diaphragm thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled children requiring mechanical ventilation will be randomized to either early&#xD;
      mobilization group or routine care group. Diaphragm thickness will be measured by ultrasound&#xD;
      on day1, day3, day5 and day7 after intubation and subsequently diaphragm thickness changing&#xD;
      tendency will be calculated in each arm. The operator acquiring ultrasound images will be&#xD;
      blinded to the care mode that the subject was randomized to. Subjects in the study will&#xD;
      follow standard ICU sedation awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials. The medical&#xD;
      team in charge of the subject will determine when the subject is safe to receive early&#xD;
      mobilization according to the standard established along with the rehabilitation team.&#xD;

    <description>Early mobilization will be performed in this arm. Critically ill children will be assessed for appropriate activity within 24 hours of intubation. When the safe criteria is met, early mobilization goals will be set according to the children's clinical conditions, developmental maturity, strength and endurance. The detailed mobilization activities include bed repositioning，passive or active range of motion and stretching exercises, passive or active respiratory muscle strengthening, sitting in bed, transfer from lying to sitting at edge of bed. Progressive mobilization goals will be individualized for each subject daily.</description>

    <description>Early mobilization is a kind of rehabilitation strategy. When the safe standards are met, early mobilization will be performed on subjects randomized in EM group for 30 minutes each time, twice a day, from Monday to Friday. The detailed mobilization activities include bed repositioning，passive or active range of motion and stretching exercises, passive or active respiratory muscle strengthening, sitting in bed, transfer from lying to sitting at edge of bed.
