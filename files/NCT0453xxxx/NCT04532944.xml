  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In multiple sclerosis (MS), the sequence of events leading to irreversible neuro-axonal&#xD;
      degeneration, which is a major determinant of clinical disability, is poorly understood.&#xD;
      Recently, the key role of neuronal energy dysfunction in driving axonal degeneration has been&#xD;
      highlighted. In the neuronal injury pathway triggered by inflammation and myelin disruption,&#xD;
      multiple adaptive changes force the neuron to a temporary condition of &quot;virtual hypoxia&quot;,&#xD;
      characterized by a mismatch between energy demand and supply. If this condition of energy&#xD;
      dysregulation is not reversed within an appropriate time-window, neurons enter an&#xD;
      irreversible axonal degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two key questions on the relationship between early energy dysregulation and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration remain unanswered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) whether brain energy dysfunction measured at a given time point can predict the subsequent&#xD;
      occurrence of neurodegeneration; ii) to what extent and for how long neurons can bear this&#xD;
      &quot;virtual hypoxia&quot; before undergoing structural damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracking the &quot;energetic signature&quot; of MS and defining its temporal distance from irreversible&#xD;
      damage is essential for the development of neuroprotective therapies.The recent optimization&#xD;
      of innovative magnetic resonance (MR)-based techniques such as sodium (23Na) MRI, phosphorus&#xD;
      MR spectroscopy (31P-MRS), and diffusion-weighted 1H MRS (DW-MRS) has allowed the generation&#xD;
      of promising in vivo data on cellular energy dysregulation in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to explore whether MR-derived metrics of energy&#xD;
      dysregulation predict MR-derived parameters of cortical neurodegeneration developing over 2&#xD;
      years, as reflected by cortical atrophy. To address this key question, the Investigators will&#xD;
      use a combination of 23Na MRI, 31P MRS, and DW-MRS associated with advanced MRI sequences to&#xD;
      explore energy dysregulation in the sensorimotor region, and measurements of cortical atrophy&#xD;
      in the same area after 24 months in 40 patients with either relapsing-remitting or&#xD;
      progressive MS and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will also test whether MR-derived metrics of energy dysregulation at study&#xD;
      entry correlate, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with: i) global cortical atrophy;&#xD;
      ii) functional cortical reorganization resulting from the condition of energy dysregulation,&#xD;
      which precedes the occurrence of structural damage; iii) cortical demyelination and&#xD;
      remyelination; iv) clinical, neuropsychological and biological measures.&#xD;

      1. RESEARCH JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Energy dysregulation is a key process in the physiopathology of neurodegeneration in MS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several mechanisms have been suggested to play a major role in the physiopathology of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS), among which: inflammatory demyelination,&#xD;
      excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and ionic channel dysfunction. Each of these mechanisms is&#xD;
      potentially implicated in inducing an energy dysregulation. Moreover, the notion that early&#xD;
      neuronal energy failure may play a key role in axonal degeneration is being more and more&#xD;
      acknowledged. In these physiological conditions, myelin sheath integrity not only allows&#xD;
      efficient saltatory conduction of the action potential, but it also helps to maintain the&#xD;
      environment for neuronal survival by assuring the correct amount of cellular energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following myelin disruption and inflammation, multiple adaptive changes force the neurone to&#xD;
      enter a temporary state of &quot;virtual hypoxia&quot;. Indeed, the loss of axonal coverage determines&#xD;
      the VGSC redistribution along the axon and the re-expression of NaV1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, demyelination induces mitochondrial proliferation along damaged axons, together&#xD;
      with a complex for hyperactivity in order to support the sodium/potassium pump. These&#xD;
      compensatory mechanisms initially overcome the conduction block resulting from demyelination,&#xD;
      but in such conditions transmembrane electrochemical gradients are maintained at the cost of&#xD;
      an increased energy demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This supplementary energy demand leads to a dysequilibrium between energy demand and supply,&#xD;
      called &quot;neuronal virtual hypoxia&quot;. In MS energetic distress is worsened by the inflammatory&#xD;
      environment, which affects mitochondrial function and is associated with a cell structural&#xD;
      deformation. This condition of energy dysfunction is potentially reversible in the first&#xD;
      stages of the disease but, if not reversed after a certain time it induces a cascade&#xD;
      characterised by a mitochondrial function failure, free radical production and&#xD;
      sodium/potassium ATPase dysfunction. Ionic pump dysfunction induces an accumulation of&#xD;
      inter-cellular sodium with an inversion of calcium flux operated by the Na+/Ca2+ pump.&#xD;
      Calcium intracellular influx eventually leads to an irreversible neuronal degeneration.&#xD;
      Therefore, identifying in-vivo the early phase of neuronal energy dysfunction proceeding&#xD;
      neuro-axonal death and understanding its temporal relationship with reversible neuronal&#xD;
      degeneration is essential for the development of therapies aimed at reverting this&#xD;
      degenerative process and maintain long term neuronal integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Imaging energy dysregulation: state of the art&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimisation over the past few years of innovative techniques based on magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR) such as sodium MRI (23Na), phosphorus spectroscopy (31P-MRI) and diffusion-weighted&#xD;
      spectroscopy (DW-MRS), have enabled the production of promising data which allow the&#xD;
      clarification of different aspects of the initial phase of energy dysregulation in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies using 23Na MRI have shown an increase of the concentration of total sodium in&#xD;
      the brain of patients with MS, which is correlating with clinical disability. More recently,&#xD;
      more sophisticated techniques to quantify 23Na concentration have been proposed, such as&#xD;
      &quot;triple quantum filtered (TQF) imaging&quot;, which allows the differentiation between&#xD;
      intracellular and extracellular sodium, thus providing unique information on the early phase&#xD;
      of energy dysregulation. Due the relatively weak sensibility of 23Na MRI, high-field MRI is&#xD;
      particularly suited for TQF. The team lead by professor Matilde Inglese has recently applied&#xD;
      7 tesla TQF imaging in MS, showing that patients with a relapsing/remitting form of the&#xD;
      disease (RR-MS) have increased intracellular sodium concentration compared to healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. This reflects the pathological intracellular accumulation of 23Na as a&#xD;
      consequence of Na+ K+ ATpase dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      31-MRS allows the direct measurement of the concentration in the brain of phosphocreatine&#xD;
      (PCr) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy currency of cells. 31P-MRS&#xD;
      at 3T has shown that MS patients present higher PCr levels in the normal-appearing white&#xD;
      matter when compared to healthy controls. 21P-MRS has also shown that beta-ATP percentage was&#xD;
      higher in RR-MS and lower in progressive forms, reflecting a &quot;relatively high energy state&quot;&#xD;
      in the early phases of the disease, with a reduction in the progressive phase, leaving room&#xD;
      for axonal degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important technical processes have been reached through the successful generation of 31P-MRS&#xD;
      data at 7T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DW-MRS gives in-vivo measurements of the diffusion properties of creatine (Cr) + PCr. In a&#xD;
      recent study using DW-MRS at 3T, the Investigators found a reduced Cr+PCr diffusivity in the&#xD;
      normal-appearing white matter and the thalami of patients with MS compared with healthy&#xD;
      controls, reflecting a reduction of energy reserved in neurons and glial cells. Two&#xD;
      alternative hypotheses could explain the observed reduction of Cr+PCr diffusivity: an altered&#xD;
      intracellular transport of creatine, in particular from oligodendrocytes to neurones from one&#xD;
      to another, or a reduced PCr consumption due to an altered function of creatine kinase B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these results confirm the strong potential of combining these different techniques&#xD;
      (23Na MRI, 31PMRS and DW-MRS) in order to obtain innovative information on each aspect of the&#xD;
      pathogenic cascade linking energy dysregulation to neuro-axonal degeneration in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;

&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to explore the relationship between the MRI-derived&#xD;
      parameters reflecting energy dysregulation in the motor sensory regions (MSR) at study entry,&#xD;
      and the parameters of neurodegeneration in the MSR after 24 months in RR-MS and PMS patients&#xD;
      compared to healthy volunteers, through a combination of 23Na quantitative MRI, 31P-MRS and&#xD;
      DW-MRS, and measurements of cortical thickness.&#xD;

      3. CONCEPTION OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Type of research project&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric research project on human beings with physiopathologic purposes (no&#xD;
      health products involved), with a duration of 24 months, whose aim is to explore the role of&#xD;
      energy dysregulation in neurodegeneration, which is the main pathologic substrate of clinical&#xD;
      progression in patients with MS. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between energy&#xD;
      dysfunction and neuro-axonal damage in patients with MS compared to healthy controls, using a&#xD;
      combination of imaging methods and clinical, cognitive and biological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the techniques used in the study involve imaging methods with the injection of&#xD;
      contrast agents, the research will be classified as interventional research of category 1,&#xD;
      according to the Jardé Law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Methodology of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, controlled, open label clinical-radiological research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from the cohorts followed at the Department of Neurology of&#xD;
      Saint-Antoine Hospital and the Department of Nervous System Pathologies of the&#xD;
      Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. They will receive a first information on the research during the&#xD;
      consultation, and the information form may be delivered on this occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be selected from the volunteers of the Center of Clinical&#xD;
      Investigation (CIC) of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be included at the CIC of the Brain and Spine Institute (ICM) -&#xD;
      Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of RR-MS (n=20) and progressive (PP-MS or SP-MS, n=20) patients will be studied and&#xD;
      compared to a group of healthy volunteers (n=15), age- and gender-matched (but without a 1:1&#xD;
      matching between patients and controls). The choice of matching a sample of 40 patients to a&#xD;
      sample of 15 healthy volunteers is based on the calculation of the minimum number of&#xD;
      observations per group needed to detect a between-group difference in the evaluation&#xD;
      criteria, using a multivariable linear regression model.&#xD;
