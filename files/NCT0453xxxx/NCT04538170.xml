    <textblock>
      Phantom pain is associated with cortical reorganization after amputation. This phenomenon&#xD;
      should not play a role in transsexual women, since the cortical representation of the male&#xD;
      sex organs is presumably altered. The study investigates the incidence of phantom pain in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study the following question should be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is the incidence of phantom pain and local chronic postsurgical pain lower in sex&#xD;
      reassignment surgery from male to female compared to inguinal tumor orchidectomy?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phantom pain is a common and much studied phenomenon after amputation.The loss of visceral&#xD;
      organs is also associated with phantom pain. Under entirely different conditions than the&#xD;
      removal of a tumorous testicle, sex reassignment surgery from male to female sex occurs in&#xD;
      transsexual women. In this operation, parts of the penis and both testicles are removed and a&#xD;
      plastic surgical transformation is made into a female genital.The surgical trauma is greater&#xD;
      compared to an orchidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sex reassignment surgery is expressly desired, the amputated tissues are rejected or&#xD;
      perceived as not belonging to the patient's own body and thus do not appear as a loss. The&#xD;
      group of patients with tumor orchidectomy acts as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the incidence of phantom pain and chronic local postoperative pain in&#xD;
      comparison between the two groups, the secondary objectives of the study were defined as the&#xD;
      occurrence of phantom pain, the type of pain and the intensity of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two patient groups were compared, the group after sex reassignment surgery (GAC) and the&#xD;
      group after inguinal orchidectomy for testicular tumor (ORC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 265 transgender women were written to, 46 of whom had undergone surgery in&#xD;
      Tübingen and 219 in Munich. The operations took place between 2002 and 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the group of patients after orchidectomy, 158 men who had undergone surgery in Tuebingen&#xD;
      between 2010 and 2014 were contacted by letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pseudonymization was done with a combination of letters and numbers, which were created&#xD;
      with a key generator program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients received a questionnaire divided into several categories, these categories were&#xD;
      questions on demography, pre- and postoperative pain as well as phantom pain, pain&#xD;
      processing, quality of life, sex life and urological questions.&#xD;
