  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To present the 9. months clinical results of percutaneous Ven Restoration Therapy (VRT), a&#xD;
      new method in the treatment of primary femoral vein insufficiency.Twenty four patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with isolated primary femoral vein insufficiency between January 2020 and December&#xD;
      2020 were included in the study. Before the procedure, junctional femoral vein diameters and&#xD;
      reflux times were measured. CEAP classification and Venous clinical severity scores (VCSS)&#xD;
      were recorded. Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ-20) were also recorded.&#xD;
      Then, VRT was applied percutaneously to the anterior and posterior of the femoral veins of&#xD;
      the patients, and the diameter of the femoral vein was narrowed and valve coaptation was&#xD;
      achieved. After the procedure, vein diameters and reflux times were measured again. All&#xD;
      parameters were reevaluated by calling patients for control at 1.,3., 6. and 9. months.&#xD;

    <description>This is a novel and promising method, applied percutaneously, in the treatment of deep venous insufficiency . In this method, developed based on the effects of compression garments, a polymer consisting of cyanoacrylate and hyaluronic acid is injected, with ultrasound-guidance, percutaneously around the femoral vein. In this way, the diameter of the vein is reduced, and function is restored to the inadequately functioning valve. The procedure is also called percutaneous valvuloplasty. The underlying idea in the development of this product was that hyaluronic acid might cause an increase in connective tissue, while cyanoacrylate could serve as an exoskeleton by forming heavy tissue.</description>
