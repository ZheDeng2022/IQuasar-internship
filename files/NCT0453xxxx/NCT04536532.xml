  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts: healthy subjects and chronic hepatitis B patients. Healthy&#xD;
      subjects will conduct a single-dose, multiple-dose and food effect study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Single-Dose Study：There will be a total of 6 dose cohorts（25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 400 mg,&#xD;
      600 mg, 800 mg). 25 mg cohort as experimental cohort, plans to enroll 4 subjects (male or&#xD;
      female) who will use HEC121120 tablets . The other else cohorts will include 10 subjects, of&#xD;
      which 8 receives HEC121120 tablets and 2 receives placebo, regardless of gender. Each subject&#xD;
      will only participate in one dose cohort. Each cohort will be divided into 2 group. The first&#xD;
      group consists of 3 sentinels, two receiving active and one placebo. The second group will&#xD;
      consist of the remainder of the cohort (6 active and 1 placebo) and, following review of the&#xD;
      available safety data, will be dosed 24 hours after the sentinel group. Subjects can leave&#xD;
      the pharmacy after their biological samples are collected on day 5. Subjects in each cohort&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of HEC121120 or placebo in the fasted state on day 1, and safety&#xD;
      evaluation is to be performed on day 2 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Food effect: There will be 1 dose cohort (200 mg), only to be admitted to the 100 mg dose&#xD;
      cohort if a single dose has been completed and is safe and well tolerated. A total of 18&#xD;
      subjects were enrolled in this dose cohort, divided into two groups A and B (9 subjects in&#xD;
      each group, 8 subjects in each group received HEC121120 and 1 received the placebo, with the&#xD;
      ratio of male to female as close as possible. All subjects were required to participate in a&#xD;
      single dose and food influence study on pharmacokinetics. Two cycles of cross-dose&#xD;
      administration were performed, with a washout period of 7 days. Four sentinels were first&#xD;
      enrolled in group A, and their safety indexes were evaluated by the investigator at least 24&#xD;
      h after administration. If tolerated, the remaining 5 sentinels could be enrolled in group A,&#xD;
      and the remaining 4 sentinels could be enrolled in group B. The safety indexes were evaluated&#xD;
      by the investigator at least 24 h after administration, if tolerated, the remaining 5&#xD;
      sentinels could be enrolled in group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Multi-Dose Study: There will be 1 dose(200 mg) cohort which will consist of 12 subjects,&#xD;
      of which 10 receive HEC121120 tablets and 2 receive placebo, with the ratio of male to female&#xD;
      as close as possible. All subjects will receive HEC121120 or placebo for 5 consecutive days&#xD;
      (study doses, administration method (fasted or fed), dosing frequency, and dosing period are&#xD;
      all to be determined based on data from the single-dose study and multiple-dose study).&#xD;
      Subjects can leave pharmacy after their biological samples are collected. Safety evaluation&#xD;
      is to be performed on day 3 and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV:Chronic hepatitis B patients: There will be a total of 3 dose cohorts (100、200、400 mg).&#xD;
      Each cohort will consist of 14 subjects, of which 12 receive HEC121120 tablets and&#xD;
      placebo(Entecavir simulation tablet), 2 receive Entecavir and placebo(HEC121120 simulation&#xD;
      tablet). It is necessary to determine the administration method and dose for patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B based on the results of the tolerance and PK study of healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Each subject will only participate in one dose cohort.Initially, the drug frequency was set&#xD;
      as once a day for 28 consecutive days. Safety and antiviral activity evaluation is to be&#xD;
      performed on day 7, 14, 21±2, 29, 35±2.&#xD;
