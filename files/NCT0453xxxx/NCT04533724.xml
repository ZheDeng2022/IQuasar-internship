      Negative symptoms are one of the five-dimensional symptoms of patients with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      and medications are not effective in treating negative symptoms. The mechanism of negative&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia is unknown, which may be related to insufficient dopamine function&#xD;
      of the prefrontal cortex. Amisulpride is a D2/D3 receptor antagonist, which can improve&#xD;
      negative symptoms. Intestinal microbes are related to central nervous system mental diseases.&#xD;
      Animal studies have found that changes in the intestinal microflora are related to&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Clinical studies have found that the gut microbes of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia are different from those of normal healthy people. Therefore, we are trying to&#xD;
      discover the changes of gut microbes in patients with effective amisulpride treatment, and to&#xD;
      improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia patients through the intestinal immune system.&#xD;
      The mechanism of brain relationship provides direction, and also provides a new way for the&#xD;
      drug treatment of negative symptoms.&#xD;

      Negative symptoms are one of the five-dimensional symptoms of patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Drug treatment of negative symptoms is not effective. Even if the positive symptoms are&#xD;
      relieved, the negative symptoms continue to exist, which seriously affects the personal&#xD;
      family social function and is an important risk factor for poor prognosis. The mechanism of&#xD;
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia is unknown, which may be related to insufficient dopamine&#xD;
      function of the prefrontal cortex, but the pathogenesis is still not fully explained.&#xD;
      Amisulpride is a D2/D3 receptor antagonist, which can improve negative symptoms, but the&#xD;
      mechanism is not clear. Intestinal microbes are related to central nervous system psychiatric&#xD;
      diseases, and intestinal flora imbalance may be an important cause of autism, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, schizophrenia and other mental and psychological diseases. Under pathological&#xD;
      conditions, when the intestinal microbiome is disturbed or the intestinal mucosal barrier is&#xD;
      destroyed, microbial-related molecules stimulate macrophages and dendritic cells to produce&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate adaptive immune cells, leading to the&#xD;
      destruction of immune homeostasis and enteric nerves The system can also interact with the&#xD;
      central nervous system through the brain-gut axis. Intestinal microbes may also influence the&#xD;
      occurrence of mental illness through metabolites. Animal studies have found that changes in&#xD;
      the intestinal microflora are related to schizophrenia. Clinical studies have found that the&#xD;
      gut microbes of patients with schizophrenia are different from those of normal healthy&#xD;
      people. Therefore, we are trying to discover the changes of gut microbes in patients with&#xD;
      effective amisulpride treatment, and to improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients through the intestinal immune system. The mechanism of brain relationship provides&#xD;
      direction, and also provides a new way for the drug treatment of negative symptoms. This&#xD;
      study intends to select 30 patients with schizophrenia with dominant negative symptoms (study&#xD;
      group) and 15 healthy people with similar living environment (control group), and the study&#xD;
      group will be treated with amisulpride (flexible treatment), negative symptom factor The&#xD;
      score reduction rate reached 20% for the effective group. Followed up for 8 weeks, fresh&#xD;
      stool samples were collected at the baseline, 2, 4, and 8 weekends for 16S rRNA sequencing&#xD;
      and short-chain fatty acid detection, and whole blood samples for immune factors (IL-1β,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-10, TNF) -α) Test to assess the negative symptom factor scores of PANSS, CDSS, CGI,&#xD;
      TESS, SAS, and Barnes akathisia, and evaluate the patient's negative symptoms, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, efficacy and adverse reactions in turn. Comparing the differences in the intestinal&#xD;
      microflora of the two groups at baseline, the correlation between the changes of the&#xD;
      intestinal microflora of the effective group of amisulpride and the immune factors and&#xD;
      negative symptoms. To understand the pathogenesis of schizophrenia patients with dominant&#xD;
      negative symptoms through the gut microbiota-brain axis.&#xD;
