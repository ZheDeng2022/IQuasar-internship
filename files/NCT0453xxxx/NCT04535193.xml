    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical 18F-mFBG as an&#xD;
      imaging agent for quantification of myocardial sympathetic innervation. The first part of the&#xD;
      study will examine control subjects, patients with very low likelihood of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. This initial part will determine optimal imaging procedures for studying uptake and&#xD;
      clearance of 18F-mFBG in myocardial sympathetic neurons and provide preliminary data for&#xD;
      estimating radiation dosimetry in adults and developing reference files for quantification of&#xD;
      normal and abnormal levels of the radiopharmaceutical. The second part will examine a group&#xD;
      of stable patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 heart failure (HF) and&#xD;
      reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function (LV ejection fraction (EF) ≤35%). The primary&#xD;
      objectives of the second part will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  document the degree to which 18F-mFBG uptake in the heart is reduced and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  characterize the distribution of regional abnormalities in relation to findings on other&#xD;
           cardiac imaging studies such as myocardial perfusion (MP) and magnetic resonance (MR)&#xD;
           imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of 18F-mFBG will be judged in relation to historical experience with other&#xD;
      nuclear imaging agents for cardiac sympathetic innervation imaging such as a&#xD;
      123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) and 11C-hydroxyephedrine (HED).&#xD;
