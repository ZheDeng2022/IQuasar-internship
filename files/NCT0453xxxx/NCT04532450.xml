  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ten percent of the population above 60 years develops an aortic abdominal aneurysm. In case&#xD;
      of rupture, this pathology leads to death in more than 70% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past ten years, Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) has been the most used&#xD;
      technique for elective treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in patients with a&#xD;
      favorable anatomy. But despite excellent postoperative results with a significant reduction&#xD;
      of mortality , a close follow-up of these patients is mandatory to detect any potential&#xD;
      endoleaks particularly in patients with a long-life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failed Endovascular Infrarenal Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) with development of a proximal&#xD;
      endoleak exposes the patient to the risk of rupture and must be treated. This type of&#xD;
      endoleaks are often related to dilatation of the proximal neck of the AAA, and of the&#xD;
      suprarenal aorta, making the use of any aortic fixation system, or uncovered stent&#xD;
      ineffective. In these cases, open surgical conversion with stent graft removal is possible&#xD;
      but at the price of a significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative is the use of a fenestrated or branched stent graft (F/BEVAR) extending the&#xD;
      proximal sealing zone to a non-diseased aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility, early and midterm outcomes&#xD;
      of (F/BEVAR) in patients with a proximal endoleak following a standard EVAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a multicentre study between January 2010 and December 2019 in 8&#xD;
      French University Centres which included 85 patients with 3 years of post operative&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between January 2010 and December 2019, all patients (n=85) who developed after EVAR, a&#xD;
      secondary type IA endoleak, and received a F/BEVAR stent graft were entered in a prospective&#xD;
      multicentre study bringing together 8 French university centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type IA secondary endoleak was defined as an endoleak appearing during follow-up, but absent&#xD;
      on computed tomography angiography (CTA) within 30 days of EVAR. All aetiologies leading to&#xD;
      the development of this endoleak were recorded in the study, including any abnormality of the&#xD;
      infra-renal stent graft, any aneurysmal evolution of the neck of the infra-renal aneurysm,&#xD;
      and any aneurysmal evolutionof the inter-renal or thoracoabdominal aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients gave their informed consent for the operation. Following the European regulation&#xD;
      on data management, the database was anonymised, upon completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients had a preoperative assessment of cardiac, renal, respiratory function and&#xD;
      underwent an ASA physical status classification. All preoperative imaging were performed on&#xD;
      &lt;1.5 mm slices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All F/BEVAR were performed using a COOK Zenith stent graft (Cook Medical Inc. Bloomington,&#xD;
      Ind). The number of fenestrations used was based on the preoperative sizing made from 3D-CTA&#xD;
      reconstructions. The investigators only used on-label F/BEVARs which were approved by the&#xD;
      Zenith cook planning centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures were performed under general, epidural or local anaesthesia, depending on the&#xD;
      preference of the anesthesiologist, surgeon or patient. Procedures were performed in a&#xD;
      conventional operating theatre or a hybrid room as described elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General postoperative complications included any cause mortality. Acute kidney injury was&#xD;
      defined following the KDIGO criteria , and myocardial infarction according to the generally&#xD;
      accepted criteria. Postoperative respiratory complications were defined by the need for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours or re-intubation. SCI was classified according&#xD;
      to the severity of the American Spinal Injury Association score and stroke was classified&#xD;
      according to National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines were used to define technical success,&#xD;
      major adverse events, aneurysm sac changes, endoleak and device integrity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      F/BEVAR procedures were analysed in an intention to treat. A procedure was considered&#xD;
      successful if the stent graft was implanted without any Type IA or type III endoleak, and&#xD;
      with patent target arteries on peroperative angiography and on CTA or contrast enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound performed within the first week following the procedure. Target artery instability&#xD;
      was defined as any branch-related death, rupture, occlusion or reintervention for stenosis,&#xD;
      kink, endoleak, or disconnection. Monitoring during follow-up was carried out by CTA, at 3, 6&#xD;
      and 36 months thereafter. Any endovascular or open revision related to the procedure was&#xD;
      recorded during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate analysis was performed using t-tests for normally distributed continuous&#xD;
      variables, and Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-normally distributed continuous variables.&#xD;
      Chi-square or Fisher tests was used when appropriate for categorical variables. Time&#xD;
      dependent outcomes including patient survival, freedom from reintervention, freedom from&#xD;
      endoleak and target arteries patency were reported using Kaplan-Meier time-to-event method. A&#xD;
      p-value &lt; .05 was used to assess statistical significance. All analyses were performed with&#xD;
      SPSS V26, (IBM Corp.) and Medcalc Â®.&#xD;
