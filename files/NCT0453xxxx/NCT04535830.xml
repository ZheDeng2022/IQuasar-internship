    <textblock>
      People with new-onset type 2 diabetes who achieve and sustain glycemic targets is important&#xD;
      for reducing the risk of complications and all-cause mortality.Glucose monitoring is the key&#xD;
      point of diabetes management.Continuous glucose monitoring(CGM)can identify day-to-day&#xD;
      glucose profiles to guide management decisions.Flash glucose monitoring is a variant of CGM&#xD;
      and is factory calibrated,requiring no finger pricks.The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if Flash glucose monitoring improves glycemic control in adults with new-onset type&#xD;
      2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, randomized controlled trial. The investigators plan to recruit 200 persons with type 2 diabetes diagnosed within six months. Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either use of a flash glucose monitoring system(FSL) or self-monitoring blood glucose(SMBG) . All participants need to wear the flash glucose monitoring sensor at baseline and at the end of the experiment for data analysis.During the three months of experiment,participants at the FSL group will wear a flash glucose monitoring sensor for 14 days and have a care visit every month,while people at SMBG group will monitor their glucose by pricking a finger at home and receive a care visit every month as well.&#xD;
The primary outcome is the between-group difference in mean HbA1c at 3 months. Meanwhile,researchers want to know whether differences in glucose variability and diabetes-specific distress between two groups.</intervention_model_description>
