  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a multi-center, single-blinded, prospective, randomized, study to&#xD;
      compare the safety and effectiveness of the CellFX System to the comparator group,&#xD;
      Electrodessication for the treatment of SH lesions in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This SH comparative study will evaluate safety and efficacy in a split face design using the&#xD;
      CellFX System and pre-defined energy profile for all primary and secondary treatments based&#xD;
      on Fitzpatrick Skin Types and tip size. The comparator group will be treated with the same&#xD;
      standardized intralesional electrodesiccation procedure conducted by all participating&#xD;
      clinical sites. Subjects with 4-10 qualifying SH lesions on the face except the scalp, nose&#xD;
      and within the orbital region will be enrolled. Each subject will be evaluated by the blinded&#xD;
      site investigator at 7-days, 30-days, and 60-days post-initial CellFX and Electrodessication&#xD;
      treatments. At the 30-day follow-up visit, lesions will be evaluate using Global Aesthetic&#xD;
      Improvement Scale (GAIS), for eligibility to receive an additional treatment. In case of a&#xD;
      second treatment, the subject will be evaluated by the blinded site investigator at 30-days&#xD;
      and 60-days post-retreatment. Photography of the study lesions will be captured along with&#xD;
      the blinded site investigator assessments at all visits.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The Principal Investigator will select a sub investigator to be the blinded investigator to classify healing characteristics and aesthetic appearance of each subject's selected lesions at baseline and treated lesions post treatment and at 7-days, 30-days, and 60-days following the last CellFX treatment or Electrodessication. This sub investigator will be blinded to the treatment assignment. The subject may not be blinded to the treatment assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>The CellFX System consists of a electrical pulse console combined with a handpiece coupled with a sterile single patient-use treatment tip (1.5 x 1.5mm, 2.5 x 2.5mm, and 5.0 x 5.0mm). Based on the size of the SH lesion and treatment tip used, a predetermined treatment energy setting is selected to deliver a sequence of electrical pulses to the SH lesion area directly beneath the treatment tip.</description>
