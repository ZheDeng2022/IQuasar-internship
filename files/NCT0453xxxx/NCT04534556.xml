  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Texas Biomedical Device Center (TxBDC) has developed an innovative strategy to enhance&#xD;
      recovery of motor and sensory function after neurological injury termed targeted plasticity&#xD;
      therapy (TPT). This technique uses brief pulses of vagus nerve stimulation to engage&#xD;
      pro-plasticity neuromodulatory circuits during rehabilitation exercises. Preclinical findings&#xD;
      demonstrate that VNS paired with rehabilitative training enhances recovery in multiple models&#xD;
      of neurological injury, including stroke, spinal cord injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury. Recovery is associated with neural plasticity in spared motor&#xD;
      networks in the brain and spinal cord. Moreover, two initial studies and a recently completed&#xD;
      Phase 3 clinical trial using a commercially available device demonstrates that paired VNS&#xD;
      with rehabilitation is safe and improves motor recovery after stroke. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to extend these findings and evaluate whether VNS delivered with the new device&#xD;
      paired with rehabilitation represents a safe and feasible strategy to improve recovery of&#xD;
      motor and sensory function in participants with stroke.&#xD;
