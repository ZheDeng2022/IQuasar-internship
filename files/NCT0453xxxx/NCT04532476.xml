  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that 90% of the patients experience pain during orthodontic treat-ment.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of a double dose of photobio-modulation&#xD;
      (PBM) therapy on pain perception in patients having fixed appliance treat-ment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-two patients were recruited to participate in this single-blinded, place-bo-controlled&#xD;
      study. Four elastomeric separators were placed, mesially and distally to the upper first&#xD;
      molar on each side. The right side of the upper jaw was treated with low-power diode laser,&#xD;
      and the left side was a placebo, same treatment with laser switched off. Two doses of PBM&#xD;
      therapy (660nm, 90mW) were delivered 24 hours apart. The par-ticipants filled out the&#xD;
      questionnaire immediately after the placement of separators and before 1st laser treatment&#xD;
      (TO), 12 hours (T1), 24 hours (T2), 2 days (T3) and 3 days after the 1st treatment (T4). At&#xD;
      each evaluation period, the degree of pain was scored twice, one for each side.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placing elastomeric separators is a part of the orthodontic treatment to create space for the&#xD;
      orthodontic bands. This initial tooth displacement induces pain and instant release&#xD;
      bio-chemical mediators such as prostaglandin-E2, substance P and interleukin 1-beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that 90% of the patients experience pain in at least one part of the&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment. Pain starts two hours after application of orthodontic fixed&#xD;
      appliance, raises over the next 24-36 hours, starts to decrease on day 3, and disappears&#xD;
      within 6-7 days.There are two principal groups of methods for controlling orthodontic pain:&#xD;
      pharmacolog-ical and non-pharmacological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser photobiomodulation (PBM), also called low-level laser therapy (LLLT), is the&#xD;
      ap-plication of the light to pathology to encourage tissue regeneration, decrease&#xD;
      inflammation and relieving pain. The wavelength used for this purpose is in the red and&#xD;
      infrared spectrum (600-1000nm). There is no complete understanding of the mechanisms behind&#xD;
      PBM, however enormous upturn has been done in this part. PBM has an impact on molecular,&#xD;
      cellular and tissue level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past studies in this field have demonstrated the opposite outcomes of PBM therapy on&#xD;
      relieving the pain after the insertion of orthodontic separators. Part of the researches&#xD;
      showed a positive effect in pain reduction and some presented no effect. The studies with&#xD;
      positive outcomes have no consistent specification such as wavelength, dose, radiant&#xD;
      exposure, irradiance, tip diameter, average power output, peak power (for gated mode), time,&#xD;
      or position of the points of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of low-level diode laser in&#xD;
      decreasing the level of pain at the beginning of an orthodontic treatment caused by&#xD;
      elas-tomeric separators. The null hypothesis for this study was that no difference existed&#xD;
      among laser-treated and placebo side in reducing pain caused by elastomeric separators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study design This is a single-blinded, placebo-controlled, split-mouth&#xD;
      study. The design of this study was split-mouth to eliminate all components related to&#xD;
      differences among subjects. The study was carried out at Department of Orthodontics,&#xD;
      University Dental Clinic, Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka. Ethical approval was obtained from&#xD;
      the Ethical Committee of the Clinical Hospital Center of Rijeka, Croatia (003-05/2/-1-/22,&#xD;
      2170-29-02/1-20-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size was decided by the Power analysis (G*power 3.1.) based on the&#xD;
      results from the previous study [29] and predicting study power of 0.95 and a significance&#xD;
      level of 0.05. The program calculated the sample size of at least 22 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and inclusion criteria The sample included 22 participants (12 females and 10&#xD;
      males) Procedure Four elastomeric separators (American Orthodontics, Sheboygan, WI, USA were&#xD;
      placed, mesially and distally to the upper first molar on each side, with a specially&#xD;
      designed plier (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the laser and the placebo sides were applied by the diode laser (Laser HF, Hager-Werken&#xD;
      GmbH &amp; Co., Duisburg, Germany), which was set at PDT mode (660nm) acu-puncture therapy. The&#xD;
      power of the laser was set at 90 mW in intervals of 80 seconds as recommended by the&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was determined in advance that the right side of the upper jaw was treated with laser, and&#xD;
      the left side was placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laser was applied perpendicular in contact with the mucosa on 1 point of the buccal and 1&#xD;
      point on the palatal side of the first molar approximately on the middle part of the root,&#xD;
      with the 10mm distance from the laser to the mucosa. Each point was treated in 3 intervals,&#xD;
      80s each, in total 240s on vestibular and 240s on the palatal side per tooth. The treated&#xD;
      surface was 1cm2. The power of the laser was 90mW, wavelength 660n, beam area 1 cm2,&#xD;
      irradiance per target 0.09 W/cm2, during 240 seconds of treatment interval per point-&#xD;
      21.6J/cm2 of energy was delivered, with total energy applied 43.2 J per tooth. Pla-cebo side&#xD;
      was treated the same way with the difference that the laser was switched off, but with the&#xD;
      maintained sound signal, implying laser was working, so that participants were blinded to the&#xD;
      allocation of the group, only the operator knew whether the side is laser treated or placebo.&#xD;
      During the period of the laser irradiation, both the patient and orthodontist used goggles&#xD;
      designed to block the laser's wavelength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same laser treatment was performed the next day, as the pain was noted to be highest&#xD;
      within 24 hours after the placement of separators.&#xD;
