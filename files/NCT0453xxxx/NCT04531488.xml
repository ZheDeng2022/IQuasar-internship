      This study compared conventional powered mobility practice to simulator based practice of&#xD;
      children with special needs aged 6-18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 stages: 1) Simulator validity study 2) Powered mobility outcome measures&#xD;
      reliability and validity for children 6-18 years 3) Intervention study to compare simulator&#xD;
      based practice and powered mobility practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simulator validity study included 30 children aged 6-18 years, proficient powered&#xD;
           mobility drivers. All participants had physical disabilities- CP or Neuromuscular&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This stage included the first 30 children from the intervention study. Data for the&#xD;
           study was based on the first evaluation out of the two evaluations in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This stage included 36 children aged 6-18 years in need of powered mobility practice to&#xD;
           become a proficient driver. The particpants were divided into two groups- experimental&#xD;
           (simulator based practice) and control group (standard powered wheelchair practice).&#xD;

    <time_frame>This outcome measure is done at baseline and after 12 weeks of practice.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an evaluation that has up to 34 items that assess the driving skills of powered wheelchair users. Each skill can receive a score of 0-5. The higher the score the better. The total sum of all skills is divided by the number of skills tested and an average score ranging from 0-5 is recorded.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Learning Powered Mobility Use- Assessing change from Baseline to End of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure is done at baseline and after 12 weeks of practice.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an evaluation that has 8 levels of 5 skills. It assess the level of powered mobility driving in areas that the PMP does not- cognitive, emotional, social. Each of the 5 skills receives a score of 1-8. The sum of all skills scores is divided by 5. The score can be between 1-8. A higher score is better.</description>

    <time_frame>This outcome measure is done at baseline and after 12 weeks of practice.</time_frame>
    <description>This is an evaluation that assess 7 powered mobility skills. The driver needs to succeed 4/5 times each skill in order to pass test. Each of the 7 skills receives a score of 1,3,5. The sum of all skills is divided by 7 and the average score is recorded 1-5. The higher the score the better.</description>

    <description>Powered mobility simulator- the McGill Immersive Wheelchair Simulator (MiWe) was developed for adults. In a previous study the simulator was found valid for use with children. Participants were provided a laptop, joystick and the software program- MiWe- to practice at home or school</description>

    <description>Two groups of participants- 18 in each- were provided with either a simulator or powered wheelchair. Both groups were tested at baseline for powered mobility level. Both groups the practiced at home or school for 12 weeks, 4 times a week for at least 20 minutes. Both groups returned and underwent another evaluation to assess powered mobility level after 12 weeks of practice.</description>
