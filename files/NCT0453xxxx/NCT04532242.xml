  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community participants will visit the neuroimaging facilities at CU Boulder for a single&#xD;
      experimental session. In all studies, participants will complete pre-task questionnaires&#xD;
      (trait measures), and a brief mood measure, followed by a task training in which a research&#xD;
      assistant describes and gives examples of cognitive reappraisal in response to negative&#xD;
      images. Then, participants complete an event-related, picture-based cognitive reappraisal&#xD;
      task for 30-45 minutes, during which whole-brain BOLD signal will be collected. Following the&#xD;
      task, participants will once again respond to a mood measure, and answer a series of&#xD;
      questions regarding the task they have completed, including difficulty of regulation, or any&#xD;
      images that were personally relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers predict that the positive emotion induction will result in powerful effects&#xD;
      on self-reported emotion which may or may not interact with the cognitive reappraisal&#xD;
      condition. Participants will be trained to use reappraisal to increase positive emotion, and&#xD;
      they will be asked to respond with the reappraisal tactic category that best fits the&#xD;
      reappraisal they used for each image. The researchers predict greater use of future-focused&#xD;
      tactics will be associated with greater reappraisal success, which in turn will result in&#xD;
      greater recruitment of vmPFC and connectivity between vmPFC and other prefrontal regions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For all studies, participants will be recruited via paper and electronic flyers on campus and&#xD;
      in the surrounding communities. Interested participants will be screened via phone, email&#xD;
      and/or web form to assess eligibility according to criteria listed elsewhere. Should&#xD;
      participants qualify, they will be invited to complete a single laboratory session at the&#xD;
      Intermountain Neuroimaging Facility at CU Boulder. Participants will be sent a copy of the&#xD;
      consent form to read in advance of their visit, and to keep for their records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once arriving at the laboratory, participants will complete the consent process, in which a&#xD;
      research assistant trained in ethical principles regarding human subjects research will&#xD;
      answer any questions about the consent form and verbally reinforce the key rights of the&#xD;
      participants outlined there. Once both parties are satisfied, consent forms will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then complete a mandatory day-of MRI eligibility form to ensure scanner&#xD;
      compatibility has not changed since the initial screening (done by phone, email or webform).&#xD;
      Females who are unable to indicate &quot;no&quot; to the question, &quot;is it possible that you are&#xD;
      pregnant?&quot; will be asked to take a pregnancy test provided at the MR facility. Participants&#xD;
      will change into MRI- compatible clothes or scrubs. Participants will sit with a trained&#xD;
      research assistant/experimenter who will give an overview of the entire session, and then&#xD;
      begin training for the cognitive reappraisal task. This training takes 10-15 minutes. During&#xD;
      the training, the experimenter will offer several possible reappraisals of negative images&#xD;
      and allow the participants to offer their own as well, providing encouragement and feedback.&#xD;
      During this training, the experimenter will also go over the method of encouragement and&#xD;
      feedback. During this training, the experimenter will also go over the method of responding&#xD;
      (using an external button box). Participants will be reminded during training that they may&#xD;
      stop the experiment at any point if the pictures are too upsetting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following task training, participants will make a general mood rating using the&#xD;
      PANAS. Then, participants will be screened one final time for metal in or near their bodies&#xD;
      at the door to the shielded MRI room, then be placed in the MRI scanner by a certified,&#xD;
      full-time MRI technician. Participants will be reminded they can stop the experiment at any&#xD;
      point if they are physically uncomfortable or become claustrophobic, and will be outfitted&#xD;
      with a panic button to indicate that they wish to stop the experiment immediately once it has&#xD;
      begun. After the initial structural and calibration scans, participants will complete the&#xD;
      reappraisal task. The task will take 40-50 minutes (broken up into 4-5 separate functional&#xD;
      runs in the scanner, with each run taking around 10 minutes).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pre- and post-task mood as measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) will be taken before and after the intervention. The PANAS is a 20-question questionnaire rated on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 1 being &quot;very slight or not at all&quot; and 5 being &quot;extremely&quot;). Questions 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 19 represent the positive affect scale with scores ranging between 10 and 50 (the higher the score, the higher the levels of positive affect). Questions 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15,18, and 20 represent the negative affect scale with scores falling between 10 and 50 (lower scores represent lower levels of negative affect).</description>

    <measure>Task difficulty</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The next batch of questions will ask the participant questions about the difficulty of the task. An example question is &quot;How difficult was it to follow the 'LOOK' instruction?&quot; Participants will be rating the level of difficulty on a scale of 1 to 7 with 1 being &quot;not difficult at all&quot; to 7 being &quot;very difficult&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Task compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about self-reported task compliance. For example, one question will ask &quot;What percentage of the time were you able to follow the &quot;LOOK&quot; instruction?&quot; The participants will be rating their self-compliance for each task from 0% (non-compliant) to 100% (fully compliant).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Experience with task images</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked whether they have any experience with reappraisal or the specific images presented in the task. The first question will ask &quot;Have you ever been trained to change your emotions by changing the way you think (in therapy, or in another experiment, or anywhere else)?&quot; Participants can choose &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; for this question. The participant will have to extrapolate if they have changed their emotions before using a fill in the blank. The next question will ask &quot;Have you ever seen any of these exact emotional images before?&quot; The participant then once again will be asked to extrapolate which images they have seen and what emotional response was generated by these images using a fill in the blank option.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depression trait differences</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will be given the Beck's Depression Inventory(BDI-II) which measures symptoms of depression and will be used to examine any between-subjects trait differences. The BDI-II is a 21 self-report measure looking at symptoms of depression with ratings falling between 0 and 3 (0 being &quot;not at all&quot; and 3 would indicate experiencing these symptoms on a constant basis).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional regulation trait differences</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) looks at methods of regulating emotions and will be used to examine any between-subjects trait differences. The ERQ is a 10-item self-report questionnaire assessing the use of two strategies to alter emotions: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. The scale is rated on a 7-point Likert scale with 1 being &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and 7 being &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Six items are categorized as using cognitive reappraisal while four of the items assess expressive suppression.</description>
