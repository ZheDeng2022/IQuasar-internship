  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a group-based and web-delivered&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention for ovarian cancer survivors (Mindful Living [ML]) compared to a&#xD;
      health promotion condition (Healthy Lifestyles [HL]) in increasing health related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQOL) and decreasing perceived stress, depressive mood (primary aims), anxiety, and&#xD;
      fatigue (secondary aims) across a 12-month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Living WELL is a randomized clinical trial examining two different programs for helping&#xD;
      ovarian cancer survivors cope and improve the quality of their lives following treatment. The&#xD;
      programs include techniques and information to enhance both mental and physical well-being.&#xD;
      The study is conducted through an internet video conferencing platform and is open to&#xD;
      survivors in all parts of the US. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of&#xD;
      various factors such as emotions, stress management and coping techniques, and health&#xD;
      information on quality of life, stress levels, depression, fatigue, and distress in ovarian&#xD;
      cancer survivors. Participants are randomized into either a Mindful Living group (targeting&#xD;
      stress management skills - e.g., relaxation, coping) or a Healthy Lifestyles group (targeting&#xD;
      health promotion strategies - e.g, nutrition, sleep, exercise). Participation in this study&#xD;
      includes taking part in an introductory online meeting, 10 consecutive weekly online&#xD;
      sessions, and follow-up meetings at approximately 4.5 and 9 months following randomization.&#xD;
      Each session will be 1.5-2 hours. Participants will complete surveys online prior to&#xD;
      beginning the program, within a week after the 10-week program is completed, and at 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months later.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women between 18 and 90 years of age with a cytological or histological diagnosis of&#xD;
             any stage of epithelial ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, fallopian tube cancer or&#xD;
             cancer of Mullerian origin consistent with ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal origin&#xD;
             (not consistent with endometrial cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who have completed primary treatment (surgery and chemotherapy or chemotherapy&#xD;
             alone for a new diagnosis of ovarian/peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer within the last&#xD;
             3 years). Date of completion of primary treatment is defined as within approximately&#xD;
             60 days after the last chemotherapy infusion. Maintenance therapy infusions do not&#xD;
             count in determining date of completion of primary therapy. Women who were not&#xD;
             recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (for example, in the case of certain&#xD;
             stage IA/IB cancers) are eligible after surgery alone. Women receiving consolidation&#xD;
             or maintenance therapy following primary chemotherapy or following treatment for first&#xD;
             recurrence are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Survivors must not have had more than one recurrence. Those who have had one&#xD;
             recurrence will be eligible if they have completed active therapy for their&#xD;
             recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Although most women meeting the above criteria will be in remission, complete clinical&#xD;
             remission (normal tumor markers and normal CT scan) is not a requirement for&#xD;
             eligibility. Even women with low-level disease after completion of cytotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapy who do not meet the strict definition of remission may have stable&#xD;
             disease and may not require additional cytotoxic chemotherapy for a prolonged period&#xD;
             of time, particularly if they are on maintenance therapy. If subjects recur during the&#xD;
             group they will be allowed to continue to participate, as able, even while taking&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Survivors must be fluent in spoken English (6th grade level), which is necessary to&#xD;
             participate in the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Survivors must be willing to be randomized and followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Survivors must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Survivors currently involved in the STEPS through Ovarian Cancer program will need to&#xD;
             wait until their involvement is completed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Survivors currently involved in a study involving another behavioral intervention or&#xD;
             an exercise intervention must wait until the prior study is completed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-epithelial ovarian cancer, ovarian tumors of low malignant potential&#xD;
             (&quot;borderline&quot;), cancers originating from other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior inpatient psychiatric treatment for severe mental illness (e.g.&#xD;
             psychosis) or current psychosis, history of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia in the&#xD;
             last 2 years or current bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, current major depression,&#xD;
             history of substance use disorder in the last 2 years or current substance dependence,&#xD;
             organic mental disorder (e.g., dementia), or substance use disorder in the last 2&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are younger than 18 or older than 90 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to meet study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving primary chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of depression is not excluded as long as the patient is not currently&#xD;
             depressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently depressed as indicated by a CES-D Score ≥ 24&#xD;
