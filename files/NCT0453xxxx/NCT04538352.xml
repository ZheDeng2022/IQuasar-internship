      This study is designed to determine whether therapy with once-weekly sc semaglutide in&#xD;
      combination with once-daily insulin degludec will be capable of maintaining (or improving)&#xD;
      glycemic control, when substituted for multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI), in&#xD;
      patients with T2D with adequate glycemic control (≤ 7.5%) on MDI-based regimens (≤ 80 units&#xD;
      of insulin per day), vs. further titration of insulin therapy in those continuing MDI. Weight&#xD;
      loss, hypoglycemic episodes, and improvement in diabetes-treatment satisfaction will also be&#xD;
      assessed between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are often overweight or obese. In order to&#xD;
      obtain adequate glycemic control, many of these patients require intensive therapy with&#xD;
      multiple daily injections of insulin (referred to as MDI, basal/bolus regimen), using a&#xD;
      rapid-acting/bolus insulin at each meal in combination with a once- or twice-daily long-&#xD;
      acting/basal insulin. Unfortunately, intensive insulin therapy can result in undesired weight&#xD;
      gain, which may, in part, result in further insulin resistance. In addition, weight gain may&#xD;
      adversely affect the control of comorbid health conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, etc.). The burden of disease management with multiple&#xD;
      daily injections of insulin also serves as a barrier to A1C goal attainment as maintaining&#xD;
      compliance with such complex regimens is often challenging in the real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients with T2D require multiple daily injections of insulin to obtain glycemic&#xD;
      control, it is generally considered to be a permanent/life-long therapy. However, reports&#xD;
      have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of adding once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1&#xD;
      receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) liraglutide to basal insulin therapy in order to obtain glycemic&#xD;
      control (1, 2), and in clinical practice, the addition of liraglutide (or other FDA-approved&#xD;
      GLP-1RAs) to basal insulin often negates or delays the need to initiate prandial insulin.&#xD;
      Subsequently, a newer form of anti-diabetic therapy, a once-daily injectable combination of&#xD;
      GLP-1RA and basal insulin, became available and demonstrated promise that perhaps glycemic&#xD;
      control may even be obtained with less complex regimens (i.e., less daily injections). There&#xD;
      are currently two GLP-1RA/basal insulin combination therapies that are FDA approved:&#xD;
      iGlarLixi (Soliqua®), and iDegLira (Xultophy®) (3, 4). While these observations with&#xD;
      iGlarLixi and iDegLira demonstrating an improvement in A1C while avoiding prandial insulin&#xD;
      injections are very exciting, what remains unclear is if patients with reasonable glycemic&#xD;
      control (A1C ≤ 7.5%) currently receiving MDI (basal/bolus, 3-4 injections per day) could&#xD;
      potentially maintain or even improve glycemic control by switching to a once-daily injectable&#xD;
      product like Xultophy® or Soliqua®. Currently, there are no studies available (or planned)&#xD;
      that have answered this clinical question. One limitation of these combination products in&#xD;
      the clinical setting is the inability to independently titrate the GLP-1RA and basal insulin&#xD;
      components. If a patient begins to experience hypoglycemia, and/or their fasting BG values&#xD;
      are currently within the goal range, the dose of these combination products cannot be further&#xD;
      titrated, limiting one's ability to further improve glycemic control in patients with a&#xD;
      residual A1C elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What also remains unclear is if some of the newer formulations of GLP-1RA may also be able to&#xD;
      reduce the burden of disease management and maintain glycemic control in patients who are&#xD;
      currently well-controlled on a regimen of MDI. Recently, subcutaneous (sc) once-weekly&#xD;
      semaglutide has been demonstrated to be capable of improving glycemic control in patients&#xD;
      with T2D in combination with insulin therapy. In SUSTAIN-5 (5), at week 30, subcutaneous&#xD;
      semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg was demonstrated to reduce A1C by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, vs&#xD;
      0.1% with placebo [mean baseline A1C value, 8.4%] in a population of T2D patients receiving&#xD;
      stable therapy with basal insulin with or without metformin. Moreover, mean body weight (kg)&#xD;
      decreased with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo from baseline to end of treatment: 3.7,&#xD;
      6.4, and 1.4 kg, respectively. Premature treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was&#xD;
      higher for semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo (4.5%, 6.1%, and 0.8%), mainly due to&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders. Even if the transition from MDI to once-daily sc semaglutide in&#xD;
      combination with basal insulin were successful in only a minority of patients, the clinical&#xD;
      advantage and reduction in burden of disease management that would be associated with&#xD;
      transitioning from 3-4 injections of insulin per day to a regimen of once- weekly sc&#xD;
      semaglutide and a once-daily injection of basal insulin would be a rather dramatic and&#xD;
      remarkable transformation for patients, and one that would likely improve patients' diabetes&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction. It would also help to solidify the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      semaglutide in yet another population of patients with T2D. What cannot be minimized is the&#xD;
      tremendous impact that a successful transition to once-weekly semaglutide and once-daily&#xD;
      basal insulin could have on patients in terms of reducing their insulin requirements,&#xD;
      assisting with weight loss (or mitigating further weight gain), and reducing the frequency&#xD;
      and burden of hypoglycemia. In my clinical experience, once patients are titrated to full&#xD;
      dose GLP-1RA therapy and attain adequate glycemic control, insulin doses (particularly&#xD;
      prandial insulin) can often be further reduced or eliminated without negatively impacting&#xD;
      glycemic control. Continuing the insulin therapy at higher doses in these patients simply&#xD;
      suppresses the glucose-dependent secretion of endogenous insulin being promoted by the&#xD;
      GLP-1RA therapy. Often, only an abrupt cessation of prandial insulin, or a step-wise&#xD;
      down-titration of insulin therapy in these patients, will reveal that insulin therapy is no&#xD;
      longer required at higher doses to maintain glycemic control. When this does successfully&#xD;
      occur, the impact on patients is transformational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of once-weekly sc semaglutide (in&#xD;
      combination with once-daily basal insulin) to maintain or improve glycemic control in&#xD;
      patients currently receiving MDI, while providing the patients with a significant reduction&#xD;
      in the burden of disease management. In addition, this approach may also furnish a positive&#xD;
      effect on weight management, a reduction in hypoglycemic episodes, and improvement in&#xD;
      diabetes treatment satisfaction, when substituted for basal/bolus therapy in patients with&#xD;
      T2D who currently have adequate glycemic control (A1C ≤ 7.5%) with a regimen of MDI&#xD;
      (requiring a total of ≤ 80 units of insulin per day). The A1C cut-point of ≤ 7.5% was chosen&#xD;
      because many patients on complex treatment regimens (MDI) with reasonable control, i.e.,&#xD;
      7-7.5%, would be expected to have a realistic chance of success by switching from MDI to sc&#xD;
      semaglutide and basal insulin combination therapy. Also, many patients taking complex insulin&#xD;
      regimens (MDI) fall in the close to A1C goal range of 7-7.5%, so using this cut-point, vs. &lt;&#xD;
      7%, would make recruitment easier. Lastly, patients receiving MDI who are older and/or with&#xD;
      heart disease also have higher individual A1C goal/targets around 7.5%. This study will also&#xD;
      assess the impact that a successful substitution may have on the patients' diabetes treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction, an important, yet under-appreciated aspect of diabetes management.&#xD;
