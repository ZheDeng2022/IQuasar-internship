  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-blind, 3-arm, comparative, controlled, randomized, study conducted at one&#xD;
      site in Vietnam whose primary objective of the study was to demonstrate clinical equivalence&#xD;
      of the two production lots of Sci-B-Vac vaccine with respect to anti-hepatitis B-Surface&#xD;
      (HBs) response (Lot A = OLD BTG vaccine and Lot B = NEW SciGen vaccine). Secondary efficacy&#xD;
      analysis was performed to demonstrate non-inferiority of seroprotection of each lot of SciGen&#xD;
      vaccine when compared to Engerix-B vaccine&#xD;

      This was a single-blind, 3-arm, comparative, controlled, randomized, study conducted at one&#xD;
      site in Vietnam. Following a screening period, healthy eligible subjects (n = 402) were&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Sci-B-Vac OLD BTG, or Sci-B-Vac NEW&#xD;
      SciGen, or Engerix-B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in two stages, approximately a year-and-a-half apart. In the first&#xD;
      stage (Stage I) beginning in March 2006, Sci-B-Vac (OLD BTG) vaccine was compared to&#xD;
      Engerix-B; and in the second stage (Stage II) beginning in November 2007, the Sci-B-Vac (NEW&#xD;
      SciGen) vaccine was compared to Engerix-B. The subjects assigned to the Engerix-B group were&#xD;
      equally divided between the stages, 67 subjects in the Engerix-B group in Stages I and II,&#xD;
      respectively, for a total of 134 subjects. Immunogenicity evaluations for Stage I data&#xD;
      (Visits 5 and 6) were conducted together with Stage II data.&#xD;
