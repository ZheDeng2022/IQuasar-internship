  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide prevalence of primary and secondary infertility is estimated at ~2% and 10.5%,&#xD;
      respectively, among women aged 20-44 years and attempting to conceive. These women may enter&#xD;
      an IVF program and be classified as poor prognosis patients for several distinct causes (e.g.&#xD;
      advanced maternal age, low ovarian reserve). proper tailoring of the ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      protocol to maximize the number of oocytes collected represents a crucial step for them to&#xD;
      eventually conceive .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence indicates that in the same menstrual cycle, there are multiple follicular&#xD;
      recruitment waves. This is in accord with the theory that folliculogenesis occurs in a&#xD;
      wave-like fashion. Thus, within a single menstrual cycle, there can theoretically be multiple&#xD;
      opportunities for a clinician to collect oocytes, as opposed to the conventional single&#xD;
      cohort of antral follicles during the follicular phase .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilizing this concept, reproductive endocrinologists have been attempting to retrieve&#xD;
      oocytes from poor responders using both the follicular-phase stimulation (FPS) and the&#xD;
      luteal-phase stimulation (LPS) protocols in order to increase the number of oocytes collected&#xD;
      shorter period of time. The number of oocytes collected in IVF is a robust surrogate outcome&#xD;
      for clinical success since there is a clear relationship between the number of oocytes&#xD;
      collected and live birth rates across all female age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      which protocol is the most effective remains controversial and the efficacy of PPOS in POR&#xD;
      compared with that of conventional protocols is unclear.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted on 80 infertile women indicated for ICSI with criteria of poor&#xD;
      ovarian response defined by Bologna criteria(15) All participants will be informed about the&#xD;
      nature of the study and informed consent will be taken from all of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:40 patients will be given the progestin primed double stimulation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: 40 patients will be given the flexible GnRh antagonist follicular controlled ovarian&#xD;
      stimulations will be done in 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consents will be obtained from all participants who accept to participate in&#xD;
      the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete history taking and full assessment of different infertility factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hormonal investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FSH, LH, E2, Prolactin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AMH, TSH&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Basal transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and embryological procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The follicular phase of the double stimulation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. luteal phase priming using combined contraceptive pills from day 21 of the previous&#xD;
           cycle for one week (0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol, gestodene 0.075 mg, Gynera tab, Bayer&#xD;
           Pharma AG., Berlin, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Controlled ovarian hyper-stimulation with 225-375 IU of gonadotropins will be started&#xD;
           day 2-3 of menses after vaginal ultrasound confirming the absence of ovarian cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dydrogesterone (Duphaston, Abbott company, Illinois, United states) at 20 mg/day will be&#xD;
           started from the first day of the ovulation induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient response will be monitored by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Transvaginal follicular scanning and the dose of the gonadotropins will be modified&#xD;
                according to the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Serum estradiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Serum progesterone and LH on the day of triggering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. GnRh agonist triggering (Decapeptyl, Ferring, SAINT-PREX Switzerland) in a dose of 2&#xD;
           ampules of 0.2 mg will be administered when leading follicle &gt;18 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Oocyte pickup will be done 36 hours after GnRh administration with precaution of leaving&#xD;
           the follicles measuring 11 mm or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After the pick-up, oocytes will be denuded. The denuded oocytes are then assessed for&#xD;
           nuclear status. Mature oocytes will be used for ICSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The luteal phase of the double stimulation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled ovarian hyper-stimulation with 225-375 IU of gonadotropins will be started the&#xD;
      next day after the previous oocyte pickup simultaneously with Dydrogesterone (Duphaston,&#xD;
      Abbott company, Illinois, United states) at 20 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rest will be as the follicular phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Fertilization and embryo quality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fertilization check, which will be performed 16 to 20 hours after ICSI. The resultant&#xD;
      embryos will be scored, and they will be vitrified for subsequent transfer.&#xD;

&#xD;
      - Starting from the next menstrual cycle Day 3, patients will receive oral estradiol valerate&#xD;
      (Cyclo-Progynova (white tablets); Bayer, Germany) daily. From Day 10 onwards, endometrium&#xD;
      growth will be monitored by transvaginal ultrasound. When endometrial thickness ≥ 7 mm.&#xD;
      Progesterone administration (as 800 mg/day vaginal suppositories per day and 100 mg ampule IM&#xD;
      every other day) will be initiated and Embryo transfer will be scheduled on Day 3, 4 or 5&#xD;
      with maximum number of 3 class A embryos whether of cleavage or blastocyst stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Luteal support - Progesterone administration (as 800 mg/day vaginal suppositories per day&#xD;
      and 100 mg ampule IM every other day) will be continued until pregnancy testing 18 days after&#xD;
      embryo transfer. The pregnant cases will continue the luteal support till the 12 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. The flexible GnRH antagonist protocol controlled ovarian stimulation This controlled&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation will be done twice in two different cycles&#xD;
