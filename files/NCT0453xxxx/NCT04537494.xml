    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare prevention (oral supplementation with the probiotic L.&#xD;
      reuteri administered to every newborn within the first week of life for 12 weeks) with&#xD;
      treatment-as-needed (supplementation with the probiotic L. reuteri after randomization, to&#xD;
      infants who develop excessive cry/fuss up to 12 weeks of age). This is a single site pilot&#xD;
      study to assess feasibility for a full trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in five infants experience colic, defined as recurrent and prolonged episodes of crying&#xD;
      and fussing with no obvious cause in healthy infants less than 5 months of age. There is&#xD;
      evidence to support the role of the probiotic L. reuteri for treatment of colic in breastfed&#xD;
      babies and for prevention of colic. However, these two options (prevention vs&#xD;
      treatment-as-needed) have not been previously compared head-to-head. The study aims determine&#xD;
      if oral supplementation with the probiotic L. reuteri administered to every newborn within&#xD;
      the first week of life for 12 weeks (prevention) is superior to treatment-as-needed, as&#xD;
      measured by daily cry/fuss duration at 6 and 12 weeks of age.&#xD;
