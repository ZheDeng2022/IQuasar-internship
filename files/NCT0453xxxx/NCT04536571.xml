  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal hypothesis is to be tested in this work is that vision stability (the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure) with a spherical contact lens correction vs. a toric contact lens correction&#xD;
      will be the same.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomised, subject-masked, crossover, bilateral non-dispensing study,&#xD;
      controlled by cross-comparison. Thirty subjects will use each lens type at a single visit in&#xD;
      random sequence.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They are an existing wearer of soft spherical contact lenses in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. They have a spherical component of their spectacle refractive error between&#xD;
&#xD;
             -0.50DS and -6.50DS in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. They have a cylindrical component of their spectacle refractive error between&#xD;
&#xD;
             -0.75DC and -1.25DC in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. They can be fitted satisfactorily with both lens types.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. They own an acceptable pair of spectacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops (including comfort drops) or&#xD;
             ointment on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. They are aphakic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. They have had corneal refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or&#xD;
             have keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. They are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any&#xD;
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic&#xD;
             reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or&#xD;
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.&#xD;
