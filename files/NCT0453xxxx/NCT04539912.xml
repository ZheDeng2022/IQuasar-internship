      Objective: To compare the clinical efficacy of angulated screw-retained and cemented single&#xD;
      implant crowns(SIC) in esthetic region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: The study was a prospective, single center, randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Patients with the needs of single tooth restoration in esthetics region were recruited&#xD;
      from Oct. 2018 to Aug. 2019. Sixty patients were enrolled in the present study and they were&#xD;
      randomly assigned into two groups: angulated screw-retained group(AG, 30 patients) and&#xD;
      cemented group (CG,30 patients). Clinical and radiological evaluations were performed on the&#xD;
      day of final crowns delivery and 12 months later. Implant survival rate, marginal bone&#xD;
      loss(MBL), pro-inflammatory cytokinesin peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF)(TNF-α, IL-6),&#xD;
      mechanical complications, peri-implant conditions(mPI, PD, BOP%), pink esthetics score/white&#xD;
      esthetics score (PES/ WES) and patients satisfaction were assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Peri-apical radiographs with paralleling technique wereperformed on the day offinal restorations delivery and 1-year visit. Implant length was used as calibration reference. The distance between restoration margin and the most coronal level of implant-bone contactwas recorded. Final result was calculated as themean value of the mesial and distal sites</description>

    <description>Survival rates were defined as the percentage of success implants and remained crowns which never been replaced</description>

    <measure>Pro-inflammatory cytokinesin peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>we collected the patients' PICF with the paper strip (PerioPaper Strips; Oraflow Inc., Smithtown, NY, USA) at 1year follow-up to access differences in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) between two groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pocket probing depth(PD)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The depth of 6 sites（mesial, middle and distal of buccal/lingual ） was measured and the average value was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PES/WES</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>specific dentists were asked to give scores for variables of PES (Mesial papilla, distal papilla, level of soft-tissue margin, soft-tissue contour, alveolar process and soft-tissue color and texture) and WES (Tooth form, tooth volume/outline, color, surface texture and transparency) with the 2-1-0 scoring system. Final PES/WES was the sum the two. Total scores were defined as perfect rate (PES/WES≥22), acceptable rate (22&gt;PES/WES≥15) and unfavorable rate (PES/WES&lt;15).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>patient's satisfaction(PS) with aesthetics, function and comfort of the restoration at 1-year visit. 0 score was extremely dissatisfied and 10 score was extremely satisfied. We also defined the final scores as perfect rate(PS≥9), acceptable rate(9&gt;PS≥6) and unfavorable rate (PS&lt;6).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>bleeding on probing% (BOP%)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The BOP of 6 sites（mesial, middle and distal of buccal/lingual ） was probed and the percentage of BOP(+) was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>modified plaque index (mPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Score 0; No detection of plaque Score 1: Plaque only recognized by running a probe across the smooth marginal surface of the implant. Implants covered by titanium spray in this area always score 1.&#xD;
Score 2: Plaque can be seen by the naked eye. Score 3: Abundance of soft matter.</description>
