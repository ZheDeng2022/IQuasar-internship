    <textblock>
      Aetiology of dysphagia after extubation is unknown and considered to be multifactorial. Use&#xD;
      of a standardized dysphagia- screening permits an early diagnosis. This study is to evaluate&#xD;
      a new GUSS (gugging swallowing Screen) tool with multi-consistency check for intensive care&#xD;
      patients (GUSS-ICU) with dysphagia. The concurrent validity (in terms of sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of the GUSS-ICU is analyzed in comparison to the flexible endoscopic evaluation&#xD;
      of swallowing (FEES).&#xD;

      Aetiology of dysphagia after extubation is unknown and considered to be multifactorial. Use&#xD;
      of a standardized dysphagia- screening permits an early diagnosis. This study is to evaluate&#xD;
      a new GUSS (gugging swallowing Screen) tool with multi-consistency check for intensive care&#xD;
      patients (GUSS-ICU) with dysphagia. The concurrent validity (in terms of sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of the GUSS-ICU is analyzed in comparison to the flexible endoscopic evaluation&#xD;
      of swallowing (FEES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GUSS-ICU with multi-consistency check includes an indirect and a direct swallowing&#xD;
      attempt. In indirect swallowing, the vigilance is first assessed on the basis of the RASS&#xD;
      score (Richmond agitation-sedation scale), the presence of a stridor, the effectiveness of&#xD;
      coughing and screeting, the possibility of swallowing saliva, drooling (saliva) and the&#xD;
      change of voice after swallowing. If six points are reached, one can immediately proceed to&#xD;
      the direct swallowing attempt. Unlike the original GUSS, the new GUSS-ICU direct swallowing&#xD;
      test consists of 4 subtests with pulpy, liquid, solid and mixed solid-liquid consistency. The&#xD;
      mixed solid-liquid consistency has been supplemented, as mixed consistencies require a more&#xD;
      complex swallowing function with increased tongue- and lip coordination.&#xD;

    <description>Gugging swallowing screen - ICU (GUSS-ICU) index test:&#xD;
Screening for post-extubation dysphagia: GUSS-ICU performed by 2 speech therapists independently. The GUSS-ICU model contains the core features of the original GUSS tool with the added assessment items specific to the ICU Patient (RASS score (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale)).&#xD;
Stage one of the screen focuses on the preliminary investigation of indirect swallowing. Stage two is comprised of varying steps that directly test swallowing. This would include the administration of semisolids, water and bread with four distinct signs that were being assessed for - deglutition, coughing, drooling and voice change. The GUSS test is evaluated using a points system (0-10) which determines the severity of dysphagia and recommends a diet form that largely minimizes the risk of aspiration. (e.g. 10 points: No dysphagia = normal food).</description>

    <description>Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) reference test:&#xD;
Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) is a technique to directly view the pharynx, larynx and esophagus during swallowing. The swallowing test is carried out first with saliva and then with different consistency (liquid, pulpy, solid) and different sized swallowing portions. This reference test is performed independently from the GUSS-ICU index test.</description>
