      To investigate a new method to rapidly modulate pulmonary venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation&#xD;
      to enable the use of deoxyhemoglobin concentration in arterial blood as an intra-arterial MRI&#xD;
      contrast agent for cerebral tissue perfusion imaging.&#xD;

      Cerebral tissue perfusion can be examined by tracking a tracer through the cerebral&#xD;
      vasculature. Currently, This requires an infusion of the contrast agent. However,&#xD;
      advancements have been made in developing non-invasive imaging techniques to evaluate tissue&#xD;
      perfusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly attractive imaging approach as it&#xD;
      does not rely on ionizing radiation and has high spatial resolution. The common contrast&#xD;
      agent used to study cerebral tissue perfusion in MRI is gadolinium-based contrast agents.&#xD;
      However, these contrast agents tend to have several disadvantages including invasiveness,&#xD;
      renal toxicity, tissue accumulation, and allergic reactions. As they are injected&#xD;
      intravenously, they become highly dispersed in the arteries, requiring a complex computation&#xD;
      of the arterial input function. In addition, although they remain predominantly&#xD;
      intravascular, they tend to diffuse extravascular in neurovascular conditions which have a&#xD;
      breakdown of the blood brain barrier leading to measurement inaccuracies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently we have determined a way to generate an abrupt change in deoxyhemoglobin&#xD;
      concentration [dHb] as the blood passes the lungs, resulting in a precise and rapid targeted&#xD;
      change of [dHb] in the arterial blood. We hypothesize that such changes in [dHb] may be used&#xD;
      as a suitable MRI contrast agent for the measurement of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood&#xD;
      volume, and mean transit time (CBF, CBV and MTT respecrively) in comparison to that with&#xD;
      gadolinium. If suitable, dOHb would provide a non-invasive, inexpensive, and safe alternative&#xD;
      to perfusion imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 patients with neurovascular disease who are clinically referred to the TWH&#xD;
      Joint Department of Medical Imaging for gadolinium perfusion imaging will be recruited. Prior&#xD;
      to the imaging study each subject will be familiarized with the respiratory gas control&#xD;
      experimental setup. A plastic face mask and breathing circuit will be applied to the&#xD;
      subject's face and fitted to form an airtight seal with medical adhesive tape. Gas supply to&#xD;
      the mask and breathing circuit will be supplied by a programmable computer-controlled gas&#xD;
      delivery system (RespirActâ„¢ RA-MR System, Thornhill Research Inc., Toronto, Canada). The&#xD;
      sequence of gas delivery and changes in PCO2 and PO2 will be applied to familiarize the&#xD;
      subject with the sensations related to changes in the gases. Subjects will then be placed&#xD;
      supine in the MRI scanner. In addition to their prescribed clinical scans, two additional&#xD;
      scans will be obtained. The additional MRI scans will include: 1) a structural (anatomical)&#xD;
      sequence (4.30 minutes), followed by 2) a BOLD-EPI sequence while inducing changes of PO2.&#xD;
      PO2 will be held at a baseline of 45-50 mmHg (hemoglobin O2 saturation, SaO2 ~75%) for 60s.&#xD;
      For 10 s, the lung PO2 will be transiently raised to peak PO2 of 90-120 mmHg (normoxia)&#xD;
      within 2 s transition, reaching a SaO2 of ~100%, and then returned to baseline.&#xD;
      Alternatively, the baseline may be at normoxia and the gas challenges will target PO2 of&#xD;
      45-50 mmHg. A total of 4 such ventilatory challenges will be applied over 6 min while&#xD;
      maintaining normocapnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each PO2 stimulus, the BOLD signal will change in synchrony and inverse proportion to&#xD;
      [dOHb]. An arterial input function will be measured by separating arterial, tissue, and&#xD;
      venous voxels based on differences in [dOHb] bolus arrival times, amplitude of change, and&#xD;
      correlation to changes in [dOHb] measured from [Hb] and calculation of SaO2 from end-tidal&#xD;
      PO2. Arterial voxels, the first in the sequence of structures to receive the bolus, will be&#xD;
      averaged to yield an arterial input function that will be deconvolved with the tissue signal.&#xD;
      Whole brain maps of relative CBF, CBV, and MTT will be generated. Whole brain segmented gray&#xD;
      matter and white matter average values for these metrics will be calculated and compared&#xD;
      against the same metric values obtained using gadolinium perfusion imaging.&#xD;
