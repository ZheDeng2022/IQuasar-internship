      This study will observe the postoperative morbidity and mortality trends in patients with&#xD;
      non- traumatic abdominal pathology who will undergo emergency general surgery. This&#xD;
      prospective study will help us in establishing a prospective de-identified registry that may&#xD;
      be used to further research this cohort in the future.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives The first objective of this study is to analyze postoperative outcomes as&#xD;
      well as morbidity and mortality trends for this sick cohort of patients with non- traumatic&#xD;
      abdominal pathology who will undergo emergency general surgery. The second objective of this&#xD;
      study is to establish a prospective de-identified registry database that may be used to&#xD;
      further study this cohort in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Target Population The target population will be all patients between the ages of 18-99,&#xD;
           regardless of sex, racial or ethnic background that underwent emergent laparotomy and&#xD;
           planned/unplanned re-laparotomy. Variables to be analyzed in the study are in the&#xD;
           attached data collection excel sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Key Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All adult patients ages 18-99, regardless of sex, racial or ethnic background who&#xD;
                will undergo or underwent emergency abdominal surgery for acute abdomen due to&#xD;
                perforated viscus, acute bowel obstruction, bowel ischemia, acute or gangrenous&#xD;
                gall bladder, post-operative complications such as anastomotic leaks after bowel&#xD;
                anastomosis, abdominal compartment syndrome,enterocutaneous/enteroatmospheric&#xD;
                fistula or bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators will also include patients after organ transplant that will undergo&#xD;
                emergent surgery for post-operative bleeding, anastomotic leak or organ ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  As well as any patients undergoing bariatric surgery or colorectal procedures that&#xD;
                develop any complication that might need return to the operating room emergently&#xD;
                will also be included in the study from 2019 at Westchester Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Key Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Elective delayed repair for surgery done after clinic follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age &lt; 18 years or greater than 89 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vulnerable Populations Vulnerable populations such as children, fetuses, neonates, or&#xD;
           prisoners will not be included in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Design This study is a prospective observational study of patients that are&#xD;
           admitted to Westchester Medical Center and undergo emergency general surgery. Each chart&#xD;
           will be reviewed for pre-op, intra-op, and post-op variables outlined in data collection&#xD;
           tool. Data will be collected until one year after discharge on follow up visits. At the&#xD;
           end of the study, all of this data will be analyzed to determine if there are any trends&#xD;
           in mortality or morbidity for these patients. The variables will then be compared by&#xD;
           using step-wise logistic regression techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study Duration The study will take place between 02/10/2019 to 1/31/2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Number of Subjects The study team/Investigators aim to enroll approximately 300&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study team will follow patients for 1 year after discharge and the follow up visits are&#xD;
      conducted in the clinic after 30 days, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year of discharge.&#xD;
      Investigators will examine incision sites, drains if present and enquire about adequacy of&#xD;
      pain control and unplanned readmission including any therapeutic or diagnostic procedures&#xD;
      done, number of hospital days during readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Chi-square difference tests will be used to assess significant&#xD;
      differences in predictors on categorical outcomes. T-tests will be used to assess mean&#xD;
      differences in predictors on continuous outcomes. Univariable and multivariable logistic&#xD;
      regression analyses will be conducted for outcomes such as all-cause mortality, pneumonia,&#xD;
      sepsis, and multi-organ failure. Univariable and multivariable linear regression will be&#xD;
      performed for hospital length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Subjects will be recruited, consented, and data from medical record data will&#xD;
      be gathered prospectively. Data will be obtained on a patient's pre and perioperative&#xD;
      details, their interventions, and final outcomes. Two data files will be maintained: a master&#xD;
      file and an analysis (de-identified data) file.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Master File: Identifiable Data: Medical Record Numbers, date of birth, admission date,&#xD;
           discharge date, ICU admission date and time, any readmission data collected during&#xD;
           follow-up, and date of death (if applicable) will be collected as part of this study and&#xD;
           stored electronically in an Excel file (Master List). Each subject will be assigned an&#xD;
           ID ( 3 digit number) under which all the collected information will be stored for that&#xD;
           subject. This file will be password-protected. The Master File will also contain a&#xD;
           unique id that is used to link identifiable data with the de-identified dataset used for&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The de-identified dataset will also be password protected and each record will be&#xD;
           organized by the unique ID. This file will include derived fields such as length of stay&#xD;
           that will be calculated using data stored in the Master File.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Potential Study Risks This study involves no more than minimal risk to subjects as it&#xD;
           involves no additional treatment/interventions. There is the potential risk for breach&#xD;
           of confidentiality. However, all research personnel will be trained in how to maintain&#xD;
           confidentiality and protect PHI. Only research staff will have access to the&#xD;
           de-identified information. Hard copies are locked in a file cabinet and electronic files&#xD;
           are saved in password protected computers issued by WMC and computer access will be&#xD;
           monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Potential Study Benefits There are no direct benefits to the subjects participating in&#xD;
           this study. Future patients may benefit from the information obtained from this&#xD;
           prospective observational study. For example, to date, no large-scale prospective study&#xD;
           on damage control surgery in trauma and non-traumatic pathology has been identified. If&#xD;
           investigators observe an association between the variable that affects morbidity or&#xD;
           mortality, investigators may be able to initiate appropriate therapy in a more timely&#xD;
           fashion for future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data and Safety Monitoring Data Safety and monitoring will be done by the Principal&#xD;
           Investigator and the research team. Data will be queried from the database and kept in a&#xD;
           password protected excel spreadsheet. Only the PI will have the access to the data which&#xD;
           has been coded with the subject identifier. The PI designated research team members will&#xD;
           have the access to the de-identified data. Data will be stored on secure password&#xD;
           protected Westchester Medical Center (WMC) servers. The only hard copies of patient&#xD;
           documents will be the consent forms and HIPAA forms, which will be stored in a study&#xD;
           binder that will be kept in locked cabinets in the PI's office. The identifiable PHI&#xD;
           will be destroyed as soon as the data analysis is complete. The de-identified PHI will&#xD;
           be kept in a database for future research. The hard copies of the study documents will&#xD;
           be shredded.&#xD;
