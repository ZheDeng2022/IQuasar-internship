      Aim: The aims of this study are 1) to determine the demand of post-acute care among patients&#xD;
      with cardiovascular disease in China; 2) to identify the details of demands especially which&#xD;
      have value for the post-acute care for patients with cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A single center prospective cohort study. Methods: Patients will be enrolled from the&#xD;
      department of cardiology in a tertiary teaching hospital. The data on the demands of&#xD;
      post-acute care will be collected throughout the hospitalization and discharge. Patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease will be followed up for 3 months. The study was approved by the ethics&#xD;
      committee in August 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Post-acute care is very important for the short- and long-term outcomes of the&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular disease. This study will provide an effective tool for the&#xD;
      investigation of the detailed demands for post-acute care in cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      provide a better understanding of the demands for the patients with cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: In clinical practice, understanding of the demands for post-acute care of the&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular disease can help nurses implement effective strategies at the&#xD;
      early stages to patients to improve the short- and long-term outcomes of the patients. The&#xD;
      follow-up results will help us better understand the impact of a post-acute care system on&#xD;
      patients' outcomes.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION China has entered the high-pressure period of cardiovascular disease. The&#xD;
           incidence of cardiovascular disease is still rising. It has become a great threaten for&#xD;
           the health of Chinese resident and the social economy development. The comprehensiveness&#xD;
           and complexity of the influencing factors of cardiovascular disease determine the&#xD;
           long-term and arduous task of prevention and treatment. It is necessary to coordinate&#xD;
           the resources of all parties and improve the mechanism of comprehensive prevention and&#xD;
           treatment of cardiovascular disease with multi department cooperation. At present, due&#xD;
           to the limited medical resources, high cost of hospitalization and the shortage of&#xD;
           hospital beds, the average length of stay of patients is gradually shortened, resulting&#xD;
           in an increasing number of patients with cardiovascular disease who are discharged&#xD;
           immediately after acute treatment. Although the emergency problems of the disease have&#xD;
           been solved during hospitalization, there is still a period of transition in the process&#xD;
           of rehabilitation before returning to the family and society. Therefore, long-term and&#xD;
           systematic management after discharge is the most important measure to improve the&#xD;
           prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease. Post-acute care (PAC) is the most&#xD;
           important guarantee to provide continuous medical care for patients with cardiovascular&#xD;
           diseases. Readiness for hospital discharge is the key link between emergency care and&#xD;
           post-acute care, which helps to shorten the length of hospital stay, reduce the rate of&#xD;
           readmission, improve the quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases and&#xD;
           reduce medical costs. In recent years, China's post-acute care system has made a series&#xD;
           of achievements, but it is still distributed in the form of dots, and there is no mature&#xD;
           working mode. Therefore, it is urgent to build a characteristic post-acute care system&#xD;
           for cardiovascular diseases based on China's national conditions. However, Understanding&#xD;
           the details of patients' demands is the key and the first step in building the&#xD;
           post-acute care system for cardiovascular diseases. This study will provide an effective&#xD;
           tool for the investigation of the detailed demands for post-acute care in cardiovascular&#xD;
           disease and provide a better understanding of the demands for the patients with&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. THE STUDY 2.1 Aims The aims of this study are 1) to determine the demand of post-acute&#xD;
           care among patients with cardiovascular disease in China; 2) to identify the details of&#xD;
           demands especially which have value for the post-acute care for patients with&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study Design This is a single-center, prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary&#xD;
      teaching hospital in Shanghai, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Setting The study will be conducted in the cardiology department in Zhongshan hospital,&#xD;
      Shanghai, China, which is the largest hospital in Shanghai with 2005 beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiology department focuses on interventional diagnosis and treatment of complex and&#xD;
      difficult cardiovascular diseases with 527 beds and 503 nurses and physicians. Approximately&#xD;
      more than 24000 patients per year are admitted, including angina pectoris, acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, premature ventricular contractions,&#xD;
      atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart&#xD;
      disease, rheumatic heart disease, valvular disease, heart failure, cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      myocarditis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Participants Inclusion Criteria Patients with cardiovascular disease aged above 18. The&#xD;
      patients are aware of the disease condition. The patients can read and understand&#xD;
      independently and participate in this study voluntarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria The patient's condition is critical and life-threatening. People who are&#xD;
      not conscious or are not cooperative by mental disorders. Patients refused to continue to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Sample size Our study will aim to identify demands for the post-acute care of patients&#xD;
      with cardiovascular disease. According to the rule of thumb, the sample size should be 5-10&#xD;
      times the number of items of questionnaire. Considering the 20% loss rate, the sample size is&#xD;
      required to be at least 900 cases, and 1000 cases are preliminarily planned to be included in&#xD;
      our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Data collection Demands for post-acute care Data of the demands for post-acute care will&#xD;
      be collected face to face or telephone, including guidance of rehabilitation exercise,&#xD;
      medication, diet, introduction of available social resources support, such as long-term care&#xD;
      insurance, etc. Demographic characteristic The demographic variables and related information&#xD;
      on the demands of post-acute care will also be collected, including gender, age, marital&#xD;
      status, education level, work status, family per capita monthly income, type of medical&#xD;
      insurance, distance between home and hospital, main diagnosis, duration of illness, pipeline&#xD;
      indwelling, length of hospital stay, hospitalization treatment, medication, the destination&#xD;
      after discharge, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readiness for hospital discharge scale (RHDS) The original scale was developed by Weis et al.&#xD;
      It has 4 dimensions: self-condition, disease knowledge, coping ability after discharge,&#xD;
      social support available, and 23 items. The first question is not included in the total&#xD;
      score. The rest items are scored by 0-10 points. The score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;not knowing at&#xD;
      all&quot; and &quot;completely unable&quot;, and &quot;10&quot; stands for &quot;completely knowing&quot; and &quot;completely&#xD;
      capable&quot;. Patients can choose the appropriate score according to their own situation. The&#xD;
      higher the score, the better the readiness for discharge. This study adopts the Chinese&#xD;
      version of Zhao et al. of West China Hospital of Sichuan University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Data management All the data will be entered and stored in the Research Electronic Data&#xD;
      Capture (REDCap), which will be securely locked, and password protected. It is supported and&#xD;
      maintained by the Evidence-based center of Fudan University. Data management and analysis,&#xD;
      including data audit, import and tracking will be done by the biostatisticians in the center.&#xD;
      Each patient will be given a study identification number; all paper files will be imported to&#xD;
      the database once completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8 Statistical analysis Chi square test was used for categorical data, t-test and ANOVA were&#xD;
      used for measurement data. Through univariate, multivariate analysis, structural equation&#xD;
      model and path analysis, the relationship between readiness for hospital discharge and&#xD;
      demands of patients for post-acute care was analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.9 Ethical considerations This study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Board in August&#xD;
      2020 (SK2020-014). The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Council&#xD;
      for Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice principles. The study will adhere to the ethical&#xD;
      principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive written and verbal information of the study before surgery. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained before inclusion. Patient have the right to withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any time. Data collection will be stopped, and patients' record will be deleted&#xD;
      from the database if a patient withdraws from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.10 Validity, reliability and rigor In this study, we will use one instrument named RHDS.&#xD;
      The validity and reliability will be tested with the baseline data. The cohort study will&#xD;
      follow the STROBE statement.&#xD;
