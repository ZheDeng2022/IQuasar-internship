      This study is an observational, multicenter, prospective, single arm study. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety of Breztri® Aerosphere® in Chinese patients with COPD in&#xD;
      real world clinical practice. The study will enrol approximately 3,050 subjects from about 42&#xD;
      sites around China and followed up for 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an observational, multicenter, prospective, single arm study. 3,050 subjects&#xD;
      who have been prescribed and have planned to take at least one inhalation of BGF MDI will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study. BGF MDI treatment will be studied through non-interventional&#xD;
      approach. It will be carried out under routine clinical practice and the start or end of BGF&#xD;
      MDI and other concomitant treatment will be determined by subjects' treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be consecutively enrolled in this study at the time they routinely&#xD;
      visit their physician and consent to participate in the study. After enrolled successfully,&#xD;
      baseline variables will be collected at V1. Subjects will be followed up every 4 weeks after&#xD;
      baseline for a total duration of 12 weeks or until study discontinuation, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first. V1 and V2 will be followed up by on-site visit and V3 and V4 will be followed up by&#xD;
      telephone call visit. For subjects who remain on study drug throughout the study (i.e.,&#xD;
      complete 4 Visits), a follow up telephone call will be performed at 14 days after the last&#xD;
      visit to collect safety information. For subjects who has an Early Discontinuation, 14 days&#xD;
      follow up is needed for AE collecting after the discontinuation. For subjects who had been&#xD;
      hospitalized during the first 4 weeks of follow-up due to one or more acute exacerbations of&#xD;
      COPD, a follow up telephone call will be performed at 28 days after the last visit to collect&#xD;
      safety information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited from qualified hospitals. Safety and effectiveness data will&#xD;
      be collected following enrollment in the study. Medical records, PROs (COPD Assessment Test&#xD;
      [CAT], St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ], Aerosphere Delivery Technology Metered&#xD;
      Dose Inhaler Preference Questionnaire [AMPQ], Patient Global Impression of Change [PGIC])&#xD;
      will be the data source in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint will be the incidence of AEs and SAEs in purpose of monitoring the safety&#xD;
      profile of BGF MDI.&#xD;
