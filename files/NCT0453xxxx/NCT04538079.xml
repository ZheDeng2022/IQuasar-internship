      Study type: Prospective Observational trial Study design: Longitudinal Population: Preterm&#xD;
      newborns &lt;32 weeks gestational age Hypothesis: The inclusion of non-invasive physiological&#xD;
      measures of cardiac output, peripheral perfusion and brain oxygenation (NIRS) for preterm&#xD;
      neonates is feasible and reveals additional information on the hemodynamic status compared to&#xD;
      blood pressure alone. These measurements can improve the ability to rapidly identify those&#xD;
      infants who might benefit from intervention and are correlated with short term clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding neonatal hemodynamics is key to neonatal care. Despite decades of research,&#xD;
      uncertainty continues as to how best assess impaired hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension defined by a low Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MABP) remains a common issue in&#xD;
      preterm infants, affecting up to 30% of extremely preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common to focus only on MABP thus neglecting the complex and dynamic (patho)physiology&#xD;
      that may be present in newborn infants. Providing sufficient cellular oxygenation is the&#xD;
      primary task of the circulatory system and different factors may compromise it. In this&#xD;
      prospective observational study the investigators will examine various forms of objective&#xD;
      non-invasive continuous hemodynamic monitoring methods in very preterm infants&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For feasibility of non-invasive CO measurement (first 20 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For reproducibility and correlation of this measurement and ECHOcardiography (first 40&#xD;
           echocardiographic examinations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For prediction of therapy response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For correlation with clinical definitions of hypotension/hypoperfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. For prediction of later clinical problems/complications of prematurity and impaired&#xD;
           hemodynamic status.&#xD;
