  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scleral lenses have emerged as an efficacious treatment option for various types of&#xD;
      intractable ocular surface diseases with many advantageous results. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      was to report the efficacy and safety of the LK scleral lenses and determine their&#xD;
      suitability in Asian patients with intractable ocular surface diseases. Subjects with&#xD;
      intractable ocular surface diseases are enrolled to fit LK scleral lenses for 12 weeks for a&#xD;
      prospective study. Evaluations are performed at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. General patient&#xD;
      demographics and medical history, visual acuities, thorough ophthalmic evaluation, ocular&#xD;
      surface disease index and National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual Function Questionnaire are&#xD;
      collected for each patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are several commercially manufactured scleral lenses of different designs and&#xD;
      sizes, all of which have been proven to be clinically beneficial in a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      diseases. Especially in the management of intractable ocular surface diseases, scleral lenses&#xD;
      with large diameters are commonly used so that the lens entirely rests on the sclera with&#xD;
      sufficient tear reservoir. PROSE devices (Boston Foundation for Sight, Needham, MA), one of&#xD;
      the first and representative scleral lenses shown to have long-term clinical benefits for&#xD;
      complex corneal diseases, have large diameters of 17.5 to 23.0 mm. However, in Republic of&#xD;
      Korea, only scleral lenses with small diameters are currently available. SoClearⓇ and OnefitⓇ&#xD;
      scleral lenses, two of the most commonly used scleral lenses in Republic of Korea, possess&#xD;
      diameters ranging from 14.1 to 15.5 mm and 13.3 to 15.0 mm, respectively, and are not&#xD;
      actually fully scleral but more of a corneoscleral type lenses. Furthermore, Asians have&#xD;
      smaller palpebral fissures with tighter eyelids than the Western population, which may&#xD;
      restrict patients' tolerability of wearing a large scleral lens and limit its clinical&#xD;
      benefits. Therefore, a more suitable scleral lens for Asians with larger diameter is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, this study investigates the efficacy and safety of the LK scleral lens (Lucid&#xD;
      Korea LTD, Seoul, Republic of Korea), which has been newly manufactured to have larger&#xD;
      diameters than currently available commercial lenses, and determines their suitability in&#xD;
      Asian patients with intractable ocular surface diseases.&#xD;
