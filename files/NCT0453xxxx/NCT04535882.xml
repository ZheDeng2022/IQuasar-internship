  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We attempt to examine the association between serum leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG)&#xD;
      levels and endoscopic activity of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) in patients&#xD;
      to determine whether LRG was a surrogate marker for mucosal healing.&#xD;

      Serum samples were collected from patients, and scores for clinical and endoscopic activity&#xD;
      of disease were obtained by reviewing the clinical records of patients. Serum sampling and&#xD;
      colonoscopy were performed within 30 days.Disease Activity. The disease activity of UC and CD&#xD;
      patients was evaluated by the Mayo endoscopy score and Crohn disease activity index (CDAI),&#xD;
      respectively. The Mayo endoscopy score was evaluated. UC patients whose Mayo endoscopy score&#xD;
      was 2 or 3 were divided into the active UC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD patients whose CDAI &gt;150 were divided into the active CD group.&#xD;
