    <textblock>
      The present study aims to predict energy expenditure models for some resistance training&#xD;
      exercises like: dumbbell bent row over, dumbbell deadlift, dumbbell lunge, dumbbell shoulder&#xD;
      press, and dumbbell squat using oxygen consumption or Metabolic Equivalents (METs) as a&#xD;
      dependent variable while blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, blood&#xD;
      lactate, rate of perceived exertion, body mass index, body weight, body height, body fat&#xD;
      composition, muscle strength, and surface electromyography of selected muscles as independent&#xD;
      variables. The previous literature measures energy expenditure for various lower and upper&#xD;
      body resistance training exercises but it devoid for dumbbell bent row over, dumbbell&#xD;
      deadlift, dumbbell lunge, dumbbell shoulder press, and dumbbell squat energy expenditure&#xD;
      models between untrained and trained participants. The subject will come for 5-8 times&#xD;
      clinical trial for total 10-20 days. After the completion of this study, the participant will&#xD;
      know about their energy expenditure during included strength training exercises.&#xD;

      know about their energy expenditure during included strength training exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include total 30 participants; 15 normal healthy young individuals and 15&#xD;
      athletes with regular resistance exercise training experience. The experiments will be&#xD;
      divided into 2 stages. The first stage experiment will be conducted in 10 young individuals&#xD;
      into two groups. The group one (untrained) will include 5 normal healthy individuals without&#xD;
      resistance exercise training experience and group two (trained) will include 5 individuals&#xD;
      with regular resistance training experience of two months. The second stage will proceed more&#xD;
      20 young participants (10 participants in each group) to determine the resistance exercise&#xD;
      energy expenditure.&#xD;

    <description>The RPE will be recorded within 5 minutes of exercise 4 (Dumbbell Shoulder Press). Each exercise will consist of three sets of 30-40 seconds. And each set will be of 10 repetition (3-4 second per repetition). Each subject will receive 3-6 training sessions for up to 3-4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Rate of perceived exertion (RPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>RPE score for exercise 5 will be used. Day 1 to up to 3-4 weeks (for exercise 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The RPE will be recorded within 5 minutes of exercise 5 (Dumbbell Squat). Each exercise will consist of three sets of 30-40 seconds. And each set will be of 10 repetition (3-4 second per repetition). Each subject will receive 3-6 training sessions for up to 3-4 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical fitness status</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline before start of exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity readiness questionnaire will be used. This questionnaire assesses baseline fitness level of participants. It has two options either ''yes'' or ''no'' in explaining the basic seven fitness related questions. The more the questions have ''yes'' answers meaning participant health status is not good and they are not eligible for this study. The other category of questions evaluate existence of any medical condition with ''yes'' or ''no'' options which can exclude participant from this study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline before start of exercise and after all three or six training sessions for up to 3-4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>body composition measuring scale will be used. The body composition will be measured two times during the study before the start of training and after three or six training sessions for up to 3-4 weeks. The weight will be measured in kilogram (kg) and height in meters (m) to report BMI in kg/m^2. The change in body composition will be compared before and after all training sessions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body fat percentage</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline before start of exercise and after all three or six training sessions for up to 3-4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Body fat will be measured with measuring scale. The body fat will be measured two times during the study before the start of training and after three or six training sessions for up to 3-4 weeks. The change in body fat percentage will be compared before and after all training sessions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline before start of exercise and after all three or six training sessions for up to 3-4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Hand held dynamometer will be used for the same muscles pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, hamstrings, quadriceps, erector spinae, or deltoid of both sides. The strength will be measured two times during the study before the start of training and after three or six training sessions for up to 3-4 weeks. The change in muscle strength will be compared before and after all training sessions.</description>
