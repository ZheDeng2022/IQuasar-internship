  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) in its seasonal and perennial form is a common allergic condition. The&#xD;
      majority of allergic rhinitis sufferers report nasal (congestion, sneezing, itching and&#xD;
      rhinorrhea) and ocular (redness, watery eyes, itching and burning) symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polymer Carragelose® is a unique broadly active anti-viral compound for treating&#xD;
      respiratory diseases. Carragelose® is a sulfated polymer from red seaweed also widely used in&#xD;
      the food industry and has GRAS status (FDA). The compound has a broad spectrum of anti-viral&#xD;
      properties. Sprayed into the nose Carragelose® creates a protective layer in the nasal cavity&#xD;
      which could prevent allergic rhinitis symptoms as well. This anti-allergic clinical&#xD;
      performance compared to untreated subjects and to subjects treated with Vis Alpin® Alpensalz&#xD;
      nasal spray should be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinical data in humans have been generated with Callergin so far. Callergin nasal spray&#xD;
      is a certified Class I medical device. The use of the nasal spray is associated with a very&#xD;
      low risk for patients. Callergin is used to moisturize nasal mucosa and to support the&#xD;
      treatment of rhinitis of any kind. Allergic subjects could benefit from the moisturizing&#xD;
      protective layer on the nasal mucosa, which could prevent allergen attachment to the mucosa&#xD;
      surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, controlled, double-blinded randomized three-way cross-over single&#xD;
      site study in adult subjects (18 to 65 years) who demonstrate a grass pollen specific&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity and have a history of grass pollen induced allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without controlled asthma. In the cross-over setting two&#xD;
      treatments, namely Callergin and Vis Alpin® Alpensalz will be evaluated compared to untreated&#xD;
      subjects. The subjects will be treated with one puff (140 microliter) into each nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate an anti-allergic clinical performance of&#xD;
      Callergin nasal spray compared to untreated subjects in grass pollen induced&#xD;
      rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis. The evaluation will be based on the assessment of rhinitis&#xD;
      symptoms during grass pollen challenge performed in the Vienna Challenge Chamber&#xD;
      (environmental exposure chamber).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective of the trial is to demonstrate an anti-allergic clinical performance of&#xD;
      Callergin nasal spray compared to subjects treated with Vis Alpin® Alpensalz nasal spray.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, controlled, double-blinded randomized three-way cross-over single site&#xD;
      study in adult subjects (18 to 65 years) who demonstrate a grass pollen specific&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity and have a history of grass pollen induced allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis with or without controlled asthma. In the cross-over setting two&#xD;
      treatments, namely Callergin and Vis Alpin® Alpensalz will be evaluated compared to untreated&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one week prior to first treatment block, subjects will be screened for appropriate&#xD;
      allergic response. A total nasal symptom score (TNSS) of at least 6 points out of 12 within&#xD;
      the first two hours in the grass pollen challenge chamber is required to be included into the&#xD;
      study. If a screening for appropriate allergic response was done during the last 12 months,&#xD;
      results from this allergy challenge can be used to fulfil the respective inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the screening provocation the medical and allergic history, safety lab as well&#xD;
      as retrieving inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed via anamnesis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      all safety assessments will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Visit 1 and visit 2 could be done on the same day!&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Day1 of first treatment period Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      the two treatment arms (fully blinded) and to the untreated control group in the order of&#xD;
      appearance and their screening numbers assigned at visit 1. Subjects will enter the study&#xD;
      site about one hour ahead of the start of allergen provocation. After positive completion of&#xD;
      all study relevant assessments, subjects will be randomized and handed out their specific&#xD;
      nasal spray. Ten to five minutes ahead of entering the grass pollen challenge chamber the&#xD;
      treatment (nasal spray) application in the two treatment groups will take place under staff&#xD;
      supervision. Afterwards the chamber session starts for subjective and objective assessments&#xD;
      for a period of 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjective nasal symptom score will be recorded every fifteen minutes during a 3-hour&#xD;
      allergen exposure challenge. Every hour rhinomanometry will be performed to objectively&#xD;
      evaluate blockage of the nose. An additional rhinomanometry will be performed 30 minutes&#xD;
      after entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Day1 of second treatment period Subjects will enter the study site about one hour&#xD;
      ahead of the start of allergen provocation. According to randomization number, subjects in&#xD;
      the two treatment groups will receive the respective nasal spray. In the following Visit 4&#xD;
      will be done in the same way as Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: Day1 of third treatment period Subjects will enter the study site about one hour&#xD;
      ahead of the start of allergen provocation. According to randomization number, subjects in&#xD;
      the two treatment groups will receive the respective nasal spray. In the following Visit 5&#xD;
      will be done in the same way as Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the respective study treatments, a wash-out period of at least 7 days must be adhered&#xD;
      to allowing complete symptom relief from previous challenge. After the wash-out period,&#xD;
      subjects change to the next treatment block in the sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire trial, subjects will be asked to monitor for adverse events (AEs), and they&#xD;
      will record the use of concomitant medications on the provided form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after the final provocation session, subjects will complete the trial after their&#xD;
      follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design is appropriate for the indication studied. Validated methods of data&#xD;
      collection, analysis, and evaluation will be used for the trial.&#xD;
