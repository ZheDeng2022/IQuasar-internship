  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify the mechanisms by which physical exercise can counter&#xD;
      inflammation and improve immune function in older persons. These mechanisms will be&#xD;
      investigated to develop exercise-based/derived strategies to improve recovery of older&#xD;
      patients suffering from immunosenescence and/or immune suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled trial, the effects of resistance exercise (RE) on inflammation&#xD;
      and chronic low-grade inflammation (CLIP) will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that exercise-induced changes in immunosenescence will be reflected by changes in&#xD;
      the various domains of interest: 1) the expression of immunosenescence-related genes in PMBC,&#xD;
      in circulating markers of inflammation and in PMBC behaviour following LPS stimulation, 2)&#xD;
      the proportion of circulating PMBC showing surface and/or intracellular markers for cell&#xD;
      senescence, and 3) markers reflecting alterations at the level of the extracellular matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this project will allow us to provide new insights in the complex interaction&#xD;
      between physical exercise and immunosenescence as well as to present evidence-based&#xD;
      guidelines for exercise in elderly persons to counter CLIP&#xD;
