  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthotics and Prosthetics are important areas where physiotherapists order a variety of&#xD;
      assistive aids to restore, compensate, or prevent physical ailments and disorders, such as&#xD;
      here, Knee Osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be helpful not only in establishing the role of footwear modification as an&#xD;
      adjunct treatment protocol for knee osteoarthritis but also elicit a multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      approach which is a much-needed area, especially in the emergency rehabilitation area.&#xD;

      2.1 MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM APPROACH As defined by World Health Organization, Curriculum&#xD;
      Contents and International Practice Patterns, physical therapy is an autonomous profession&#xD;
      where clinical make clinical decisions based on clinical reasoning, differentially diagnose,&#xD;
      determine prognosis, and make plan of care including discharge planning and outcome&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthotics and Prosthetics are important areas where physiotherapist order variety of&#xD;
      assistive aids to restore, compensate or prevent physical ailments and disorders, such as&#xD;
      here, Knee Osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be helpful not only establishing role of foot wear modification as adjunct&#xD;
      treatment protocol for knee osteoarthritis but also elicit a multidisciplinary team approach&#xD;
      which is a much needed area especially in emergency rehabilitation area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 LITERATURE GAP Although, there is work on performance of modified foot wears, which have&#xD;
      been studied mostly alone or as adjunct with pharmacology. There is less literature on&#xD;
      conservative treatment of osteoarthritis with foot wear modification coupled with&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment. This study will create a unique impact paying ways for type of&#xD;
      preferable footwear that should be used, based on results, and combining treatment with&#xD;
      physiotherapy care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 UNSETTLED DEBATE OVER TYPE OF FOOTWEAR The debate is still underway, worldwide, regarding&#xD;
      which shoe type or foot wear should be preferred over other. The study results will come up&#xD;
      with a contribution towards determining right foot wear for osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 COST EFFECTIVENESS The knee osteoarthritis is a problem that degenerative in nature and&#xD;
      is triggered due to posture and abnormal force distribution. Right shoes are proven to alter&#xD;
      walk posture, step length and degree of ease in walk. This simple remedy can be integral for&#xD;
      reduction in care cost by minimizing disability and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 NOVEL SHOE MAKING APPROACH Although, advising foot wears and its modification is&#xD;
      technical phenomenon, yet, this study can impact formulation of a shoe pattern that can help&#xD;
      the arthritis patients. This can open new shoe making approach on public shoe outlets, from&#xD;
      where old age individuals can directly buy the shoes that be the potential healer and disease&#xD;
      modifier.&#xD;

    <description>the lateral heel wedged insole (19) comprised non-custom, high density based on insoles of ethyl-vinyl acetate distributed bilaterally, preferably, covered in leather, were used in the study. The insole were equipped with a lateral wedge of 50 to 60.&#xD;
In the case of unilateral knee osteoarthritis, the non-wedge insole were used to compensate for possible leg length discrepancy in the contra-lateral leg. Shoes used was based on gymnast type to keep wedge insole in place. This further finalized individual to individual with unanimous decisions of Cordwainers, orthotics, and principal researcher, physiotherapist.</description>

    <description>The conventional physical therapy will be consisted of an array of protocols being deployed in parallel. This will consist of&#xD;
Patient education regarding deforming forces, strategies of prevention and home exercise program&#xD;
Decreasing stiffness by controlled active range of motion and mobilization techniques involving join play.&#xD;
Mechanical stresses will be controlled in form of support provided by foot wear modification&#xD;
Range of motion will be increased muscle stretches and manual mobilization techniques&#xD;
Muscle performance and neuromuscular control will be addressed by gentle exercises of low intensity and repetitive exercises.&#xD;
Balance improvement by employing balance training activities as part of treatment&#xD;
Physical conditioning low impact or non-impact aerobics This conventional exercise will be given as baseline treatment to both of groups.</description>
