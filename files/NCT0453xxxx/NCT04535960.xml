  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide essential mechanistic insights into natriuretic and hemodynamic&#xD;
      effects of SGLT2i and GLP-1RA agents in T2D patients. Ultimately, by obtaining physiological&#xD;
      data in T2D patients without HF, our aims are to gain insight into how the use of this&#xD;
      combined therapy may be used in T2D with HF in future work.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an epidemic that afflicts more than 350 million people world-wide.&#xD;
      Despite the use of existing medical therapies, T2D continues to cause significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, leading to large societal and financial costs to Canadians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newer agents called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been developed&#xD;
      to improve glycemic control and lower hemoglobin A1c by increasing glycosuria. SGLT2i also&#xD;
      reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in T2D - possibly through natriuresis. Importantly, a&#xD;
      landmark trial &quot;EMPA-REG OUTCOME&quot; demonstrated that the SGLT2i empagliflozin is the first&#xD;
      anti- hyperglycemic agent to reduce mortality and heart failure (HF) risk, and also to&#xD;
      decrease the risk of progressive diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), is a subcutaneous drug,&#xD;
      used for treating T2D patients. Recently, this drug was also able to reduce cardiovascular&#xD;
      endpoints in the LEADER trial. Furthermore, liraglutide attenuated the risk of progressive&#xD;
      albuminuria as well. GLP-1RAs induce natriuretic effects, but have not been shown to reduce&#xD;
      HF risk. Their positive cardiovascular effects are probably due to reduction in&#xD;
      atherosclerotic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2D patients are at high risk for development of both HF and atherosclerotic diseases. Given&#xD;
      that SGLT2i and GLP-1RA seem to reduce cardiovascular outcomes via different approaches,&#xD;
      combining these two agents in the treatment of T2D is an appealing new strategy. In this&#xD;
      project, we aim to combine GLP-1RA and SGLT2i therapies in T2D patients without HF and&#xD;
      compare renal and cardiovascular physiological measures in these patients, such as renal&#xD;
      function, neurohormonal activation, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance. This could give a better understanding on the action of the combination therapy&#xD;
      in T2D, support future mechanist trials with patients with HF, and give support to the&#xD;
      development of large clinical trials on this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Open-label, exploratory, randomized (with randomization concealment), pilot&#xD;
      mechanistic trial, with two groups and 2 sequential treatments within each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Male and female subjects with T2D, 18 years old or older, with eGFR â‰¥30&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73m2, as described in the full protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to initial therapy with empagliflozin 25mg PO daily&#xD;
      or liraglutide 1.8 mg SC daily, for 6 weeks. After that, patients in the empagliflozin group&#xD;
      will also receive liraglutide 1.8mg SC daily for additional 6 weeks and patients in the&#xD;
      liraglutide group will also receive empagliflozin 25mg PO daily for 6 weeks (combination&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Comparison of proximal tubular natriuresis (measured by FENa+, fractional&#xD;
      excretion of sodium) after 6 weeks of SGLT2i monotherapy vs FENa+ after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      combination therapy (SGLT2i + GLP-1RA) AND comparison of FENa+ after 6 weeks of GLP1-RA&#xD;
      monotherapy vs FENa+ after 6 weeks of combination therapy (GLP-1RA + SGLT2i).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients visit the outpatient clinic on a more regular basis than standard&#xD;
      patient care - i.e. at study inclusion and at each study visit for clinical assessment. Blood&#xD;
      work for physiological assessments, renal function tests and cardiovascular assessments will&#xD;
      be obtained as described in the protocol. 24hr urine will be collected one day prior to the&#xD;
      hospital visit. No other invasive measurements will be executed. Patients receive restitution&#xD;
      of all travel costs and also a financial aid for 3 visits. Patients receive no priority in&#xD;
      treatment of other diseases in the clinic during this study. There are no other direct&#xD;
      benefits for the patients to be included and participation is on a voluntary basis.&#xD;
