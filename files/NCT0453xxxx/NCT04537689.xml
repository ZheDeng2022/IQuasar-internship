  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis (PsO) is a systemic immune disease that affect 2-4% of the population worldwide.&#xD;
      PsO causes tremendous burden in terms of quality of life, psychological impact, disability&#xD;
      and work productivity of affected individuals. PsO is associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidities and mortality in the long term. Up to 30% of PsO patients develop&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis (PsA) over time causing joint deformities and further disabilities.&#xD;
      Majority of patients with PsA developed PsO first, and arthritis develop 5-10 years&#xD;
      afterwards. PsA and PsO are increasingly recognized as two entities under the umbrella of&#xD;
      psoriatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in biological treatments have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with PsO.&#xD;
      Remarkable efficacies have been demonstrated for patients with moderate to severe PsO in&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, the high cost of biological treatment is one of&#xD;
      the major barriers to prescription of biological treatment and many patients may have limited&#xD;
      access to these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best strategy of treatment for PsO that takes into account efficacy and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness is unknown. For instance, whether some PsO patients can stop biological&#xD;
      treatment and be retreated with non-biologic medications upon relapse, which may enhance cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment. Preliminary studies have shown that some PsO patients were able&#xD;
      to maintain good control of disease without medications after biologics withdrawal. The&#xD;
      patho-immunological mechanisms behind long term remission after drug withdrawal is poorly&#xD;
      understood. Better understanding on patho-immunological mechanisms on maintenance of&#xD;
      remission and relapses will advance the development of biomarkers that eventually guide&#xD;
      development of best treatment strategies for PsO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ixekizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4 kappa) monoclonal antibody targeting&#xD;
      interleukin (IL)-17A. It is highly efficacious in the treatment of plague PsO with and&#xD;
      favorable safety profile as shown in randomized controlled trials, and is an approved&#xD;
      treatment for moderate-to-severe PsO by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Health&#xD;
      Sciences Authority. With the proven efficacies, ixekizumab could be a choice of first-line&#xD;
      treatment for patients with moderate to severe PsO. The 2013 American Academy of Dermatology&#xD;
      position statement have stated that the old paradigm of stepwise-therapy starting first with&#xD;
      phototherapy and oral systemic therapies before biologic treatment is not required for&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe PsO. In the recent 2017 update of the European S3 guidelines&#xD;
      also recommend the use of IL-17 inhibitors as either a first- or second-line agent. In a RCT&#xD;
      that evaluated relapses after withdrawal of ixekizumab among patients who achieved a&#xD;
      clearance of PsO, loss of PsO clearance were seen after a median of 20 weeks. Response can be&#xD;
      successfully recaptured in over 80% of patients with retreatment with ixekizumab, suggesting&#xD;
      that the treatment regimen could be interrupted in some patients. However, real-life data on&#xD;
      biologic treatment or withdrawal for moderate to severe PsO is scatty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the investigators hypothesize that a proportion of patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      PsO may sustain reasonable good outcomes when a short course of ixekizumab is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the investigators hypothesize that the investigators can identify the perturbations&#xD;
      in the architecture of the immunome which are pathogenic, and to discriminate such&#xD;
      perturbations based on treatment and clinical responses, thus distilling theragnostic&#xD;
      signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objectives of the study are as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: To describe the clinical course, sustained good outcomes, relapse rate, time&#xD;
      to relapse and quality of life in PsO patients who stopped a 6-month short course treatment&#xD;
      of ixekizumab, till the end of 2-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2: To identify the genomic and immunomic signatures in skin biopsies and blood&#xD;
      in PsO patients who has good outcomes (PASI 75) at 6 months, comparing treatment vs pragmatic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 3: To identify the genomic and immunomic signatures in skin biopsies and blood&#xD;
      in PsO patients who sustained good outcomes at 1 year after stopping ixekizumab, compared to&#xD;
      those relapsed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>To evaluate the real-life effectiveness of ixekizumab as first-line systemic treatment in participants with moderate to severe PsO, the investigators would recruit a pragmatic control arm.&#xD;
⦁ Intervention arm: Eligible participants will be offered ixekizumab as first-line systemic treatment for PsO. Standard dose of subcutaneous ixekizumab for moderate to severe PsO will be given at 160 mg at week 0, followed by ixekizumab 80mg at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, then 4 weekly thereafter, for a total duration of 6 months.&#xD;
Ixekizumab will be withdrawn after 6 months. For some participants, there may be relapse of PsO. Relapses will be managed as per standard care.&#xD;
⦁ Pragmatic control arm&#xD;
Eligible participants will be recruited to pragmatic control arm in these circumstances:&#xD;
Patient disagree to ixekizumab for personal reasons.&#xD;
The quota for ixekizumab is exhausted.&#xD;
The management of PsO in this pragmatic control arm will be the same as that in the standard care.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In all participants (both ixekizumab treated and standard care) the investigators will describe the following:&#xD;
Every 3-6 monthly till end of 30 months, investigators will evaluate the change scores of Quality of Life (EQ5D-5L). It consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions. Each dimension is measured on a scale of 1-5, with '1' indicating no problem, '2' indicating slight problems, '3' indicating moderate problems, '4' indicating severe problems, and '5' indicating unable to/extreme problems. The highest and the lowest scores for both EQ-5D-5L indices were 1.00 (best imaginable health) and -0.769 respectively; where negative values are valued as worse than dead.&#xD;
EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale from 0-100 with '0' indicating worst health one can imagine and '100' indicating best health one can imagine.</description>

DLQI is measured on a scale of 0-3 or not relevant, with '0' indicating not relevant or not at all, '1' indicating a little, '2' indicating a lot, '3' indicating very much.
