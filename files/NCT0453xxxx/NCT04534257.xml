  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extensive arterial occlusion significantly reduces arterial perfusion, and may eventually&#xD;
      lead to Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI). The pathology gives rise to symptoms such as ischemic&#xD;
      pain, slow healing wounds at lower extremity and gangrene. It places patients with&#xD;
      multi-segment occlusion at high risks of amputations and mortality. The treatment methods for&#xD;
      such long occlusive lesions are limited. Traditionally, the standard of care would be&#xD;
      surgical revascularization. This is because lesion length have been identified in several&#xD;
      studies as an independent risk factor for the development of restenosis after angioplasty&#xD;
      and/or stenting. However, thanks to recent advances in endovascular techniques, such as the&#xD;
      utilization of subintimal technique for crossing long segment occlusions, it is now possible&#xD;
      to employ endovascular techniques for suitable patients.The re-establishment of an in-line&#xD;
      flow, even if only temporary, can allow tissue healing, which is vital in achieving limb&#xD;
      salvage. In addition, the use of Drug Coated Balloons (DCB) can potentially reduce restenosis&#xD;
      rate, as Sirolimus have an anti-proliferative effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are few studies that have evaluated the performance of DCB in lesions that are&#xD;
      longer than 10cm. The investigators hope to evaluate the performance of the Selution DCB when&#xD;
      used in treatment of such lesions&#xD;
