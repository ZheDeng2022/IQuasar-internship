  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-centre, interventional randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be individually randomised to receive either COMPASS online CBT + &quot;usual&#xD;
      care&quot; (standard LTC charity support), or usual care only. Randomisation will be stratified by&#xD;
      recruiting charity site to ensure a balance of participants with different LTCs across the&#xD;
      intervention and control arm. Randomisation will occur using a 1:1 allocation ratio managed&#xD;
      by RECAP software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to COMPASS will receive access to the online program. It consists of&#xD;
      11 online modules which target challenges associated with living with LTC(s) and includes,&#xD;
      amongst other things, psycho-education, patient examples, interactive tasks and goal setting.&#xD;
      Participants are linked to a therapist; 'guide', who will provide 6 x 30 minute support&#xD;
      sessions delivered fortnightly in the format preferred by the client (phone and/or in-site&#xD;
      message).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the usual care control arm will receive the usual care that is&#xD;
      available to them via their charity. All charities include a helpline which can be accessed&#xD;
      via telephone or email. The helplines at all charities offer one-off emotional and/or&#xD;
      informational support provided by people trained in active listening and/or counselling&#xD;
      skills. Additional support avenues that can be accessed may include online support groups,&#xD;
      local community support groups and informational resources.&#xD;
