  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial investigates how well 7T MRI scan works in imaging central nervous system tumors.&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures, such as 7T MRI, may help find and diagnose central nervous system&#xD;
      tumors and help measure a patient's response to earlier treatment. The goal of this trial is&#xD;
      to learn if a new MRI system can provide better quality images than a standard MRI.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for several imaging modalities in brain&#xD;
      malignancy as compared with normal brain parenchyma separately by type of malignancy and&#xD;
      treatment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the conspicuity of each imaging modality to differentiate radiation necrosis&#xD;
      from progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess patient experience in the 7 Tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system&#xD;
      compared to their most recent MRI examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the typical significance values seen for areas of maximal brain activity&#xD;
      associated with each functional MRI (fMRI) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the geometric distortion of a radiation planning sequence on a ultra-high&#xD;
      field (UHF) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 7T MRI over 60 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>For each imaging modality, will calculate the CNR separately in the largest lesion/metastasis per patient as well as in all study lesions. The CNR for each imaging method will be determined and reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. If enough follow-up images are obtained, will compare the CNR in lesions that respond to treatment to those that do not by using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Will compare the CNR between baseline and follow-up within patient by using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Also, for those lesions that initially respond, some will subsequently grow in size after the initial response. Of these, some will be considered radiation necrosis and some progressive disease. The CNR will be compared between lesions with necrosis and those that are progressive disease using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</description>

    <description>The T1 sequence by MRI will be considered the gold standard, and will compare the conspicuity of each of the other methods to that of T1 sequencing by using McNemar's test. This analysis will first be performed in the largest lesion per patient, and then analyses will be repeated using all lesions.</description>
