      1. To acknowledge the prevalence of renal insufficiency and kidney-related diseases in&#xD;
      patients with chronic hepatitis B in China through epidemiological surveys in outpatient&#xD;
      clinics of about 150 hospitals across the country; 2. To analyze the related factors of renal&#xD;
      insufficiency and kidney-related diseases in domestic patients with chronic hepatitis B from&#xD;
      the aspects of demographic characteristics, family history, antiviral treatment, nephrotoxic&#xD;
      drug use history, etc.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At present, the mainstream antiviral treatment of CHB is still nucleotide analogues. The&#xD;
      increase in the proportion of comorbidities in patients with chronic hepatitis B also&#xD;
      increases the risk of nucleotide analogue contraindications. The antiviral treatment of CHB&#xD;
      patients needs to fully assess the risk of adverse reactions . Taking into account the&#xD;
      current impact of nucleotide analogs on renal function, the AASLD 2018 Chronic Hepatitis B&#xD;
      Guidelines recommends that the dosage of nucleotide analogs should be adjusted according to&#xD;
      renal function and creatinine clearance. A Hong Kong cohort study of patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B showed that the 5-year chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression rate of patients&#xD;
      receiving entecavir and tenofovir and not receiving treatment reached 40%. A similar study in&#xD;
      the United States also showed that nucleotide analogs reduce the glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR). Studies on the indicators of early kidney&#xD;
      injury found that the β2 microglobulin and retinol binding protein indicators changed&#xD;
      significantly during the course of patients receiving adefovir dipivoxil, and the baseline β2&#xD;
      microglobulin and retinol binding protein indicators Affect the reduction of eGFR.&#xD;
      Retrospective analysis using recent domestic urban medical insurance data also observed that&#xD;
      the proportion of chronic kidney disease diagnoses in domestic CHB patients has shown a&#xD;
      significant upward trend, which also suggests the necessity of assessing renal function in&#xD;
      domestic CHB patients before using nucleotide analogs. Due to the lack of real-world renal&#xD;
      function screening studies for CHB patients in China, there is a risk of severe&#xD;
      underestimation of the proportion of CHB patients with renal insufficiency estimated based on&#xD;
      medical insurance data. In the real world, the proportion of domestic CHB patients with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency has not been fully clarified. Domestic clinical The treatment guidelines also&#xD;
      did not specifically emphasize the necessity of renal function assessment before receiving&#xD;
      nucleotide analog treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the prevalence of renal insufficiency&#xD;
      among people receiving hepatitis B antiviral treatment through a national epidemiological&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey, using hospital outpatient clinics as the research site, and to&#xD;
      analyze related factors to improve clinicians Awareness of renal insufficiency in patients&#xD;
      with CHB and better guidance on the safe use of nucleotide analogs in patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B.&#xD;

    <description>The amount of ultrafiltrate produced by the kidneys on both sides per unit time (per minute), called glomerular filtration rate, is an important indicator of renal function. Clinically, the glomerular filtration rate estimated in combination with the patient's gender, age, weight, and creatinine value is called the estimated glomerular filtration rate.</description>

        In order to ensure the representativeness of the research subjects, this study will be&#xD;
        carried out in the liver disease clinics of about 150 participating hospitals across the&#xD;
        country. The source of the hospitals will take into account the region, city size and&#xD;
        compliance. After each hospital project is launched, the epidemiological investigation will&#xD;
        be completed within 1-3 months according to the sample size allocated by each hospital.&#xD;
