  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will determine the feasibility of a time restricted feeding&#xD;
      intervention,a fasting regimen that restricts eating to a feeding window (8 hrs/day) for 1&#xD;
      year in adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) who are overweight&#xD;
      or obese. The study will provide valuable information on the intervention in terms of safety,&#xD;
      adherence, acceptability, and tolerability. Last, this pilot trial will provide initial&#xD;
      insight into biological changes including abdominal adiposity, changes in kidney growth and&#xD;
      function, and markers of biological pathways related to the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mounting evidence suggests that a metabolic defect exists in autosomal dominant polycystic&#xD;
      kidney disease (ADPKD), which likely contributes to cystic epithelial proliferation and&#xD;
      subsequent cyst growth. There are notable overlapping features and pathways among metabolism,&#xD;
      obesity, and/or ADPKD. The investigators recently reported that in the Halt Progression of&#xD;
      Polycystic Kidney Disease (HALT-PKD) Study A that overweight and obesity are strong&#xD;
      independent predictors of more rapid kidney growth. Moving beyond body mass index, the&#xD;
      investigators have novel preliminary data using magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from a small&#xD;
      number of participants from HALT-PKD Study A that abdominal adiposity is an independent&#xD;
      predictor of kidney growth and kidney function decline. Adipocytes do not simply act as a fat&#xD;
      reservoir but are active endocrine organs that promote release of pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      and produce adipokines. Numerous signaling pathways promoted by adipocytes are also&#xD;
      implicated in cystogenesis. Periods of fasting may counter adiposity-mediated signaling&#xD;
      pathways and slow ADPKD progression. Mild-to-moderate food restriction profoundly slows cyst&#xD;
      growth and maintains renal function in rodent models of ADPKD, which are characterized by&#xD;
      metabolic reprogramming favoring enhanced aerobic glycolysis. Notably, fasting promotes a&#xD;
      shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism, which could suppress cyst growth. The&#xD;
      investigators are currently conducting an ongoing behavioral weight loss pilot trial (based&#xD;
      on either daily caloric restriction or intermittent fasting) in adults with ADPKD who are&#xD;
      overweight/obese. As an alternative to these approaches, time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a&#xD;
      novel fasting regimen that restricts eating to a feeding window (typically 8-12 hrs/day). As&#xD;
      isocaloric TRF reduces disease progression in a rodent model of ADPKD, including kidney: body&#xD;
      weight and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, it may be an alternative and easier&#xD;
      to adhere to dietary strategy to slow ADPKD progression. Specific Aim: Determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of TRF without energy intake restriction in adults with ADPKD and&#xD;
      overweight/obesity. The study will determine adherence to TRF by assessing the percent of&#xD;
      participants achieving the goal of eating within an 8-hour TRF window, measured objectively&#xD;
      with a photographic food record and verified with continuous glucose monitoring data. The&#xD;
      study will also further assess the safety, acceptability, and tolerability of TRF by&#xD;
      evaluation of safety labs, adverse events, and quality of life measures, as well as changes&#xD;
      in abdominal adiposity and total kidney volume (TKV) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and&#xD;
      markers of biological pathways (AMP-activated protein kinase [AMPK], mTOR, insulin-like&#xD;
      growth factor 1 [IGF1]).&#xD;
