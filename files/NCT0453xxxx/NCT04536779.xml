  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to investigate the physiological, mental, social health effect&#xD;
      among individuels with low physical mobility participating in one of the two pre-existing&#xD;
      initiatives: the Danish 'Team Twin' and Cycling Without Age. In these, the individuals with&#xD;
      low physical mobility are moved by and together with by normal functioning volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above, this research project will answer the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does movement by others improves the quality of life (QOL) among individuals with low&#xD;
           physical mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does movement by others improves the physiological health among individuals with low&#xD;
           physical mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does moving individuals with low physical mobility improve health among normal&#xD;
           functioning individuals (i.e volunteer runners and pilots)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How does participation in the physical activity initiatives influence well-being,&#xD;
           relations and attitudes among relatives (to the disabled individuals) and employees at&#xD;
           nursing homes?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research project consists of two sub-projects, where data collection will take place&#xD;
      independently of each other. For both projects, we will use a self-controlled study design&#xD;
      with pre- and post-measurements of the participant. Through a mixed-method design combining&#xD;
      both quantitative and qualitative data will be obtained from the following three target&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals with low physical mobility ('Handiathletes' TT and 'Passengers' CUA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Volunteers (Runners and Pilots)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relatives (to the Handiathletes) and employees at nursing homes (older people)&#xD;
&#xD;
      I collaboration with the two initiatives: the Team Twin- &amp; Cycling without Age-foundation,&#xD;
      the study intend to recruit approximately 25 'Handiathletes' and 25 'Passengers' with low&#xD;
      physical mobility and a non-defined number of volunteer-runners, pilots and relatives from&#xD;
      most recent established local departments of TT and nursing homes who offers the CUA-concepts&#xD;
      to the nursing home residents. Prior to the enrollment, all participants will be given oral&#xD;
      and written participant information and give their written consent to participate. Depending&#xD;
      on the target group, each group will undergo different data collection methods (described&#xD;
      under outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Team Twin description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primo 2021, the Handiathletes (TT) who meet eligibility criteria will undergo two clinical&#xD;
      pre-test days within a two weeks interval. Starting from approximately ultimo February, a&#xD;
      training period of minimum 3 months will start. All the participant target groups train and&#xD;
      participate in prescheduled races in their respective departments of TT. During the 3 months&#xD;
      of training, data will be collected from the different target groups (see outcome measure).&#xD;
      After the 3 months of training, the 'Handiathletes' will undergo one clinical post-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cycling Without Age description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primo 2021, the Pilots (CUA) who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the project -&#xD;
      a trial period of minimum 3 months. We will conduct pre- and post measures regarding the&#xD;
      research questions (described under outcome)&#xD;
