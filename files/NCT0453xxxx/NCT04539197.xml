      300 IgG4-RD patients, 200 other autoimmune diseases, 60 IgG4-RD mimickers and 100 healthy&#xD;
      controls were enrolled. Circulating plasmablast/plasma cells were detected of all patients at&#xD;
      baseline and healthy controls. IgG4-RD patients were followed up every 3-6 months.&#xD;
      Circulating plasmablast/plasma cells were also detected at disease remission and relapse.&#xD;
      IgG4-RD patients' clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected.&#xD;

      300 IgG4-RD patients, 200 other autoimmune diseases, 60 IgG4-RD mimickers (pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, vasculitis, lymphoproliferative diseases, inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
      kimura disease) and 100 healthy controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood samples of 5-10 ml&#xD;
      were collected from all patients and healthy controls. Serum was separated for ELISA&#xD;
      detection. Circulating plasmablast/plasma cells were detected of all patients at baseline and&#xD;
      healthy controls. IgG4-RD patients were followed up every 3-6 months. Circulating&#xD;
      plasmablast/plasma cells were also detected at disease remission and relapse. IgG4-RD&#xD;
      patients' clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected. Data were analyzed to&#xD;
      evaluate plasmablast/plasma cells in diagnosis and relapse prediction of IgG4-RD.&#xD;
