  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fracture risk of diabetic patients proves to be higher than those without diabetesdue to&#xD;
      thehyperglycemia, usage of diabetes drugs, the changes in insulin levels and excretion, and&#xD;
      this risk begins as early as adolescence.Many factors may be related to bone metabolism in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes, including demographic data (e.g. age, height, weight, gender),&#xD;
      medical history (e.g. smoking, drinking, menopause) and examination (e.g. bone mineral&#xD;
      density, blood routine), urine routine).However, most of existing methods are qualitative&#xD;
      assessments and do not take the interactions of the physiological factors of humans into&#xD;
      consideration. In addition, the fracture risk of diabetic patients with osteoporosis has not&#xD;
      been further studied before. In order to investigate the effect of patients' physiological&#xD;
      factors on fracture risk, in the paper, we used a hybrid model combining XGBoost with deep&#xD;
      neural network to predict the fracture risk of diabetic patients with osteoporosis.&#xD;
