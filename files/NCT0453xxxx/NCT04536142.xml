  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see the changes in structural and functional connectivity that&#xD;
      happen in the brain of patients undergoing brain tumor surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to visualize and quantify changes in the brain of patients&#xD;
      undergoing brain tumor surgery through high-quality, high-resolution structural and&#xD;
      functional brain imaging and brain connectivity measures. To understand the effects of the&#xD;
      primary treatment for brain tumors, the investigators will determine changes in brain&#xD;
      connectivity after surgery and correlate this with neurologic status. The investigators will&#xD;
      prospectively collect brain imaging (MRI) and clinical data in brain tumor patients before&#xD;
      and after removal of their tumor. Any adult patient with a brain tumor (primary or&#xD;
      metastatic) for whom surgery to remove the tumor is planned is eligible. The investigators&#xD;
      plan for recruitment of 30 subjects. This will include 27 subjects with brain tumors and 3&#xD;
      healthy controls. Both clinical and imaging data will be collected for tumor and healthy&#xD;
      subjects. A two-part research scan (diffusion MRI and resting state functional MRI) will be&#xD;
      performed within 1 week prior to surgery and again 2 weeks after surgery. The healthy&#xD;
      controls will obtain identical research scans with the second session two weeks following the&#xD;
      first session. Subjects will be also administered Neurocognitive and Qualitative Assessments&#xD;
      at two time intervals, pre- and post-surgery (2 weeks).&#xD;

    <description>A research MRI scan will be performed within 1 week prior to surgery and again 2 weeks after surgery. The surgical removal of the brain tumor(s) is not a component of this research. The MRI scan will perform both programs (diffusion MRI, resting state MRI) during the same single session. The healthy controls will obtain identical research scans with the second session between two and three weeks following the first session, since they will not undergo a surgery.</description>
