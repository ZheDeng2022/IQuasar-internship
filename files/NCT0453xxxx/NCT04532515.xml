    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, open label, study to evaluate safety and performance of Seal-G&#xD;
      and Seal-G MIST in reinforcing colonic anastomosis, in subjects undergoing Colon Resection&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seal-G and Seal-G MIST Surgical Sealants are intended for the reinforcement and protection of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal anastomosis. The Seal-G and Seal-G MIST devices share the same Alginate&#xD;
      based sealant technology and intended purpose. The devices only differ in their method of&#xD;
      application, The Seal-G device is designed for spread application by extra-corporal approach,&#xD;
      and the Seal-G MIST device is designed for spray application by intra-corporal approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Clinical Investigation aims to collect clinical evidence on the devices' usage,&#xD;
      including safety, performance and usability.&#xD;
