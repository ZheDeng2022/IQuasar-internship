      Blended Treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder (BLEND-A) is a pragmatic, cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementing&#xD;
      a blended treatment format that aims to reduce problematic alcohol use. Blended treatment is&#xD;
      a treatment format where treatment as usual is offered as a combination of online and&#xD;
      face-to-face sessions, integrated into one treatment protocol. The BLEND-A study will&#xD;
      evaluate and implement a blended treatment program in routine alcohol addiction treatment.&#xD;
      The trial is led by Unit of Clinical Alcohol Research, University of Southern Denmark (UCAR)&#xD;
      in collaboration with partners at the Centre for Telepsychiatry in the Region of Southern&#xD;
      Denmark (CTP), and Sundhed.dk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: A major challenge to psychological treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is&#xD;
      patient non-compliance. A promising new treatment approach that is hypothesized to increase&#xD;
      treatment compliance is blended treatment, consisting of face-to-face contact with a&#xD;
      therapist combined with modules delivered over the Internet within the same protocol. While&#xD;
      this treatment concept has been developed and proven effective for a variety of mental&#xD;
      disorders, it has not yet been examined for AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The study described in this protocol aims to examine and evaluate patient compliance&#xD;
      with blended AUD treatment as well as the clinical and cost effectiveness of such treatment&#xD;
      compared to face-to-face treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study design is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      The included outpatient institutions (planned number of patients: n=1800) will be randomized&#xD;
      in clusters to implement either blended AUD treatment or face-to-face treatment only, i.e.&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU). Both treatment approaches consist of motivational interviewing and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy. Data on socio-demographics, alcohol consumption, addiction&#xD;
      severity, treatment retention, treatment duration and intensity, and type of conclusion of&#xD;
      treatment (dropout vs. compliance), will be retrieved from the National Register of Alcohol&#xD;
      Treatment (NAB). In addition, all patients will be assessed for alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      consequences of drinking and quality of life at treatment entry and six months after&#xD;
      treatment conclusion. Data will be analyzed with an Intention-to-treat approach by means of&#xD;
      generalized mixed models with random effect for cluster and fixed effect for each step. Also,&#xD;
      analyses evaluating cost-effectiveness will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Blended treatment may increase treatment compliance and thus improve treatment&#xD;
      outcomes due to increased flexibility of the treatment course. Since this study is conducted&#xD;
      within an implementation framework it can easily be scaled up, and blended treatment has the&#xD;
      potential to become an alternative offer in the majority ofmany outpatient clinics&#xD;
      nationwide.&#xD;
