  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this mixed methods study is to evaluate a peer-delivered decision support&#xD;
      intervention with emerging adults newly enrolled in an early intervention program, also known&#xD;
      as coordinated specialty care (CSC). It is hypothesized that participants will experience a&#xD;
      reduction in decision-making needs after participating in the intervention, and that study&#xD;
      and intervention procedures will demonstrate feasibility and acceptability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to pilot test a peer-delivered decision support&#xD;
      intervention (in the form of decision coaching) that is designed to enhance emerging adults'&#xD;
      treatment decision-making and service engagement after enrollment in a coordinated specialty&#xD;
      care (CSC) program. Based on an experimental therapeutics approach, this mixed methods pilot&#xD;
      trial will assess feasibility, acceptability, and the intervention's potential impact on key&#xD;
      decision-making needs (i.e., decision-making targets). We will track feasibility data related&#xD;
      to study and intervention procedures, and collect acceptability and outcome data from 20&#xD;
      emerging adults who will participate in the intervention after enrollment in the CSC program.&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis related to decision-making targets will provide preliminary evidence&#xD;
      regarding whether the intervention impacts these targets, while qualitative analysis will&#xD;
      explain how it may do so. Merged results from these two sets of data will inform intervention&#xD;
      refinement by providing a nuanced understanding of the intervention's potential to engage&#xD;
      decision-making targets from the perspective of emerging adults.&#xD;

    <description>An intervention provided by a trained peer interventionist to facilitate treatment decision making among emerging adults with early psychosis. Specific components of this intervention may include facilitating access to information, clarifying values, helping a person obtain the needed support to make a decision, and screening for implementation barriers. Due to having lived experience of a mental health condition, the peer interventionist will also be able to provide unique types of information and support within the coaching process.</description>
