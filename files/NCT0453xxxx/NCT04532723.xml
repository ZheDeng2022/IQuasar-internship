  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on prior exoskeleton research, it was determined that 40 participants of variable&#xD;
      height, weight and injury level would provide a significant measure of the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of using the ExoAtlet II in individuals with SCI for standing and walking&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy. Craig Hospital will be responsible for enrolling up to 30 individuals&#xD;
      during the study duration.The inclusion criteria will be utilized to identify appropriate&#xD;
      subjects for this study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spinal Cord injury with lower extremity paralysis (partial or complete) levels T4-L5&#xD;
             (AIS A-C) or C7-T3 (AIS D)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 Years of age or older in general good health&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight, no more than 220lbs (100kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intact Skin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to stand without exhibiting symptomatic hypotension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use a wheelchair for mobility at least 50% of the day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enough strength in hands and shoulders to support standing and walking using crutches&#xD;
             or a walker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical clearance for full weight-bearing&#xD;
&#xD;
             ---Per our clinical guidelines, we will require all individuals with SCI who are going&#xD;
             to use an exoskeleton to receive full weight-bearing medical clearance from their&#xD;
             physician prior to participation. If they are unable to obtain full weight-bearing&#xD;
             medical clearance they will not be able to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Passive range of motion (PROM) at shoulders, trunk, upper extremities and lower&#xD;
             extremities within functional limits for safe gait and use of appropriate assistive&#xD;
             device/stability aid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hip width no greater than 18&quot; (46 cm) measured when sitting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Femur length between 37 cm and 49 cm measured between mid-patellar tendon and the&#xD;
             floor&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spinal cord injury level higher than T4 (AIS A-C) or C7 ASIA D&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe muscle stiffness/tightness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale score of 3 or above)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trunk or lower extremity pressure wound&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable spine, un-healed limbs, or fractures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of bone in soft tissue where bone normally does not exist (heterotopic&#xD;
             ossification), limiting range of motion in the hip or knee joints&#xD;
&#xD;
             ---Each individual who is interested in participating in this study will be screened&#xD;
             for heterotropic ossification (HO) using a verbal checklist first and then they&#xD;
             participate in a thorough range of motion (ROM) evaluation before being fit in the&#xD;
             exoskeleton. If they verbalize a history of HO or demonstrate a bony block/resistance&#xD;
             to passive ROM, they will be sent back to their physician to rule out HO and will not&#xD;
             participate in the study until they receive additional clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Joint instability, dislocation, moderate to severe hip dysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fracture or lower-limb surgery in past year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychopathology, or other condition that the physician or investigator, in his or her&#xD;
             clinical judgment, considers to be exclusionary to safely use an exoskeleton&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females (Potential female participants will be informed that&#xD;
             risks to pregnant or lactating females are unknown; then they will be asked if they&#xD;
             are pregnant or lactating, or if they could be pregnant. If there is any uncertainty,&#xD;
             they will not be included in the study).&#xD;
