  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people have a mutation in the CDH1 gene that is known to lead to stomach cancer. They&#xD;
      are advised to get regular endoscopies with biopsies even if their stomach appears normal.&#xD;
      The endoscopy method currently used is called the 'Cambridge Method.' Researchers want to&#xD;
      test a new method called the 'Bethesda Protocol.'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the Cambridge Method and Bethesda Protocol and find out which is more efficient in&#xD;
      catching early signs of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older who have a mutation in the CDH1 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical history, medical records, and&#xD;
      physical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be put into group 1 (Bethesda Protocol) or group 2 (Cambridge Method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam. They will have endoscopy. For this, they will be put&#xD;
      under general anesthesia. They will wear compression cuffs around their legs to prevent blood&#xD;
      clots. A lighted tube will be inserted into their mouth and go down to their stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group 1 participants, 88 pieces of tissue will be taken from 22 areas of their stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group 2 participants, 30 pieces of tissue will be taken from 6 areas of their stomach.&#xD;
      Then group 2 will be injected with a contrast dye. A microscope will be inserted, and more&#xD;
      samples will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 14 days later, participants will have a follow-up visit or phone call. They may give&#xD;
      stool samples every 3 to 6 months for 12 months for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have another endoscopy 6-18 months later.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is most often attributed to inactivating germline&#xD;
      mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) tumor suppressor gene. Mutation carriers have a 24-70%&#xD;
      lifetime risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International consensus guidelines recommend endoscopic screening and surveillance of CDH1&#xD;
      mutation carriers who decline risk-reducing total gastrectomy (TG). However, this approach&#xD;
      lacks sufficient sensitivity for detection of occult, intramucosal foci of signet ring cancer&#xD;
      cells (SRCC), which are pathognomonic of HDGC. Our team has established a systematic&#xD;
      endoscopic screening protocol (Bethesda protocol) that demonstrates a higher rate of SRCC&#xD;
      detection compared to historic controls using the currently recommended Cambridge method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if Bethesda protocol provides improved sensitivity for detection of early stage&#xD;
      gastric cancer in CDH1 germline mutation carriers compared to the Cambridge method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with pathogenic or likely pathogenic CDH1 germline mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;=18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologically able to undergo upper endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II randomized study to compare Bethesda protocol and Cambridge method for detection of&#xD;
      intramucosal SRCC in asymptomatic CDH1 mutation carriers undergoing endoscopic screening or&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
