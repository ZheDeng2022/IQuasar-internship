  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to predict fluid responsiveness in the operating room and therefore benefit of&#xD;
      performing fluid administration to improve patient's hemodynamic status, it will test two&#xD;
      ventilation strategies : the Tidal Volume Challenge (VtC) and the Lung Recruitment Maneuver&#xD;
      (LRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to determine whether the variation of 2 parameters such as pulse pression&#xD;
      variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) during these 2 strategies, allows to&#xD;
      predict fluid responsiveness in the operating room for any heavy surgery. All patients will&#xD;
      benefit from the 2 ventilation strategies then a fluid administration, called &quot; fluid&#xD;
      challenge &quot;, will be performed to discriminate the true responders and others. The order of&#xD;
      the ventilation strategies will be determined by randomization.&#xD;

    <description>The LRM is performed first for 30 seconds (an insufflation pressure of 30 cmH2O for 30 seconds is applied). After a free interval of 3 minutes, the VtC is done during 1 minute. For VtC, tidal volume is increased from 6 to 8 ml.kg-1 of predicted body weight. Finally, after a new free interval of 3 minutes, the fluid challenge (consisting in fluid administration of 250 ml of Ringer Lactate) is started for 10 minutes (in aim to determine which patients are responders). This sequence is repeated every 30 minutes (maximum four times).</description>
