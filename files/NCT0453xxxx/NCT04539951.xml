  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes a sequenced clinical trial in order to assess the efficacy of several&#xD;
      switching or augment strategies when initial treatment is ineffective，and to provide strong&#xD;
      evidence for clinical practice and international guidelines for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors(SSRIs) are the first line pharmacotherapy for&#xD;
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) according to APA（American Psychological&#xD;
      Association）guideline. Nevertheless, a large proportion (40% or more) of patients response&#xD;
      only partially or not at all to treatment with a SSRI. On the basis of the existing sparse&#xD;
      literature, several pharmacotherapy options for OCD patients who do not respond, or who&#xD;
      respond but do not remit, have been outlined in current treatment guidelines. These include&#xD;
      1) treatment with higher than usual doses of an SSRI, 2) switch to a different SSRI, 3)&#xD;
      switch to a different class of medication, 4) augmentation with a dopamine blocker, and 5)&#xD;
      augmentation with a glutamatergic agent. There is a need for additional data, particularly&#xD;
      real-world data, on how best to choose between these options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) study is a multi-center clinical study with a&#xD;
      total of 13 centers that specialize in OCD patients. A randomized block design will be used&#xD;
      in this study and all eligible participants accepted into this study will undergo an initial&#xD;
      course of pharmacotherapy (phase I), and non-remmitters will be randomly allocated to five&#xD;
      treatment arms (phase II). In phase I all participants will be treated with sertraline for 12&#xD;
      weeks.In phase II,The 5 arms will comprise 1) treatment with higher than usual doses of&#xD;
      sertraline, 2) switch to fluvoxamine, 3) switch to venlafaxine, 4) augmentation with&#xD;
      memantine, and 5) augmentation with aripiprazole. Clinicians and patients will know which&#xD;
      treatment arm is being employed, but raters will be kept blind to treatment group.&#xD;
