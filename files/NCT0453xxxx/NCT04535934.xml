  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 12 adults subjects will be enrolled. Participants will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      two directly observed dosing regimens with 2mg adenine 5+ (five stable-labled nitrogens) as&#xD;
      follows: 1 dose/week followed by 4 doses/week OR 3 doses/week followed by 7 doses/week. Each&#xD;
      dose regimen will have a duration of approximately 12 weeks and will be separated by a&#xD;
      12-week washout period for a total study duration of approximately 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dried blood spots (DBS) and whole blood will be collect weekly. Urine will be collected less&#xD;
      frequently, about every 2 weeks. The ratio of ATP 5+ to naturally occurring ATP 2+ is dried&#xD;
      blood spots will be the primary outcome, as adenine is phosphorylated to ATP in red blood&#xD;
      cells. Breakdown products will be measured in urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will allow flexibility in terms of which days are used for dosing for the 1, 3,&#xD;
      and 4 dose(s)/week regimens. This is scientifically justified as investigators expect a 20-30&#xD;
      day half-life of ATP 5+ in DBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately twelve healthy adult volunteers with no contraindicated medical conditions or&#xD;
      medications will be recruited from CU/Denver and the surrounding community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of 2 sequences consisting of two directly observed&#xD;
      dosing regimens with 2mg adenine 5+ per dose, 1 dose/week followed by 4 doses/week or 3&#xD;
      doses/week followed by 7 doses/week. Each dose regimen will have a duration of approximately&#xD;
      12 weeks and will be separated by an approximately 12-week washout period for a total study&#xD;
      duration of approximately 36 weeks. The rationale for this study design is several fold.&#xD;
      First, the lower doses are given initially to minimize the potential effects of carry-over in&#xD;
      the second regimen. Second, 1 to 7 doses/week encompass a wide range of simulated adherence&#xD;
      rates to assess the promise of this taggant, adenine 5+, as an adherence biomarker. Third,&#xD;
      the 12 week duration is designed to achieve ~90% of steady-state given an estimated half-life&#xD;
      of 20-30 days.&#xD;
