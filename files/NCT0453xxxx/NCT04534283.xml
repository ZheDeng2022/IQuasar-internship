  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of CTO-IUSCC-0730 study is to assess the clinical efficacy of LY3214996 in&#xD;
      combination with abemaciclib at the recommended phase 2 dose of LY3214996 200 mg orally daily&#xD;
      and abemaciclib 150 mg orally twice daily. Patients will be treated until evidence of disease&#xD;
      progression, non-compliance with study protocol, unacceptable major toxicity, at subject's&#xD;
      own request for withdrawal, or if the study closes for any reason.&#xD;
