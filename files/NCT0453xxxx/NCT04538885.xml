  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor incision healing is a common complication after abdominal surgery, mainly manifested as&#xD;
      incision dehiscence, subcutaneous fat liquefaction, malnutrition, and incision infection.&#xD;
      Poor healing of the incision will increase the patient's pain and prolong the patient's&#xD;
      hospital stay, and the choice of wound treatment is closely related to the wound healing&#xD;
      effect. Mesenchymal stem cells mainly rely on paracrine effects to exert their therapeutic&#xD;
      effects and obtain better therapeutic effects in wound healing. Here, the pleiotropic factors&#xD;
      secreted from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-PFs) will be used to treat patients with poor&#xD;
      healing after surgery to evaluate its effectiveness and safety.&#xD;
