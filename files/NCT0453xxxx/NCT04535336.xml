      A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the effects of a six-month VA&#xD;
      program on the muscle mass, muscle strength, and quality of sleep of institutional older&#xD;
      adults with sarcopenia. Using convenience sampling, 12 long-term care facilities with 114&#xD;
      older adults were recruited, and then cluster-randomized by the facility to a VA experimental&#xD;
      or a control group. The experimental group received the VA program led by certified&#xD;
      instructors 3 times per week and 40 minutes per session for 6 months; the control group&#xD;
      continued with their regular daily activities. One pre-test and two post-tests, 3 months&#xD;
      apart, were conducted.&#xD;

    <description>The VA program took 40 minutes to complete and included 3 phases: 1) activating qi and blood (5 movements, 10 minutes): warm-up exercises that allowed the body to accumulate heat and promote flexibility of the joints to loosen up the body, 2) punching meridians (14 movements, 20 minutes): both hands were used to exert a vibrating effect according to the rhythms that stimulate the 14 meridians in the entire body to improve aerobic endurance, and 3) relaxing body and mind (5 movements, 10 minutes): muscle relaxing exercises to rest the body and cease the qi. Participants in the experimental group received the VA program led by the instructors, who were trained an certified by the PI, 3 times per week and 40 minutes per session for 6 months.</description>
