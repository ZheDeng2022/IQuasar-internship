    <textblock>
      In this study researcher want to learn more about possible skin reactions such after repeated&#xD;
      application of an antifungal cream containing Trolamine. They are especially interested in&#xD;
      skin irritations or allergic skin reactions. The study plans to enroll about 225 female or&#xD;
      male participants with the age 18 - 79 years. The antifungal test cream will be applied on&#xD;
      the back between the shoulder blades of the participants and covered by a special dressing&#xD;
      patch. This will be repeated 3 times a week for the first 3 weeks of this study applying the&#xD;
      cream on the same area of the back. At each visit the skin will be investigated for redness,&#xD;
      dryness and other reactions. After a rest period of two weeks the test cream will be applied&#xD;
      on the same skin area as before and on a second new skin area nearby. After 2 and 4 days the&#xD;
      two skin areas will again be investigated for redness, dryness and other reactions.&#xD;

    <description>During the Induction Phase, participants received 0.2 g Butenafine HCl 1% covered by an occlusive patch on the upper back skin test site three times a week for a total of 9 applications. Prior to each patch application and after the last patch removal, the test sites were evaluated for gross changes according to the Erythemal Scoring Scale and if necessary the Additional Scoring system. After 14 days of Rest Phase, on the first day of Challenge Phase, participants received same procedure on original Induction Phase test site and on a virgin test site. The patches were removed and the sites scored 48 hours after application and scored again at 96 hours after application. The test sites were evaluated using the Induction Phase scoring system.</description>
