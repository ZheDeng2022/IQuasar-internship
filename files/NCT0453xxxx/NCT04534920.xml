      Two different datasets from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved studies L#12,083 and&#xD;
      L#12,086 will be used to compare the sample characteristics between subjects who received&#xD;
      Strattice mesh for abdominal wall reconstruction at Westchester Medical Center and Americas&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal wall defects or hernias are commonly seen after open surgery performed electively&#xD;
      or under emergent conditions. During the last decade numerous advances have been made in the&#xD;
      management of patients with abdominal wall defects. These defects are repaired by various&#xD;
      surgical techniques including mesh repair (synthetic vs. biologic), primary repair, etc.&#xD;
      However, the outcomes of patients after these injuries are highly variable and many of these&#xD;
      patients suffer from in-hospital complications, mesh infections requiring explantation, and&#xD;
      recurrence. Various factors play a role in the final outcome of the patient. These include&#xD;
      factors associated with the reasons for initial surgery or disease (trauma or emergency&#xD;
      general surgery), patient demographics (age, gender, co-morbidities), preoperative features&#xD;
      (hemoglobin and other biochemical indicators, surgical technique used during the repair and&#xD;
      use of repair (onlay, inlay, retro rectus) and the types of mesh used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Two different datasets from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved studies&#xD;
      L#12,083 and L#12,086 will be used to compare the sample characteristics between subjects who&#xD;
      received Strattice mesh for abdominal wall reconstruction at Westchester Medical Center and&#xD;
      Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative (AHSQC) registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the degree to which our sample of Strattice速 recipients&#xD;
      resemble AHSQC Strattice速 recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves two different datasets from our existing studies L#12083 and L#12,086&#xD;
      which are approved by New York Medical College, IRB on 6/14/2017and 7/7/2017 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study L#12,083 is a retrospective data collection of subjects who had abdominal wall&#xD;
      reconstruction and received Strattice mesh during 1/1/2011 to 12/31/2018 at Westchester&#xD;
      Medical Center. A total of 105 records from this study will be used for comparison study.&#xD;
      Study L#12086 is a prospective study of subjects who had abdominal wall reconstruction using&#xD;
      biological mesh. A total of 77 records will be used from this study. From both the studies&#xD;
      combined we have about a total of 182 records of extracted data and same data variables will&#xD;
      be used to compare with AHSQC registry. The data that will be compared includes preoperative&#xD;
      info, hospital course, complications, re-hospitalizations and 2weeks follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Subject Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects Total of 182 records met the inclusion criteria and data has been&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender of Subjects There will be no gender based restrictions for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age of Subjects Subjects 18 to 85 years old will be included in this study.&#xD;
