  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was to evaluate the effect of topical Arnica and MPSP application with&#xD;
      respect to visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, maximal interincisal opening (MIO) and edema&#xD;
      values after mandibular impacted third molar removal on days 1, 3, 5 and 10 postoperatively.&#xD;
      The following null hypotheses of the present research were determined as follows: usage of&#xD;
      topical agents would not influence i) VAS scores, ii) MIO values, and iii) edema values on&#xD;
      1st, 3rd, 5th, and 10th days after the mandibular impacted third molar surgery&#xD;

    <measure>Preoperative Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>On the day of surgery preoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), 10 cm in length, ranging from 0 for &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 for &quot;the worst possible pain&quot;. Preoperative VAS value recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Maximal Interincisal Opening (MIO) on Postoperative Follow Up Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively on the day of surgery, postoperative first, third, fifth and tenth days</time_frame>
    <description>All patients' maximal interincisal opening were measured and recorded as the distance between upper and lower central incisors. Preoperative MIO value recorded. The measurements were repeated as described above in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 10th days after surgery and recorded.</description>

    <measure>3. Change From Baseline Facial Measurements for Evaluation of Edema on Postoperative Follow Up Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively on the day of surgery, postoperative first, third, fifth and tenth days</time_frame>
    <description>The level of edema was determined by a modification of tape measuring method described by Gabka and Matsumara [20, 21]. Three measurements (in mm) (AC, AE and BE) were made between 5 reference points: A) tragus, B) lateral corner of the eye, C) outer corner of the mouth, D) angle of the mandible, and E) soft tissue pogonion. The mean of three preoperative measurements was calculated and recorded. The measurements were repeated as described above in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 10th days after surgery.</description>
