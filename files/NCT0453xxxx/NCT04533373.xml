  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Common goals of breast reconstruction include obtaining satisfactory breast symmetry,&#xD;
      softness, and appropriate size and shape. Advances in surgical techniques have prompted a new&#xD;
      goal: achieving breast sensation after reconstructive surgery. This desire has led the&#xD;
      surgical community to investigate operative techniques for achieving this goal. However, few&#xD;
      studies have examined the effectiveness of breast sensory restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory nerves are nerves responsible for sensation from skin. When a sensory nerve is cut,&#xD;
      sensation is lost to the area supplied by the nerve. In the case of Breast reconstruction&#xD;
      this involves the nerves supplying the skin overlying breast(s). 'Neurotization' refers to&#xD;
      regeneration of the nerve after it has been cut. This means that the cut nerve is being&#xD;
      repaired in order to restore its function. In Neurotization this repair is carried out using&#xD;
      a new &quot;source&quot;. In this case, the investigators want to restore function of the nerves that&#xD;
      supply the skin overlying the breast(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be performing breast reconstruction using tissue from the patient's&#xD;
      abdomen and transferring it to the chest wall to repair the mastectomy defect. Sensory&#xD;
      function is restored by using the nerve that supplies the skin of this abdominal tissue (i.e&#xD;
      the new &quot;source&quot;) that is being transferred and attaching it to a nerve in the chest wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Avance® Nerve graft is a nerve graft material that has been produced by Axogen, Inc. The&#xD;
      graft is made by processing donated human nerves. This graft is used during neurotization to&#xD;
      bridge the gap and join the nerve from the abdominal tissue to the nerve in the chest wall.&#xD;
      The use of the graft helps the body to attach these 2 nerves and improves nerve repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When neurotization is done without the nerve graft there is a possibility that the surgeon&#xD;
      may require extra nerve material to join the 2 nerves. Traditionally, in this case the&#xD;
      surgeon would have to obtain a separate donor nerve from another part of the patient's body.&#xD;
      This technique carries the risk of complications to part of the body that the separate donor&#xD;
      nerve was obtained from - loss of sensation, infection or neuroma formation (an abnormal&#xD;
      growth of nerve tissue that can cause pain, burning or tingling sensation, numbness). The&#xD;
      Avance nerve graft avoids the need for the additional donor nerve and the possible&#xD;
      complications associated with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Avance® Nerve Graft is currently being used in some women during breast reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery, however the effectiveness of this procedure in improving the restoration of&#xD;
      sensation has not been proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women undergoing reconstruction of one breast and at the same time using the women's own&#xD;
      tissue as part of standard clinical care, may join.&#xD;

The Breast-Q is comprised of 2 domains - i) Satisfaction domains and ii) Well-being domains, which are further divided into sub-domains. We will be using 3 satisfaction sub-domains:&#xD;
i) Satisfaction with breasts ii) Satisfaction with Nipple iii) Satisfaction with outcome&#xD;
and 3 well-being sub-domains:&#xD;
i) Psychosocial well-being ii) Sexual well-being and iii) Physical well-being&#xD;
Each sub-domain will be scored on a scale of 0-100, where higher scores will indicate higher satisfaction.</description>

             flap (DIEP) will be included.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Autologous reconstruction where the flap is buried.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Exclusion criteria will encompass any patient with: diabetic neuropathy, thyroid&#xD;
             disorders, collagen vascular disease, alcoholism, pernicious anemia, or any other&#xD;
             severe underlying peripheral neuropathy including chemotherapy-induced neuropathy or&#xD;
             neuropathy induced by other medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant or lactating women will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women with recurrent breast cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women with previous reconstructive procedures or who have previously undergone&#xD;
             lumpectomy with radiation will be excluded.&#xD;
