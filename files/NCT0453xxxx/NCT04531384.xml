  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Robot-assisted&#xD;
      rehabilitation intelligent system as a virtual stand-alone treatment, delivered with minimal&#xD;
      clinical monitoring compared with treatment as usual in methamphetamine (MA) use disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on artificial intelligence technology, face recognition technology, virtual reality&#xD;
      technology to develop an available Robot-assisted rehabilitation intelligent system. Then,&#xD;
      using this intelligent system as a new way of Psychotherapy to provide treatment for&#xD;
      methamphetamine patients, and compare it with traditional treatment to verify the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Robot-assisted rehabilitation intelligent system in Chinese methamphetamine&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>Participants assigned to this condition were offered 10 weekly individual sessions of robot-assisted rehabilitation treatment, delivered by the Robot-assisted rehabilitation intelligent system. The system contains 10 core cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) skill topics (such as functional analysis, coping skills training, reviewing practice exercises, explaining CBT concepts). A robot therapist demonstrates the target CBT skills and assigns homework to participants.</description>
