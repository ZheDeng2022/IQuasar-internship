  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following severe traumatic brain injury, patients may remain unconscious for many years. It&#xD;
      is the intestinal microbiome and metabolomics analysis comparing differentially intestinal&#xD;
      microflora and metabolites between patients with chronic disorder of consciousness and&#xD;
      controls so far. The investigators have mature data analysis technology. The obtained results&#xD;
      provide new insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the chronic&#xD;
      disorder of consciousness&#xD;

      Objective:To determine differences in metabolic profiles and Intestinal microbial abundance&#xD;
      among healthy human individuals and patients in a vegetative state (VS) and minimally&#xD;
      conscious state (MCS) and to identify metabolites in human plasma that can accurately&#xD;
      distinguish VS patients from MCS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Plasma samples and fecal sample were obtained from patients with chronic disorder of&#xD;
      consciousness, and healthy volunteers. A comprehensive metabolic profile was obtained with&#xD;
      targeted metabolomics analysis and untargeted and targeted lipidomics analysis, as well as&#xD;
      intestinal microbial abundance from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.&#xD;

    <measure>Coma Recovery Scale-Revised(CRS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before samples collection</time_frame>
    <description>Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score was used to quantify the severity, which consists of 23 hierarchically arranged items that comprise six subscales addressing auditory, visual, motor, oromotor/verbal, communication, and arousal processes. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity, whereas the highest items represent cognitively mediated behaviors In total, The lowest mark on the scale is 0 and the highest mark is 23. To a certain extent, the higher the score is, the better the level of consciousness is, whereas the lower the level of consciousness is.</description>
