    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility, multi-site, randomized, double-masked, 2×2 crossover design,&#xD;
      1-week dispensing study. Subjects will wear the Test lens in one eye and the Control lens in&#xD;
      the other in a random order for 1-week each as a daily disposable modality with a wash-out&#xD;
      period of 1 week between the wearing periods.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 7 days of contact lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of comfort will be performed using the Contact Lens User ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire used to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a US contact-lens wearing population between 18 and 65 years of age. CLUE composite scores are derived using Item Response Theory (IRT) and follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for the population of soft disposable contact lens wearers.</description>

    <measure>Monocular Distance Visual Performance (Low Luminance/High Contrast)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 7 days of contact lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Visual performance will be calculated as contact lens-corrected distance visual acuity using a logMAR visual acuity scale for each eye. This will be evaluated under and low luminance/high contrast conditions at 4 meters from Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts.</description>
