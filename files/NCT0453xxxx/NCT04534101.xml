  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults and children undergoing medical care (inpatient or outpatient) often experience pain&#xD;
      and anxiety either as a result of their medical condition or a side effect of medical&#xD;
      procedures. The purpose of this study is to create a registry of patients using virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) mindfulness therapy through different aspects of their medical care to determine&#xD;
      if VR mindfulness therapy is more effective than the standard of care (i.e., no technology&#xD;
      based distraction) for treating or preventing anxiety and pain in adults and children&#xD;
      suffering from chronic pain, GI conditions where pain is a common symptom, or undergoing any&#xD;
      painful medical procedure (i.e. IV access, blood draws, endoscopy, surgery). The anticipated&#xD;
      primary outcome will be reduction of pain and anxiety for both acute and chronic pain.&#xD;

      Inpatient: Inpatients will be presented with an informed consent. If they sign the consent,&#xD;
      they will then be given a VR headset pre- programmed with content that they may use for the&#xD;
      duration of their stay. GI patients headsets will be collected when they are discharged.&#xD;
      There are pain and anxiety analog scales at the end of each program. This data will be&#xD;
      downloaded to Stanford. Patient's will not be entering their PHI. we will know who has&#xD;
      headsets, as they will be numbered. Patient who are hospitalized for chronic pain will be&#xD;
      allowed to take the VR headset home for month and be asked to return it at their followup&#xD;
      outpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient: Patient's who are about to undergo gastrointestinal disease testing or be seen&#xD;
      for an outpatient GI appointment will be presented with an informed consent. If they sign the&#xD;
      consent, they will be given the VR headset to use prior to their procedure. There are pain&#xD;
      and anxiety analog scales at the end of each program. This data will be downloaded to&#xD;
      Stanford Medicine Box.Patient's will not be entering their PHI. we will know who has&#xD;
      headsets, as they will be numbered.&#xD;
