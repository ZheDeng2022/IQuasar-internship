  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Patient Empowerment Study is an observational longitudinal study among adults with&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). The scope of this study is to better understand how a patient's&#xD;
      DFU disease process and usage of the Podimetrics System can impact patient health-related&#xD;
      quality of life. Health-related quality of life will be measured by both the generic 36-item&#xD;
      Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and the ulcer-specific Diabetic Foot Ulcer&#xD;
      Scale Short Form (DFS-SF) questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is emerging evidence that diabetic foot complications greatly affect the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients and cause people a significant burden to life. A diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)&#xD;
      is associated with deterioration the physical, mental and social life quality. Given the&#xD;
      detrimental effect foot ulcers have on patients, it is essential that quality of life metrics&#xD;
      be evaluated among DFU patients. To what degree can diabetic foot ulcers affect the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients? What are the facilitators and barriers to an improved quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain insight into these questions Podimetrics researchers will be conducting a&#xD;
      longitudinal study among patients suffering with a DFU. The general purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the current quality of life of DFU patients from the subject perspective in&#xD;
      various domains including physical functioning, general health perception, psychological,&#xD;
      social functioning, vitality and role limitations. The study will also explore the&#xD;
      relationships between HRQoL and usage of the Podimetrics System. Improved understanding of&#xD;
      patients' subjective evaluation of their quality of life, and the role of the Podimetrics&#xD;
      System, will help clinicians provide better care for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cohort of DFU patients will be recruited upon providing informed consent. Participant&#xD;
      lifestyle and ulcer status information is collected by a background survey. HRQoL is assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, 6 month and 12 month using questionnaires. The investigators intend to use two&#xD;
      types of questionnaires for HRQoL evaluation in this study: one generic questionnaire, SF-36,&#xD;
      which addresses general quality of life issues, and one specific questionnaire, DFS-SF, which&#xD;
      addresses issues specific to diabetic foot diseases, such as ulcer severity and impact of&#xD;
      ulcer care.&#xD;

Potential participants will be asked to indicate their interest in participating in this patient empowerment study during their initial phone consultation for mat set-up with the Podimetrics care-management team. Participants will be followed for one year and answer a set of identical questionnaires at three time points: at baseline, at 6-month and at 12-month post enrollment.</description>

        Two hundred (200) patients who have been prescribed the Podimetrics Remote Temperature&#xD;
        Monitoring System (hereafter &quot;Podimetrics System&quot;) by their healthcare providers will be&#xD;
        recruited. Potential participants will be asked to indicate their interest in participating&#xD;
        in this patient empowerment study during their initial phone consultation for mat set-up&#xD;
        with the Podimetrics care-management team. Participants will be recruited based on the&#xD;
        requirements indicated below. A Podimetrics representative will confirm that each&#xD;
        participant meets the requirements by evaluation through a brief interview after&#xD;
        participants indicate their interest and provide oral consent. This study will exclude&#xD;
        anyone with a cognitive impairment that would disqualify them from providing informed&#xD;
        consent.&#xD;
