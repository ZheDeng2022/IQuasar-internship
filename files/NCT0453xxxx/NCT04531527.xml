  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to gather information about the potential of Antifungal Cream&#xD;
      V61-044 containing Trolamine to produce a phototoxic reaction on the skin. A phototoxic&#xD;
      reaction is an irritant reaction of the skin to ultra violet light. In order to find this out&#xD;
      the study drug will be applied to the skin of healthy human subjects. By using a solar&#xD;
      simulator to generate a UV spectrum similar to that of sunlight the potential of the study&#xD;
      drug to produce a superficial reddening of the skin will be measured.&#xD;

    <measure>Phototoxic Reaction Evaluation Reported as Number of Test Site With Different Erythema Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before irradiation, 24 hours after irradiation, and 48 hours after irradiation</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the test sites after irradiation used following scoring system: score 0=Normal skin; score 1=Faint, barely perceptible to moderate redness with poorly defined margins (not clinically significant); score 2=Moderate to intense redness with well defined margins; score 3=Redness plus well defined edema; score 4=Redness plus papules, vesicles, or ulceration. All four test sites were evaluated for gross changes according to the Erythemal Scoring Scale and if necessary the Additional Scoring system immediately before irradiation, 24 hours after irradiation, and 48 hours after irradiation (3 different time points), thus for each type of test site (i.e. treated irradiated test site), a total of 87 test sites with scores were collected (i.e., 29 participants *3 time points = 87 sites).</description>

Participants also had two more test sites, the untreated irradiated control site without Butenafine HCl 1% followed by UV irradiation and the untreated non-irradiated control site without Butenafine HCl 1% or UV irradiation. All test sites were evaluated for erythema on the following day. Afterwards, participants received same procedure on all 4 test sites, and evaluation of the test sites occurred at 24 hours and 48 hours post-irradiation.</description>

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014.

          <title>Phototoxic Reaction Evaluation Reported as Number of Test Site With Different Erythema Score</title>
          <description>Evaluation of the test sites after irradiation used following scoring system: score 0=Normal skin; score 1=Faint, barely perceptible to moderate redness with poorly defined margins (not clinically significant); score 2=Moderate to intense redness with well defined margins; score 3=Redness plus well defined edema; score 4=Redness plus papules, vesicles, or ulceration. All four test sites were evaluated for gross changes according to the Erythemal Scoring Scale and if necessary the Additional Scoring system immediately before irradiation, 24 hours after irradiation, and 48 hours after irradiation (3 different time points), thus for each type of test site (i.e. treated irradiated test site), a total of 87 test sites with scores were collected (i.e., 29 participants *3 time points = 87 sites).</description>
