  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of superficial chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) of the lower limbs is&#xD;
      estimated at 18 million French people. The number of patients operated for varicose veins is&#xD;
      around 300,000 per year. Post-operative complications such as venous ulcer, venous thrombosis&#xD;
      and varicose vein rupture require a lot of medical care. Varicose veins are responsible for a&#xD;
      decrease in quality of life and represents 1 to 2% of total health expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, operating techniques tend towards minimally invasive procedures in order to&#xD;
      minimize the surgical trauma, improve patient comfort and reduce the time of postoperative&#xD;
      work stoppages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare two surgical techniques for the treatment of superficial chronic&#xD;
      venous insufficiency of the lower limbs : phlebectomy, the gold-standard technique, and&#xD;
      endovenous steam treatment. Several studies have already been carried out on endovenous steam&#xD;
      treatment for saphenous veins but none has been published concerning the tributary veins.The&#xD;
      main objective of INVOLVE is to assess the quality of life of patients 1 month after surgery.&#xD;
      Clinical improvement and economic impact will also be evaluated.&#xD;
