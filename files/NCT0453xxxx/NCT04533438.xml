      The purpose of this study is to compare the RhinAer procedure to treat tissue in the&#xD;
      posterior nasal nerve area to improve symptoms in adults diagnosed with chronic rhinitis with&#xD;
      a sham procedure that duplicates the actual procedure as closely as possible absent the&#xD;
      delivery of radiofrequency (RF) energy to the nasal tissue.&#xD;

    <measure>Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months visit following the study procedure.</time_frame>

The instrument consists of 14 questions across 5 domains (activity limitations (n=3), practical problems (n=2), nose symptoms (n=3), eye symptoms (n=3), and other symptoms (n=3)). Responses are based on a 1-week recall and provided on a 7-point scale:&#xD;
0 = not troubled&#xD;
1 = hardly troubled at all&#xD;
2 = somewhat troubled&#xD;
3 = moderately troubled&#xD;
4 = quite a bit troubled&#xD;
5 = very troubled&#xD;
6 = extremely troubled.&#xD;
The total or overall MiniRQLQ score is the mean of the 14 responses and the domain scores are the mean of the questions in each domain.</description>

    <description>The RhinAer procedure will be performed in the study clinic using the RhinAer Stylus and Aerin Console. The RhinAer Stylus is a disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency generating device. Participants will have the portion of the nasal cavity mucosa overlying the region of the posterior nasal nerve (the posterior middle meatus and posterior inferior turbinate) in both nostrils treated during a single study procedure session. Each nostril will be treated at 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 nonoverlapping positions depending on the size of the target treatment area. Treatment settings to be used are temperature 60 °C, power 4 watts, treatment time 12 seconds, and cooling time 0 seconds</description>
