  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rectal varices (RVs) are an important cause of lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) in portal&#xD;
      hypertension (PHT) and have been reported to occur in 44% to 89% of cases of cirrhosis. RVs&#xD;
      are dilated sub-mucosal porto-systemic communications which extend from mid rectum to the&#xD;
      ano-rectal junction and are considered distinct from internal hemorrhoids, which are&#xD;
      submucosal arterio-venous communications of the anorectal vascular plexus. The suspicion of&#xD;
      RVs as the cause of bleeding can be made with a high index of suspicion when lower GI bleed&#xD;
      is seen in absence of hemorrhoids, and colonoscopy shows blood in rectum. Bleeding usually&#xD;
      happens from endoscopically evident rectal varices (EERV) but sometimes bleed can occur from&#xD;
      varices, which are endoscopically in evident (EIERV). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been&#xD;
      shown to be more sensitive in diagnosis of EIERV. Endoscopic and EUS correlation of RVs has&#xD;
      shown that RVs, classified as tortuous, nodular, and tumorous on endoscopic examination, have&#xD;
      corresponding appearances on rectal EUS as single, multiple, and innumerable submucosal&#xD;
      veins, respectively. The hemodynamic evaluation (HDE) of RVs by EUS is routinely done at some&#xD;
      centers to assess parameters like the site, size, velocity, or direction of flow.&#xD;

      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the clinical, radiological, endoscopic and endoscopic-ultrasound features of&#xD;
      non-bleeding and bleeding rectal varices, among patients with portal hypertension.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical and liver -related risk-factors for presence of rectal varices (RV) among patients&#xD;
      with portal hypertension Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Etiological spectrum of bleeding per-rectum, among patients with PHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frequency of coexistence of hemorrhoids with RV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Distribution and size of variceal channels in the rectum on endoscopy and endoscopic&#xD;
           ultrasound (EUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Location and numbers of inflow and outflow perforator channels for RV on endoscopic&#xD;
           ultrasound (EUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with PHT (cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic), with active or prior anorectal bleeding&#xD;
      (defined later) in the preceding 6-months will be evaluated for inclusion. We will also&#xD;
      include patients with incidental detection of RV during endoscopy done for other indications.&#xD;
      We will include both indoor and outdoor patients, attending the Department of Hepatology,&#xD;
      ILBS, New Delhi. An informed consent will be obtained from the participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Cross- sectional, observational and descriptive study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period September 2020 to February 2020. Baseline data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following clinical, biochemical and radiological features will be recorded (detailed in&#xD;
      the proforma):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Liver disease etiology and severity, including Fibroscan and HVPG, where done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Upper endoscopy findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Details of prior bleeding episodes if any (upper and lower).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Details of current bleeding episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Radiological features (cirrhosis, splanchnic venous thrombosis, flow direction in portal&#xD;
           vein (PV) and its tributaries, inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) diameter, enlarged&#xD;
           para-rectal collateral circulation, large porto-systemic shunts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy procedure, as per the clinical&#xD;
      indication. Patients found to have RV will undergo EUS examination in addition. EUS&#xD;
      evaluation of patients with hemorrhoids alone will be done at the discretion of the examiner&#xD;
      after informed consent from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel preparation: Patient will be advised liquid-soft diet for 24 hours before the&#xD;
      examination day. Split dose PEG preparation (2-4 L volume) will be administered- 2L in&#xD;
      evening before and 2L on day of procedure till 4hours before the study scheduled time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient position: Left lateral position. Endoscopes: Colonoscope or gastroscope. EUS probes:&#xD;
      Radial and linear EUS scopes, paired with Olympus compact EUS processor EU-M2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operators: Procto-sigmoidoscopy: HS supervised by VB/ VB EUS: VB/ HS supervised by VB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower GI bleeding LGIB will be defined as bleeding from a source distal to the ileocecal&#xD;
      valve (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding Acute LGIB will be defined as bleeding of recent&#xD;
      duration (&lt;3 days) that may result in hemodynamic instability, anemia, and/or the need for&#xD;
      blood transfusion (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically significant lower gastrointestinal bleeding[VB1] Requirement for blood&#xD;
      transfusion, a hemoglobin drop of &gt; 3g/dL from baseline or need for hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bleeding episode is clinically significant when there is (BAVENO III[VB2] ):&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Transfusion requirement of ≥ 2 units of blood within 24 hours of time zero, 2. Systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg or a postural change of &gt;20 mmHg, 3. Pulse rate &gt;100/min at time&#xD;
      zero Anorectal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anorectal bleeding will be defined as red bleed per-rectum without or with stool&#xD;
           expulsion. In the latter instance it can be mixed with stools, may smear stool, may&#xD;
           dribble after defecation, or may smear wipes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anorectal bleeding may be painless or may be associated with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anorectal bleeding may or may not be associated with hemodynamic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
