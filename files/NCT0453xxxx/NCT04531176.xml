      This is a pragmatic, 24 month, single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial&#xD;
      comparing an obesity-centric approach with a medically-supervised and comprehensive weight&#xD;
      loss program (Cleveland Clinic's Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute's Integrated Weight&#xD;
      Management Program) augmented by AOMs, vs. an obesity-centric approach with a&#xD;
      medically-supervised and comprehensive weight loss program without AOMs, vs. the current&#xD;
      usual care approach to general health management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained. IRB approval of the study will be obtained. 300 subjects&#xD;
      (employees or spouses covered by our EHP) will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either an&#xD;
      obesity-centric approach with AOM therapy (N=100), an obesity-centric approach without AOM&#xD;
      therapy (N=100), or the current usual care approach to general health management (N=100).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects nearly 40% of adults in the US and it is responsible for important medical&#xD;
      problems including hypertension, dyslipidemia, T2D, depression, coronary heart disease,&#xD;
      stroke, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), fatty liver disease, and some cancers,&#xD;
      to name a few4,5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is responsible for the development of T2D and hypertension in more than 90% and 50%&#xD;
      of cases, respectively6-7. Also more than 70% of patients with obesity have dyslipidemia. The&#xD;
      prevalence of depression in patients with obesity is more than 50% and obesity is responsible&#xD;
      for causing osteoarthritis in more than 25% of the patients8. Also, in the adult population,&#xD;
      the prevalence of OSA is estimated to be ~25%, and as high as 45% in subjects with obesity9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with obesity have an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death. In&#xD;
      recognition of the biologic basis and seriousness of obesity, several professional health&#xD;
      associations and organizations worldwide recognize obesity as a disease10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though there is clear evidence in the literature that weight loss is associated with a&#xD;
      dramatic improvement of obesity-related comorbidities and the patient's quality of life, in&#xD;
      general, clinicians all over the world focus their attention on treating the diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia and other comorbidities rather than the obesity itself,&#xD;
      concentrating their efforts on improving blood glucose indices, blood pressure and LDL as&#xD;
      well as triglycerides, and in many instances, prescribing anti-diabetes and antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications that potentiate further weight gain11,12. As a result, clinicians are faced with&#xD;
      a rising epidemic of obesity, perpetuating a preexisting epidemic of diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is one of the biggest drivers of preventable chronic diseases and healthcare costs in&#xD;
      the United States. Currently, estimates for these costs are $210 billion per year. In&#xD;
      addition, obesity is associated with job absenteeism and with lower productivity while at&#xD;
      work costing approximately $4.3 billion annually12,13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a person's BMI increases, so do the number of sick days, medical claims and healthcare&#xD;
      costs. Individuals who suffer obesity spend 42% more on direct healthcare costs than adults&#xD;
      who have a healthy weight. Individuals with grade 1 obesity (BMI between 30 and 35) are more&#xD;
      than twice as likely as individuals with BMI &lt; 30 to be prescribed prescription&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals to manage medical conditions14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing obesity, improving nutrition, increasing physical activity, and making lifelong&#xD;
      meaningful lifestyle changes can help lower costs through fewer doctor's office visits,&#xD;
      tests, prescription drugs, sick days, emergency room visits and admissions to the hospital&#xD;
      and lower the risk for a wide range of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2008 study by the Urban Institute, The New York Academy of Medicine and Trust for America's&#xD;
      Health found that an investment of $10 per person in proven community-based programs to&#xD;
      increase physical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent smoking and other tobacco use&#xD;
      could save the country more than $16 billion annually within five years. That's a return of&#xD;
      $5.60 for every $1 invested15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of these important facts there is a significant, yet much-underutilized role, for&#xD;
      structured weight management programs, both with and without use of anti-obesity medications,&#xD;
      to improve metabolic control for patients with obesity who have developed comorbidities such&#xD;
      as hypertension hyperlipidemia and T2D. Unfortunately, these patients have a much higher risk&#xD;
      of developing coronary artery disease and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical literature contains ample evidence which demonstrates the positive impact that a&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention program augmented by FDA approved AOMs can have on anthropometric and&#xD;
      metabolic parameters in patients with obesity who have developed significant&#xD;
      comorbidities16-17. Lifestyle intervention, in the form of improving diet, eating behaviors&#xD;
      and increasing physical activity, is first-line treatment for obesity and overweight, but the&#xD;
      majority of people with obesity and overweight struggle to achieve and maintain their weight&#xD;
      loss long-term. We hypothesize that an obesity-centric approach delivered through a&#xD;
      medically-supervised and comprehensive weight loss program18, augmented by AOM, as the&#xD;
      primary treatment of patients with obesity and T2D, will result in greater and sustainable&#xD;
      weight loss, a better metabolic profile, (including glycemic blood pressure and cholesterol&#xD;
      control) and improved quality of life (QOL) and treatment satisfaction when compared to an&#xD;
      obesity-centric approach without AOM therapy or the current usual care/standard of care&#xD;
      comorbidity-centric approach to general health management in patients with obesity and T2D.&#xD;
      If confirmed, these findings would be expected to change our future approach to chronic&#xD;
      diseases management, and reduce the rates of T2D, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia related&#xD;
      complications (including heart disease and cancer) as well as the development of other&#xD;
      obesity-related comorbidities, potentially reducing the long-term cost of care&#xD;
