    <textblock>
      ROBOCOP is an open-label, randomized controlled feasibility trial comparing robotic-assisted&#xD;
      and open partial nephrectomy in preparation for a confirmative phase III randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical excision is the gold standard for the treatment for localized kidney cancer. An&#xD;
      organ-preserving procedure should be carried out whenever possible in order to maintain&#xD;
      kidney function. Partial nephrectomy can be performed through the conventional open technique&#xD;
      as well as through a robotic-assisted approach. Although both methods belong to the standard&#xD;
      care, there is still no published data from randomized controlled trials in the scientific&#xD;
      literature comparing them. The ROBOCOP-trial is designed as a single-center comparison of the&#xD;
      two surgical approaches in preparation for a phase III study. 50 patients are to be included&#xD;
      in the trial within a period of 15 months. The primary endpoint is feasibility of patient&#xD;
      recruitment. In addition, potential primary outcomes for a confirmative trial such as&#xD;
      perioperative complications, quality of life, inflammatory response, survival and ergonomic&#xD;
      aspects for the operating surgeons will be investigated.&#xD;
