  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRwNP) is an inflammatory disease of the nasal&#xD;
      mucosa. It is presented with severe stuffiness, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain, and&#xD;
      sleep disorders. It leads to severe inconvenience to social life and the quality of life. The&#xD;
      first step standard medical therapy consists of the topical intranasal or systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Surgery should be considered in the case of medical treatment failure.&#xD;
      However, the recurrences are common after both surgery and medical therapies in severe&#xD;
      disease and usually require revision surgeries or high dose corticosteroid regimens. On the&#xD;
      contrary, either the revision surgeries or the high dose corticosteroid therapies are not&#xD;
      capable of preventing the recurrences, treatment failures. Besides, revision surgeries&#xD;
      usually lead to high complication rates and high dose corticosteroids usually cause severe&#xD;
      adverse effects. The use of the short course topical intranasal corticosteroids after the&#xD;
      surgery is generally advocated for these patients. However, the recurrence rates are still&#xD;
      high. Hence a new and effective maintenance treatment algorithm with no severe adverse&#xD;
      effects is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the clinical trial is an estimated symptom recovery and superiority in both&#xD;
      efficacy and safety by the use of low-dose methylprednisolone or methotrexate as compared to&#xD;
      the standard maintenance therapy in treatment-resistant CRwNP patients. Therefore, the&#xD;
      results of the present study are believed to provide data on novel maintenance therapy and&#xD;
      suggest an alternative to the topical intranasal corticosteroids or the high-risk revision&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methotrexate, as an anti-inflammatory drug used in animal experiments, and low dose systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatments have recently been suggested for the treatment of the CRwNP.&#xD;
      Despite the several case reports of methotrexate being used for the severe and&#xD;
      treatment-resistant CRwNP, the literature is a lack of clinical trials. Likewise, low-dose&#xD;
      corticosteroid regimens have not been tested well contrary to the high dose corticosteroid&#xD;
      therapy in the same course of the disease. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare a low-dose of methylprednisolone or a low dose of methotrexate treatments with the&#xD;
      standard intranasal, topical corticosteroid treatment in human volunteers with medical and&#xD;
      surgical treatment-resistant CRwNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was planned as a randomized, controlled, triple armed, parallel, open-label&#xD;
      phase 2 clinical trial which is conducted in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Dokuz&#xD;
      Eylül University Hospital. Human volunteers with CRwNP who are resistant to the medical and&#xD;
      surgical therapies were recruited to the study. After randomization, the patients were&#xD;
      divided into three groups including 14 volunteers in each study groups and 13 in the control&#xD;
      group. One of the study groups was take methotrexate (n=14, eight weeks) and the other was&#xD;
      take methylprednisolone (n=14, eight weeks). Each patient were evaluated by endoscopic&#xD;
      examination, the nasal air-flow, the smell threshold, and the blood biochemistry both before&#xD;
      and after the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy goals of the study are located at below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary efficacy variable: Lund-Kennedy endoscopic grading system (NPS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary efficacy variables: Total visual analog scale (VAS) score; the Turkish version&#xD;
           of the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22); sum score of the peak nasal inspiratory flow&#xD;
           (PNIF) and butanol olfactory threshold test (BuOT) obtained from bilateral nasal&#xD;
           cavities; serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level; and the presence of peripheral&#xD;
           eosinophilia (PE, &gt; 500/mcl) in blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety goal of the study was evaluated by the examination of the adverse event reports and&#xD;
      the number of patients who experienced adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The normality of the continuous variables was evaluated by the Shapiro&#xD;
      Wilk test. Comparison of age was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
      Repeated measurements in three groups were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA for 3×3&#xD;
      model with a within and a between-subjects factor. The results were assessed with a 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval and at the p&lt;0.05 significance level.&#xD;
