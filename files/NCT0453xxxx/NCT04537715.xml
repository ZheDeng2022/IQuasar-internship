  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, multi-center, open-label, multi-dose, two-part PK and safety study to&#xD;
      characterize the DDI potential of oral Tazemetostat.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This two-part study is designed to characterize the steady-state PK of oral Tazemetostat and&#xD;
      its metabolite EPZ 6930 when administered as a single and twice daily dose in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced malignancies while taken alone or in combination with either itraconazole or&#xD;
      rifampin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Tazemetostat and Itraconazole Drug Interaction Part 1 of the study will evaluate the&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction between Tazemetostat and itraconazole in an open-label, fixed&#xD;
      sequential cross over design. Subjects in Cycle 1 of Part 1 will be treated for 39 days. On&#xD;
      Days 1, 15 and 36, a single oral dose of 400 mg Tazemetostat will be administered in the&#xD;
      morning. From Days 3 - 14 and 21 - 35, subjects will receive an oral 400 mg dose of&#xD;
      Tazemetostat twice daily (12 hours apart). From Days 18 - 38, a single dose of oral 200 mg&#xD;
      itraconazole will be administered daily in the morning after a meal, co-administered with&#xD;
      Tazemetostat when necessary. PK blood samples will be collected on Days 1 - 3, 15 - 18, 21 -&#xD;
      22, and 36 - 39. Sparse PK samples will be collected on Days 25, 28, 31, and 34.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Tazemetostat and Rifampin Drug Interaction Part 2 of the study will evaluate the&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction between Tazemetostat and rifampin in an open-label, fixed sequential&#xD;
      cross over design. Subjects in Cycle 1 of Part 2 will be treated for 26 days. On Days 1, 15&#xD;
      and 24, a single oral dose of 800 mg Tazemetostat will be administered in the morning. From&#xD;
      Days 3 - 14 and 17 - 23, subjects will receive an oral 800 mg dose of Tazemetostat twice&#xD;
      daily (12 hours apart). From Days 17 - 25, a single dose of oral 600 mg rifampin will be&#xD;
      administered daily in the morning one hour before a meal, co-administered with Tazemetostat&#xD;
      when necessary. PK blood samples will be collected on Days 1 - 3, 15 - 17 and 24 - 26. Sparse&#xD;
      PK samples will be collected on Days 19 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may discontinue from the study after completion of Cycle 1 or can continue treatment&#xD;
      (Cycle2+ onwards) with Tazemetostat at the recommended therapeutic dose of 800 mg twice daily&#xD;
      until Investigator-assessed clinical disease progression per standard practice, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study by the sponsor. All subjects who&#xD;
      receive the recommended therapeutic dose of 800 mg Tazemetostat twice daily for 9 Cycles or&#xD;
      longer, and are eligible to continue receiving Tazemetostat, will transfer to a Rollover&#xD;
      Study (EZH-501) for monitoring and continued study drug at the Investigator and Medical&#xD;
      Monitor's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both Parts 1 and 2, safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the subject's&#xD;
      participation. Subjects must have an end of study visit after 30 days of the last dose of&#xD;
      Tazemetostat for safety assessment.&#xD;

For subjects continuing Tazemetostat treatment at the recommended therapeutic dose (800 mg Tazemetostat twice daily [12 hours apart]), Cycle 2 will begin on day 27 (Cycle 2 Day 1) and each subsequent cycle from Cycle 2+ onwards will be of 28-day duration. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the subject's participation.</description>

&#xD;
             Note: Laboratory results obtained during screening should be used to determine&#xD;
             eligibility criteria. In situations where laboratory results are outside the permitted&#xD;
             range, the Investigator may retest the subject and the subsequent within range&#xD;
             screening result may be used to determine the subject's eligibility. Subjects may be&#xD;
             retested once within 2 weeks of the screening test. Samples must be reanalyzed at the&#xD;
             local laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able to swallow and retain orally-administered medication and without clinically&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Manual differential with no significant morphologic abnormalities on complete blood&#xD;
             count (CBC) testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Male subjects must refrain from donating sperm from first dose of Tazemetostat until 3&#xD;
             months following the last dose of Tazemetostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Be vasectomized, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Remain abstinent or use a condom starting at signing of informed consent until 3&#xD;
                  months following the last dose of study drug. The reliability of sexual&#xD;
                  abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial&#xD;
                  and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg,&#xD;
                  calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal&#xD;
                  are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Female partners of male subjects who are of childbearing potential must also adhere to&#xD;
             one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception&#xD;
                  plus an additional barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Progesterone-only oral contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the&#xD;
                  primary mode of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Female subjects of childbearing potential:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
                  contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year starting at&#xD;
                  least 7 days before the planned first dose of study drug until 6 months following&#xD;
                  the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established and proper use of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine&#xD;
                  devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Due to the potential of enzyme induction with Tazemetostat, female subjects who&#xD;
                  use hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of birth&#xD;
                  control while on study treatment and for 6 months after discontinuation of study&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, or&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subjects may take prophylactic antimicrobials, however subjects that are taking&#xD;
                  specific antimicrobial drugs where there may be drug-drug interaction or&#xD;
                  overlapping toxicities should be excluded from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subjects should be on established anti-retroviral therapy for at least 4 weeks,&#xD;
                  and have an HIV viral load of &lt; 400 copies/mL prior to enrollment.&#xD;
