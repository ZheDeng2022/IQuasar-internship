      Because of its simplicity, TLE may represent a more feasible approach for adolescents than&#xD;
      other caloric restriction regimens based on macronutrient composition and kilocalories. Our&#xD;
      preliminary data support TLE feasibility, acceptability, and safety in adolescents. However,&#xD;
      no trial to date has studied the effects of 8-hour TLE on glycemic control and body&#xD;
      composition in adolescents with T2D. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for&#xD;
      adolescents living with T2D by incorporating meal-timing behaviors as part of their medical&#xD;
      regimen early in diagnosis. We hypothesize that TLE (8-hr eating period/16-hr of daily&#xD;
      fasting) will minimize glycemic excursions, delay β-cell deterioration, and reduce body fat&#xD;
      mass in adolescents with T2D when compared to prolonged eating periods (12+hours).&#xD;
      One-hundred adolescents with T2D (aged 14-21 years), diagnosed within the last 6 months, with&#xD;
      a hemoglobin A1c &lt; 9%, and on Metformin monotherapy, will be recruited from Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Los Angeles. All participants will be randomized to one of two meal-timing schedules&#xD;
      to be followed for 12 weeks: (1) Control: &gt;12-hour eating or (2) TLE. We will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the effect of TLE on glucose control and β-cell function in youth with T2D. We&#xD;
      will measure (a) glycemic control with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to capture percent&#xD;
      time in range (%TIR) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and (b) β-cell function using the&#xD;
      insulinogenic index (IGI) after a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). We expect TLE to result&#xD;
      in greater increase in %TIR and IGI and decrease in HbA1c compared to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the effect of TLE on obesity and liver fat in youth with T2D. We will measure (a)&#xD;
      total body fat by DEXA scan and (b) liver fat fraction by liver MRI during the pre- and post-&#xD;
      intervention period. We expect TLE to result in a greater decrease in total body fat, and&#xD;
      liver fat than the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test the effect of TLE on sleep, physical activity, and dietary intake. We will&#xD;
      compare change in sleep, physical activity, and dietary intake between TLE and control.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be given at baseline and post intervention. The data generated will&#xD;
      explore how meal timing may influence occurrence, timing, and distribution of sleep and daily&#xD;
      movements as well as dietary intake and caloric distribution compared to control.&#xD;

      3.2. Overview of Proposed Study Design: We propose a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      testing the efficacy of TLE on glycemic control, β-cell function, and body composition among&#xD;
      adolescents with T2D. The implementation steps of the proposed RCT are as follows (See Table&#xD;
      3): (1) The staff will introduce the study to all eligible participants either in person or&#xD;
      virtually and consent interested families for the study; (2) All participants and their&#xD;
      families will complete baseline study surveys in REDcap; (3) All participants and their&#xD;
      families will receive training on the use and application of the Dexcom G6 CGM139, which is&#xD;
      FDA approved in patients 2 years and older. All equipment required for the duration of the&#xD;
      study will be distributed to the participants in-person. Participants will receive enough&#xD;
      sensors to wear the CGM daily for the entire study period. Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      change their sensor every 10 days with the assistance of the study staff. Each participant&#xD;
      will be asked to download the CGM app onto their personal smartphone and set up an account&#xD;
      with a pseudonym. (4) All participants and their families will receive standard nutritional&#xD;
      counseling and be randomized to one of two meal-timing schedules to be followed for 12 weeks:&#xD;
      (1) Control: &gt;12-hour eating or (2) TLE (8-hr eating period/16-hr of daily fasting). During&#xD;
      the eating window, participants will not be required to count calories or monitor their food&#xD;
      intake. Participants will choose and pay for their own food during the intervention. All&#xD;
      participants will record their eating window daily and submit it to the study staff via&#xD;
      REDcap. All participants will receive standard recommendations for physical activity, screen,&#xD;
      and sleep time as per the American Academy of Pediatrics age appropriate recommendations at&#xD;
      the first visit140; (5) The study staff will conduct study assessments with participants at&#xD;
      week -1, 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12; (6) The study staff will perform weekly phone encounters with&#xD;
      the participants to assess barriers to adherence and review the CGM data. If a barrier is&#xD;
      identified the study staff will create a solution plan to promote adherence and retention.&#xD;
      The study staff will record any medication changes or health issues that have occurred in the&#xD;
      last 7 days; (7) To further inform future trials and scalability we will continuously collect&#xD;
      recruitment, consent, and retention rates, and barriers to engagement; 9) Adverse Event&#xD;
      Monitoring (See Human Subject Protection Plan for full details) will be monitored. If at any&#xD;
      time, the study staff notices any unhealthy compensatory behaviors the PI will be notified&#xD;
      and a treatment plan will be created to ensure that the participant receive the appropriate&#xD;
      screening, work-up, and diagnosis from their primary care provider and are withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study if appropriate. (8) The PI and research team will meet bi-weekly to monitor all study&#xD;
      procedures and oversee data management and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: We will recruit 100 adolescents (age 14-21 years at enrollment, all gender&#xD;
      expressions) from clinical programs at CHLA. All adolescents newly diagnosed with T2D and&#xD;
      referred to the endocrinology clinic at CHLA will be screened. Inclusion criteria are: (1)&#xD;
      age 14-21 years; (2) Tanner stage III and above; (3) diagnosis of T2D based on the ADA&#xD;
      diagnostic guidelines48; (4) hemoglobin A1c &lt; 9% on Metformin monotherapy (based on the ADA&#xD;
      and International Society for Adolescent and Pediatric Diabetes recommendations. At CHLA we&#xD;
      currently recommend Metformin Monotherapy for any patients with HbA1c &lt;9% at onset and&#xD;
      therefore will use this cut off for the study);25 (5) participant and/or parent/guardian or&#xD;
      family member must have a personal smart phone that is CGM compatible; and (6) participant&#xD;
      must be willing and able to adhere to the assessments, visit schedules, and eating/fasting&#xD;
      periods. To limit confounding factors, individuals will be considered ineligible to&#xD;
      participate if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria: (1) previous diagnosis of&#xD;
      Prader-Willi Syndrome, brain tumor or hypothalamic obesity; (2) serious developmental or&#xD;
      intellectual disability; (3) previous diagnosis or subthreshold symptoms of an eating&#xD;
      disorder (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder); (4)&#xD;
      parent/guardian-reported physical, mental of other inability to participate in the&#xD;
      assessments (e.g., inability to wear CGM, inability to undergo imaging testing without&#xD;
      sedation); (5) previous or planned bariatric surgery; (6) current planned use of an&#xD;
      anti-obesity or other diabetes medication (e.g., phentermine, topiramate, orlistat,&#xD;
      glucagon-like-peptide-1 agonist, naltrexone, buproprion, SGLT-2 Inhibitor, insulin etc.); or&#xD;
      (7) current participation in other interventional weight loss studies. A random block&#xD;
      stratified randomization scheme will be used. Randomization tables will be first generated&#xD;
      using SAS and fed into the study REDCap database. Participants will be randomized 1:1 via&#xD;
      stratified, blocked randomization to ensure the groups are balanced in terms of number of&#xD;
      participants and distribution of potential confounding variables including sex and age. Block&#xD;
      size will be blinded from the PI performing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Feasibility of recruiting economically, racially, and ethnically diverse participants.&#xD;
      The high volume CHLA endocrinology clinic has seen 96 patients with new onset T2D (&gt; 14 to &lt;&#xD;
      21 years old) in the past year. Of those, 50 patients had an HbA1c &lt; 9.0% and would have been&#xD;
      eligible for the study. The demographics of our patient population are: mean age 16.9 years,&#xD;
      60% female, mean age of diagnosis 13.2 ± 2.3 years. Sixty-five percent of our patients&#xD;
      self-identify as Latinx, compared to 47.5% of the population in Los Angeles.141 At CHLA, we&#xD;
      have a long history of conducting investigator-initiated studies in youth with T2D, including&#xD;
      large consortium studies such as the Treatment of Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY)&#xD;
      trial16, SEARCH for diabetes in youth22 and Prevent Diabetes Consortium (PDC). 50 At CHLA,&#xD;
      the recruitment rate in this population is between 50-60% with a retention rate of 60-80%.&#xD;
      Based on our recruitment history in adolescents with T2D, we anticipate a consent rate of&#xD;
      50-60%, retention rate of 75-80%, and recruitment of 30 adolescents per year to reach our&#xD;
      target recruitment of 100 adolescents by year 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Retention strategies. Each participant, regardless of which group they are randomized&#xD;
      to, will receive compensation in the form of gift cards. Participants will receive $50 at&#xD;
      each study visit they attend (5 visits for a total of $250 per participant).&#xD;
      Parents/guardians/family members will also receive $20 gift card for each study visit they&#xD;
      attend for a total of $100 for participation in the study to account for time and effort&#xD;
      required to support their participant. Parking validation will be provided. All families who&#xD;
      do not have a car will be offered free ride-sharing transportation to- and from study visits&#xD;
      upon request. To foster treatment adherence, participants will receive weekly calls from the&#xD;
      study staff for the duration of the trial. Counseling will be conducted by trained research&#xD;
      staff. The sessions will serve three purposes: (1) foster adherence, retention, and&#xD;
      accountability; (2) troubleshoot intervention barriers; and (3) monitor safety endpoints.&#xD;
      During the sessions, participants will be provided with the support, knowledge, skills, and&#xD;
      resources they need to successfully adhere to the protocol. The research staff will analyze&#xD;
      the adherence data and progress using multiple-pass methodology. To support participants, the&#xD;
      staff will use behavioral techniques, such as stimulus control, goal setting, behavioral&#xD;
      contracting, and motivational interviewing. In addition, the staff will assist participants&#xD;
      in troubleshooting any adherence issues and give participants additional encouragement and&#xD;
      support when adherence problems arise. If a participant adheres to meal timing protocol &lt; 4&#xD;
      days/week, a follow-up call or videoconference will be scheduled to address challenges and to&#xD;
      counsel participants. Furthermore, In order to reduce participant burden, if at all possible&#xD;
      study procedures will be scheduled to coincide with participants' scheduled clinical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5. Intervention Arms: Dietary counseling (all participants): All participants will attend&#xD;
      the new onset T2D education curriculum delivered at CHLA. The dietary counseling is modelled&#xD;
      after the Healthy Eating through Reduction of Excess Sugar (HEROES) intervention (NIH R01&#xD;
      MD010358-A1), which is currently used by Dr. Michael Goran's team at CHLA as a method to&#xD;
      reduce added sugar intake in diets for youth with obesity and fatty liver disease. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of recommendations for low added sugar and a moderate&#xD;
      carbohydrate-controlled daily diet. No specific caloric restriction will be recommended, and&#xD;
      participants will not be required to keep logs of daily consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-Limited Eating (TLE): The TLE intervention arm will involve instructing participants to&#xD;
      only eat from 11 AM to 7 PM. We conducted a cross sectional analysis of a cohort of 100&#xD;
      adolescents with obesity and found that most total calories, carbohydrates, and added sugars&#xD;
      were consumed between 11 AM and 7 PM.42 Therefore, to align with the normal developmental&#xD;
      eating patterns seen in adolescents, we will implement an afternoon TLE approach.&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to consume non-caloric beverages (water, tea, coffee) during the&#xD;
      fasting period. No energy restriction will be required. All participants will be asked to&#xD;
      record their eating times daily and submit to the study team via REDcap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: The control arm will have no mealtime restrictions on eating. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to consume food over a 12-hour or more eating window without mealtime schedule. No&#xD;
      energy restriction will be required. All participants will be asked to record their eating&#xD;
      windows daily and submit to the study staff via REDcap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise: No structured exercise intervention will be included. However, regular physical&#xD;
      activity is encouraged, consistent with the guidelines for T2D management in youth.142&#xD;
      Participants will complete a Physical Activity Questionnaire over the study period to monitor&#xD;
      the impact of TLE on physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6. Measurements: The study team will conduct all assessments at week -1, 0, 4, 8 and 12.&#xD;
      All data will be collected and stored in REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the effect of TLE on glucose control and β-cell function in youth with T2D. We&#xD;
      will measure (a) glycemic control by using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to capture&#xD;
      percent time in range (%TIR) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and (b) β-cell function using the&#xD;
      insulinogenic index (IGI) after a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantifying glycemic control (%TIR): Using a Dexcom G6 CGM, FDA approved in patients 2 years&#xD;
      and older, we will capture glucose readings every 5 minutes and obtain the weekly %TIR&#xD;
      (defined as glucose levels from 70 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL142) over the course of the study. CGM&#xD;
      provides robust data about change in glycemic control in response to an intervention by&#xD;
      capturing frequent glucose trends throughout the day in response to all daily activities. and&#xD;
      has been shown to have a good correlation with HbA1c measures.143 Vigersky et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that a 10% change in the %TIR is equivalent to a 0.8% change in HbA1c. 143&#xD;
      Hemoglobin A1c: HbA1c will be collected via venous blood draw at the CHLA laboratory at week&#xD;
      1 and 12. HbA1c will be measured using a DCA 2000 (Bayer Corporation, Elkhart, IN) and&#xD;
      compared pre- and post- intervention between TLE and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantifying change in β-cell function: Change in IGI after MMTT: The MMTT provides a&#xD;
      simultaneous estimate of insulin secretion and sensitivity.143-148 To improve participant&#xD;
      burden and decrease project cost, the modified MMTT will be utilized. Previous adult TLE&#xD;
      trials have utilized the IGI as a surrogate marker of β-cell function in TLE trials.66&#xD;
      Therefore, we will evaluate the effect of TLE on changes in IGI measured after MMTT. The MMTT&#xD;
      will be performed at weeks 0 and 12. Participants will be instructed to not take their&#xD;
      Metformin for 48 hours prior to their MMTT. Following baseline sampling (0 min), a test meal&#xD;
      (470 kcal, ∼66% carbohydrate, 18% fat, and 16% protein) composed of one 8-fluid-ounce Boost&#xD;
      nutrition supplement drink (Nestlé Health Science) and one Power Bar (Nestlé Nutrition) will&#xD;
      be administered. The meal will be consumed within 10 min and repeat sampling will be&#xD;
      performed at 0, 30, 60-, 90- and 120- minutes post-meal for C-peptide, glucose and insulin&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Consideration (For Full Plan See Statistical Analysis Section in Human Subject&#xD;
      Research): The sample size estimates, and analytical plans were developed under the guidance&#xD;
      of Dr. Ramon Durazo-Arvizu from the Biostatistics core at TSRI. Descriptive statistics,&#xD;
      including graphical depictions, will be utilized to assess the degree of symmetry/normality&#xD;
      of continuous outcomes and identification of outliers. A ladder of powers approach will be&#xD;
      applied to identify the best easy-to-interpret transformation of the outcome variable.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be implemented with and without transformations in addition to&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed models, when appropriate. All regression models will be adjusted for&#xD;
      baseline of outcome levels, as this adjustment increases power (reduces required sample&#xD;
      size).149,150 A false discovery rate (FDR)151 approach will be applied to assess the effect&#xD;
      of multiple testing. An FDR of 10% or higher will be used given the pilot nature of the&#xD;
      study. Statistical analyses will be performed using STATA 17.0(STATA Corp, College Station,&#xD;
      TX). Graphs will be generated using the R package ggplot2, STATA and PRISM and will include&#xD;
      mean, SD or SEM and Confidence interval (CI) for change data. The study is designed to&#xD;
      compare the average primary outcomes (%TIR, HbA1c, IGI, and Total Body Fat Mass) over time as&#xD;
      well as marker change from baseline (week 0) to end of the study (week 12) between&#xD;
      intervention groups (TLE vs. control). Study participant's drop-out in clinical trials is a&#xD;
      prevalent problem, which results in missing data. Statistical analyses will be crafted under&#xD;
      three different mechanisms, namely missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random&#xD;
      (MAR), and other missing data patterns.152-155 Our first approach to statistical analysis&#xD;
      with missing data will follow common practice, such as last value carried forward, and&#xD;
      multiple imputations.156-159 Last value carried forward and multiple imputation will be&#xD;
      carried out to generate complete data prior to analyzing data under the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle. A per-protocol analysis will also be performed and compared to results obtained&#xD;
      under the intention-to-treat approach. 160 Statistical Considerations: No studies in the&#xD;
      literature specifically addressed all our aims. Nevertheless, we were able to extract&#xD;
      reasonable effect size information from several intervention-based studies, including some&#xD;
      TLE studies conducted in adults.6,8,9,66,161 The primary outcomes for Aim 1 are the&#xD;
      difference between TLE and control in: a) average %TIR overtime, b) HbA1c at week 12 compared&#xD;
      to baseline, and c) average IGI after MMTT at week 12 compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percent Time in Range(%TIR): Statistical Analysis Plan. Average %TIR will be extracted&#xD;
           from the CGM data for the 7-day period prior to the study visit point and assessed at&#xD;
           week 0, 4, 8, and 12. A sequential analysis plan will be executed starting with&#xD;
           graphical depictions of %TIR distributions at baseline and 12 weeks followed by&#xD;
           model-based approaches that make use of all information collected. This approach&#xD;
           facilitates interpretations of study findings. 1) Descriptive statistics, such as means&#xD;
           (confidence intervals), histograms, Box plots of %TIR will be constructed by group; 2) A&#xD;
           two-sample t-test used to compare average %TIR between TLE and control groups, followed&#xD;
           by ANCOVA (multivariable linear regression) to adjust for baseline (week 0) %TIR values&#xD;
           and other unbalanced variables; 3) A change variable (%TIR at week 12 minus %TIR at week&#xD;
           0) will be generated for each study participant and average values adjusted for baseline&#xD;
           %TIR and confounders compared via multivariable linear regression; 4) The previous&#xD;
           analysis techniques do not take full advantage of the repeated measures in each&#xD;
           individual. A linear mixed effect model with random intercept (LME) adjusting for&#xD;
           baseline and confounding factors will be fit to compare the two treatment arms.&#xD;
           Power/Sample Size Justification. No preliminary data was available of the effect of TLE&#xD;
           in youth with T2D on %TIR so effect size estimates were drawn from adult data on the&#xD;
           impact of nutrition intervention on %TIR and based on a minimum effect size equal to the&#xD;
           difference between the two groups divided by the SD (Cohen's d). Extracting from adult&#xD;
           data, and data from youth with type 1 diabetes, a change in %TIR of greater than 5% is&#xD;
           considered clinically significant, this correlates with an estimated change in HbA1c of&#xD;
           -0.4%. Because we targeted improvements in %TIR, a one-sided at a 5% significance level&#xD;
           to detect a benefit of TLE compared to control was used for each comparison, with a&#xD;
           conservative within-subject correlation of 0.6 (spherical variance-covariance matrix).&#xD;
           The required sample size to detect a pre-specified effect size (Cohen's d = difference&#xD;
           in means in standard deviation units) of 0.34 with 80% power using an LME models&#xD;
           (adjusting for baseline %TIR) with four %TIR determinations at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12&#xD;
           results in 40 subjects per group (80 total).162 A 20% attrition rate was observed in our&#xD;
           preliminary data collected from our pilot study of TLE in adolescents. The&#xD;
           attrition-adjusted total sample size is 100 (80/0.8) participants. Furthermore, data&#xD;
           extracted from adult studies suggests that the standard deviation of %TIR is between 16&#xD;
           and 25%.143 Thus, a 0.34 effect size and a standard deviation of about 20% (midpoint&#xD;
           between 16 and 25) amounts to a difference in %TIR of about 6.8% (0.34*20% = 6.8%). We&#xD;
           will seek to decrease attrition using the experienced gained and by following study&#xD;
           participants even after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in HbA1c: Statistical Analysis Plan. As above a sequential analysis approach will&#xD;
           be implemented. Graphical and numerical depictions of data by intervention arm first,&#xD;
           followed by a two-sample, one sided, 5%-significance t-test (equivalent to simple linear&#xD;
           regression) to assess difference in HbA1c from baseline to week 12 between TLE and&#xD;
           control. Power/Sample Size Justification. Calculations are based on the latter model.&#xD;
           Carter et al. examined the impact of intermittent energy restriction compared to&#xD;
           continuous energy restriction in adults with T2D and found that there was a between&#xD;
           group difference of -0.2% with an SD of 0.1%.14 On the other hand, Toledo-Corral, et.&#xD;
           al., estimate the mean and standard deviation of HbA1c among children aged 8-17 years of&#xD;
           about 5.75% and 0.2%, respectively.163 An application of a one-sided, two-sample,&#xD;
           5%-significance t-test with 50 participants per intervention group (40 prior to&#xD;
           attrition adjustment) will detect an effect size (mean HbA1c change) of -0.12% with 85%&#xD;
           power, assuming a correlation between week 0 and week 12 HbA1c determinations of about&#xD;
           0.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Insulinogenic Index after MMTT: Statistical Analysis Plan. To evaluate the difference in&#xD;
           β-cell function between TLE and control we will measure the difference in IGI change&#xD;
           following MMTT at week 12 compared to baseline utilizing a two-sample, one-sided,&#xD;
           5%-significance t-test (special case of simple linear regression). A multivariate linear&#xD;
           regression model will be fit to the data to compare mean IGI change adjusting potential&#xD;
           confounders (unbalanced baseline variables), including baseline IGI values. Power/Sample&#xD;
           Size Justification. A recent pilot study of TLE in an adult cohort without diabetes,&#xD;
           showed TLE increased the IGI by 14 ± 7 U/mg compared to control at week 6 compared to&#xD;
           baseline.66 A total sample size of 100 participants (80 before adjusting for attrition)&#xD;
           will thus detect a difference in IGI change of 4.2 with 85% power using the&#xD;
           5%-significance, one-sided, two-sample t-test. Additional power is gained by adjusting&#xD;
           for baseline IGI and unbalanced participant characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the effect of TLE on obesity and liver fat in recently diagnosed youth with T2D.&#xD;
      We will measure total body fat by DEXA scan and liver fat fraction by liver MRI-PDFF pre- and&#xD;
      post- intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of body composition: Total Body Fat: Using a Hologic QDR 5400 densitometer&#xD;
      (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA) DEXA scan, we will measure the change in TBF at week 12 compared&#xD;
      to baseline between TLE and control. Liver Fat Fraction: Change in liver fat will be measured&#xD;
      by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Participants will&#xD;
      undergo MRI screening examinations at baseline and week 12 using an advanced magnitude-based&#xD;
      spoiled-gradient-echo MRI-PDFF estimation technique previously validated to measure hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis in children.164-168 Key MRI-PDFF scanning parameters will be: 3T MRI scanner (GE 3T&#xD;
      750, and Siemens 3T TrioTim), 2D axial spoiled-gradient-echo breath hold acquisitions, TR &gt;&#xD;
      100 ms, six TE values evenly spaced from 1.15 to 6.9 ms, flip angle 10 degrees, number&#xD;
      frequency-encoding steps between 140 and 192, number phase-encoding steps between 128 and&#xD;
      140, no filters, no saturation, slice thickness 6 to 10 mm (contiguous), and rectangular&#xD;
      field-of-view to accommodate body habitus. 164&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Consideration: Statistical Analysis Plan. We will utilize multivariate linear&#xD;
      regression model to adjust for potentially unbalanced variables across group, in particular&#xD;
      baseline values. Power/Sample Size Justification. A recent systematic review of the impact of&#xD;
      TLE on cardiometabolic outcomes, showed that in adults TLE has variable effect on total body&#xD;
      fat mass with some studies showing a decrease of up to 4 kg compared to control and others&#xD;
      showing no change in TBF and liver fat fraction compared to control.134,137,169 A previous&#xD;
      study estimated the mean and standard deviation of Liver Fat (HFF) among children 18 and&#xD;
      younger is about 8 and 8, respectively. A one-sided, two-sample, 5%-significance t-test will&#xD;
      detect a difference in liver fat as large as 3.25 with 81% power, adjusting for baseline&#xD;
      values, with 50 children per treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test the effect of TLE on sleep, physical activity, and dietary intake. We will&#xD;
      compare change in sleep, physical activity, and dietary intake between TLE and control.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be given at baseline and post intervention. The data generated will&#xD;
      explore how meal timing may influence occurrence, timing, and distribution of sleep and daily&#xD;
      movements as well as dietary intake and caloric distribution compared to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Nutrient Data System Recall (NDSR) 24 Hour Dietary Recall45:&#xD;
      Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls will be conducted for all participants pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention. One weekday and one weekend day will be collected for all participants.&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)170-175: The International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) has been developed to estimate levels of habitual physical&#xD;
      activity across different countries and socio-cultural environments and will be collected at&#xD;
      5 time points.6 Munich Chronotype Questionnaire for children and adolescents (MTCQ)176,177:&#xD;
      The Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) is a self-rated scale to assess sleep structure,&#xD;
      patterns, duration, and quality and will be collected at 5 time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Consideration: Statistical Analysis Plan. All outcome variables (sleep, physical&#xD;
      activity, and dietary intake) will be treated as continuous. The ladder of transformations&#xD;
      approach156,157will be implemented to improve symmetry and/or approximate normality of their&#xD;
      distribution. The analysis will follow the sequential approach suggested for Aims 1 and 2. We&#xD;
      will take advantage of the within-person correlation (assumed to be about 0.6) to improve&#xD;
      efficiency of variance estimators. Furthermore, all comparisons between the TLE and control&#xD;
      arms will control for baseline values. Should randomization be imperfect for some variables,&#xD;
      the multivariate regression model will be adjusted. The study was not powered to assess&#xD;
      mediation or moderation of each secondary outcome; however, we will estimate direct and&#xD;
      indirect effects of the interaction between the outcomes. Power/Sample Size Justification.&#xD;
      Given the estimated sample size, and desired statistical power, the minimal effect size&#xD;
      (Cohen's d) is estimated, under the assumption of 0.6 correlation of each of the outcome&#xD;
      variables between baseline (week 0) and follow-up (week 12). A 5%-significance, one-sided,&#xD;
      two-sample t-test with the operating characteristics describe above will detect an effect&#xD;
      size as large as 0.5 (mean difference in standard deviation units). As an alternative to&#xD;
      hypothesis testing, we will determine 95% confidence intervals in response to the&#xD;
      interventions that will provide evidence worthy of further investigation in adolescents with&#xD;
      T2D. Additional Considerations: Many authors have argued that the use of &quot;significance&#xD;
      testing&quot; of hypothesis does not fully address the scientific research questions. Instead, the&#xD;
      use of confidence intervals has been advocated for the assessment these questions.178-181&#xD;
      Confidence intervals not only allow for a better interpretation of effect estimates and their&#xD;
      variability but could also be used to discriminate between group differences. Although&#xD;
      results from this study will be evaluated using traditional techniques, such as p-values, we&#xD;
      will rely on interpretation via confidence intervals. As a result, parameter estimates (e.g.,&#xD;
      mean difference, change and trends) will be used to aid scientific reasoning.178 Potential&#xD;
      Challenges and Alternative Approaches: 1) Recruitment: The CHLA T2D cohort is predominantly&#xD;
      Latinx. We considered using a recruitment strategy to ensure balanced proportion of ethnic&#xD;
      groups. However, given the population of Los Angeles in general and those served at CHLA, we&#xD;
      opted to recruit all interested participants who met eligibility criteria. This approach will&#xD;
      provide the opportunity to conduct our research with minority populations and improve my&#xD;
      cross-cultural sensitivity and research approach; 2) Study Design: a) We considered including&#xD;
      a group not on Metformin; however, robust literature exists that describes the natural&#xD;
      trajectory of T2D disease progression in untreated adolescents.52,56,57,59-62,74,182&#xD;
      Therefore, it did not appear ethically appropriate. b) We considered a more robust crossover&#xD;
      design. However, given the behavioral components of the approach, we believed there was a&#xD;
      high risk of contamination and bias that would be unable to be separated appropriately&#xD;
      between TLE and control. c) Ensuring difference in eating windows between groups. We&#xD;
      acknowledge that habitual eating windows for adolescents may be intrinsically condensed due&#xD;
      to shifting chronobiology leading to staying up late and waking up late.42 To overcome this,&#xD;
      we will request the control group consume their meals over a 12+hour period and have all&#xD;
      participants report their eating windows to confirm the between group difference. 3)&#xD;
      Assessment: β-cell function: The hyperglycemic clamp and FSIGT have been the most widely&#xD;
      reported and acceptable methods to evaluate β-cell function. However, given this is a limited&#xD;
      resources proposal in adolescents, we elected to utilize the modified MMTT procedure, which&#xD;
      is both more cost- effective and tolerable for pediatric participants.&#xD;

    <description>This intervention arm will involve TLE, in which participants are instructed to only eat from 11 AM to 7 PM. Therefore, to align with the normal developmental eating patterns seen in adolescents, we will implement an afternoon/evening-based TLE approach. Participants will be allowed to consume non-caloric beverages (water, tea, coffee) during the fasting period. No energy restriction will be used, but participants will be given the low added sugar/carbohydrate guidelines described above.
