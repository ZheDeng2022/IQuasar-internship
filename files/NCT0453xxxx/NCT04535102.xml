  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter, open-label study of polatuzumab vedotin administered by IV&#xD;
      infusion in combination with standard doses of bendamustine (B) and rituximab (R) in&#xD;
      transplant-eligible patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. A total of 22 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled over a period of 2 years through the University of Colorado and additional study&#xD;
      sites if applicable. Study treatment will be given in 21-day cycles for patients with DLBCL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first day of treatment will constitute Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients will be treated with a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 cycles to upto a maximum six cycles to optimize response prior to ASCT per&#xD;
      investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated for safety and efficacy according to the schedules of&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed for response to treatment by the investigator with the use of&#xD;
      standard criteria according to the Modified Lugano Response Criteria (Cheson et al. 2014; see&#xD;
      Appendix 3) at screening and at the following timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of primary response assessment, 3 weeks after completion of study treatment&#xD;
           (i.e., 3 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 3 or after last dose of study medication)) Imaging&#xD;
           at these timepoints must include FDG-PET (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission&#xD;
           tomography) and a diagnostic-quality CT scan with both oral and IV contrast. A combined&#xD;
           PET/CT scan is encouraged if feasible. CT scans with oral and IV contrast should include&#xD;
           neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvic scans. In patients for whom contrast is&#xD;
           contraindicated, (e.g., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance or&#xD;
           patient denial), PET-CT scans without contrast are permitted so long as they permit&#xD;
           consistent and precise measurement of target lesions during the study treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be evaluated every 3 months for 2 years, or until disease progression,&#xD;
      death, withdrawal of consent, or initiation of another anti-cancer therapy. Tumor assessments&#xD;
      should also be performed to confirm clinical suspicion of relapse or disease progression for&#xD;
      documentation. The study will end when all patients enrolled have been followed until death,&#xD;
      have withdrawn consent, have been lost to follow-up, until 2-year follow up, or the Sponsor&#xD;
      decides to end the trial, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the last patient enrolls and undergoes EOT PET-CT assessment, primary endpoint data and&#xD;
      interim survival analysis will be evaluated and published/presented at meetings. Subsequent&#xD;
      survival analysis will be published post 2-yr follow-up&#xD;

&#xD;
             agreement to remain abstinent or to use single highly effective or combined&#xD;
             contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the&#xD;
             treatment period and for ≥ 12 months after the last dose of rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                  methods of contraception.&#xD;

                  established, proper use of combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and&#xD;
                  certain intrauterine devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier&#xD;
                  methods such as a condom and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure&#xD;
                  rate of &lt; 1% per year. Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use&#xD;

             days prior to commencement of dosing. Women who are considered not to be of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are not required to have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. For men, agreement to remain abstinent or to use a condom plus an additional&#xD;
             contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during&#xD;
             the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug and&#xD;
             agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men with a pregnant partner must agree to remain abstinent or to use a condom for&#xD;
                  the duration of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                  methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before&#xD;
                  treatment with polatuzumab vedotin.&#xD;
