  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of delivering an 8-week Mediterranean Diet&#xD;
      intervention as well as the intervention's preliminary efficacy on cancer-related fatigue&#xD;
      among patients undergoing chemotherapy, compared to usual care. In the first 4 weeks of the&#xD;
      intervention, we will provide the participants with food and educate them on the principles&#xD;
      and components of the Mediterranean Diet, while in the second 4 weeks participants will&#xD;
      prepare their own food. In addition, we will evaluate changes in metabolism and mitochondrial&#xD;
      function during 4 weeks of chemotherapy and determine how adherence to a Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      modulates these changes during these 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the intervention will promote adherence to the Mediterranean Diet. The&#xD;
      second hypothesis is that adherence will be associated with alleviation of fatigue and&#xD;
      improvements in metabolic and mitochondrial function.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the Mediterranean Diet arm are asked to follow a Mediterranean Diet for 8 weeks. The diet is ad libitum. A combination of fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable meals are provided for the first 4 weeks. Also during the first 4 weeks, participants receive an education session to discuss how to effectively implement a Mediterranean Diet into their daily routine.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Usual care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the usual care are will complete all the same study assessments as those in the intervention group. They will not receive any specific dietary advice, but they will be permitted to seek dietary advice outside the study. Data from this group are indispensable in understanding the nutritional habits and preferences of patients undergoing chemotherapy, and these data will be used to optimize nutritional interventions in future studies. At the end of the 8-week intervention, the participants in the usual care group will be provided the intervention materials gratis, including one-week of Mediterranean Diet food and education materials.</description>
