  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several open-label trials have shown the therapeutic promise of deep brain stimulation (DBS)&#xD;
      targeted to striatal and surrounding capsular areas in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).&#xD;
      However, the results of placebo-controlled trials have been mixed, with one showing a large&#xD;
      difference between active and sham DBS and another finding no difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aim of this study is establishing whether active DBS results in more treatment&#xD;
      responders than sham DBS. Secondary aims are establishing an adverse events profile,&#xD;
      establishing effects on quality of life,neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures, and&#xD;
      finding predictors of response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, with an estimated&#xD;
      lifetime prevalence of 14.6% across high-income countries.Effective therapeutic options for&#xD;
      MDD include psychotherapy, different classes of antidepressants, and electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy (ECT). Nevertheless, up to 30% of patients do not respond to four consecutive&#xD;
      antidepressant strategies and 52% of pharmacotherapy resistant patients do not respond to&#xD;
      ECT.Such patients are designated an advanced stage of Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD),&#xD;
      which is associated with more hospitalizations, more suicide attempts, and higher costs than&#xD;
      non-TRD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapeutic option for TRD patients. DBS consists&#xD;
      of implanting electrodes in specific brain areas and then optimizing stimulation parameters&#xD;
      (e.g. voltage, frequency, pulse width) to modulate brain activity of the targeted area. Since&#xD;
      2005, several open label trials have reported promising effects of DBS in TRD, targeting&#xD;
      different brain structures involved in the neurobiology of MDD: the Subcallosal Cingulate&#xD;
      Gyrus (SCG),Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB),Ventral Capsule/Ventral Striatum (VC/VS), and&#xD;
      Nucleus Accumbens (NAc). Response rates, defined as a symptom decrease of at least 50%, range&#xD;
      from 30% to 90% with most studies finding a response rate around 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, results of the first two randomized trials are mixed. The first randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) of VC/VS DBS in TRD did not find differences in response rates&#xD;
      following active (3 of 14 patients) or sham stimulation (2 of 15 patients) after four months&#xD;
      of stimulation. In contrast, our group found a strong antidepressant effect in 16 patients&#xD;
      with TRD following active ventral Anterior Limb of the Internal Capsule (vALIC) DBS compared&#xD;
      to sham stimulation in a randomized crossover phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this trial aims to establishing whether active DBS results in more treatment&#xD;
      responders than sham DBS. Secondary aims are establishing an adverse events profile,&#xD;
      establishing effects on quality of life,neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures, and&#xD;
      finding predictors of response.&#xD;
