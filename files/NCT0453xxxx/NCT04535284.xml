  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of people with stroke experience strain that can reduce their quality of life.&#xD;
      Caregivers are routinely engaged during hospital discharge for education and training related&#xD;
      to the person with stroke. However, the critical period after stroke survivor's discharge is&#xD;
      largely unsupported for the caregiver. This proposed study is a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      that will provide post-discharge support for caregivers using a health coaching program as&#xD;
      compared to usual care and examine its effect of caregivers and people with stroke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Caregiver strain reduces quality of life and can increase the chance of unplanned hospital&#xD;
      readmission for the person with stroke. Caregivers are routinely engaged during hospital&#xD;
      discharge for education and training. However, the critical period after discharge is largely&#xD;
      unsupported. The proposed research will integrate occupational therapy and telehealth to&#xD;
      provide a post-discharge, caregiver-focused program, the &quot;Health Coaching-in-Context&quot; that&#xD;
      consists of up to 10 sessions, arranged once-a-week or multiple times a week based on&#xD;
      convenience of scheduling for up to 10 weeks. The program targets improved caregiver health&#xD;
      and reduction in readmissions for stroke survivor. The study aims to examine the effects of&#xD;
      the coaching program for caregivers as compared to usual care and evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      study design. A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted with two parallel groups,&#xD;
      &quot;Health Coaching-in-Context&quot; and usual care. A sample of up to 40 pairs, including up to 40&#xD;
      stroke survivors and their respective 40 caregivers will be recruited from University&#xD;
      hospitals and randomly assigned after consenting. The occupational therapist, unaware of the&#xD;
      group assignment, will administer assessments before and after the intervention, and at&#xD;
      4-week follow-up. Data will be collected on general information, readmissions, performance,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and quality of life.&#xD;
