  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The malaise of the infant represents a polymorphic pathology in its clinical presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the young age of the patients concerned and the parental anxiety generated, hospital&#xD;
      management is necessary, for clinical and paraclinical evaluation and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice of complementary examinations is guided by personal and family history, and the&#xD;
      precise description of the discomfort as well as clinical examination of the child and&#xD;
      assessment of his vital parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in view of the particular terrain represented by infants under one year of age, a&#xD;
      number of tests are carried out systematically, and therefore empirically, because they are&#xD;
      not guided by the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These various tests can be invasive, anxiety-provoking for parents and generate a significant&#xD;
      additional cost during hospital management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of the indication and interest of these tests is necessary in order to propose&#xD;
      a homogeneous clinical and paraclinical management of the discomfort of the infant, in&#xD;
      particular of discomforts of type BRUE (Brief Resolved Unexplained Events), as described in&#xD;
      the 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations.&#xD;
