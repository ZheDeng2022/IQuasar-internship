  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PICC related venous thrombosis (PICC-RVT) is one of the common complications of PICC and the&#xD;
      main cause of unplanned extubation. Effectively identifying the risk of PICC-RVT in patients&#xD;
      and preventing PICC-RVT are of great clinical significance. There are many studies on the&#xD;
      risk factors of VTE at home and abroad, and there are also many studies on the risk&#xD;
      assessment of PICC catheter-related thrombosis, mostly focusing on sociodemographic data,&#xD;
      comorbidities, and intubation related factors, while the research on laboratory related&#xD;
      indicators is limited It involves D-dimer, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count&#xD;
      (PLT), etc., but its specificity or positive predictive value is not high, and there is no&#xD;
      reliable biomarker report. Studies have shown that the decrease or lack of AT-Ⅲ, PC, PS&#xD;
      activity is one of the mechanisms of hypercoagulable state in patients with cancer, and may&#xD;
      be a biomarker of thrombosis. Many retrospective studies have also shown that the activities&#xD;
      of AT-Ⅲ, PC, and PS are related to the occurrence and recurrence of VTE and DVT. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis is mainly anticoagulant protein defect or decreased expression. However, when&#xD;
      PICC is implanted in patients with AT-Ⅲ, PC and PS activity defects, whether PICC indwelling&#xD;
      will become a predisposing factor of thrombosis is not yet known. Therefore, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to understand the rate of anticoagulant protein deficiency in patients with&#xD;
      tumor PICC-RVT, and to prospectively explore the correlation between the lack of AT-Ⅲ, PC,&#xD;
      and PS activities and PICC-RVT, and to provide targeted preventive interventions for PICC-RVT&#xD;
      patients Scientific basis.&#xD;

      A prospective study showed that a mild reduction in AT levels (70%-80%) was associated with&#xD;
      the recurrence of no incentive VTE. Subsequent studies defined mild AT deficiency as less&#xD;
      than the 5th percentile of the normal range to further verify that mild AT deficiency is a&#xD;
      risk factor for VTE recurrence. Many retrospective studies have also shown that the&#xD;
      activities of AT-Ⅲ, PC and PS are related to the occurrence and recurrence of VTE and DVT.&#xD;
      Taking the lower limit of the normal reference value as the criterion for judging the lack of&#xD;
      anticoagulant protein activity, Zhu Tienan et al. found that the lack of activity of AT, PC,&#xD;
      and PS in normal people were 1.15%, 1.49%, and 2.29%, respectively. Fang Biqian et al. found&#xD;
      277 cases of VTE. Among the cases found that the lack of activity of AT, PC, and PS were&#xD;
      16.00%, 17.45%, and 17.09%, respectively. That is, the lack of activity of the three&#xD;
      anticoagulant proteins in VTE patients was about 10 times higher than that of normal people.&#xD;
      Chinese scholars from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Shanghai also found that the total lack of three&#xD;
      anticoagulant proteins of AT-Ⅲ, PC and PS exceeds 15% in Western countries, suggesting that&#xD;
      the etiological composition of venous thromboembolism in the Chinese population may be&#xD;
      similar to that of Western countries. Different, reflecting that anticoagulant protein&#xD;
      deficiency plays an important role in the pathogenesis of VTE patients in China. Compared&#xD;
      with factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin 20210A mutation, the most common thrombosis in&#xD;
      Asian population is antithrombin Ⅲ (AT-Ⅲ), protein C (protein C, PC) and protein S (protein&#xD;
      S, PS), etc. Defects of anticoagulant protein. When the hypercoagulable state caused by&#xD;
      anticoagulant protein deficiency is induced by certain risk factors for thrombosis, such as&#xD;
      pregnancy, oral contraceptives, fractures, long-term immobilization, etc., it can lead to the&#xD;
      occurrence of VTE. When PICC is implanted in patients with AT-Ⅲ, PC and PS activity defects,&#xD;
      whether PICC indwelling will become a predisposing factor of thrombosis is not yet known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that the severity of CVC-related thrombosis in patients with AT-Ⅲ&#xD;
      deficiency after CVC catheterization is higher than that of the normal group. Nowak-Göttl et&#xD;
      al. showed that PC and PS genetic defects are related to catheterization in children&#xD;
      Thrombosis plays an important role. In 2016, a systematic review showed that the risk of DVT&#xD;
      related to more than one anticoagulant defect increased by 3.20 times. PC defects can&#xD;
      increase the incidence of CVC-related DVT in children. Our preliminary study of this subject&#xD;
      found that the lack of anticoagulant protein in PICC-RVT patients was higher than that in&#xD;
      non-PICC-RVT patients.&#xD;
