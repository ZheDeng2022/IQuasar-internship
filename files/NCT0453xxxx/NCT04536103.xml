  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the diagnosis of OA is based on radiographs and clinical findings, which is limited&#xD;
      to detecting late-stage disease. There is a pressing, unmet clinical need for robust&#xD;
      assessment of early changes in cartilage health. Towards this goal, extensive efforts are&#xD;
      ongoing to develop quantitative MRI for cartilage matrix analysis. MR T1ρ and T2 relaxation&#xD;
      times have shown to be promising imaging biomarkers for early cartilage degeneration and&#xD;
      prediction of disease progression. However, many challenges remain to clinically applying&#xD;
      these techniques, including lack of standardized acquisition and quantification methods, and&#xD;
      long acquisition times. The study aims to develop novel, fast and reproducible MR T1ρ and T2&#xD;
      relaxation time imaging methods on MR systems from multiple vendors and establish a platform&#xD;
      for standardization and cross validation of these measures as a tool for clinical trials&#xD;
      using such techniques. Following method validation, patients at risk for osteoarthritis will&#xD;
      be tested.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The significance of this study is twofold. First, one typical hurdle in applying advanced&#xD;
      quantitative MRI to clinical protocols is the long acquisition time. The proposed novel&#xD;
      acceleration techniques will facilitate clinical translations of T1ρ and T2 imaging by&#xD;
      reducing the time and cost to integrate the sequences into standard clinical practice,&#xD;
      increasing patient comfortableness and reducing potential motion artifacts. Second, it is an&#xD;
      essential but sometimes overlooked step to investigate quantification variability across&#xD;
      sites and MR systems in order to validate MR imaging biomarkers and to apply the measures in&#xD;
      large scale multi-vendor multi-site trials. Specifically, there is a lack of systematic&#xD;
      evaluation of inter-vendor inter-site variability of T1ρ imaging even though it has been&#xD;
      widely applied in neural imaging, liver imaging, cardiac imaging, oncology imaging, and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal imaging. Furthermore, no commercial T1ρ phantoms are available with validated&#xD;
      reference values. The proposed study is addressing these significant gaps. By implementing&#xD;
      and cross-validating T1ρ and T2 imaging on MR systems from different vendors, the outcomes&#xD;
      from the proposed study (dedicated calibration phantoms, fast and standardized acquisition&#xD;
      and analysis protocols) will provide the field with essential tools for future multi-vendor&#xD;
      multi-site trials that will use these quantitative imaging techniques. In this proposal, the&#xD;
      innovation and development in patients at risk for osteoarthritis will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, novel accelerated T1ρ and T2 imaging methods will be developed to&#xD;
      systematically evaluate inter-vendor inter-site variation of these measures using dedicated&#xD;
      T1ρ and T2 calibration phantoms (to be developed in this study) and traveling subjects, and&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility in patients after ACL injury and reconstruction who are at risk&#xD;
      of post-traumatic OA. The investigation has three Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Develop novel acceleration techniques for fast 3D T1ρ and T2 imaging. Despite the&#xD;
           increasing availability of accelerated morphologic imaging using compressed sensing (CS)&#xD;
           techniques, applications of CS to quantitative MRI are still very limited with the&#xD;
           challenges of maintaining quantitative accuracy. A novel convex, model-based CS&#xD;
           technique will be developed to take full advantage of the known model for T1ρ and T2&#xD;
           decay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Develop a calibration phantom suitable for standardization of T1ρ and T2 measurements&#xD;
           and implement acceleration techniques on MR systems of three major vendors (Siemens, GE&#xD;
           and Philips). The phantom development and reference measurements will be in&#xD;
           collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The&#xD;
           accelerated T1ρ and T2 sequences will be implemented on six MR systems at four sites&#xD;
           from three vendors. Inter-site and inter-vendor variation of T1ρ and T2 will be&#xD;
           quantified in phantoms and traveling human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Demonstrate the ability of the newly developed acceleration techniques to quantify&#xD;
           cartilage degeneration longitudinally in a multi-vendor setting. Subjects with acute&#xD;
           anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, an established 'early OA' model, along with&#xD;
           age-, gender-, and BMI-matched controls will be scanned on three MR systems using&#xD;
           standard and accelerated T1ρ and T2 protocols at baseline and one-year. A novel&#xD;
           atlas-based voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) analysis will be applied. Cross-sectional and&#xD;
           longitudinal measures will be compared between standard and accelerated T1ρ and T2&#xD;
           protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four groups of subjects will be recruited at CCF for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: 30 volunteers (for Aim 1) The 30 volunteers from Group I will be recruited at CCF&#xD;
      for evaluating differences between standard T1rho and T2 imaging vs accelerated T1rho and T2&#xD;
      imaging techniques that will be developed from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: 8 traveling volunteers (for Aim 2) The 8 traveling volunteers in Group II will be&#xD;
      recruited at CCF and be scanned at CCF, University of California San Francisco, University of&#xD;
      Kentucky and Albert Einstein College of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group III: 30 patients with acute ACL tears (for Aim 3) Group IV: 12 controls who are matched&#xD;
      with Group III patients with age, sex and BMI (for Aim 3) Subjects in group III and IV will&#xD;
      be recruited at CCF and scanned at baseline and 1-year at all of the three MR systems at CCF&#xD;
      (Siemens, GE, Philips).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects of Group I will be recruited in year 1 and 2; Group II will be recruited in year 2&#xD;
      and 3, and Group III and IV will be recruited in year 3-5. Group II and IV share the same&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, therefore subjects can participate the study and serve as&#xD;
      subjects within both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At two other sites involved in the study, University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and&#xD;
      Albert Einstein College of Medicine at New York, 20 local volunteers will be recruited for&#xD;
      sequence development in year 1 and 2.&#xD;
