  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is uncertain whether opt-out framing will increase participation in a clinical trial&#xD;
      intended to promote physical activity in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). This&#xD;
      study will test whether opt-in or opt-out framing of study participation upon initial contact&#xD;
      affects the proportion of patients who ultimately enroll in the study and the demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of enrolled patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GAMEPAD study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating whether a&#xD;
      home-based walking program with automated coaching augmented with gamification and behavioral&#xD;
      economic principles improves functional capacity in patients with PAD. GAMEPAD will be&#xD;
      conducted using the Way to Health platform, and patients will enroll and consent for&#xD;
      participation online, with available help from a study coordinator by telephone. The present&#xD;
      study will leverage the GAMEPAD enrollment process to test whether opt-in or opt-out framing&#xD;
      of study participation upon initial contact affects the proportion of patients who ultimately&#xD;
      enroll in the GAMEPAD study and the demographic characteristics of enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be contacted via email to determine their interest in participation in&#xD;
      the GAMEPAD study. Patients will be randomized 3:1 to an email message framing trial&#xD;
      participation in a standard opt-in manner versus an email message framing trial participation&#xD;
      in an opt-out manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to opt-in framing will be instructed to visit the Way to Health website&#xD;
      to enroll in the GAME PAD study, or to call or email the study coordinator with questions or&#xD;
      for assistance in enrolling. Patients randomized to opt-out framing will be informed that a&#xD;
      study coordinator will be calling them in the coming days to discuss enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of patients randomized to each framing method will be abstracted&#xD;
      from the electronic health record and Penn Data Store, and will include age, sex,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities. Whether contacted patients created an account on&#xD;
      the Way to Health website and/or ultimately consented for enrollment in the study will be&#xD;
      captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all outcomes, we will compare patients initially presented with study participation via&#xD;
      opt-in framing versus opt-out framing. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients&#xD;
      that enroll in the GAMEPAD study. We will also report the proportion of enrolled patients&#xD;
      that failed to complete the GAMEPAD study among those patients that ultimately enrolled.&#xD;

The Walking Impairment Questionnaire will be used to rate the degree of difficulty of various physical activities, ranging from 0 (unable) to 4 (no difficulty). Scores are divided by the maximum number of points and presented on a scale of 0%-100% where 0% indicates they are unable to do the activity and 100% indicates they have no difficulty.</description>
