      This study will be an open label study of secukinumab for the treatment of nail psoriasis.&#xD;
      Secukinumab is an FDA-approved treatment for psoriasis. This is a single arm trial - all&#xD;
      patients will receive the study drug. We will examine time to response and different methods&#xD;
      of defining nail disease response.&#xD;

    <measure>NAPSI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI): NAPSI is the most comprehensive nail assessment used in clinical trials. The fingernail is divided into four quadrants. For each quadrant, 1 point is assigned for a nail matrix abnormality and 1 point for a nail bed abnormality allowing for a total of 8 points per nail. 0-80 total points possible with a higher score corresponding to a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PASI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI): Four assessments for each of four body areas (head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) are provided. The assessments are erythema, induration, and scale (each assessed as 0-4 using a standardized scale), and the number of palms/percentage of each area is categorized (0 = 0%, 1 = less than 10%, 2 = 10%-29%, 3 = 30%-40%, 4 = 50%-69%, 5 = 70%-89%, and 6 = 90%-100%). The scale is 0 to 72 with a higher score corresponding to a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment of Nail Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment of Nail Disease. Scale of 0-100 with higher score corresponding to a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DLQI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI):&#xD;
There are a total of 10 questions and each question is scored on a four-point Likert scale:&#xD;
Very much = 3 A lot = 2 A little = 1 Not at all = 0 Not relevant = 0 Question unanswered = 0&#xD;
The DLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. A score higher than 10 indicates that the patient's life is being severely affected by their skin disease.</description>
