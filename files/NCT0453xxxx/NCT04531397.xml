      We aim to investigate the antiproteinuric effect of adding Dapagliflozin to the standard of&#xD;
      care in children with proteinuria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blockers of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) such as angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered the standard of&#xD;
      care in treatment of Proteinuric Chronic Kidney Disease. However, these agents lead to&#xD;
      incomplete renal protection. The purpose of the study is to investigate the antiproteinuric&#xD;
      effect of adding Dapagliflozin to the standard of care in children with proteinuria. In this&#xD;
      study, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ACEI+Dapagliflozin (5mg or 10mg,&#xD;
      based on body weight) or ACEI only once daily for 24 weeks. Prespecified outcomes includes&#xD;
      changes in 24-hr proteinuria, albumin, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), blood&#xD;
      pressure, body weight and so on.&#xD;
