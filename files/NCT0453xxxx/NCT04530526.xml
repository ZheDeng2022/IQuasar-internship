  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-mastectomy pain due to nerve injury leads to long-term opioid use and diminished&#xD;
      quality-of-life. The investigators on this study will evaluate the regenerative peripheral&#xD;
      nerve interface (RPNI), a novel surgical approach to neuroma treatment, to improve&#xD;
      patient-reported post-mastectomy pain and definitively treat intercostal neuromas after&#xD;
      mastectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40% of patients who undergo mastectomy suffer from chronic pain, defined as pain&#xD;
      lasting greater than three months. Chronic post-mastectomy pain due to nerve injury leads to&#xD;
      long-term opioid use and diminished quality-of-life. A novel surgical approach to neuroma&#xD;
      treatment, the regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) developed to treat painful&#xD;
      neuromas associated with limb amputation has shown significant reductions in patient-reported&#xD;
      pain. RPNI surgery is now available through Michigan Medicine's Multi-Disciplinary Peripheral&#xD;
      Nerve (MDPN) Clinic to improve post-mastectomy pain and definitively treat intercostal&#xD;
      neuromas following mastectomy. Using patient-reported outcomes and clinical data the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the use of RPNI surgery to reduce persistent post- mastectomy&#xD;
      pain in women seeking surgical consultation through the Plastic Surgery or MDPN clinics.&#xD;

    <description>The use of RPNI surgery to reduce post-mastectomy pain will be evaluated by validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) surveys administered at 4 timepoints: at baseline (at time of enrollment), at the RPNI pre-operative visit (approximately 3 months after enrollment), and at approximately 3 and 9 months after RPNI surgery. The average time of study involvement for each patient will be 12 months. Patients enrolled during the first year of the study's 2-year recruitment period may be followed until the study stops.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
