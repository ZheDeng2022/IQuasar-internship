    <measure>The response rate of ACR20 after 24 weeks of L-arginine administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0+3+6+9+12+15+18+21+24+26</time_frame>
    <description>According to the American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 criteria, the ACR20 is a composite measure defined as both improvement of 20% in the number of tender and number of swollen joints, and a 20% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient global assessment, physician global assessment, functional ability measure [most often Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], visual analog pain scale, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP).The reduction ratio of ACR20 after 24 weeks of high or low dose of L-arginine or placebo administration will be observed and documented as the measurement of primary outcome.</description>

    <description>According to the American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 criteria, ACR50/70 are the same instruments with improvement levels defined as 50% and 70% respectively versus 20% for ACR20. The reduction ratio of ACR 50/70 after 24 weeks of high or low dose of L-arginine or placebo administration will be observed and documented as the measurement of secondary outcome.</description>

    <measure>The change of DAS28/ESR</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0+3+6+9+12+15+18+21+24+26</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 Scores indicate how active a patient's rheumatoid arthritis is currently, and can be trended over time. DAS stands for 'disease activity score' and the number 28 refers to the 28 joints that are examined in this assessment. The EULAR Response Criteria also allows clinicians to use DAS28 to categorize the effectiveness of a particular therapy.The formula for DAS28/ESR is (0.56*√(Tender Joint Count)+0.28*√(Swollen Joint Count)+0.7*ln(ESR)+0.014*(global health)). In this study, the change of DAS28/ESR will also be observed and documented as the measurement of secondary outcome.</description>
