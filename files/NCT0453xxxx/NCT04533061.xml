  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a sub-study of a 5-year study designed to investigate how antibody and T cell responses&#xD;
      following influenza vaccine compare among lung transplant patients, patients waiting for lung&#xD;
      transplantation, and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed to investigate the hypothesis that there is no difference in T Cell&#xD;
      response to the influenza vaccine between lung transplant patients and healthy controls.&#xD;

      Influenza virus infection causes significant morbidity and mortality each season. The&#xD;
      infection is particularly serious in the elderly and those with chronic cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      conditions. Solid organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy may be at&#xD;
      particularly high risk for serious influenza infection. Lung transplant patients may have an&#xD;
      even higher risk because of their underlying pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza prophylaxis is extremely important in the care of the transplant patient. Annual&#xD;
      influenza immunization is recommended because protection is short-lived and the vaccine&#xD;
      composition changes. However, the efficacy and effectiveness of this intervention is largely&#xD;
      unproven. Not surprisingly, studies have shown that lung transplant patients have lower&#xD;
      antibody responses than healthy individuals do. To this end, this study tests the hypothesis&#xD;
      that the influenza vaccine-induced T cell responses will be similar in lung transplant&#xD;
      patients and healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn prior to and 2-4 weeks after immunization and used to measure antibody&#xD;
      responses by hemagglutination inhibition assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected in Jan-April each season to study Trans-vivo Delayed Type&#xD;
      Hypersensitivity (TVDTH) response.&#xD;

    <description>T cell response is measured with trans-vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity assay (TVDTH). To induce TVDTH responses, prepared lymphocytes were injected into the footpads of anesthetized (isoflurane) severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice using a 0.5 ml syringe with a 28-gauge needle. The resulting swelling is an index of human T cell sensitization.</description>
