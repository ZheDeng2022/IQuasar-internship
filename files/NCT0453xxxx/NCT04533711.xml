    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an osteoarthritis (OA) primary care Physical activity&#xD;
      Care Pathway (OA-PCP), a scalable intervention that includes: 1) a practical process for&#xD;
      physical inactivity screening in primary care, 2) a brief, tailored physical activity (PA)&#xD;
      counseling intervention via telephone, 3) connection of patients with community programs and&#xD;
      other resources to support PA, and 4) follow-up with patients to deliver additional&#xD;
      appropriate counseling and referrals to PA resources. This program will be compared to&#xD;
      another program that provides education on a variety of topics important to understanding&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) and its care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized pilot trial of the refined OA-PCP among n=240 patients age&#xD;
      â‰¥65 with hip and/or knee OA recruited from primary care clinics. Participants will be&#xD;
      assigned equally to either the OA-PCP or an attention control group. Participants will&#xD;
      complete assessments at baseline, and 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      trial will be objectively assessed PA, measured via accelerometer and secondary endpoint will&#xD;
      be self-reported pain and function.&#xD;

    <description>Participants assigned to the OA-PCP intervention will receive an initial physical activity (PA) coaching call then, 5 more calls over the course of 12 months. Participants, if they agree, will also receive monthly check-in emails between phone calls.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the Attention Control group will receive the same number of phone calls over the course of 12 months, focused on understanding osteoarthritis (OA) and current information on treatment options. Participants, if they agree, will also receive monthly check-in emails between phone calls.</description>

    <intervention_name>OA-PCP Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The OA-PCP intervention includes brief physical activity (PA) counseling delivered via phone by a PA Coach trained in relevant aspects of PA and motivational interviewing. During the initial call, the PA Coach will ask participants about their current physical activity level and work with them to set physical activity goals. Then, after the first call, participants in this group will receive a call about two weeks later, then at about 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months later. During these calls, the PA coach will ask participants' about their progress toward PA goals and work with them to address any barriers or challenges. The coach will also help participants to identify any programs or resources that may help them to achieve their PA goals. Participants in this group will be asked to wear a wrist-worn monitor to help them track their PA during the intervention period. Also, if participants approve, the coach will use an online program to view their PA data.</description>

    <description>This group will receive an intervention in the same &quot;dose&quot; (e.g., number and duration of phone calls and emails) as the OA-PCP group, but the content will not be PA-specific. During the first call, the Coach will discuss 2 topics, for which the amount of content parallels call #1 for the OA-PCP: What is OA? OA Diagnosis and OA Risk Factors. During the second call, the Coach will discuss the topic of Health Care Providers and Overview of OA Treatment Guidelines. Call topics for 3, 6, 9 and 12- month follow-up calls will be: Pain Medications, Mechanical Treatments (e.g., knee braces, footwear, joint protection), Complimentary and Alternative Therapies and discussion of OA and Mental Health, Sleep and Fatigue.</description>
