  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Best management of suspected large for gestational age (LGA) fetuses is unclear. In some&#xD;
      hospitals women with an LGA fetus by customised growth charts are are offered earlier&#xD;
      induction. This study aimed to examine scan accuracy for this group and the outcome with&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women taken from 3 groups; women with a&#xD;
      suspected LGA fetus (LGA), women with diabetes (DM) and a control group of women that&#xD;
      underwent induction of labour at or after 40 weeks. Scan accuracy using GROW and WHO charts&#xD;
      in the LGA and DM cohorts was assessed using ROC curves and outcomes between the cohorts was&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Induced labour of a singleton pregnancy at Northumbria Healthcare Foundation trust&#xD;
             resulting in a delivery between 01/01/2018 and 31/12/2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion in the LGA group means that the main indication for induction is recorded as&#xD;
        suspected macrosomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion in the Diabetic group means diabetes was pre-existing or arose in pregnancy,&#xD;
        diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing from 24-30 weeks or by home blood glucose&#xD;
        monitoring with standard thresholds as per NICE ng3. Induction had to be undertaken with&#xD;
        diabetes as the (co)indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for the control group was induction of labour at or after 280 days&#xD;
        gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous caesarean section Multiple pregnancy Fetal concerns pre-induction: abnormal&#xD;
        antenatal trace or abnormal doppler flow studies on antenatal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cases of induction for suspected LGA are to be excluded if there is a co-indication of&#xD;
             obstetric cholestasis, hypertensive disorder or diabetes.&#xD;
