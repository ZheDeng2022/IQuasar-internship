      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that allowing infants that require high flow&#xD;
      nasal cannula (HFNC)/Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to orally feed if&#xD;
      demonstrating oral cues will achieve full oral feeds faster.&#xD;

    <description>Infant will be seen by occupational therapist (OT) twice a week and assessed for oral cues. If infant shows oral cues then the occupational therapist will proceed with feeding strategies. Oral feeding strategies include pacifier dips, open nipple trials with syringe controlled bolus size (1-4mls) and po trials up to 10mls.</description>
