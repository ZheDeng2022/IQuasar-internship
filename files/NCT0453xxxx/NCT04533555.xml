  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of our research is to define an evidence-based, sustainable approach to&#xD;
      identifying and managing genetic risk among young adults with cancer and their relatives.&#xD;
      Conventional practice leaves referral and testing decisions to mostly non-expert clinicians&#xD;
      implementing complex guidelines at the point of care, leading to substantial&#xD;
      under-utilization. The investigators hypothesize that panel-based universal screening coupled&#xD;
      with electronic medical record- (EMR-) based algorithms can improve ascertainment of genetic&#xD;
      risk by functioning as an automated, radically simplified default practice in place of&#xD;
      repeated single decisions requiring clinician cognitive effort and action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary goal is to explore differences in ascertainment of genetic risk among&#xD;
      first-degree relatives of probands.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial among young adult (YA) cancer patients to&#xD;
      rigorously test the hypothesis that universal testing identifies many YA patients with&#xD;
      germline cancer risk who would be missed by conventional testing strategies, to improve&#xD;
      adherence to risk reduction interventions among YAs with cancer susceptibility, and to&#xD;
      increase ascertainment among relatives of these patients at increased genetic risk. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of the randomized trial will be ascertainment of probands, but in a companion&#xD;
      study, the investigators will also explore the incremental utility of universal testing with&#xD;
      respect to ascertainment of risk among relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be immediately randomized using a computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      algorithm using permuted variable block sizes with a concealed sequence. Randomization will&#xD;
      be stratified by gender, National Comprehensive Cancer Network/American College of Medical&#xD;
      Genetics and Genomics (NCCN/ACMG) referral criteria (meets/doesn't meet), and hospital (i.e.,&#xD;
      HUP vs. other Penn Medicine hospitals). Note that because of demographic differences between&#xD;
      hospitals, the investigators are using hospital type as a proxy for race/ethnicity and so&#xD;
      will not stratify for it separately. Randomization will occur in a 2:1 ratio (experimental:&#xD;
      control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrollment for genetic testing will be completed within the first 12 months. If&#xD;
      patients receive a pathogenic or likely pathogenic result then they will be followed for up&#xD;
      to five years to evaluate the impact of the clinical decision support. Recruitment will end&#xD;
      when approximately 1238 subjects are enrolled. Subjects will be recruited across five Penn&#xD;
      Medicine sites, including Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP), Penn Presbyterian&#xD;
      Medical Center (PPMC), Pennsylvania Hospital (PAH), Chester County Hospital (CCH), and&#xD;
      Lancaster General Hospital (LGH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are notified of their eligibility status and indicate an interest in study&#xD;
      participation will be directed to an educational website about hereditary cancer risk and the&#xD;
      implications of genetic testing for patients and family members. They will also be provided&#xD;
      information about the study. If they wish to consent after viewing the educational module,&#xD;
      patients will be automatically sent to REDCap where, following consent, they also will&#xD;
      complete a brief survey to obtain demographics and family history information. Patients will&#xD;
      also have the option of reviewing information, providing consent, and completing&#xD;
      sociodemographic and family history data collection via paper forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon provision of signed informed consent and determination of high/low risk (based on&#xD;
      ACMG/NCCN guidelines and determined by either the study research coordinator or clinical&#xD;
      genetic counselor as outlined above), patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      (experimental: control) into one of the two study arms stratified by gender, meeting&#xD;
      NCCN/ACMG criteria, and hospital type (HUP vs. other). Study enrollees will be encouraged to&#xD;
      sign up to use their local patient portal, if they haven't done so already, in order to&#xD;
      receive study communications, health information, and heath maintenance alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of patients randomized to the phenotype-based (standard) arm will depend on&#xD;
      whether they are identified as being at high or low risk of having a genetic predisposition.&#xD;
      Patients who do not meet high-risk criteria will have routine clinical care (i.e., no&#xD;
      study-directed referral to a genetic counselor). Patients who do meet high-risk criteria will&#xD;
      be referred to a genetic counselor at their treating Penn Medicine institution for a standard&#xD;
      cancer genetics evaluation and testing based on genetic counselor recommendation and patient&#xD;
      preference. Participants on this arm who receive genetic testing will be tracked and results&#xD;
      will be manually entered into the study database, although if they are tested at Ambry&#xD;
      Genetics (the lab used in the universal-testing intervention arm), positive results will be&#xD;
      directly imported into PennChart (the investigators' local instance of Epic) via a secure&#xD;
      interface, which already has been built and is operational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the universal-testing arm will provide either a saliva or blood sample&#xD;
      to have sequencing of a broad cancer risk gene panel conducted by Ambry Genetics. Genetic&#xD;
      test results will go directly into PennChart from Ambry via a secure interface (HL7).&#xD;
      Patients identified as being at high risk according to NCCN/ACMG criteria will be referred to&#xD;
      a genetic counselor at their treating institution, who will be asked to obtain testing using&#xD;
      the Ambry broad cancer risk gene panel rather than by usual clinical tests. If they do not&#xD;
      follow-up for clinical testing, as outlined above, they will be tested by the study team,&#xD;
      using mailed genetic testing kits (with pre-paid mailers to Ambry Genetics). Patients&#xD;
      identified as being at low risk will undergo testing using the Ambry broad cancer risk gene&#xD;
      panel via mailed genetic testing kits (as above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants seen by a genetic counselor will have their results disclosed to them by their&#xD;
      care team. Participants who enroll remotely will be notified that their results are available&#xD;
      via their preferred method (patient portal, mail, or e-mail). Those patients with a negative&#xD;
      result will be provided the result via the preferred method and given the option to speak&#xD;
      with a genetic counselor. Those patients with positive results will be provided their results&#xD;
      over the phone by either the study or their clinical genetic counselors or physician.&#xD;
      Patients tested at Ambry will have their results directly imported into their charts via HL7;&#xD;
      release of results via MyPennMedicine (MPM) will only occur only after genetic counselor or&#xD;
      physician has spoken with the patient (manual release).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, genetic testing is being done for variants in genes known to be&#xD;
      associated with increased cancer risk. However, it is possible that the investigators do not&#xD;
      know of all such genes, and the investigators are interested in studies that may help to&#xD;
      identify them in the future. As an optional part of the study, the investigators will seek&#xD;
      consent from participants to use their DNA sample to help understand the development of&#xD;
      cancer and other diseases. Possible future research may include other research on inherited&#xD;
      cancer risk or the link between DNA and medical outcomes, including response to treatment or&#xD;
      contributions to other disease research. Some research may include whole genome sequencing, a&#xD;
      method that determines the exact sequence of a person's DNA. Participants may decline&#xD;
      participation in this aspect of the study and only have their samples used for the main&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be identified through one of two mechanisms. Most will be&#xD;
      identified through the electronic health record (EHR) system, which at Penn Medicine is Epic,&#xD;
      and will be referred directly to the study team via an Epic registry. Participants will be&#xD;
      screened by a study research coordinator to determine study eligibility, making sure they do&#xD;
      not meet any of the study's exclusion criteria based on information contained in the EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternately, some eligible participants will be identified at the time that they see a&#xD;
      genetic counselor at one of the Penn Medicine cancer genetics practices and recruited by&#xD;
      their local genetic counselor with immediate randomization. These patients will include, for&#xD;
      example, patients who need to be seen more quickly than would be picked up through the Epic&#xD;
      registry (e.g., breast cancer participants pre-surgery). Patients who have an appointment&#xD;
      already scheduled with cancer genetics at the time they are picked up by the Epic registry&#xD;
      will be recruited through their genetic counselors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not meet NCCN/ACMG guidelines for referral to a genetic counselor will&#xD;
      have routine clinical care, which does not include a genetic counselor visit or genetic&#xD;
      testing for cancer predisposition. Participants who do meet NCCN/ACMG guidelines will be&#xD;
      referred to a genetic counselor at their treating institution. Genetic testing will be&#xD;
      ordered based on the genetic counselor's clinical recommendation and patient preference.&#xD;
      Participants on this arm who receive genetic testing will be tracked and results will be&#xD;
      manually entered into the study database, although if they are tested at Ambry Genetics,&#xD;
      positive results can be directly imported into PennChart (our local instance of Epic) via a&#xD;
      secure interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the universal-testing arm will have genetic testing using a broad&#xD;
      cancer risk gene panel through Ambry Genetics. Participants will have saliva samples&#xD;
      collected. For low-risk patients, as well as for high-risk patients who decline Genetic&#xD;
      Counselor (GC) visits, Research Coordinators (RCs) will mail a saliva kit, along with a&#xD;
      prepaid mailer addressed to Ambry Genetics and a completed testing requisition form, to the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orders will be placed in PennChart and will link directly with the Ambry Genetics application&#xD;
      programming interface (API). This functionality already has been built and implemented in&#xD;
      PennChart. For both arms, clinical reports from Ambry including variant interpretations are&#xD;
      directly imported into PennChart. Participants seen by a GC will have their results returned&#xD;
      by that care team. Participants consenting remotely will be told in advance that they will be&#xD;
      notified by their preferred method (patient portal, mail, email) that their genetic results&#xD;
      are available. Negative results will be provided by that method, with the option of a GC&#xD;
      visit upon request. Participants with positive results pathogenic/likely pathogenic or&#xD;
      variant of uncertain significance (P/LP or VUS) will be told that results are available and&#xD;
      be returned by phone by the study genetic counselor or their clinical genetic counselor. VUS&#xD;
      results will be returned to tested patients with appropriate caveats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascertainment of genetic risk among 1st-degree adult relatives: This portion of the study&#xD;
      will explore differences in ascertainment of genetic risk among 1st-degree adult relatives of&#xD;
      patients assigned to the universal-testing arm as compared with the phenotype-directed arm&#xD;
      after a combination of referral by the proband and direct clinical and/or research team&#xD;
      outreach. The investigators hypothesize that, by testing all young adult patients with solid&#xD;
      tumors with a comprehensive germline cancer risk panel rather than following the standard&#xD;
      guideline-directed approach to germline genetic testing of patients with cancer, the&#xD;
      investigators will identify a higher proportion of their 1st-degree relatives as being at&#xD;
      increased genetic cancer risk.&#xD;
