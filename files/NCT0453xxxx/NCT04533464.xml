        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 18 years of age or older AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Received at least 3 units of any blood product in any hour before Shock Trauma&#xD;
             Intensive Care Unit (STICU) arrival AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Survived to initial ICU arrival AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Initial hemostasis has been achieved, in the opinion of the attending surgeon AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Predicted to survive at least 24 hours after STICU arrival by the attending physician&#xD;
             AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to start and complete investigational product infusion within 24 hours after&#xD;
             known or estimated time of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prisoners, defined as those who have been directly admitted from a correctional&#xD;
             facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prisoners are excluded because of their vulnerable population status. A free-living&#xD;
             individual who is under police observation as a suspect will remain in the study until&#xD;
             discharge or incarcerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant and lactating females. It is unknown how stem cells affect a developing fetus&#xD;
             or if they can be found in milk. To protect the safety of developing fetuses and&#xD;
             breastfeeding children, pregnant and lactating women will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a head injury deemed non-survivable by the trauma or neurosurgery attending. The&#xD;
             attending physician may determine futility from a range of injuries/physiological&#xD;
             responses. These may include non-survivable TBI (malignant ICP elevation despite&#xD;
             maximal therapy with findings of uncal herniation and/or brain dead exam;&#xD;
             atlantooccipital dissociation), cardio-pulmonary failure refractory to resuscitation&#xD;
             and those patients with an advanced directive that declines resuscitative or organ&#xD;
             support therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hemodynamically unstable or requiring clinically meaningful escalation of vasopressor&#xD;
             dose for blood pressure support (to maintain SBP ≥ 90 mmHg) during the 30 minute&#xD;
             period prior to study product thawing/preparation. Clinically meaningful vasopressor&#xD;
             dose adjustment defined as ≥ 5 mcg/min increase in norepinephrine dose; ≥ 50 mcg/min&#xD;
             increase in phenylephrine dose; ≥ 5 mcg/kg/min increase in dopamine dose; and ≥ 0.05&#xD;
             mcg/kg/min increase in epinephrine dose. If the patient is on vasopressin,&#xD;
             investigators will be instructed not to titrate the vasopressin dose during this 30&#xD;
             minute period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Greater than 20% total body surface area burns and/or suspected inhalation injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects with large and severe thermal injuries and inhalation injures require a&#xD;
             resuscitation approach that is different from current isolated trauma resuscitation&#xD;
             strategies. Additionally, in the absence of concomitant severe blunt trauma, these&#xD;
             subjects are unlikely to receive blood products in the early resuscitative phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Preexisting chronic kidney disease, defined by prior documented glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 for 3 months or more. Patients who are unable to&#xD;
             communicate their pre-existing conditions will be excluded by Medical Alert&#xD;
             bracelets/IDs, stigmata pathognomonic for chronic kidney disease such as presence of&#xD;
             dialysis vascular access devices or shunts/markedly elevated BUN/Creatinine, or&#xD;
             abdominal incisions consistent with organ transplantation, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Preexisting chronic liver disease, evidenced by clinical or laboratory examinations&#xD;
             consistent with chronic liver disease/failure (Childs A-C), patient or family report,&#xD;
             Medical Alert bracelets/IDs or abdominal incisions consistent with organ&#xD;
             transplantation, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known condition of single kidney or concurrent use of potentially nephrotoxic&#xD;
             medications at doses likely to be nephrotoxic&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known immunodeficient condition or concurrent use of potentially immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medications at doses likely to result in an immunosuppressed status&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known allergy to MultiStem, dimethyl sulfoxide or human serum albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No available intravenous access (peripheral or central) of at least 22-guage that can&#xD;
             be utilized exclusively for investigational product during the time of planned&#xD;
             infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Clinical condition would be anticipated to deteriorate with intravenous administration&#xD;
             of 250 ml of crystalloid&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Known Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Enrolled in a concurrent ongoing interventional clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known functional asplenia or prior surgical removal of the spleen, or a trauma related&#xD;
             splenic injury sufficient to precluding enrollment as determined by the PI or Co-&#xD;
             Investigators. (trauma related splenic injuries include surgical total splenectomy or&#xD;
             nonoperative management of AAST grade V splenic injury including splenic arterial&#xD;
             embolization.* *Proximal splenic arterial embolization to control bleeding that leaves&#xD;
             the spleen in situ and perfused (below Grade V) does not necessarily exclude the&#xD;
             patient. Further, achieving Grade V, with an upgraded score due to a secondary small&#xD;
             laceration, etc. away from primary injury will be considered a Grade IV for the&#xD;
             purposes of the protocol.&#xD;
