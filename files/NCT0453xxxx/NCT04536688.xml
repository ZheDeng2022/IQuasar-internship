      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To assess the dose response relationship between RGLS4326 and ADPKD biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of RGLS4326 in plasma and urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of RGLS4326&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, adaptive design dose-ranging study to evaluate ADPKD&#xD;
      biomarkers, PK, safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of RGLS4326 administered via&#xD;
      SC injection to patients with ADPKD. The goal is to assess the dose response relationship&#xD;
      between RGLS4326 and ADPKD biomarkers. The study will consist of three sequential cohorts&#xD;
      with approximately 18 to 27 subjects total.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Cohorts will be enrolled and treated sequentially. Dosing decisions will be made based on prior cohort's safety and biomarker data. Six to 9 subjects will be enrolled in each cohort based on the magnitude and/or variability of the increase in PC1 and PC2 or to allow for replacement of subjects that do not complete the study. The highest dose (1 mg/kg) will be administered in cohort 1. If the Sponsor determines that the increase in PC1 and PC2 from baseline for cohort 1 is inadequate, the study may be stopped for futility. If the Sponsor determines that the increase from baseline for cohort 1 is adequate, then 0.3 mg/kg will be administered in cohort 2. Based on the increase of PC1 and PC2 from baseline in cohort 2, Sponsor may determine a higher dose needs to be evaluated, then 0.5 mg/kg will be administered in cohort 3. If the Sponsor determines that lower dose needs to be evaluated, then 0.1 mg/kg will be administered in cohort 3.</intervention_model_description>
