  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain in breast cancer survivors (BCS) is of considerable concern as it impacts the&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and activities of daily living negatively. Over the&#xD;
      past decades, awareness has raised the value of pain neuroscience education (PNE) in chronic&#xD;
      pain. However, pain education remains underused in oncology and is often restricted to a&#xD;
      biomedical management, which falls short in explaining persistent pain following cancer.&#xD;
      Since PNE alone has rather small effect sizes, it should ideally be combined with a physical&#xD;
      part, 'behavioural graded activity' (BGA). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of PNE with BGA compared to usual care on chronic pain in BCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-centre, parallel, two-arm, double-blinded superiority with a three months&#xD;
      intervention and two years follow-up will be conducted in 200 BCS with chronic pain. These&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group. The intervention group&#xD;
      will receive 6 sessions, in which PNE and BGA will be integrated. Whereas, the usual care&#xD;
      group will receive an information leaflet regarding &quot;Pain in and after cancer&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the present study is to examine whether the combination of PNE and&#xD;
      BGA has an added value in decreasing the pain intensity compared to the usual care in BCS&#xD;
      with chronic pain. The secondary objectives are to investigate whether the combination of PNE&#xD;
      and BGA has the ability to reduce endogenous hyperalgesia and improve HRQoL compared to the&#xD;
      usual care in BCS with chronic pain.&#xD;

First, the assessor will inspect the affected (and painful) region for possible skin damage and will be looking for: wound disruption, hematoma (bruising), abscess (cavity filled with pus) and seroma (cavity filled with transparent liquid). Second, the he will inspect the presence of a possible inflammation process of the scar tissue and will be looking for signs such as: warmth, redness, etc. Third, he will assess the mobility of the scar. During this manual test, will be assessed whether the scar is moving relative to the underlying layers, which will be scored on a 5-point Likert scale with response possibilities: (totally disagree, disagree, don't disagree/agree, agree, totally agree).</description>

    <description>Patients in the experimental group will receive a behavioural treatment integrated within the concepts of operant conditioning. The purpose of Behavioural Graded Activity (BGA) is to increase the level of physical activity in the patient's daily lives in a time-contingent manner. On top of that, a healthy behaviour will be positively reinforced to consequently create a withdrawal of the attention towards pain behaviour, which is seen as an unreliable &quot;alarm sign&quot; in chronic pain patients. The implementation of BGA after PNE is described in the guideline reported by the International Association for the Study of Pain.</description>
