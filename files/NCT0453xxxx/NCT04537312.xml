  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine safety, efficacy, and potential risks of robot assisted&#xD;
      nipple sparing mastectomy (RNSM), by utilizing the daVinci surgical system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the advances of breast reconstruction after mastectomy for the treatment of breast&#xD;
      diseases including breast cancer, surgical techniques have evolved to preserve the skin flaps&#xD;
      and nipple areolar complex (NAC) to give better aesthetic outcome without compromising&#xD;
      outcome. Mastectomy that preserves the NAC is called nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM). NSM can&#xD;
      provide major psychosocial benefits for patients but is technically demanding and challenging&#xD;
      to perform. Total mammary glandular excision in NSM can be technically challenging due to&#xD;
      small size of the incision and poor visualization of dissection plane. Recent studies&#xD;
      demonstrate feasibility and safety of performing minimally invasive robot-assisted NSM&#xD;
      (RNSM). The technique of RNSM is still novel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm pilot study for feasibility and safety of RNSM.&#xD;
