      To establish the prediction of the renal damage and renal development deficiency in&#xD;
      congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), a diagnostic accuracy study on&#xD;
      MRI-DWI combined with urinary microprotein detection is to carried out comparing with DMSA&#xD;
      scan as the golden standard for renal damage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) is one of the common birth defects,&#xD;
      with a morbidity of 6‰. The delayed diagnosis, due to its demanding diagnostic technique, may&#xD;
      leads to long-term severe renal damage. This project is a prospective, continuous&#xD;
      double-blind designed diagnostic accuracy study. The clinical diagnosis of CAKUT relies on a&#xD;
      panel of radiological examinations most of which are invasive and risk of radiation harm for&#xD;
      children. To establish the non-invasive and safe diagnosis detections of renal damage of&#xD;
      CAKUT in children, a combination of MRI/DWI with urinary detection through Immunomagnetic&#xD;
      beads isolation technique is to carried out to evaluate the renal deficiency in CAKUT&#xD;
      comparing the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan as the golden standard of renal parenchymal&#xD;
      damage. Analysis of sensitivity and specificity is to evaluate the accuracy of the combined&#xD;
      diagnostic protocol. Furthermore the clinical information of pregnancy and phenotypes of the&#xD;
      patients with CAKUT is to be collected with all the genetic information constructing the full&#xD;
      phenotype- genotype spectrum for big data analysis and predictive model for early detection&#xD;
      of renal damage in CAKUT.&#xD;

    <description>The accuracy of combined diagnosis includes sensitivity and specificity. The reference standard test (DMSA scan) and combined diagnosis are conducted in the cohort of pediatric children diagnosed of CAKUT.&#xD;
Sensitivity is defined as: The proportion of renal parenchymal damage is successfully screened out by combined diagnosis.&#xD;
Specificity is defined as: The proportion of children without renal parenchymal damage who are not recognized as impairment by combined diagnosis.</description>

    <description>This study is an observational study to evaluate the accuracy of renal parenchymal damage combined diagnosis with no intervention. All patients from the cohort accept MRI-DWI scan，the urinary biomarkers detection, disease gene detection and DMSA scan.&#xD;
This combined diagnosis includes MRI-DWI scan and the urinary biomarkers detection.&#xD;
MRI-DWI： All the scans are performed using the MagnetomVerio 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging system from Siemens.&#xD;
Urinary polypeptide collection: Urine samples requirements: volume between 50-100ml, specific gravity &gt;1.010. Immunomagnetic beads isolation technique is used to collect polypeptide.&#xD;
The reference standard is DMSA scan: Intravenous injection of 99mTC-DMSA5mCi is followed by anterior and posterior planar imaging of the renal area 1 hour later. The DMSA scan images are read by 2 trained radiologists and confirmed by the special doctor of the center for diagnosis and treatment of renal and urinary diseases at the same time.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient that was diagnosed clinically and genetically as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal parenchymal aplasia or ectopia, including simple renal aplasia,Multicystic&#xD;
             Dysplastic Kidney, kidney tubules dysplasia, and hereditary cystic kidney. ①disease&#xD;
             renal agenesis (RA): With ultrasound diagnosis of unilateral renal absence.②Renal&#xD;
             hypoplasia (RH)/renal dysplasia (RD) is usually defined as renal volume less than two&#xD;
             standard deviations of the average of the same age, or renal total volume less than&#xD;
             50% of the normal value of the same age. RD refers to the presence of undifferentiated&#xD;
             or not metaplastic tissue in the kidney, with or without renal volume reduction.&#xD;
             Diagnosis is based on the ultrasonic findings of multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK)&#xD;
             and the diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral renal functional defects by means of&#xD;
             isotopic renal functional imaging (DMSA or DTPA);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Kidney tubular dysplasia: ①the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease(ADPKD/ARPKD) is&#xD;
             mainly dependent on imaging; Patients with a family history of ADPKD can be diagnosed&#xD;
             with more than 3 renal cysts on either side. those who with bilateral renal diffuse&#xD;
             enlargement with multiple cysts should be clinically considered with PKD even without&#xD;
             family history of ADPKD, and relevant gene screening is recommended.②Simple renal&#xD;
             cyst: single renal cyst was found by ultrasound or other imaging&#xD;
             examination;③Nephronophthisis, NPHP: ultrasonography showed enhanced renal echo or&#xD;
             unclear boundary between cortex and medulla, with or without genetic diagnosis or&#xD;
             involvement of other system, gene sequence should be considered. Genetic molecular&#xD;
             diagnosis is the main diagnostic basis of NPHP diagnosis.④nephrocalcinosis and urinary&#xD;
             calculi: the diagnosis depends on the ultrasound diagnosis and the examinations of&#xD;
             serum and urine electrolyte and metabolite should be performed to further diagnose the&#xD;
             primary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormalities of Ureter， renal pelvis and/or bladder: ① Dual collection system:&#xD;
             Reduplication of kidney or renal pelvis/ureter depends on ultrasound, magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis. ② Urinary obstruction: Including ureteropelvic&#xD;
             junction obstruction, ureterovesical junction obstruction or insufficiency. The&#xD;
             diagnosis of obstruction depends on magnetic resonance urography (MRU) and isotopic&#xD;
             dynamic renal imaging(DTPA) ③ vesicoureteral reflux: The diagnosis depends on voiding&#xD;
             cysternography (VCUG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urinary tract anomalies: ① Urethral absence/urethra atresia/ectopic orifice: Diagnosis&#xD;
             depends on physical examination and VCUG examination. ② Posterior urethral valve:&#xD;
             Severe hydronephrosis can be found by ultrasound, and the diagnosis depends on VCUG&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with renal failure due to different causes but without urine specimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
