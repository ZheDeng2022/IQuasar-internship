      The present research aims to determine the impact of stenoses in downstream vessels on the&#xD;
      FFR and iFR measurements of left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenoses of intermediate&#xD;
      severity as determined by coronary angiography. Anatomic metrics derived from intravascular&#xD;
      imaging modalities of IVUS and optical coherence tomography (OCT) will also be validated&#xD;
      using as the comparator the FFRtrue and iFRtrue measurements pf LMCA lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate characterization of the functional significance of intermediate stenoses located in&#xD;
      the left main coronary artery (LMCA) is of central relevance for decisions about the need of&#xD;
      myocardial revascularization. However, the physiological assessment of such lesions by means&#xD;
      of fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements are affected by stenoses in the downstream&#xD;
      vessels (left anterior descending artery and/or left circumflex artery), which frequently&#xD;
      coexist in series with LMCA lesions. More recently introduced, the instantaneous wave-free&#xD;
      ratio (iFR) is a resting index that is less influenced by crosstalk between serial lesions&#xD;
      and, in theory, could be more accurate for assessment of LMCA stenoses in the presence of&#xD;
      downstream disease. Nonetheless, iFR has not been validated for assessment of LMCA lesions.&#xD;
      Due to the difficulty in interpreting FFR results, the possibility of characterizing the&#xD;
      atheroma type, precisely estimate lesion severity and disease extension and distribution,&#xD;
      intravascular imaging [especially intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)] became an attractive&#xD;
      alternative to assess LMCA lesions and guide the percutaneous treatment, whenever this&#xD;
      strategy is selected. However, most IVUS validations for LMCA stenosis assessment used FFR as&#xD;
      the standard comparator, which by itself has limited diagnostic ability in this anatomic&#xD;
      scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the main objective of the current research project is to determine the impact of&#xD;
      stenoses in downstream vessels on FFR and iFR measurements of LMCA stenoses of intermediate&#xD;
      severity as determined by coronary angiography. The primary endpoint is the change (delta) in&#xD;
      FFR and iFR values prior and after percutaneous treatment of downstream stenoses. Assuming a&#xD;
      change of 0.04 mmHg between the FFRpredicted and FFRtrue with a standard deviation of 0.04&#xD;
      mmHg, and a change of 0.01 mmHg between iFRpredicted and iFRtrue with a standard deviation of&#xD;
      0.03 mmHg, a total of 53 patients are needed to confirm the mean difference of 0.03 mmHg&#xD;
      between iFR and FFR changes before and after treatment of downstream stenoses. Anatomic&#xD;
      metrics derived from intravascular imaging modalities of IVUS and optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) will also be validated using as the comparator the FFRtrue and iFRtrue&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
