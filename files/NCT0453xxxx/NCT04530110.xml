    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fremanezumab in the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric participants 6&#xD;
      to 17 years of age (inclusive at enrollment in the pivotal study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous fremanezumab in pediatric&#xD;
      participants with migraine and to evaluate the immunogenicity of fremanezumab and the impact&#xD;
      of ADAs on clinical outcomes in pediatric participants exposed to fremanezumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is planned to be up to 60 months.&#xD;

    <description>The Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS) is used to assess migraine disability across multiple domains of functioning including school, home, social, and recreational. The measure consists of 6 items measuring the number of days in which activities were missed as a result of headache/migraine. The measure yields a total score by summing items. Total scores correspond to one of four &quot;disability grades:&quot; 0-10 = little to no disability, 11-30 = mild disability, 31-50 = moderate disability, and &gt;50 = severe disability.</description>
