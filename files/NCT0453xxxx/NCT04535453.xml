  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess humoral immune responses of 3 dose levels of&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S administered intramuscularly (IM) as a 2-dose schedule (56 days apart);&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S administered IM as a single vaccination; safety and reactogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S&#xD;
      administered IM as a 2-dose or a single-dose schedule in adults (18-65 years or older) and to&#xD;
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, administered IM as single dose in&#xD;
      adolescents (12-17 years) and to test both compressed and expanded 2-dose schedules of&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S (28 and 84 days apart) in adults (18-55 years and 65 years or older).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical development program is to develop a safe and&#xD;
      effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. Currently, there is only limited&#xD;
      availability of authorized/licensed vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus disease-2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19). Ad26.COV2.S (also known as Ad26COVS1) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a&#xD;
      recombinant, replication incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode&#xD;
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spike (S) protein,&#xD;
      which will be assessed in this study. Also, different vaccination intervals and multiple&#xD;
      lower dose levels compared to the dose levels in the first in human study (VAC31518COV1001&#xD;
      [NCT04436276]) will be assessed. For adults, the study consists of: screening phase (28&#xD;
      days), vaccination phase (1-3 months) depending on the vaccination interval, and follow-up&#xD;
      (12 months). The study duration is approximately 15 months (Groups 1-6, 8, 10 and Group 7 [to&#xD;
      participants for whom vaccination 2 was delayed]), 14 months (Group 7), and 16 months (Group&#xD;
      9) in adult groups and approximately 13 months for adolescents group (Groups A to C). The&#xD;
      adverse events and other safety assessments including vital signs measurements (heart rate,&#xD;
      supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature), and&#xD;
      physical examinations will be assessed during the study.&#xD;
