  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research study is to contribute to generalized knowledge on how&#xD;
      to increase screening for patients at risk of missing their recommended cancer preventive&#xD;
      care by using a newly developed predictive model and analytic tool to improve shared&#xD;
      decision-making for these patients. The goal of the clinical trial is to evaluate (prove) the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this shared-decision making support tool developed in EPIC on the rate of&#xD;
      recommended cancer screening in practice. It contributes to knowledge on what specific&#xD;
      methods can increase patient adherence to recommended preventive care and reduce disparities.&#xD;

      Patients seen at primary care practices, who have been pre-determined to have unmet screening&#xD;
      requirements and have received standard of care with a QI tool, will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      optional questionnaire electronically through a patient portal or via a link sent by text&#xD;
      within a week of their visit, based on their preference. Only those who have indicated they&#xD;
      agree to be contacted for research purposes will be contacted. Surveys will be distributed&#xD;
      through REDCap so no identifying information will be contained in the answers. REDCap is a&#xD;
      free, HIPAA compliant interface for building and managing online databases. Additionally,&#xD;
      surveys will be sent via mail if the patient cannot be reached electronically. Survey&#xD;
      responses received through the mail will not include any identifying information. Pre-paid&#xD;
      return envelopes will be provided to preserve anonymity. Although a small proportion of South&#xD;
      Carolina's population are primary Spanish speakers (about 4%), to be inclusive we want to&#xD;
      ensure all materials are available in Spanish. To remove barriers to participation, those&#xD;
      needing physical, hearing, and visual assistance will be able to review and complete&#xD;
      documents at the time of their clinic visit with the assistance of trained study personnel.&#xD;
      Invitations will continue to be sent out until 100 total patient responses are received per&#xD;
      practice in the pragmatic trial, or 50 per practice in the pilot. Clinicians will also&#xD;
      receive a survey to assess the tool. Recruitment for clinicians surveys will be done via&#xD;
      email sent by the practice managers to the providers who have agreed to use the QI tool.&#xD;
      Clinician assessments will be delivered electronically via a link delivery by email or text,&#xD;
      or sent by mail, based on clinician preference. Respondents will be reimbursed for their time&#xD;
      and effort. These assessments will be anonymous. Survey participation will be coded in order&#xD;
      to provide compensation. Since data will be identified only by code numbers (participant IDs)&#xD;
      the master list of those codes will be kept physically separate from the collected data.&#xD;
