      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 for&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although esophagectomy is still the standard treatment for patients with localized esophageal&#xD;
      cancer, the long-term therapeutic effect is not satisfactory.About 50% of patients&#xD;
      experienced relapse in the first year after treatment. The 5-year survival rate of esophageal&#xD;
      cancer patients treated by surgery is still less than 30%. Although the effect of&#xD;
      preoperative treatment is relatively clear, the effect of postoperative treatment, especially&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy, is still controversial and no consensus has been reached.The&#xD;
      basic reason is that the postoperative trauma of esophageal cancer is large, and the&#xD;
      patients' tolerance to chemotherapy is poor. The efficacy of immunocheckpoint inhibitors in&#xD;
      metastatic ESCC has been recognized.We plan to conduct a phase II multicenter, single arm,&#xD;
      open phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of humanized anti PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody SHR-1210 in adjuvant treatment of resectable esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
