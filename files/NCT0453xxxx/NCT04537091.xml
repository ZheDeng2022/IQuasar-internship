  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), is characterised by pain around the greater&#xD;
      trochanter. Failure of first-line management for GTPS is followed by second-line treatments&#xD;
      range from extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), corticosteroid or platelet-rich plasma&#xD;
      (PRP) injections, and surgery. In a systematic reviews, PRP seems a viable effective and safe&#xD;
      alternative option for GTPS after failed physical therapy. Also, positive results from&#xD;
      previous systematic reviews involving radial ESWT (rESWT) as a treatment for GTPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature review, there is no comparison of the effectiveness of ESWT and PRP&#xD;
      injection in patients with GTPS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      rESWT and PRP injection on pain, hip disability, and quality of life in patients with GTPS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pain and activities of daily living, referring to the previous week, and assessments of&#xD;
      hip function (limping) and range of motion were evaluted by Harris Hip Score (HHS). The pain&#xD;
      severity during rest and activity in the previous week was evaluted by Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      (VAS). The pain and activity limitation was evaluted by The Roles and maudsley (RM). The&#xD;
      quality of life was evaluted by The EQ-5D-3L scale.&#xD;

    <description>The index consists of questions about pain and activities of daily living, referring to the previous week, and assessments of hip function (limping) and range of motion. Score ranges from 100 (no disability) to 0 (maximum disability).</description>

    <description>The self-evaluation of pain severity during rest and activity in the previous week was calculated using a 10-cm VAS scale, where 0 in the left corner of the scale represented 'no pain' and 10 in the right corner represented 'the worst pain that could be imagined'</description>

    <measure>The Roles and maudsley (RM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in Roles and maudsley score to 1 month and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>RM score was used to evaluate pain and activity limitation as classified in four categories: 1 point = excellent, 2 points = good, 3 points = fair, and 4 points = poor.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-3L scale, which scores five health conditions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) through evaluation at 3 levels (no problems, some problems, or extreme problems), was used to evaluate the quality of life.</description>

    <description>rESWT was administered once per week for 3 weeks with 4 bar pneumatic pressure, 10 Hz frequency, with 2000 pulses. Radial shock waves were transmitted to the greater trochanteric region with the maximum pain/tenderness that was identified with patients' reaction with small circular movements with an adequate amount of contact gel</description>

    <description>PRP injection is performed with a high resolution 7-12-megahertz linear probe ultrasonography device. 15 ml of blood will be drawn from the patients and the blood will be centrifuged for 5 minutes. 4-5 ml PRP will be injected into the affected gluteal tendons accompanied by ultrasonography.</description>
