  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed or known multiple myeloma with newly diagnosed vertebral&#xD;
      lesion(s) will be invited to participate in a cross-sectoral randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      trial will compare two groups of patients which either receive regular medical treatment of&#xD;
      their vertebral lesion(s) or vertebroplasty in addition to regular medical treatment. Our&#xD;
      goal is to investigate the effectiveness of vertebroplasty and determine the role of surgical&#xD;
      treatment in the overall treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and vertebral lesion(s).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients identified by the attending consultant as eligible are invited to participate.&#xD;
      Patients who express an interest in participating will be given written and oral information&#xD;
      on the purpose, nature and implications of study-participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible candidates will be identified at the departments of Hematology where the patients&#xD;
      are treated for their disease. All Danish departments of Hematology will be invited to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hematologist will inform the patient of the protocol and decide if they fulfil the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient wishes to participate the hematologist will&#xD;
      fill out screening forms regarding disease stage, lines of treatment, current disease status,&#xD;
      bisphosphonate status, and pain relief treatment. The hematologist will refer the patient to&#xD;
      their collaborating surgical department. The surgical department will decide if the patient&#xD;
      has contraindications for surgery and inform the patient of the risk of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient decides to participate, he or she will fill out forms regarding ODI, VAS pain&#xD;
      score, QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization, the patients will be divided into two groups, stratifying between&#xD;
      patients with known multiple myeloma with new diagnosed spine fracture and relevant pain ≤ 3&#xD;
      months prior to inclusion and patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with new spine&#xD;
      fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, to ensure balanced control and intervention groups the included patients at&#xD;
      randomization will be stratified according to 1) panned PVP of 1 vs 2-4 levels, and 2) former&#xD;
      vertebral fractures that are not planned treated with PVP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to either PVP treatment or conservative treatment by drawing.&#xD;
      It is therefore not possible for patients to choose between the treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to vertebroplasty will be referred to a facility performing&#xD;
      vertebroplasty. Patients randomized to non-vertebroplasty will receive the departments' usual&#xD;
      care with the option to change treatment arm after 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be performed by the diagnosing clinician, but orchestrated by one&#xD;
      individual central to the clinics. The clinics will receive sealed envelopes containing the&#xD;
      choice of randomization equally divided between PVP and conservative treatment. When all&#xD;
      sealed envelopes have been used for randomization, the clinics will receive new envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will not be possible to randomize more than one patient at a time. All patients will be&#xD;
      contacted by a research nurse on a weekly basis the first 12 weeks after enrolment and after&#xD;
      3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients randomized to vertebroplasty will undergo standard operative treatment involving&#xD;
      a standard scheduled outpatient clinical control with the surgeon 12-weeks post-operative&#xD;
      including long-standing radiographs of the spine.&#xD;
