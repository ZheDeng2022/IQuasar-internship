  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to study the potential skin reaction after repeated&#xD;
      application of an antifungal cream containing trolamine. The study plans to enroll about 32&#xD;
      healthy female or male participants with the age 18 - 79 years. Researchers will apply on the&#xD;
      skin of the upper back between the shoulder blades of the study participants three different&#xD;
      patches to cover a small amount of the antifungal cream or 0.3% solution of sodium lauryl&#xD;
      sulfate, which is known to cause skin irritation (so called positive control). A third patch&#xD;
      will cover a skin area without any product (so called negative control). Participants will&#xD;
      return daily to the study center to have new patches containing the test products applied on&#xD;
      the same skin area of the back, excluding weekends, for 21 days of continuous skin contact.&#xD;
      At each visit the skin will be investigated by the researchers for redness, dryness and other&#xD;
      reactions to learn about the skin reaction after repeated application.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to each patch application and after the last patch removal, the test sites were evaluated for gross changes according to the Erythema Scoring Scale: 0 = No visible erythema; 0.5 = Slight, barely perceptible erythema; 1 = Mild erythema; 2 = Moderate erythema; 3 = Marked erythema; 4 = Severe erythema. The Cumulative Irritation Total is generated by totaling the Erythema Scoring Scale scores of the Investigational Product for each subject completing the trial and then adding those totals.
