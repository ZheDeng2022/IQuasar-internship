      Research background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenomyosis (AD) is a benign uterine disease with endometrial glands and stroma invading into&#xD;
      the myometrium, accompanied by hyperplasia and hypertrophy of uterine smooth muscle cells,&#xD;
      which leads to abnormal uterine structure and function. In non pregnancy period, the main&#xD;
      manifestations are diffuse enlargement of uterus, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, menorrhagia,&#xD;
      which can lead to infertility. In recent years, with the delay of childbearing age, the&#xD;
      incidence of adenomyosis in pregnancy is increasing gradually. The incidence of adenomyosis&#xD;
      in the general population reached 20.9%, while the incidence of adenomyosis was higher in&#xD;
      recurrent abortion and assisted reproduction, reaching 38.2% and 34.7% respectively. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that adenomyosis is associated with early preterm delivery, late preterm delivery,&#xD;
      low birth weight infants, very low birth weight infants, and small for gestational age&#xD;
      infants. Patients with adenomyosis are prone to hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy,&#xD;
      intrauterine infection, abnormal placenta, and increased cesarean section, postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage and abnormal fetal position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin is widely used in the treatment of immune system diseases and the prevention of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular diseases because of its anti-inflammatory and anti platelet aggregation&#xD;
      effects. Aspirin is more and more widely used in obstetrics and Gynecology, such as recurrent&#xD;
      abortion caused by antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, recurrent abortion related to abnormal&#xD;
      uterine artery blood flow and unexplained recurrent abortion. Since 1980, aspirin has been&#xD;
      widely recommended for the prevention of pregnancy with high risk factors of preeclampsia and&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction, and it has been confirmed that aspirin is effective in the&#xD;
      prevention of pregnancy It is safe in clinical application. The inflammatory environment of&#xD;
      adenomyosis is closely related to the initiation of preterm delivery, but whether aspirin can&#xD;
      benefit pregnant women with adenomyosis is still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study population Inclusive criteria: ① Singleton; ② in line with the diagnosis of&#xD;
           adenomyosis in pregnancy; ③ no history of chronic diseases and definite diagnosis of&#xD;
           endocrine diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, antiphospholipid&#xD;
           syndrome; ④ informed consent and voluntary participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria: ① twins / multiple births; ② induced labor for medical reasons; ③&#xD;
           allergic to aspirin or other salicylates, tetracycline drugs or any other components of&#xD;
           drugs; ④ patients with mental disorders; ⑤ transferred to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Withdrawal criteria: Subjects withdraw informed consent; subjects request to withdraw&#xD;
           from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Termination of the experiment: unacceptable adverse events occurred; the subjects&#xD;
           voluntarily asked to withdraw from the trial; the protocol was violated; the researcher&#xD;
           / ethics committee considered it necessary for the subjects to stop the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnostic criteria of adenomyosis: according to pre pregnancy and early pregnancy&#xD;
           transvaginal ultrasound diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria of transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
           for adenomyosis include: (a) ectopic endometrial glands and stroma, (b) myometrium&#xD;
           hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and increased blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size calculation: the incidence of preterm delivery in pregnant women with&#xD;
           adenomyosis was about 21.63% (Mette R. Bruun et al. 2018). It is expected that the&#xD;
           incidence of preterm birth in patients with adenomyosis during pregnancy will be reduced&#xD;
           by 40% after aspirin intervention, that is, the incidence of premature delivery in the&#xD;
           intervention group will be about 12.98%. Assuming that the test level α is 0.05, the&#xD;
           test efficiency is 0.8, and one-sided test, 236 sample sizes are estimated for the&#xD;
           intervention group and the control group by using the sample size estimation software&#xD;
           pass. Considering the loss of follow-up rate of about 10%, the sample size of&#xD;
           intervention group and control group was about 262 cases. Therefore, 550 pregnant women&#xD;
           were recruited in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis plan: the statistical analysis in the study is based on the&#xD;
           principle of intention to treat (ITT), that is, all the subjects involved in the study&#xD;
           participate in the statistical analysis. Chi square test or unpaired t test was used to&#xD;
           analyze the difference between the intervention group and the control group. In the chi&#xD;
           square test, if the theoretical frequency of cells was less than 5, Fisher exact&#xD;
           probability method was used, and the Mann Whitney U test was used for quantitative&#xD;
           variables that did not conform to normal distribution. Chi square test was used to&#xD;
           analyze the difference of preterm birth rate between intervention group and control&#xD;
           group. Logistic regression model was used to estimate the relative risk value and 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval (95% confidence interval) of preterm birth between the two groups.&#xD;
           The choice of statistical analysis method for secondary outcome indicators was&#xD;
           consistent with that in primary outcome analysis. SAS viya was used as the analysis&#xD;
           software in the study, and the difference was statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      research implementation process: research steps (describe the data collection content and&#xD;
      method according to the time node) 2020.10-2020.12：we distributed recruitment advertisements,&#xD;
      prepared placebos and aspirin, screened and enrolled patients, signed informed consent, and&#xD;
      arranged outpatient follow-up of enrolled patients; 2021.01-2021.06：150 cases of pregnant&#xD;
      women with adenomyosis were planned to be enrolled, and the registration and follow-up of the&#xD;
      patients were done well; 2021.07-2021.12：150 cases of pregnant women with adenomyosis were&#xD;
      planned to be enrolled; the experimental data were summarized gradually; the information of&#xD;
      defect was recorded; 2022.01-2022.06：150 cases of pregnancy with adenomyosis were planned to&#xD;
      be enrolled, the pregnancy outcomes of the pregnant women were counted, and the case report&#xD;
      forms were completed; 2022.07-2022.09： we plan to complete the work of 50 cases of pregnancy&#xD;
      with adenomyosis, analyze the data statistically, write papers and final reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of study: placebo had no effect on subjects; adverse reactions of aspirin mainly&#xD;
      included gastrointestinal reactions, risk of fetal teratogenesis before 12 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy, and risk of bleeding during pregnancy. However, since 1980, aspirin has been&#xD;
      widely used in the prevention of pregnancy with high risk factors of preeclampsia and fetal&#xD;
      growth restriction, which proves that the probability of adverse reactions of low-dose&#xD;
      aspirin is very low, no teratogenic effect is found, and it has clinical safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of the study: expected to reduce the incidence of preterm birth and improve adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes. In order to explore the prevention and treatment of premature delivery&#xD;
      and adverse pregnancy outcomes, it is necessary to provide a new therapeutic target, fill in&#xD;
      the blank of the effective prevention of premature birth treatment of pregnancy combined with&#xD;
      adenomyosis at home and abroad, which may reduce the medical costs related to pregnancy&#xD;
      complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as the cost of dealing with adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes. This study has important clinical application value and social and&#xD;
      economic benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and protection measures of subjects There are recruitment advertisements in this&#xD;
      study, and other documents are provided; Protective measures for the subjects: in order to&#xD;
      reduce the adverse reactions of aspirin as far as possible, we used aspirin enteric coated&#xD;
      tablets, 50mg, twice a day, the dosage belongs to low dose. From 12 weeks of gestation to 36&#xD;
      weeks of gestation. If you have bleeding during pregnancy, you need to stop taking aspirin,&#xD;
      and you can continue to take aspirin after the bleeding disappears. The number of follow-up&#xD;
      visits during pregnancy is roughly the same as that of general prenatal examination (about 10&#xD;
      times), without additional visits; about 5ml more blood will be drawn for examination on the&#xD;
      day of establishing pregnancy card, and the extra examination cost will be borne by the&#xD;
      research group; we will arrange experienced doctors to take charge of the whole pregnancy&#xD;
      examination of the subjects and keep communication at any time. We will pay more attention to&#xD;
      the subject's gastrointestinal reaction, tinnitus, erythema, liver and kidney function and&#xD;
      other discomfort during each birth examination. If there is any abnormality, we will take the&#xD;
      following measures: (1) immediately stop your experiment if the condition requires; (2) be&#xD;
      responsible for the treatment of your adverse drug reactions; (3) give appropriate economic&#xD;
      compensation according to the degree of your injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent process: the subject's informed consent work is in charge of a specially&#xD;
      assigned person, who will provide sufficient and easy to understand information to the&#xD;
      pregnant women who meet the inclusion conditions; the subjects of informed consent are all&#xD;
      those with independent ability, and they will not be able to participate in this project if&#xD;
      they have no independent ability; there will be no pressure on pregnant women who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion conditions in the process of informed consent. In the process of participating in&#xD;
      the research, it will ensure that research participants get timely information (including&#xD;
      their rights, safety and health).&#xD;
