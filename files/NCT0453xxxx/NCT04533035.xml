    <textblock>
      In acute lower limb ischemia the main goal of the treatment is to restore the blood before&#xD;
      irreversible damage to the soft tissues of the limb. Delays in identifying acute lower limb&#xD;
      ischemia may lead to limb loss or lead to the loss of the patient. Situations in which the&#xD;
      patient is unable to express symptoms of the acute lower limb ischemia, such as during&#xD;
      general anesthesia, in intensive care, or immediately after vascular surgery, are challenging&#xD;
      for medical staff to identify. A reliable, easy-to-use and non-invasive monitoring method is&#xD;
      not yet in every day use. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that Near InfraRed&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring is such a monitoring method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tourniquet induced ischemia is often used in hallux valgus surgery because it offers a&#xD;
      bloodless view of the anatomical structures. In our study we will measure the soft tissue&#xD;
      perfusion (rSO2) of the lower limbs during the whole operation. The sensors based on&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy will be located to the tibial surface and will record the normal&#xD;
      state before the start of the tourniquet, during the tourniquet and also in the recovery&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that rSO2 decreases linearly as a function of time from the beginning of&#xD;
      the tourniquet induced ischemia and the recovery time depends on the duration of the&#xD;
      tourniquet. In our study the patients will be operated under a spinal anesthesia. We also&#xD;
      hypothesise that rSO2 increases due to the induction of the spinal anesthesia. Our goal is to&#xD;
      define the percentual decline of rSO2 that is significant for lower limb ischemia and also&#xD;
      its time response to induction of ischemia.&#xD;
