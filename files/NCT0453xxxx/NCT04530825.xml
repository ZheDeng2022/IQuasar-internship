  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of a novel, Health Information&#xD;
      Technology behavior change tool in a single clinic setting. The PREVENT tool is the first&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR)-compatible tool that both tailors evidence-based behavior&#xD;
      change strategies and incorporates community-level data specific to each patient into routine&#xD;
      care. The central hypothesis is that PREVENT will improve patient's attitudes towards&#xD;
      behavior change recommendations, increase adherence to recommended behavior change and&#xD;
      improve cardiovascular health. Fifty adolescents will be randomized to intervention or&#xD;
      wait-list, routine care control to assess the preliminary effectiveness of PREVENT.&#xD;
      Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used among patients, parents and providers to&#xD;
      examine barriers to current and future implementation of the PREVENT tool to inform adoption&#xD;
      and maintenance.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in minutes of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured using a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+, Actigraph of Ft. Walton Beach, FL). The participant will be instructed to wear the accelerometer on an elasticized belt, on the left mid-axillary line. The Actigraph is one of the most common accelerometers used for scientific purposes. Participants will be encouraged to wear the accelerometer 24-hours per day for at least 7-days, including 2 weekend days. Participants will also complete a brief Health Behavior &amp; Attitudes Survey.</description>
