  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of using orthodontic bands with glass&#xD;
      ionomer cement to arrest or reverse interproximal lesions as a preventive treatment compared&#xD;
      to monitoring and oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that placing orthodontic bands with glass ionomer cement will&#xD;
      arrest and possibly remineralize incipient carious lesions compared to teeth that are being&#xD;
      monitored without intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the efficacy of orthodontic bands and glass ionomer&#xD;
      cement in arresting and remineralizing incipient carious lesions as compared to monitoring&#xD;
      for changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single blinded, split mouth randomized control trial, with the patient being their&#xD;
      own control. A split mouth study is considered the gold standard because both experimental&#xD;
      and control groups are exposed to the same environmet and conditions within the mouth. This&#xD;
      study design eliminates confounding variables that may occur that could significantly alter&#xD;
      the interpretation of end results (e.g. oral hygiene effectiveness between two patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened at their routine periodic dental examination, where they will&#xD;
      receive a dental exam, prophylaxis (cleaning), radiographs and fluoride varnish application&#xD;
      in accordance with the guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.&#xD;
      Radiographs will be examined by an evaluator to determine if participants meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Each participant requires at least one pair of permanent posterior teeth with&#xD;
      interproximal caries lesions in enamel or in proximity of the dentinal enamel junction (E1,&#xD;
      E2, early D1). An ideal pair consists of the same tooth type on the left and right side of&#xD;
      the mouth (i.e. tooth #5 and #12, maxillary right permanent first premolar and maxillary left&#xD;
      permanent first premolar). Another acceptable type of pair is same tooth type (i.e. tooth #5&#xD;
      and #21, maxillary right permanent first premolar and mandibular left permanent first&#xD;
      premolar) or two adjacent teeth (i.e tooth #19 and 18 mandibular left first and second&#xD;
      molar). Additionally, patients may also be screened when coming in for other dental treatment&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will have his or her qualifying lesions randomized equally into two groups,&#xD;
      one that will receive the band, and one that will not. Envelopes will contain the treatment&#xD;
      conditions: Left/Upper/Distal or Right/Lower/Mesial, to indicate that the lesion on either&#xD;
      the left/upper/distal or right/lower/mesial side of the mouth will get banded. They will be&#xD;
      randomly organized and then ordered in the box.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization has occurred, each participant will have a blank orthodontic band&#xD;
      (Denovo) fitted on the treatment lesion and cemented with glass ionomer cement (Fuji).&#xD;
      Additionally, oral hygiene instructions will be reinforced. Participants will be instructed&#xD;
      to return for their routine periodic dental exam in 6 months. Because the intervention is&#xD;
      obvious, blinding the patient or the operator is not possible. At the 6 month visit, the band&#xD;
      will be removed with a band remover prior to their dental exam and cleaning. Routine&#xD;
      radiographs (according to the AAPD's radiographic guidelines) will be taken after the band&#xD;
      has been removed. 20,21,22&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded second investigator will examine the pre and post treatment radiographs. Lesions&#xD;
      will be classified initially by ADA CCS, and change will be noted as: progression, arrest, or&#xD;
      regression. A de-identified data sheet containing the data will be sent to a statistician and&#xD;
      a McNemar's Chi-square test will be used to test the differences in the lesion status of both&#xD;
      groups&#xD;
