  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic conjunctivitis is one of the most common comorbidities of allergic diseases,&#xD;
      especially of allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhinoconjunctivitis is an allergic condition of the nasal mucosa and the eyes. Conjunctivitis&#xD;
      is triggered by hypersensitivity to certain pollens and other airborne allergens and causes&#xD;
      several symptoms such as reddened eyes, itchy eyes and can cause watery eyes and a scratchy&#xD;
      feeling in the eye. Tacrolimus is a well-known immunosuppressiv active substance which is&#xD;
      hardly soluble in water. Within Tacrosolv, Tacrolimus is completely dissolves in aqueous&#xD;
      solution. The effectiveness of Tacrosolv will be tested for treatment of allergic&#xD;
      conjunctivitis. Allergic subjects will be treated with aqueous formulation of tacrolimus&#xD;
      'Tacrosolv 50 micrograms per milliliter, eye drops' for 8 days. On day 1 and day 8 allergic&#xD;
      patients will be challenged with grass pollen for a period of 4 hours and subjective allergic&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, crossover, double-blind, single site trial in adult&#xD;
      subjects (18-65 years of age) who have demonstrated grass specific Immunglobulin E (IgE)&#xD;
      reactivity and have a history of grass pollen induced rhinoconjunctivitis with or without&#xD;
      controlled asthma. The crossover design will ensure that individual subjects will receive&#xD;
      either one drop Tacrosolv compared to two drops placebo or 2 drops Tacrosolv compared to 1&#xD;
      drop placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of two doses of&#xD;
      Tacrosolv on day 8 of treatment. To assure full blinding, two study populations are treated&#xD;
      in a crossover design against placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be based on the assessment of ocular symptoms during grass pollen&#xD;
      challenge performed in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (environmental exposure chamber).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the onset of action of either dose of&#xD;
      Tacrosolv on day one of treatment as well as efficacy differences between low dose and high&#xD;
      dose treatment on day eight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one week prior to first treatment block, subjects will be screened for appropriate&#xD;
      allergic response during a grass pollen challenge chamber session. A total ocular symptom&#xD;
      score (TOSS) of at least 4 points out of 12 within the first two hours in the grass pollen&#xD;
      challenge chamber is required to be included into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the screening provocation the medical and allergic history, safety lab as well&#xD;
      as retrieving inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed via anamnesis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      all safety assessments will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Visit 1 and visit 2 could be done on the same day!&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 &amp; 5: Day1 of the respective treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment arms (fully blinded)&#xD;
      in the order of their screening numbers assigned at visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will attend the study site about two hours ahead of the start of allergen&#xD;
      provocation. After positive completion of all study relevant assessments, baseline values for&#xD;
      symptom scores will be assessed approximately 45 minutes before entering the grass pollen&#xD;
      challenge chamber. Subjects will receive their first treatment 30 minutes before entering the&#xD;
      challenge chamber. During the 4 hours grass pollen challenge subjective and objective&#xD;
      assessments will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjective ocular symptom score, as well as the other symptom scores, will be recorded&#xD;
      every fifteen minutes during a 4-hour allergen exposure challenge. Before and after&#xD;
      provocation session several ocular assessments will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the allergen challenge, subjects will receive study medication for the home treatment&#xD;
      phase (days 2 to 7) and continue treatment into each conjunctival sac once a day (in the&#xD;
      morning) until day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 &amp; 6: Day8 of respective treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 8 of their respective treatment block, subjects will attend the study site about two&#xD;
      hours before provocation starts. Before receiving their last treatment dose, baseline symptom&#xD;
      scores will be assessed. Subjects will take their last treatment dosage approximately half an&#xD;
      hour before entering the challenge chamber for a 4-hour allergen exposure challenge.&#xD;
      Subjective symptom scores will be recorded every fifteen minutes. Slit lamp biomicroscopy&#xD;
      including all other ocular assessments as mentioned above will be performed before and after&#xD;
      the provocation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the respective study treatments, a wash-out period of at least 13 days must be&#xD;
      adhered to allowing complete dissipation of the previous treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the wash-out period, subjects change to their respective next treatment block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire trial, subjects will be asked to monitor for adverse events (AEs), and they&#xD;
      will record the use of concomitant medications on the provided form. Female subjects of&#xD;
      child-bearing potential will complete a urine pregnancy test during screening and on D1 of&#xD;
      each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following parameters will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective symptom score (nasal, ocular, respiratory) during the grass pollen challenge&#xD;
           lasting for 4 hours - every 15 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active anterior rhinomanometry (AAR) - every 60 minutes&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Objective ocular measurements performed in the following order so that one does not&#xD;
           affect the other:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Break up time (BUT): Tear break up time will be measured following the guidelines&#xD;
                published in the Report of the International Dry Eye Work Shop (DEWS) 2007.13&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Staining of the conjunctiva with lissamine green: it stains epithelial cells only&#xD;
                if the cell membrane is damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Staining of the cornea with fluorescein: Principally for assessing corneal damage,&#xD;
                fluorescein should be instilled in a similar way, but with the excess saline on the&#xD;
                strip shaken off to instill a minimal volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conjunctival chemosis: Lid-parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF) will be evaluated&#xD;
                with a slit-lamp microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conjunctival redness: The most common clinical sign that is suggestive of ocular&#xD;
                surface inflammation is conjunctival redness. Ocular redness can be easily detected&#xD;
                with a pen torch or standard slit lamp biomicroscopic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Slit lamp microscopy: Assessment of eyelid edema and conjunctival papillae.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Safety laboratory assessments: Complete blood count with differential, blood chemistry,&#xD;
           liver function, urine dipstick test - at screening visit, serology at screening and drug&#xD;
           of abuse test on investigator's decision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin Prick Test with skin prick test solution (Manufacturer Allergopharma) - at&#xD;
           Screening or within the previous 12 months&#xD;
