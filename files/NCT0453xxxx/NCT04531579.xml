  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a drug called valproic acid (VPA) will protect&#xD;
      organs (such as the kidneys) from damage when a person is injured and loses a large amount of&#xD;
      blood. The organs may not get enough blood or oxygen when a patient loses a lot of blood.&#xD;
      After the patient receives fluids such as blood, plasma, or saline and the bleeding is&#xD;
      stopped, blood and oxygen return to the organs. This process called ischemia/reperfusion&#xD;
      (I/R) is known to cause injury to organs such as the kidneys and heart. VPA is an approved&#xD;
      drug for treating conditions like seizures and migraines for many years. However, it is not&#xD;
      approved for use at the higher dose that will be used in this study or for protecting organs&#xD;
      from I/R injury. This study will enroll trauma patients and randomly assign them to receive&#xD;
      either VPA diluted in salt water or salt water without VPA (placebo) and then follow the&#xD;
      patients and compare their organ function and overall outcome. This study is masked meaning&#xD;
      that the patients, doctors, and nurses will not know which patient received which treatment.&#xD;
      The study treatment will be given in addition to the care that trauma patients normally&#xD;
      receive to treat their injuries. The researchers doing this study believe that VPA will&#xD;
      lessen organ injury caused by I/R, meaning that patients who receive VPA will experience less&#xD;
      kidney injury when compared to patients who receive the placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      I/R injury is a critical condition that causes cell damage and organ dysfunction and&#xD;
      contributes to morbidity and mortality in a wide range of pathologies. Ischemia is defined as&#xD;
      hypoperfusion of tissues, which can occur in conditions such as hemorrhage, sepsis, organ&#xD;
      transplantation, and acute coronary syndrome. An imbalance in metabolic supply and demand&#xD;
      within the ischemic organ results in tissue hypoxia and microvascular dysfunction. Among&#xD;
      trauma patients who have suffered significant blood loss and prolonged hypotension requiring&#xD;
      multiple vasopressors, the kidney frequently shows injury due to significant I/R. The rate of&#xD;
      acute kidney injury (AKI) in trauma patients is reported to be between 25-30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VPA is an anticonvulsant drug that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in&#xD;
      1978. VPA was developed for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      seizure disorders, mania associated with bipolar disorder, and migraine. Both oral and&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) formulations are available. Doses up to 60 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day&#xD;
      for up to 14 days have been demonstrated to be safe and effective. More recently, a study has&#xD;
      shown that a single dose of intravenous VPA at up to 140 mg/kg is safe in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      VPA has been recognized as an histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) shown to reduce the&#xD;
      inflammatory response and oxidative stress in septic mice, thereby protecting against renal&#xD;
      injury. The molecular mechanisms conferring anticonvulsant properties associated with VPA&#xD;
      have not been clearly elucidated to date, but likely include increasing levels of&#xD;
      Î³-aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system (CNS), reduction in&#xD;
      N-Methyl-D-Aspartate-mediated excitation, and blockade of voltage gated sodium and L-type&#xD;
      calcium channels. More recently, VPA has shown HDACI potential, specifically targeting class&#xD;
      I (subclasses Ia and Ib) and class II (subclass IIa) HDAC proteins. Given that VPA modulates&#xD;
      multiple pathways involved in AKI, it theoretically could prevent kidney dysfunction and&#xD;
      inflammation that is induced by I/R injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of VPA on reducing I/R injury related to&#xD;
      organ damage in the kidneys in trauma patients with moderate-to-severe hemorrhage. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of VPA on reducing AKI compared&#xD;
      with placebo in trauma patients with expected moderated-to-severe hemorrhage at risk for I/R&#xD;
      injury. The two secondary objectives are: 1) To assess the post-infusion pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of VPA in trauma patients with moderate-to-severe hemorrhage at risk of I/R injury, and&#xD;
      2) To evaluate the safety of VPA administered as IV infusion in trauma patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe hemorrhage at risk of I/R injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 2, single-dose, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 140 mg/kg of&#xD;
      VPA plus standard of care (SOC) or the placebo plus SOC, administered via IV infusion within&#xD;
      3 hours (ideally 1 hour) after admittance to the emergency department (ED). Clinical&#xD;
      evaluations such as physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory&#xD;
      results will be collected. AKI will be used to assess VPA efficacy. Myocardial injury and&#xD;
      laboratory measurements (hematology, chemistry, coagulation profile, and urinalysis) will be&#xD;
      used to monitor subject safety. Outcome measures including in-hospital mortality, length of&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) and/or stepdown unit (SDU) stay, length of hospital stay, number of&#xD;
      alive and ventilator free days (aVFD), and incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) will&#xD;
      also be collected. Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis. The PK analysis will&#xD;
      correlate study drug exposures with safety profiles. Specimens (plasma, peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and urine) will be stored for future undetermined study-related&#xD;
      analyses, including pharmacodynamics (PD) and VPA responsiveness studies. These studies may&#xD;
      correlate PK profiles to molecular changes related to beneficial properties of VPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female hemorrhaging trauma patients between 18 and&#xD;
      80 years old will be recruited for the study. Trauma patients will be those whose arrival to&#xD;
      the ED results in trauma team activation. Only patients who can provide consent or for whom a&#xD;
      Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) can provide consent, will be enrolled. Approximately&#xD;
      50 subjects will be recruited from across two major medical centers for participation in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available safety profile data from multi-dose clinical trials of VPA, the&#xD;
      product safety information sheet, as well as the VPA Phase 1 study which evaluated the safety&#xD;
      of single ascending doses of VPA, it has been determined that a dose of 140 mg/kg is safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated with minimal adverse reactions. However, given that patients studied at the&#xD;
      140 mg/kg dose in the phase 1 study were relatively healthy compared to the proposed patient&#xD;
      population in this study and unanticipated Adverse Events (AEs) may occur, the study team&#xD;
      will monitor all study subjects closely for AEs throughout the study. All AEs will be&#xD;
      evaluated for duration, seriousness, severity, and relationship to the study drug, and&#xD;
      reported accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be monitored according to the data and safety monitoring plan which will&#xD;
      outline the different levels of monitoring and the responsible parties. A Safety Review&#xD;
      Committee (SRC) will review and monitor all safety information and compliance data as well as&#xD;
      the overall study progress on a regular basis. A Medical Monitor (MM) with relevant clinical&#xD;
      and research expertise will oversee the clinical study and provide ongoing medical&#xD;
      monitoring. The clinical site Principal Investigators (PIs) will be responsible for ensuring&#xD;
      that all AEs that occur in subjects during the AE reporting period are managed and reported&#xD;
      in accordance with the protocol, Sponsor requirements, and any applicable regulations and&#xD;
      institutional policies. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor implementation and&#xD;
      progress of the study and review the accumulating endpoint and safety data by treatment arm&#xD;
      to detect evidence of early significant benefit or harm for subjects while the study is in&#xD;
      progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of VPA in the study population and to&#xD;
      investigate efficacy signal, this is a proof-of-concept (PoC) study. Because it is a PoC&#xD;
      study rather than a confirmatory one, it has been assumed that a total sample size of 50&#xD;
      subjects (25 in each treatment arm) will be sufficient to provide adequate clinical evidence&#xD;
      of safety and potential efficacy, and to support decision-making on whether a larger pivotal&#xD;
      confirmatory Phase 3 study would be justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical analysis plan (SAP) that details the analytical principles and statistical&#xD;
      techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives will be&#xD;
      developed. Demographic and relevant baseline characteristics will be presented and summarized&#xD;
      descriptively by treatment for the randomized, modified intent-to-treat (mITT), and&#xD;
      per-protocol (PP) populations. The primary endpoint of KDIGO stages will be measured in&#xD;
      ordinal scale as 0, 1, 2, or 3, where 0 indicates normal renal function and the progressively&#xD;
      higher values indicate worsening renal function. The ordinal scale measurements will be&#xD;
      analyzed using the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. The KDIGO stages will&#xD;
      be the dependent variable and drug treatment will be used as the independent variable. The&#xD;
      common odds ratio across the KDIGO stages and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated.&#xD;
      Binary endpoints (e.g., incidence of AKI) will be analyzed by Fisher's exact test or logistic&#xD;
      regression with treatment as an independent variable. The odds ratio and its 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval will be calculated. Continuous outcomes will be analyzed by missed effects models&#xD;
      with treatment and baseline value of the outcome (if applicable) as independent variables.&#xD;
      Un-ordered categorical variables with more than two levels of outcome will be analyzed by a&#xD;
      chi-square test. Ordered categorical variables with more than two levels of outcome will be&#xD;
      analyzed in the same way as for the primary endpoint. Safety endpoints will be analyzed and&#xD;
      summarized descriptively. Categorical variables will be summarized by count and percentage.&#xD;
      Odds ratios and relative risks may be calculated to compare study drug with placebo in&#xD;
      incidence of certain safety events. Continuous variables will be summarized by mean, SD,&#xD;
      median, minimum, and maximum. Shift tables may be used to describe changes in certain&#xD;
      laboratory values. The plan for the PK analysis is two-fold. First, a standard&#xD;
      noncompartmental analysis will be performed to obtain descriptors of VPA exposure to explore&#xD;
      potential relationships to the primary outcome), secondary outcomes, or any observed adverse&#xD;
      effects. A population PK analysis will be performed to examine and, perhaps, explain the&#xD;
      anticipated differing PK of VPA in the trial. Specifically, low protein binding of VPA and&#xD;
      massive blood loss are expected to affect the elimination clearance and, perhaps, the volume&#xD;
      of distribution of VPA. Characterizing the degree to which the PK are perturbed as well as&#xD;
      the parameter variability in this population will be important for analyzing the relationship&#xD;
      of VPA exposure to primary and secondary outcomes and determining the effects, if any, of&#xD;
      factors related to disease or perioperative conditions to the PK of VPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analyses will be performed for this study. This study does not have a formal&#xD;
      stopping rule based on statistical testing. See Section 3.9 for more information on stopping&#xD;
      rules. Missing data can occur in clinical studies, and they may have an impact on the results&#xD;
      of statistical analyses. Every effort will be made to ensure that the amount of missing data&#xD;
      is kept at a minimum.&#xD;
