  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the investigators will test tools designed to more precisely identify,&#xD;
      define and create a radiation treatment plan to tumor remnants as separate from fibrotic or&#xD;
      normal tissue in a Magnetic Resonance (MR) simulator in the department of radiation oncology.&#xD;
      The investigators will examine if this beneficial for tumor versus normal tissue delineation,&#xD;
      will result in more precise tumor targeting with radiation in an efficient manner and whether&#xD;
      there would be fewer toxicities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical research study following patients for toxicity after brachytherapy,&#xD;
      and the investigators will be using the D2cc as a surrogate biomarker for determining risk&#xD;
      for toxicity in addition to utilizing toxicity measured from physician-queries using the&#xD;
      Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 4.0). Patients will have images&#xD;
      analyzed for quantification of residual tumor versus fibrosis. The investigators will utilize&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance (MR) tracking, and pilot test: an endovaginal coil, a deflectable Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance stylet, real-time planning software, and auto-segmentation of normal tissues and&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard T2-weighted MR images are generally recommended given the soft-tissue visualization&#xD;
      without the need for contrast media injection. At the time of brachytherapy, acquisition of&#xD;
      para-axial, para-sagittal and para-coronal images should be performed with the orientations&#xD;
      being orthogonal (para-axial) and parallel (para-sagittal/para-coronal) to the intrauterine&#xD;
      tandem. Slice thickness has a direct impact on applicator reconstruction accuracy, and a&#xD;
      slice thickness of â‰¤3mm is required on the NRG Oncology study (NRG-GY006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More advanced multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mmpMRI) series show significant&#xD;
      promise. A Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) study identified one voxel cluster consisting of&#xD;
      low-enhancing voxels based on the relative signal increase (RSI) time series that was related&#xD;
      to locoregional control (adjusted p-value 0.048). Diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI is used to&#xD;
      identify areas of dense residual tumor.31 In one analysis, the mean apparent diffusion&#xD;
      coefficient (ADC) value of the primary tumor on pretreatment MRI was an independent predictor&#xD;
      of disease-free survival in cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiation. However,&#xD;
      artifacts result in inconsistent contouring at the time of brachytherapy. 3D Slicer is a free&#xD;
      open source software application for medical image computing, and will be utilized for some&#xD;
      aspects of research in MR Simulator Suite.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to&#xD;
        participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma. Central&#xD;
