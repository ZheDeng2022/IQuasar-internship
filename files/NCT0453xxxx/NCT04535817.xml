  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the publication of two case studies that reported behavioral benefit in ASD&#xD;
      patients treated with omalizumab, the investigators will conduct a pilot trial to test the&#xD;
      proof-of-concept efficacy of omalizumab in ASD patients with comorbid atopic disease.&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate behavioral improvement using three questionnaires. Investigators&#xD;
      will also perform fMRI on all subjects and obtain serum samples for quantification of&#xD;
      immunological biomarkers. If the trial is conclusive, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      larger-scale, randomized-controlled trial to further understand the pathology of allergy in&#xD;
      this subpopulation of ASD patients and the efficacy of this intervention.&#xD;

      This clinical trial is a Phase I, single-arm, open-label study. All 20 subjects will be given&#xD;
      the same dosage of the study drug. Following baseline testing, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      treatment during a 24 week treatment period and will receive six subcutaneous injections&#xD;
      total, one injection every 4 weeks. A 24-week follow-up period after the treatment period&#xD;
      will be concluded with patient interview. Behavioral questionnaires will be administered&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the trial. fMRI will be conducted at baseline and at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the treatment period. Blood will be drawn for serum testing at baseline, at&#xD;
      Week 12 during the treatment period, and at the conclusion of the treatment period. Vitals&#xD;
      and CGI will also be assessed throughout the trial.&#xD;
