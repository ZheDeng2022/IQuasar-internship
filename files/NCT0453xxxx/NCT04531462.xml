    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the efficacy of empagliflozin 10 mg after 52 weeks compared to&#xD;
      placebo in elderly patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to explore if&#xD;
      empagliflozin has any impact on patient physical condition compared to placebo in elderly&#xD;
      patients with T2DM.&#xD;
