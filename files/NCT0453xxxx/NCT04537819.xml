  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The problem of acute tonsillitis (AT) is one of the most urgent in modern clinical medicine.&#xD;
      The prevalence of pathology ranges from 2 to 15% of the total population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AT (ICD J03.0-J03.9) in most cases is due to viral infections. Bacterial acute tonsillitis&#xD;
      occurs in immunocompetent children in 20-30% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the indications for antibacterial therapy, the Mclsaac scale is a commonly used&#xD;
      tool for decision. This scale is used to classify patients according to their symptoms and to&#xD;
      determine the patients for whom antibiotic therapy is not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in most cases of acute tonsillitis (even if there are 4-5 points according to the&#xD;
      scale), it has to be taken into account that there is a low probability of the presence of&#xD;
      GABS. Therefore, there are no unconditional indications for the prescription of antibiotics.&#xD;
      Unjustified antibiotic therapy of AT plays a significant role in the formation of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent unjustified prescription of antibiotics, a therapeutic concept of delayed&#xD;
      administration is proposed. A patient with AT is prescribed treatment with antibiotics in a&#xD;
      delayed manner. In the absence of a positive effect within 36-48 hours from the beginning of&#xD;
      treatment with Imupret, the antibacterial therapy is started. The advantage of deferred&#xD;
      antibiotic prescription is, that a higher number of patients and doctors, awaiting antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, may be more agreeable with this way of treatment than with a complete rejection of&#xD;
      the antibiotic's prescription. So delayed use of antibiotics is an important treatment&#xD;
      strategy to reduce the number of unreasonable prescriptions of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering this fact, it becomes necessary to use drugs with a complex effect and&#xD;
      evidence-based efficacy base for acute tonsillitis. At the moment, there is an insignificant&#xD;
      evidence base for the application of the phytoneering drug Imupret in acute tonsillitis. The&#xD;
      spectrum of its pharmacological properties includes antiviral, antibacterial,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating effects. The combination of these properties makes it&#xD;
      possible to influence practically all parts of acute tonsillitis. The already existing&#xD;
      studies were not conducted under GCP conditions. Confirmation of the high effectiveness of&#xD;
      Imupret in the treatment of acute tonsillitis would serve as a rationale for optimizing the&#xD;
      treatment regimen of this nosology and recommendations for the inclusion of the drug in&#xD;
      national guidelines.&#xD;

      Study of Therapeutic Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Imupret application in the&#xD;
      therapeutic concept of delayed prescription of antibiotics in patients with severe acute&#xD;
      tonsillitis in children, aged 6-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute tonsillitis in most cases is due to viral infections. Bacterial tonsillitis occurs in&#xD;
      immunocompetent children in 20-30% of cases, adults - in 5-15%, and the most frequent cause&#xD;
      of it is β-hemolytic streptococcus group A (GABS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute tonsillitis is defined as the sudden appearance of the following symptoms: sore throat,&#xD;
      hyperemia, edema of the tonsils, increase in swollen lymph nodes, and non-specific additional&#xD;
      symptoms like fever, weakness, and joint pain. There are no pathognomonic symptoms of&#xD;
      bacterial tonsillitis. To assess the patient's condition and to determine the indications for&#xD;
      antibacterial therapy, the Mclsaac scale is a commonly used tool for decision. This scale is&#xD;
      used to classify patients according to their symptoms and to determine the patients for whom&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy is not indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McIsaac scale (sum of scores) The probability of the identification of β-hemolytic&#xD;
      streptococcus in a smear from pharynx -1 or 0 - 1% 1-10% 2 ~17% 3 ~35% 4 or 5 ~50% Thus, in&#xD;
      most cases of acute tonsillitis (even if there are 4-5 points according to the scale), it&#xD;
      must be considered that there is a low probability of the presence of GABS. Therefore, there&#xD;
      are no unconditional indications for the prescription of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unjustified antibiotic therapy of acute tonsillitis based on &quot;sore throat&quot; or &quot;exudate&#xD;
      (plaque) tonsils&quot; only does not affect pain and lads the formation of antibiotic resistance.&#xD;
      In order to avoid the irrational use of antibiotics, one should distinguish the desire of the&#xD;
      patient or his parents to get rid of the pain, from the rational assessment of the doctor for&#xD;
      all pros and cons about an antibacterial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent the unjustified prescription of antibiotics, a therapeutic concept of delayed&#xD;
      administration is proposed. A patient with acute tonsillitis is prescribed treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics in a delayed manner. In the absence of positive dynamics within 36-48 hours from&#xD;
      the beginning of treatment with Imupret the antibacterial therapy is started. The advantage&#xD;
      of deferred antibiotic prescription is, that a higher number of patients and doctors,&#xD;
      awaiting antibiotic therapy, may be more agreeable with this way of treatment than with a&#xD;
      complete rejection of the antibiotic's prescription. Therefore, the delayed use of&#xD;
      antibiotics is an important treatment strategy to reduce the number of unreasonable&#xD;
      prescriptions of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering this fact, it becomes necessary to use drugs with a complex effect on the main&#xD;
      processes of pathogenesis and have an evidence-based efficacy for acute tonsillitis. Now,&#xD;
      there is an insignificant evidence base for the application of the herbal drug Imupret in&#xD;
      acute tonsillitis. The spectrum of its pharmacological properties includes antiviral,&#xD;
      antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating effects. Additionally, a good safety&#xD;
      profile allows to consider Imupret as an adequate basic therapy for the treatment of acute&#xD;
      tonsillitis in the therapeutic concept of delayed prescription of antibiotics. The already&#xD;
      existing studies were not conducted under GCP conditions. Confirmation of the high&#xD;
      effectiveness of Imupret in the treatment of acute tonsillitis would serve as a rationale for&#xD;
      optimizing the treatment regimen of this nosology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed trial design: open-label, exploratory, comparative, multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      prospective, parallel-group study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison group (n = 100): soft diet; elimination of factors that irritate the mucous&#xD;
      membrane of the pharynx (thermal, chemical); local NSAIDs - benzydamine hydrochloride (Tantum&#xD;
      Verde); acetaminophen as antipyretic if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main group (n=100): soft diet; elimination of factors that irritate the mucous membrane&#xD;
      of the pharynx (thermal, chemical); local NSAIDs - benzydamine hydrochloride; Imupret oral&#xD;
      drops in the age-related dosage of 6 times per day for 6 days with the subsequent transition&#xD;
      to the regime of 15 drops / 3 times in a day according to the patient's condition;&#xD;
      acetaminophen as antipyretic, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of visits. During the study, 3 planned visits: Visit 1 (The 1-st day): screening,&#xD;
      randomization, and treatment; evaluation by Mc Isaac Score scale; LTM Scale (Local&#xD;
      Tonsillitis Manifestation Scale): (5 symptoms: Sore throat at swallowing (0 - absent, 1 -&#xD;
      mild, 2 - moderate, 3 - severe / pronounced); Sore throat at rest; Throat irritation at rest;&#xD;
      Palatine tonsils hyperemia; Palatine tonsils edema); Patients self-assessment (VAS; 0-10).&#xD;
      Visit 2 (3rd±1 day): intermediate evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment -&#xD;
      clarification of the patient's condition, the need to prescribe an antibiotic; evaluation by&#xD;
      LTM Scale, patients' self-assessment (VAS; 0-10). Visit 3: intermediate evaluation of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment (day 5-day ±1) via telephone (or visit if necessary); patients'&#xD;
      self-assessment (VAS; 0-10). Visit 4: final (10th day ±1 day). Evaluation by LTM Scale&#xD;
      (0-15), patients' self-assessment (VAS; 0-10). 5 Follow up; day 28: evaluation of the&#xD;
      long-term effects of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unscheduled visit can be made if the patient's condition worsens (according to the patient&#xD;
      and/or the researcher, including if the symptoms of the disease persist or worsen, including&#xD;
      but not limited to an increase in the temperature in the armpit above 38.0 ° C at the 3rd&#xD;
      and/or subsequent days of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the treatment: 10 days. The total duration of the study for one patient&#xD;
      is no longer than 38 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study: To investigate the influence of Imupret prescriptions in the&#xD;
      therapeutic concept of delayed prescription of antibiotics to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  need for antibiotics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  regression of the tonsillitis symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of antipyretics administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed parameters of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The severity of symptoms of tonsillitis, on the Visit 2 compared to the Visit 1. -&#xD;
           Indications for prescribing antibiotics (no positive dynamics or worsening of the&#xD;
           patient's condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The decrease in the total score (the sum of scores for each symptom) according to the&#xD;
           LTM Scale (0-15), - Patients self-assessment (VAS; 0-10) scale of local manifestations&#xD;
           of tonsillitis at the V 2, V 3 and V 4 in comparison with the 1-st visit. - Decrease in&#xD;
           temperature in the armpit at the V 2 and V 3 compared to the Visit 1. - Self-evaluation&#xD;
           of the patient's quality of life. - Duration of NSAID administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main criterion (main variable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      - the decrease in the severity of each symptom (complaint) that is part of the scale of&#xD;
      tonsillitis manifestations, up to 1 point or less. This variable is dichotomous, with the&#xD;
      categories &quot;treatment effective&quot; and &quot;treatment not effective&quot;: Treatment is effective -&#xD;
      reducing the severity of each symptom (complaint) that is part of the Local Tonsillitis&#xD;
      Manifestation Scale (0-15),of tonsillitis manifestations, up to 1 point or less in the&#xD;
      evaluation stages. Absence of indications for prescribing antibacterial therapy Treatment is&#xD;
      not effective - the condition is given for the category &quot;therapy is effective&quot; is not met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The decrease in the severity of the symptoms of the underlying disease, at the V 2, V 3&#xD;
           and V 4 visits compared to the 1-st visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The decrease in the total score (the sum of scores for each symptom) according to the&#xD;
           scale of local manifestations of tonsillitis at the V 2, V 3 and V 4 in comparison with&#xD;
           the 1-st visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in temperature in the armpit at the 2-nd and 3-rd visits compared to the 1-st&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's self-assessment of the quality of life (every day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of antipyretics administration. Statistical analysis is performed by a&#xD;
           statistician and includes descriptions of patients (included, completed and withdrawn),&#xD;
           adverse events and reactions, analysis of efficacy in each group, comparison of efficacy&#xD;
           between groups, safety assessment, and tolerability in each group. It is planned to use&#xD;
           the criteria of Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney (U).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biometry: Patients with acute tonsillitis (N = 200): Age: 6-12 years old. The main group (n =&#xD;
