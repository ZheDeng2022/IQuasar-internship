    <measure>Group mean change at 6 weeks and 4 months on parenting self-efficacy on the Tool of Parenting Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 weeks and baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>TOPSE consists of 48 self-efficacy statements that address six domains of parenting; emotion and affection, play and enjoyment, empathy and understanding, control, discipline and boundary setting, pressures of parenting, self-acceptance, and learning and knowledge. There are six self-efficacy statements for each domain and parents indicate how much they agree with each statement by responding to a Likert scale from 0-10 where 0 equates to completely disagree and 10 equates to completely agree. A higher overall score indicates greater self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Parenting Practices Interview is a standardized instrument to measure parenting skills. It includes three subscales: harsh discipline, inept discipline, and positive parenting.
