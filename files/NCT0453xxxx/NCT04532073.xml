  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a sub-study of the ENTAiER study. The ENTAiER study is a multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eurythmy therapy and Tai&#xD;
      Chi in comparison to standard care in chronically ill older patients with an increased risk&#xD;
      of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the main questions of the ENTAiER study, three additional questions are being&#xD;
      investigated at the Hospital Essen-Steele: Proteome and telomere analyses as well as&#xD;
      qualitative parameters are recorded and examined. The aim is to compare the changes in&#xD;
      proteomes, telomeres and qualitative factors under eurythmy therapy, Tai Chi and standard&#xD;
      care in chronically ill older patients with an increased risk of falling.&#xD;

    <description>A maximum of 500 µL plasma is used for the proteomic studies. The proteins are digested tryptically, a concentration determination is performed by amino acid analysis and the peptide samples are then measured by different mass spectrometric methods (data dependent (DDA) and independent detection (DIA), proteome-wide prediction of peptide tandem mass spectra by deep learning (Prosit), etc.). The results obtained are then verified by Western blot, ELISA and/or a targeted mass spectrometric method (parallel reaction monitoring)</description>
