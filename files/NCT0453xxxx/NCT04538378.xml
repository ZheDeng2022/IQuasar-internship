  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancers with EGFR mutations may develop resistance to therapies targeting this protein&#xD;
      by evolving/being transformed into small cell or neuroendocrine cancers. There are no&#xD;
      standard treatments for it. Researchers want to see if a new combination of drugs can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the combination of durvalumab and olaparib will cause tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older who had EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that was&#xD;
      treated and now transformed to SCLC or another neuroendocrine tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol. They may have a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam. They will have a review of their symptoms, their&#xD;
      medicines, and their ability to do their normal activities. They will have blood tests. They&#xD;
      will have an electrocardiogram to evaluate their heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a computed tomography (CT) scan, a series of x-rays taken of parts of&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get durvalumab on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle. It is given through a small&#xD;
      plastic tube that is put in an arm vein. They will take olaparib by mouth twice every day.&#xD;
      They will keep a medicine diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drugs until their disease gets worse or they have&#xD;
      unacceptable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after they stop taking the study drugs, participants will have a follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Then they will be contacted every 6 months for the rest of their life....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted therapies designed for specific genetic alterations, known as cancer driver&#xD;
      mutations, have changed the treatment paradigm in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma&#xD;
      (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are&#xD;
      effective in NSCLC with activating mutation in the EGFR. Although most patients achieve&#xD;
      robust responses to EGFR TKIs with tumor shrinkage and symptomatic relief, drug resistance&#xD;
      eventually develops in the majority of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation has been reported as one of the mechanisms of&#xD;
      acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several phase III trials showed durable response with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)&#xD;
      inhibitors in the breast and ovarian cancer with BRCA mutation, a tumor suppressor gene&#xD;
      involving homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, and several PARP inhibitors are now&#xD;
      FDA approved for these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint blockade appears to be most effective against hypermutated tumors,&#xD;
      suggesting that clinical responses correlate with an increased propensity to produce&#xD;
      neoantigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGFR-mutated transformed SCLC is an aggressive cancer whose clinical course is similar to&#xD;
      that of SCLC. There are no standard treatments for this disease and prospective studies have&#xD;
      not been conducted to date. Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone are not effective for&#xD;
      EGFR-mutated transformed SCLC. Analyses of EGFR transformed SCLC tumors suggest that these&#xD;
      tumors are HRR deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of a combination of durvalumab and olaparib with respect to best&#xD;
      overall response (BOR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1) in patients&#xD;
      with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that transform to SCLC and other&#xD;
      neuroendocrine carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with initial diagnosis of EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and&#xD;
      histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors&#xD;
      following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should have received platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy for&#xD;
      small cell/neuroendocrine transformation or refused such therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;=18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status &lt;= 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label Phase II study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with durvalumab (1,500 mg), IV, every 4 weeks and olaparib (BID, 600&#xD;
      mg total daily dose) in a 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by CTCAE v5.0, and for response every 8&#xD;
      (+/-1) weeks by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the time of screening&#xD;
             throughout the total duration of the protocol treatment and for at least three months&#xD;
             after the last dose of the study drug (s). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect&#xD;
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately. Postmenopausal or evidence of&#xD;
             non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential: negative urine or serum&#xD;

             menopause with more than one-year interval since last menses; surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). Male patients must use a condom from the&#xD;
             time of screening throughout the total duration of the protocol treatment and for 3&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study treatment when having sexual intercourse with a&#xD;
             pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male&#xD;
             patients should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of&#xD;
             childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to&#xD;
             poor prognosis. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastasis&#xD;
             and whose brain disease is stable without steroid therapy for 2 weeks may be enrolled.&#xD;
             Imaging to rule out brain metastases is not required for screening but should be&#xD;
             performed prior to study enrollment if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;

             enrollment. Note: local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are moderate and strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: dihydropyridine calcium - channel blockers are permitted for management of underling&#xD;
        disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of auto-immune disease requiring steroid maintenance, or history of primary&#xD;
             immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the&#xD;
             enrollment, with the exception of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone or an equivalent corticosteroid. In the case of short-term use of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids (less than 24 hours within 28 days) of greater than 10 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone or an equivalent corticosteroid, the required washout period prior to&#xD;
             enrollment is 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia; or baseline clinical&#xD;
             features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent toxicities (greater than or equal to CTCAE grade 2) with the exception of&#xD;
             alopecia, caused by previous cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition of olaparib or durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resting ECG indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac conditions, as&#xD;
             judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic&#xD;
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, QTcF prolongation &gt;500 ms, electrolyte&#xD;
             disturbances, etc.), or patients with congenital long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;

             or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody&#xD;
             [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) and patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody&#xD;
             are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HBV or HCV RNA..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of potential&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with study drugs. However, patients with long-standing&#xD;
             (&gt;5 years) HIV on antiretroviral therapy &gt; 1 month (undetectable HIV viral load and&#xD;
             CD4 count &gt; 150 cells/microliters) may be eligible if the PI determines no anticipated&#xD;
             clinically significant drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allogenic organ transplantation, bone marrow transplant or double umbilical&#xD;
             cord blood transplantation (dUCBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or medical condition including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia requiring medications ((except chronic atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation/flutter with controlled vascular rate), or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that may impair the patient s tolerance of study treatments and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication&#xD;
             based on primary investigator decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib is a PARP inhibitor agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with durvalumab and olaparib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with study drugs.&#xD;
