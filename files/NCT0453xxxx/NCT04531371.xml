  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation is a postanesthetic phenomenon that develops in the early phase of&#xD;
      general anesthesia recovery, and is characterized by agitation, confusion, disorientation,&#xD;
      and possible violent behavior. Though agitation is observed more frequently in pediatric&#xD;
      patients, the incidence in adults has been reported at 4.7% or 21.3%. Emergence agitation can&#xD;
      lead to serious consequences such as self-extubation, removal of catheters, hemorrhage, and&#xD;
      even severe injuries from falling out of the bed. Furthermore, it may increase the demand on&#xD;
      human resources and cause medical staff injuries.&#xD;

      Postoperative agitation (POA) although short-lived is potentially harmful to the patient and&#xD;
      the recovery staff. In the postoperative care unit, an agitated patient requires more nurses&#xD;
      to control his abnormal movement and apply restrains that could result in bruises of his&#xD;
      extremities. In the postoperative care unit, we noticed that agitated patients remove venous&#xD;
      and arterial catheters, nasal packs, oxygen masks and endotracheal tubes leading to bleeding&#xD;
      and hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative agitation is a well-documented phenomenon in children recovering from&#xD;
      sevoflurane anesthesia. However, in adults, few reports have highlighted the occurrence of&#xD;
      this phenomenon. The exact trigger for this complication remains to be determined, however,&#xD;
      many factors play a crucial role in revealing POA. While an alert, calm patient is the ideal&#xD;
      recovery outcome, the occurrence of excitation, excessive motor movements and unexplained&#xD;
      sounds is not an uncommon scenario following nasal surgery in adults. Several factors have&#xD;
      been incriminated to provoke agitations in adults; pain, hypoxia, type of operation, too&#xD;
      rapid emergence from anesthesia, sedatives like benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative agitation following nasal surgery The incidence of postoperative agitation&#xD;
      following nasal surgery is relatively high. The exact mechanism is Unknown. However, some&#xD;
      studies reported that the occurrence of POA could be as high as 55.4% and the presence of&#xD;
      nasal pack is likely to be the main trigger of agitation. Other experiments reported an&#xD;
      incidence of 68% following nasal surgery. We highlighted several factors that may increase&#xD;
      the prevalence of POA; Male gender, young age, smoking, postoperative pain and premedication&#xD;
      with atropine and Phenergan. Yu et al., 2005 reported a 55% incidence of POA after nasal&#xD;
      surgery. They demonstrated that Doxapram administration, pain, and presence of a tracheal&#xD;
      tube and or a urinary catheter appear to be the most important causes of postoperative&#xD;
      agitation. Similarly, pain, urinary catheters, and tracheal tubes were also reported by Kim&#xD;
      et al., 2004as risk factors for POA following nasal surgery. The presence of nasal pack as a&#xD;
      trigger to POA remains debatable.&#xD;
