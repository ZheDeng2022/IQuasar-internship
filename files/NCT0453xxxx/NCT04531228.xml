  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly malignant tumors around the world.&#xD;
      Hepatic resection or liver transplantation is the radical method to cure the disease.&#xD;
      However, due to multiple tumors or poor hepatic function reserve in cirrhosis, surgical&#xD;
      treatment is suitable for early-stage and well reserved liver function patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      in clinical practice, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a preferential and standard&#xD;
      treatment of unresectable HCC. TACE has been proved to provide outstanding efficacy for&#xD;
      treating advanced stage HCC patients. However, TACE is associated with a high rate of&#xD;
      treatment failure for advanced HCC patients. EACH trial opened the door to FOLFOX-based&#xD;
      system chemotherapy for advanced HCC patients. Recently, investigators have showed that&#xD;
      hepatic arterial infusion of FOLFOX-based chemotherapy (HAIC) was safe and efficient for&#xD;
      advanced HCC patients. The combination of TACE with HAIC (TACE-HAIC) was proved to increase&#xD;
      the local doses of chemotherapeutic agents in the liver, reduce the viability of HCC cells&#xD;
      and increase the hepatectomy rate in our previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levatinib is a new treatment and offers relative high overall response rate for advanced HCC,&#xD;
      which was approved in China and Japan. However, whether the combination of TACE-HAIC and&#xD;
      Lenvatinib would increse tumor control for unresectable patients is still unknown. Thus, this&#xD;
      single arm, phase 2 study is designed to analyze the safety and efficacy TACE-HAIC plus&#xD;
      Lenvatinib for patients with unresectalbe HCC.&#xD;
