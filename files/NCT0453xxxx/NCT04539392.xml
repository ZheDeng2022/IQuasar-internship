  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that infertile couples experience an impact of their sexuality&#xD;
      impacted during the diagnostic process carried out as part of the medically assisted&#xD;
      procreation assessment, and also by the announcement of the possible cause of the couple's&#xD;
      infertility. It is also conceivable that a disorder of the couple's sexuality forms the&#xD;
      origin of, or is a contributor to, infertility.&#xD;
