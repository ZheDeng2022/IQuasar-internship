    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two educational interventions to&#xD;
      enhance breastfeeding knowledge among senior medical students. One intervention consisted of&#xD;
      a traditional face-to-face teaching lecture and the other consisted of the use of a&#xD;
      smartphone application containing information about breastfeeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental study was performed. Students were allocated to two groups; the first&#xD;
      group underwent a 6-hour face-to-face breastfeeding course which was divided in four 1.5-hour&#xD;
      sessions during a time span of two weeks. The second intervention consisted of downloading a&#xD;
      digital smartphone application designed by the research team to teach proper breastfeeding&#xD;
      concepts which participants freely navigated during the same time span of two weeks. Before&#xD;
      and after each intervention, students answered a general breastfeeding knowledge test&#xD;
      consisting of twenty multiple choice answers with a score range of 0 to 20. Statistical&#xD;
      comparisons between pre- and post-test scores were performed in each group and mean change in&#xD;
      scores was compared between them to establish which method was the most efficient. Moreover,&#xD;
      amount of time spent on the application was descriptively measured.&#xD;

    <measure>Efficacy of each breastfeeding course evaluated by a quantitative general knowledge questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>In order to measure this outcome, all participants answered a test consisting of a quantitative questionnaire of general breastfeeding knowledge before and after the intervention. This general knowledge test consisted of twenty questions with multiple choice answers ranging between two to five possible answers according to the nature of the question. It was designed by study researchers which included specialists in Pediatrics and breastfeeding and it was based solely on the course content. Minimum and maximum scores were 0 and 20, where a higher score indicated a better grade on the test. Central tendency and dispersion measures were obtained for pre- and post-test scores and a further statistical comparison between this parameters indicated whether there was a statistically significant difference. If the post-test score was statistically superior to the pre-test score, it was concluded that the intervention was efficient to improve breastfeeding knowledge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the efficacy of each breastfeeding course by comparison of mean differences</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>In order to measure this outcome, a mean difference between the post-test and pre-test scores was obtained for each group. Furthermore, these mean differences were compared to establish if the mean improvement in test scores was different between both interventions. If the mean change of one intervention was statistically superior to the other, it was assumed that the former intervention was more efficient to promote breastfeeding knowledge. On the contrary, if no statistical differences between the effects of both interventions on test scores were observed, it was assumed that no intervention was superior to the other.</description>
