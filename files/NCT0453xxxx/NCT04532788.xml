  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard or Dresden protocol was established in 2003 and treats the entire cornea.&#xD;
      However, recent ultra-structural research showed that keratoconus is localized. Therefore,&#xD;
      treating only the affected zone and minimalizing the risk of damaging surrounding tissues&#xD;
      would be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the effectiveness of customized&#xD;
      cross-linking (cCXL) is non-inferior to standard accelerated cross-linking (sCXL) in terms of&#xD;
      flattening of the cornea and halting keratoconus progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2003 Wollensak et al used corneal cross-linking (CXL) in humans to halt the progression of&#xD;
      keratoconus. During the procedure the top layer of the cornea, the epithelium, is debrided.&#xD;
      Then the cornea is soaked with riboflavin, a photosensitizer. Hereafter a 9.0 mm diameter&#xD;
      Ultraviolet-A (UVA) beam radiates the cornea for 30 minutes with a fluence of 3 mW/cm2&#xD;
      resulting in a total energy of 5,4 J/cm2. This protocol is called the Dresden protocol.&#xD;
      Currently, accelerated versions of the Dresden protocol are used in common practice. There&#xD;
      are different accelerated protocols with fluences of 9mW/cm2, 10mW/cm2 and 15 mW/cm2. The&#xD;
      higher the fluence, the shorter the treatment time, however according to the Bunsen-Roscoe&#xD;
      reciprocity law the total amount of energy stays the same.During the procedure oxygen&#xD;
      radicals are formed that interact with the surrounding molecules, leading to the formation of&#xD;
      new chemical bounds between the collagen fibrils (i.e. corneal crosslinks). The final goal of&#xD;
      the procedure is to cause the cornea to stiffen and achieve flattening of the treated region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any treatment, it is imperative that the unaffected region of the tissue is not&#xD;
      unnecessarily treated by an intervention or drug application. To minimalize the risk of&#xD;
      damage to surrounding tissues it would be beneficial that the UVA beam is restricted to the&#xD;
      affected, keratoconic zone in the patient's cornea. This can be achieved by customizing the&#xD;
      beam shape and size in a way that only the degenerated zone is treated, i.e. by customized&#xD;
      cross-linking (cCXL). Recently published studies provide clinical evidence that similar&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (amount of corneal flattening) can be achieved when only the cone is&#xD;
      treated instead of the entire cornea.They also show the potential benefits of cCXL, e.g. the&#xD;
      treatment is patient-specific, a smaller surface of the cornea is irradiated, lower incidence&#xD;
      of corneal haze, a faster reepithelialisation and a shorter procedure time. However, none of&#xD;
      these studies are randomized and study results are limited by using small sample sizes.&#xD;
      Therefore, we feel that there is a great need for a randomized controlled trial with an&#xD;
      appropriate design and sample size to confirm these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate if cCXL is non-inferior to sCXL (10 mW/cm2) in terms&#xD;
      of flattening of the corneal surface and halting the disease progression.&#xD;

    <description>In the customized corneal cross-linking protocol (cCXL) a patient-specific treatment pattern, based on the patient's Pentacam images, will be used to treat the cornea. The CXL pattern exists out of 3 concentric circles and is centered on the cone. To estimate the cone location a combination of the thinnest corneal point, maximum anterior elevation and maximum posterior elevation is used. The epithelium is debrided with alcohol within the marked zone. After the application of riboflavin each circle receives a different amount of energy, which gradually decreases with increasing circle size.&#xD;
The procedure is done with the Avedro Mosaic CXL device (Avedro, Inc. Waltham, Massachusetts, United States).</description>
