  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall performance of an&#xD;
      investigational silicone hydrogel lens when compared to ACUVUE OASYS® with HYDRACLEAR® PLUS&#xD;
      (AOHP).&#xD;

      Following completion of the initial study, the protocol was amended to add a second part,&#xD;
      referred to as Part B, to pursue exploratory objectives. The initial study was relabeled as&#xD;
      Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of this study is a randomized, double-masked, crossover study comparing 2 contact lens&#xD;
      products. The expected duration of subject participation in Part A is approximately 8 weeks&#xD;
      with 5 scheduled visits. Part A completed on February 04, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of this study is a single arm, single masked (subject) study with 1 contact lens&#xD;
      product. The expected duration of subject participation in Part B is approximately 4 weeks&#xD;
      with 3 scheduled visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject may participate in both parts of the study. Each part is anticipated to enroll up&#xD;
      to 66 subjects, for a total of 132 subjects (Part A and Part B).&#xD;
