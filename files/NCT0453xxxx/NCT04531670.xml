  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of an integrated rapid access HIV prevention program for People who&#xD;
      inject drugs (PWID) called iRaPID. The program incorporates same-day access to Pre-exposure&#xD;
      Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Hybrid type 1 implementation science design,will be used to pilot test the APN-led iRaPID&#xD;
      program while exploring information on its implementation at multiple time points through the&#xD;
      study. The hybrid type 1 pilot trial provides an implementation heuristic to assess potential&#xD;
      research questions, perhaps more comprehensively, accurately and certainly earlier than could&#xD;
      be achieved in a sequential 'intervention-then-preliminary-pilot study' strategy. In this&#xD;
      hybrid type 1 pilot trial, the RCT will be utilized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine feasibility and acceptability among PWID and clinical stakeholders for an&#xD;
           adapted APN-delivered, rapid HIV prevention program for PWID (iRaPID) that integrates&#xD;
           same-day PrEP and OAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the preliminary efficacy of PrEP and OAT uptake in a pilot randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial of the iRaPID vs. treatment as usual strategy in PWID without HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess future scale-up factors, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research&#xD;
      (CFIR) will be utilized with the nominal group technique (NGT). It is a conceptual framework&#xD;
      developed to guide the assessment of multilevel implementation contexts. The CFIR framework&#xD;
      was selected because it provides a structured menu of constructs associated with effective&#xD;
      implementation. It consists of 5 domains with 39 underlying constructs. As recommended by&#xD;
      Damschroder, in this study 8 CFIR constructs based on the relevancy will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the NGT, participants will be asked questions related to the multi-level&#xD;
      implementation factors that will be based on the sample guide available on&#xD;
      http://cfirguide.org but tailored for PWID. After posing each question, participants silently&#xD;
      generate individual ideas. Then, using a round-robin elicitation process, each person&#xD;
      contributes ideas that are recorded visually. They then engage in group discussion to clarify&#xD;
      and evaluate the ideas. Items are then grouped by consensus with duplicate items removed.&#xD;
      Then, each participant casts three votes on items as they deem them important. Votes are&#xD;
      immediately tallied, ranked based on total number of votes, and the facilitator leads a final&#xD;
      discussion to review the results. Sessions will take 60 minutes and be audio-recorded and&#xD;
      transcribed.&#xD;
