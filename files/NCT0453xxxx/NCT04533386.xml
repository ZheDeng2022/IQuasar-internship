  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tragically, HIV infections among Black sexual minority men (BSMM) in the U.S. persist.&#xD;
      Despite the availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, effective&#xD;
      uptake among BSMM remains low. It is imperative to support PrEP initiation among this group.&#xD;
      The proposed multi-component interventional study is designed to increase HIV risk&#xD;
      perceptions and subsequent PrEP initiation through the use of our team's existing mobile&#xD;
      application called PrEPme and a peer change agent (PCA) to record and review sexual risk&#xD;
      behaviors and subsequent PrEP interest. Few have studied whether reviewing sexual diaries&#xD;
      with a PCA increases HIV risk perceptions and PrEP initiation among BSMM. This strategy will&#xD;
      allow BSMM who are not using PrEP to record their sexual behaviors using a PrEPme-based&#xD;
      diary, review their sexual histories with a PCA, and assess PrEP interest. The PCA will be&#xD;
      trained in motivational interviewing techniques to facilitate discussions. The PCA will&#xD;
      provide HIV prevention education, sexual risk evaluation, and PrEP navigation. BSMM who&#xD;
      become interested in initiating PrEP will be referred to our team's ongoing PrEP&#xD;
      tele-medicine study (PI: Jason Farley, co-investigator) or other PrEP care services in the&#xD;
      greater Baltimore area. The proposed intervention targets a high priority population in HIV&#xD;
      prevention and mitigates structural barriers to PrEP uptake such as perceived judgement,&#xD;
      stigma, and discrimination from clinical providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed multicomponent intervention will use our team's existing mobile smartphone app&#xD;
      called PrEPme along with a peer change agent (PCA) to record and review sexual risk behaviors&#xD;
      among 80 HIV-negative BSMM. PrEPme is an existing HIPAA compliant mobile app that is&#xD;
      currently available in the mobile application &quot;store&quot; and offers PrEP navigation services in&#xD;
      Baltimore and throughout the State of Maryland. Currently, the app contains a diary that&#xD;
      allows users to record and review their sexual risk behaviors using a weekly &quot;timeline&quot;&#xD;
      including number and gender of partners along with substance use. At the end of each week,&#xD;
      the dashboard provides a weekly review of sexual history for four weeks until the history is&#xD;
      displayed as a monthly overview. The app also allows users to chat with our case management&#xD;
      team to learn more about PrEP, obtain adequate insurance coverage, and get help scheduling&#xD;
      appointments at any time. The proposed intervention leverages the current features of the app&#xD;
      as part of the multi-component strategy. In the intervention, pre-post assessments will&#xD;
      include demographic information, sexual behavior, substance use, mental health (e.g.,&#xD;
      depression, gay community affiliation), and PrEP use history. HIV risk perception will be&#xD;
      measured using an 8-item scale. The PCA will be trained to review sexual histories, highlight&#xD;
      HIV and sexually transmitted infection risks, provide HIV prevalence information, deliver&#xD;
      PrEP information, and encourage PrEP uptake. This intervention phase will use a single-group&#xD;
      pretest post-test design to explore feasibility and findings will be used as the foundation&#xD;
      for an efficacy trial among a larger sample of BSMM in different locales.&#xD;
