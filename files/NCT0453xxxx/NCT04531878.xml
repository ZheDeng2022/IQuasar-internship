  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to improve the prognosis of inhereditary cholestasis caused by&#xD;
      ABCB11 gene mutations by using BSEP function rescue drugs&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bile acids function as detergents to aid digestion and as signaling molecules to regulate&#xD;
      gene expression and metabolism. They are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, secreted&#xD;
      into bile and re -turned from chyme to liver in portal- vein blood 6-10 times per day&#xD;
      (enterohepatic circulation. Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids involves more than 20&#xD;
      transporters among which bile salt export pump (BSEP), encoded by ABCB11 plays a key role.&#xD;
      BSEP medi-ates the secretion of bile acids across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes&#xD;
      into bile to provide the osmotic pressure for bile flow. Mutations in ABCB11 can cause&#xD;
      absence or dysfunction of BSEP leading to cholestasis. Bile acid accumulation in hepatocytes&#xD;
      caused by BSEP dysfunction is associated with a range of liver dis-eases, ranging from&#xD;
      transient neonatal cholestasis to fatal progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC),&#xD;
      with jaundice, growth retardation, cirrhosis, liver failure and death. Our current indicates&#xD;
      that more than 70% patents with ABCB11 mutations need liver-transplantation or dead during&#xD;
      follow-up. In recent years, some targeted drugs including 4-phenylbutyrate(for patients with&#xD;
      BSEP trafficking abnormal), ivacaftor(for patients with abnormal BSEP transport function),&#xD;
      and gentamicin (for patients with none sense mutations) have emerged make it possible for&#xD;
      individual targeted therapy possible.&#xD;
