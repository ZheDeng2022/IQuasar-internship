  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neurobiological response to stress is an adaptive response allowing us to cope with the&#xD;
      multiple aggressions of daily life. This response orchestrates the body's systemic reaction.&#xD;
      The intensity of response to stress can modify the body's functioning, which implies a&#xD;
      variety of fields where biomarkers may be isolated: immunity, psychology, neurophysiology,&#xD;
      integrative physiology. When stress is too intense or prolonged, response to stress may&#xD;
      become misfitted and deleterious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on the hypothesis that a severe physical or psychological trauma is&#xD;
      associated with an intense and misfitted stress that is responsible from an undue&#xD;
      immuno-inflammatory activation (through sympathetic activation). The result is a subinvasive&#xD;
      state of systemic and tissue inflammation (low-noise inflammation), responsible for the&#xD;
      mid-term deleterious consequences of the traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to understand how the dysregulation of intense stress&#xD;
      simultaneously generates an initial pathological state and an alteration of mid-term&#xD;
      evolution (which is considered as a poor prognosis and/or as responsible for after-effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to identify relevant biomarkers of the mechanisms activated during&#xD;
      intense stress and influencing the immuno-inflammatory and epigenetic spheres with&#xD;
      deleterious consequences on physiological and psychological functions.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Screening for depression will be done using a validated self-report questionnaire, the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Version (GDS).&#xD;
We will use the threshold value of 10 (score &gt; or =) which corresponds to a very high probability of depression.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnosis of &quot;psychosomatic death&quot; will be made by a physician. There is no consensus on the diagnosis of this syndrome. However, a patient with &quot;psychosomatic death&quot; is likely to be hospitalized or followed up medically and will not be able to respond to the investigator's request for a telephone interview.</description>
