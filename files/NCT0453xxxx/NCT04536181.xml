  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentric, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial&#xD;
      compared the efficacy of 6 months vs. 3 months of initial prednisolone therapy in decreasing&#xD;
      the incidence of FRNS with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome in children age 1 year up to&#xD;
      6 years. Three months tapering prednisolone or placebo are administrated follow by open-label&#xD;
      3 months standard prednisolone therapy.The cumulative incidence of FRNS and adverse events&#xD;
      for one year were evaluated in the 3-month and 6-month groups.&#xD;
