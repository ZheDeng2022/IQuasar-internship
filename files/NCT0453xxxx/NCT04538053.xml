  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre trial of children with bone and joint infections (BJIs). The primary&#xD;
      objective is to establish if in children with acute, uncomplicated BJIs, entirely oral&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment is not inferior to initial intravenous (IV) treatment for 2 to 4 days&#xD;
      followed by an oral antibiotic course in achieving full recovery 12 months after&#xD;
      presentation. Children will be randomly allocated to the 'entirely oral antibiotic' group or&#xD;
      the 'standard treatment' group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with acute onset BJIs who present to the Royal Children's Hospital will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the trial if eligible (see eligibility criteria) and randomly allocated into two groups.&#xD;
      Children in the 'standard treatment group' will receive standard treatment for BJIs, which&#xD;
      consists of IV antibiotics for 2-4 days followed by 3 weeks of oral antibiotics. Children in&#xD;
      the 'entirely oral treatment group' will receive high dose oral antibiotics, followed by the&#xD;
      standard dose of oral antibiotics for 3 weeks. The outcomes of children in each of the two&#xD;
      groups will be compared to determine whether BJIs can be treated without needing a course of&#xD;
      IV antibiotics.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life - Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Day 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>

CHU9D is an acronym for the Child Health Utility scale. It includes 9 domains scored 0 to 5. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 5. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 45. Lower scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost effectiveness - cost-effectiveness ratio of all resources at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be determined for both arms of the trial. This is a summary measure representing the economic value of the intervention (oral cefalexin), compared with the alternative (IV cefazolin followed by oral cefalexin). Estimated total sum of all hospital and patient/family resources required per patient per treatment course (AUD) collected by the study team at each study visit using a standard questionnaire (e.g. clinical services, medication, hospital and family accommodation, travelling, loss of income, care arrangements for family members). The mean total cost per treatment cost (AUD) will be reported for each arm of the trial.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 3</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence - Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) at 3 weeks</measure>
