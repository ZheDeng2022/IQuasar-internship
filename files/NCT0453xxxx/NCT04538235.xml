  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video-Assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is the standard treatment for localized lung cancer.&#xD;
      However, there is no consensus on analgesic management in patients undergoing VATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of thoracic epidural with that a&#xD;
      &quot;Bi-block&quot; combining an Erector Spinae muscle plane Block (ESP) and a Serratus Anterior Block&#xD;
      (SAP) in patients undergoing VATS for lung or pleural surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that the analgesic efficacy of the Bi-block, assessed by morphine&#xD;
      consumption, is not inferior to that provided by a thoracic epidural during the first 48&#xD;
      hours after VATS. We conducted a age, gender and type of surgery-matched retrospective cohort&#xD;
      study in the Department of Thoracic Anesthesia of the Montpellier University Hospital&#xD;
      (France).&#xD;

    <description>The Bi-block consisted in performing an ESP block followed by a SAP block on the side ipsilateral to the thoracic surgery. For the ESP block, 40 ml of Ropivacaine 2mg/ml were injected under the erector spinae muscle plane, at the level of the 4th thoracic vertebra. For the SAP block, 40 ml of Ropivacaine 2 mg/ml were injected under the serratus anterior muscle plane. The cumulative dose of Ropivacaine did not exceed 3 mg/kg.&#xD;
Regional anesthesia was performed before surgery.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Thoracic Epidural Analgesia (TEA) group</arm_group_label>
    <description>The thoracic epidural was performed according to a standardized protocol, with a Tuohy needle via the median puncture technique, at the level of T4-T5 intervertebral space. After a test dose of 2 to 3 ml of Lidocaine, 5 to 10 ml of a mixture of Ropivacaine 2 mg/ml and Sufentanil 0.5 µg / mL were injected. Epidural continuous administration was performed with the same mixture of anesthetic connected to a CADD Solis ™ pump set according to a PCEA protocol adapted to the patient's weight (continuous flow rate from 3 to 6 ml/h, self-administered bolus dose from 3 to 5 ml, refractory period 30 min).&#xD;
