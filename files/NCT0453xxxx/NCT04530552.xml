  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial investigates how well apalutamide before surgery works in treating&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer that is confined to the prostate gland. Testosterone can cause&#xD;
      the growth of prostate cancer cells. Apalutamide blocks the use of testosterone by the tumor&#xD;
      cells. Giving low dose apalutamide before prostate surgery may lead to lowered PSA levels in&#xD;
      men with prostate cancer that is confined to the prostate gland.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of low dose apalutamide on circulating levels of prostate&#xD;
      specific antigen (PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of low dose apalutamide on Ia. Reversibility of testosterone&#xD;
      levels 7-14 days post intervention. Ib. Post-intervention plasma trough apalutamide&#xD;
      concentration. Ic. Intra-prostatic immune cell infiltration. Id. Health-related quality of&#xD;
      life. Ie. Gleason score of pre- and post-intervention tumor(s) with matched location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 40 patients taking part in this trial receive apalutamide orally (PO) three times a&#xD;
      week (TIW) for 4-8 weeks prior to before prostate surgery in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Based on PSA levels of the first 40 patients, the next&#xD;
      group of 40 patients receive apalutamide either once a week (QW) or once daily (QD) for 4-8&#xD;
      weeks prior to before prostate surgery in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients may receive apalutamide for up to 12 weeks before prostate surgery (in the&#xD;
      event surgery is delayed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7-14 days after prostate&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with &gt;= 25% decline in PSA levels (from baseline to end-of-intervention) will be determined for each dose cohort. Paired t test will be performed on the changes in PSA to evaluate the effects of low dose apalutamide for each dose group. The dose level of the second dose group can be higher than the first dose group (i.e. does escalation). Therefore, we conservatively use Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparisons for the primary endpoint analysis since a gate-keeping procedure based on the test result of the first dose group will be inappropriate when does escalation occurs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reversibility of testosterone levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at 7-14 days post-intervention (post-operative)</time_frame>
    <description>The post-operative testosterone levels will be compared with the levels at baseline and end-of-intervention within each dose cohort. Paired t test will be performed on the changes in testosterone to evaluate the effects of low dose apalutamide for each dose group. A 95% CI will be reported for each of the two dose groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-intervention plasma trough apalutamide concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7-14 days after prostate surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Post-intervention plasma trough apalutamide concentrations will be quantified by a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay. The correlation between plasma trough apalutamide and the change of PSA levels will be assessed. Pearson correlation coefficient will be derived to evaluate the correlation between the plasma trough apalutamide levels and the change of PSA levels. A 95% CI will be reported for each of the two dose groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intra-prostatic immune cell infiltration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7-14 days after prostate surgery</time_frame>
    <description>CD8+, CD4+, and CD56+ positive cells in the prostate tissues will be assessed by immunohistochemistry. Changes (from most recent biopsy to prostatectomy) in these immune cells will be assessed for each dose group. Changes in immune cell infiltration will also be assessed in a subgroup of participants where materials are available from pre- and post-intervention tumor(s) with matched location. Changes (from most recent biopsy to prostatectomy) in these immune cells will be assessed for each dose group by paired t test. A 95% CI will be reported for each of the two dose groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, until end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>HRQOL will be assessed by a validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice [EPIC-CP]) to allow for efficient and accurate measurement of urinary incontinence, urinary irritation, bowel, sexual, and hormonal HRQOL in prostate cancer patients. Changes (from baseline to end-of-intervention) in the overall score and subscore for each measure will be assessed for each dose group. Changes in EPIC-CP (from baseline to end-of-intervention) in the overall score and sub-score for each measure will be derived and paired t test will be performed to evaluate the change for each dose group. A 95% CI will be reported for each of the two dose groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gleason score of pre- and post-intervention tumor(s) with matched location</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7-14 days after prostate surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Changes (from most recent biopsy to prostatectomy) in the Gleason score of pre- and post-intervention tumor(s) with matched location will be assessed for each dose group. Linear mixed effects model with a random intercept accounting within-subject dependence will be performed to compare the change in Gleason score of pre- and post-intervention tumor(s) with matched location since a participant can have more than one tumor. A 95% CI will be reported for each of the two dose groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of first dose of apalutamide, up to 7-14 days after prostate surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics of the type and frequency of all adverse events will be generated, including 95% confidence intervals.</description>
