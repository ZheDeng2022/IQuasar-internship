  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study of children whose families are in a precarious situation, who will benefit from&#xD;
      a targeted at-home intervention by a pediatric nurse. Visits will be organized during the&#xD;
      first, fourth and sixth months after the discovery of diabetes. The HbA1C measured 12 months&#xD;
      after the diabetes diagnosis will be compared to the HbA1C obtained in an historical cohort&#xD;
      that did not receive at-home therapeutic education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EPICES score is an individual indicator of precariousness associated with indicators of&#xD;
      access to health care and indicators of health. For this score, 30 is considered as the&#xD;
      precariousness threshold. It is collected during the follow-up of our cohort of diabetic&#xD;
      children and the data is obtained from the parent accompanying the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, we found in this cohort that a context of precariousness was associated with a very&#xD;
      poor result of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (Lamaraud J et al., 2017). The imbalance of&#xD;
      diabetes was detectable as early as one year after diagnosis and persisted despite additional&#xD;
      educational interventions. Therapeutic education allows families in precarious situations to&#xD;
      acquire, during the initial hospitalization, knowledge that meets the security objectives and&#xD;
      is adapted to the care of their child. However, we have noticed that it can be difficult for&#xD;
      some families to apply this knowledge when they are back in their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we are planning to set up a coordinated intervention by a pediatric nurse at the&#xD;
      child's home to support the parents in the implementation of the theoretical knowledge&#xD;
      acquired at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three home visits will be set up by a nurse during the first six months of the discovery of&#xD;
      diabetes in the child. These visits will be organized during the first, fourth and sixth&#xD;
      months after the discovery of diabetes and last about 2 hours each time. An additional visit&#xD;
      may be set up according to the needs of families. The HbA1C measured 12 months after the&#xD;
      diabetes diagnosis will be compared to the HbA1C obtained in an historical cohort that did&#xD;
      not receive at-home therapeutic education.&#xD;

    <description>The pediatric nurse will visit the patient's home 3 times during the first six months of the discovery of diabetes in children. These visits will be organized during the first, fourth and sixth months after the discovery of diabetes and last about 2 hours each time. An additional visit can be organized according to the needs of families.&#xD;
The pediatric nurse will ensure the implementation of learning in terms of drug therapy (modality of insulin administration, adaptation of insulin doses) and diet, according to the knowledge acquired during the initial hospitalization. She will offer her help to the families to make a connection with the school and after-school activities of the child.&#xD;
In addition to these visits, the child and his family will come to the hospital as part of the regular medical follow-up: consultations with the pediatric diabetologist at the 3rd and 6th month and at 1 year of the discovery of diabetes.</description>
