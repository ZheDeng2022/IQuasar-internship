    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of 12 weeks group-based exercise program&#xD;
      enhanced with 24 weeks health empowerment program (HEP) to an extended usual care condition&#xD;
      (the HEP program alone) on physical function, disability, health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HQoL) in home-dwelling older adults at risk for disability. Interventions were implemented&#xD;
      into existing health care pathways and added to routine preventive programs using a two-armed&#xD;
      randomized intervention design with multiple sites.&#xD;

      Study design: a two-armed multi-faceted exercise intervention study with two phases: 12 weeks&#xD;
      intensive phase followed by 12 weeks maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active condition (exercise + health-empowerment): twice-weekly exercise + 4&#xD;
           health-empowerment sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison condition (health-empowerment) 8 health-empowerment sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active condition (exercise + health-empowerment): 4 health-empowerment sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison condition (health-empowerment): 4 health-empowerment sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling method Danish home-dwelling older adults entitled to a nationally regulated&#xD;
      preventive home-visit according to the Danish social act, living in three provincial&#xD;
      municipalities in the Southern region of Denmark (Odense, Slagelse and Esbjerg) were invited&#xD;
      to participate in the WIPP screening as an integrated part of the home-visit. The screening&#xD;
      resulted in a risk-profile for functional loss and disability, on which eligibility for&#xD;
      interventions was based. The interventions studied here were offered by the municipalities in&#xD;
      line with existing services during the project period. In order to enable proper evaluations,&#xD;
      citizens who volunteered to participate where randomly allocated to either of the two&#xD;
      conditions by sealed randomization procedures. Citizens were informed about this prior to&#xD;
      agreeing to participate. Towards the end of the project phase, exceptions from this procedure&#xD;
      took place, to accommodate project interests. Tracking of allocation procedure is possible in&#xD;
      the dataset. Subject recruitment and allocation, data collection and management as well as&#xD;
      interventions were all run by the health care providers (i.e. municipalities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry procedures and other quality factors On-site data collection (self-report and&#xD;
      objective assessments) was led by the municipalities. The raw-data was registered in either&#xD;
      paper- or digital format depending on the technical prerequisites (access to portable digital&#xD;
      equipment and internet connection) of each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paper-format data was subsequently digitalized by municipality staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance of the validation and registry procedures primarily consisted of three&#xD;
      elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Written instructions on how to fill out the individual parts of the data registration&#xD;
           were available during the on-site registration, regardless of whether this was done&#xD;
           electronically or in paper format. The information was also available during the final&#xD;
           registration into the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The written instructions were further qualified by a verbal introduction on how to use&#xD;
           the data registry platform and how to fill out the individual parts correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assure standardization and validation of data registry, as well the paper-format as&#xD;
           the digital databases passed through consecutive cycles of: development (academia and&#xD;
           engineer), pilot testing (municipalities), feedback/evaluation (municipalities and&#xD;
           academia) and correction (municipalities and academia), until a final product was ready.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software platform REDCap Cloud (cloud-based data management platform) was used to setup&#xD;
      and administer the databases ensuring the required level of data security (GDPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platform allowed the database to be set up with predefined rules of range as well as&#xD;
      connections between related data fields. For continuous outcomes on scales that could in&#xD;
      principle be infinite (ex. time to complete 10-meter walking distance), predefined rules in&#xD;
      the database where based on pilot testing and or qualified by normative data on similar&#xD;
      populations when possible. For ordinal and categorical outcomes as well as outcomes&#xD;
      restricted to a given range (ex. self-rated health on a VAS scale) the predefined data-base&#xD;
      rules were set according to these given restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team setting up the database consisted of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One primary coder (profession: Engineer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five Testers/Data collector managers from the different data collector sites&#xD;
           (municipalities)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One scientific advisor The outcome data in this database is not routinely collected&#xD;
           elsewhere. Therefore, only few items, and only of descriptive character (e.g. sex and&#xD;
           age) exist to our knowledge in other databases. Due to GDPR-restrictions these items&#xD;
           were not compared to external data sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As external validation is not possible for this dataset, an internal verification procedure&#xD;
      is developed and will be executed before running the analysis for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The dataset consists of multiple waves of data-collection. Descriptive items that are&#xD;
           considered time constant (e.g. sex, age, group-allocation, subject identification&#xD;
           number) will be compared for inconsistencies across waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initially, descriptive analysis to detect outlying data were performed on all outcome&#xD;
           data for each wave separately. Each case will be investigated to identify potential&#xD;
           erroneous data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Variables with delta-values (i.e. changes from one test-time to another) will be&#xD;
           generated for each outcome, and the procedure from point 2 will be followed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Spot checks will be done across related variables. For example, measured gait speed will&#xD;
           be compared to a composite test-score in which gait speed is an important element. If&#xD;
           gait speed is very high and the score of the composite test is very low the case will be&#xD;
           investigated in order to identify which data is erroneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The database has dedicated a section for comments to the data made by either the&#xD;
           test-personnel or the person digitalizing the data. Data will be qualified against these&#xD;
           comments before being included in the analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If erroneous data is identified in step 1-5 or in case of doubt about data correctness,&#xD;
           data will be marked as missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The step-wise verification process will be registered in the database material as Stata .do&#xD;
      and Stata .log files, to ensure back-tracking and replicability of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main data dictionary was built in REDCap Cloud on the first language for the different&#xD;
      sites (Danish or German).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the database was later converted into .dta file format, an expansion of the data&#xD;
      dictionary was initiated with added information and renaming of certain variables. The main&#xD;
      language of the .dta database was then changed to English. All information on both&#xD;
      translation, conversion and expansion of the dictionary is stored and available from Stata&#xD;
      .do and .log files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REDCap Cloud database had a dedicated section for the recruitment pathway with a box to&#xD;
      register time of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All steps in data preparation (changes) and analysis activities are registered both by syntax&#xD;
      (.do) and output (.log)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention instructors and the test-personnel were all instructed to identify and register&#xD;
      adverse events. The registration was systematically done in all phases of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project had a prespecified number of participants it aimed at recruiting according to the&#xD;
      funding requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database was fitted with options for registering reasons for missing data both for each&#xD;
      individual section (i.e. self-report and objective data) and for each wave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If erroneous data is identified in step 1-5 or in case of doubt, the data will be marked as&#xD;
      missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main intervention effects on the primary outcome SPPB and on secondary outcomes of muscle&#xD;
      function, physical function, self-reported disability and quality of life as well as&#xD;
      hypothesized effect modifiers: self-efficacy, outcome expectancies and barrier management&#xD;
      will be estimated using repeated measures mixed models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify significant covariates, adjusted models will be fitted using a step-wise&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
