    <textblock>
      In the field of Adult Spinal Deformity (ASD), there are currently no standardized protocols&#xD;
      for preoperative, intraoperative or post-operative care. New standards are being created for&#xD;
      minimally invasive spine surgery within orthopedics and some neurosurgical centers. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the efficacy of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocol for complex&#xD;
      spine surgery performed for the treatment of ASD.&#xD;

      Purpose : In the field of Adult Spinal Deformity (ASD), there are currently no standardized&#xD;
      protocols for preoperative, intraoperative or post-operative care. New standards are being&#xD;
      created for minimally invasive spine surgery within orthopedics and some neurosurgical&#xD;
      centers. This study will evaluate the efficacy of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocol&#xD;
      for complex spine surgery performed for the treatment of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants : Patients undergoing surgery aimed at treating adult spinal deformity are the&#xD;
      subject of this research. This population was chosen as these procedures are often associated&#xD;
      with prolonged length of stay (LOS), high post-operative narcotic use, and often require&#xD;
      complex post-operative discharge planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures : Patients undergoing surgery to address the complications of ASD present a unique&#xD;
      challenge in that this patient population is diverse, and there are multiple operative&#xD;
      procedures available to treat the same condition. Given that there are currently no accepted&#xD;
      or recommended Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols for complex spine procedures, the&#xD;
      investigators have developed an ERAS protocol at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in&#xD;
      collaboration with the anesthesia department for the support of complex surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Implementing a multi-modal enhanced recovery after complex spine surgery protocol&#xD;
      will improve patient measured outcomes and patient functional outcomes leading to a&#xD;
      statistically significant reduction in LOS, post-operative pain, complication rate, cost.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Oswestry Disability Index Score from Pre-op baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Preop to post op comparison of ODI at 4 days, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for functional impairment is used to quantify disability related to lower back pain. The final score/index ranges from 0-100. A score of 0-20 reflects minimal disability, 21-40 moderate disability, 41-60 severe disability, 61-80 crippled, and 81-100 bed-bound. Higher scores reflect more severe disability.&#xD;
The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) measures patients' degree of disability related to lower back pain. The ODI has 10 items (Pain, self-care, bring, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex, social, and travelling). After adding up the total score of each item, the initial total score is 0 to 50 points. Then divide the total score by 5 and multiply by 20 to get the final score of 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Promis Score - Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Preop to post op comparison of PROMIS instruments at 6 weeks and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), this 8-item, self-reported tool will assess a person's level of confidence to manage/control symptoms, to manage their symptoms in different settings and to keep symptoms from interfering with work, sleep, relationships or recreational activities. Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. The total raw score for a measure is converted to into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured.</description>
