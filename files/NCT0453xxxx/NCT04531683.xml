      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture on mixed&#xD;
      urinary incontinence among women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risk, all patients giving written informed&#xD;
      consent form will be undergo a 1-week screening period to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups 1)&#xD;
      electroacupuncture group: electroacupuncture will be provided to patients at BL33, BL35 and&#xD;
      SP6 for 3 time per week for 8 weeks; 2) sham electroacupuncture group: sham&#xD;
      electroacupuncture will be provided to patients at sham acupoints to BL33, BL35 and SP6 for 3&#xD;
      time per week for 8 weeks.The follow-up time for the first two groups are 24 weeks and life&#xD;
      style counselling will be provided once when receiving the first acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment(contents are the same as the life style counselling group). 3) life style&#xD;
      counselling group: life style advice will be provided to patients at enrolment with content&#xD;
      on drinking, diet, weight control, lung disease, urinary track infection control, and etc.&#xD;
      Patients in this group will be followed up for 20 weeks. Primary and secondary outcome will&#xD;
      be measured at 4, 8, 20, 32 weeks, respectively.&#xD;

    <description>patients will receive electroacupuncture at 3 acupoints (Bladder meridian of foot-taiyang 33 and 35（BL33 and BL35), and Spleen meridian of foot-taiyin 33(SP6)) 3 times/week for 8 weeks(24 times in total), followed with 24-weeks follow up. Disposable acupuncture needles with size of 0.30 × 75 mm will be used at BL 33 and BL 35, and needles with size of 0.30 × 40 mm at SP 6. Standardised electroacupuncture apparatuses will be used, and the stimulation will last for 30 minutes with a continuous wave of 20 Hz, and a current intensity of 2 to 6.5 mA at BL33 and BL 35, and 1 to 3.5 mA at SP6. Life style counselling will be provided to all patients and contents are as same as the life style counselling group.</description>

The stimulation will only last for 30-second with a very weak currency intensity and a continuous wave of 20 Hz.
