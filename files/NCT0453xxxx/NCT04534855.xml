  <brief_summary>

      To establish the antitumor activity and safety of the anti-programmed death 1 receptor&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, Treprilimab, in patients with local recurrent/residual nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma after re-irradiation.Patients with local recurrent/residual NPC after&#xD;
      re-irradiation were treated with Treprilimab until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) and secondary end points&#xD;
      included survival and toxicity.The sample size of this study was estimated on the assumption&#xD;
      that response rates (RRs) to Treprilimab should be around 25%,based on a report that was&#xD;
      available at the time this study was planned.Furthermore, the RR to noncytotoxic,&#xD;
      experimental agents such as pazopanib and cetuximab in similarly pretreated patient cohorts&#xD;
      was approximately 5% to 10%. This study's design was based on the modiﬁed Simon two-stage&#xD;
      optimal design (α=0.05，β=0.2,n1=2/22,n2=7/40). If two responses were observed during the ﬁrst&#xD;
      stage, enrollment was continued until a total of 40 patients was reached.&#xD;

      stage, enrollment was continued until a total of 40 patients was reached. The target lesions&#xD;
      had to be measurable by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Radiologic&#xD;
      assessments were performed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
      Eligible patients were treated with Treprilimab at a dosage of 240mg intravenously every 3&#xD;
      weeks until they experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end&#xD;
      point of this study was objective response by the RECIST criteria , and the secondary end&#xD;
      points were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response and&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
