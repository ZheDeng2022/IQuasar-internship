      The purpose of this study is to assess the cardiovascular responses of the elderly to heat&#xD;
      wave conditions&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heat waves are lethal and cause a disproportionate number of deaths in the elderly relative&#xD;
      to any other age group. It is important to note that such deaths are primarily&#xD;
      cardiovascular, not hyperthermia itself, in origin. Nevertheless, we know relatively little&#xD;
      about the effects of aging on cardiovascular function during actual heat wave-like&#xD;
      conditions. The central hypothesis of this work is that the elderly exhibit greater&#xD;
      cardiovascular stress during heat wave conditions. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      recognized impairments in thermoregulatory capacity in the elderly will culminate in&#xD;
      heightened cardiovascular stress during prolonged exposure to heat wave conditions.&#xD;
      Comprehensive cardiovascular and thermal responses in the elderly, relative to younger&#xD;
      adults, will be evaluated during exposure to two prolonged heat wave conditions: hot and&#xD;
      humid (replicating the 1995 Chicago heat wave), very hot and dry (replicating the 2018 Los&#xD;
      Angeles heat wave). The expected outcome from this body of work will re-shape our&#xD;
      understanding of the consequences of aging on cardiovascular function during heat waves&#xD;
