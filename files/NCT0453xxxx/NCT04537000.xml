      The individualized strategies of red blood cell for perioperative pediatric patients are made&#xD;
      based on the comparison between the clinical condition score and the Hb concentration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the individual transfusion strategies will help to save blood&#xD;
      resource, and meanwhile will not adversely affect the patients' clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into two groups, where the strategies of transfusion of&#xD;
      red blood cell will be made following different principles. The strategies for patients in&#xD;
      control group will be made by the attending doctors in charge according to the current&#xD;
      Chinese red blood cell transfusion guidelines. For the patients in study group, the clinical&#xD;
      condition will be identified every time red blood cell transfusion is considered. The&#xD;
      strategies will be made according to the comparison between the score and the Hb&#xD;
      concentration. The volume of the red blood cell used in these two groups will be compared.&#xD;
      The number of patients who need transfusion in these two groups will be compared. The&#xD;
      clinical outcomes will also be compared between the two groups.&#xD;

    <description>The strategies of red blood cell transfusion for the pediatric patients in this group will be made by the attending doctors in charge based on the current transfusion guidelines.

    <description>For study group, the clinical condition score must be identified every time red blood cell transfusion is considered. The strategies of red blood cell transfusion for the pediatric patients in this group, including the trigger and the volume, will be made based on the comparison between the clinical condition score and the Hb concentration.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>clinical condition score</intervention_name>
    <description>A score is firstly identified using a clinical condition scale including the concentration of inspired oxygen to maintain the percutaneous oxygen saturation (SPO2)≧95%, the fusion rate of catecholamine drugs to maintain normal blood pressure, the nasopharyngeal temperature and the oxygen saturation of central venous blood. The score was graded as 0, 1 and 2 points according to the patient's clinical condition. The score identified from the scale plus 7 finally makes the clinical condition score. If the score is higher than 10, it will be replaced with 10. That is to say, the highest clinical condition score is 10. If the clinical condition score≦Hb, blood red cell transfusion will not be started. If the clinical condition score&gt;Hb, blood red cell transfusion will be started, and the volume will be calculated using the following formulation, transfusion volume(ml)=(clinical condition score - Hb)*body weight *5.</description>
