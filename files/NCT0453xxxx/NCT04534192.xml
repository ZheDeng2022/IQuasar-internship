  <brief_summary>

      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the 6-month safety and performance&#xD;
      outcome of the non-compliant high pressure JADE balloon for the treatment of infrainguinal&#xD;
      stenotic occlusive or stenotic TASC C &amp; D lesions in patients with chronic limb threatening&#xD;
      ischemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulsatile straight line blood flow to the foot is required to aid wound healing in the&#xD;
      setting of chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI). Patients with CLTI usually present with&#xD;
      infra-popliteal arterial occlusions and endovascular therapies to restore blood flow are&#xD;
      often preferred considering their inherently less invasive nature and because of multiple&#xD;
      patient background comorbidities or absence of a suitable vein conduit in these patients.&#xD;
      Below The Knee (BTK) plain balloon angioplasty (POBA) remains the only viable &quot;standard of&#xD;
      care&quot; in the management of long &quot;Real World&quot; BTK Lesions. However tibial angioplasty is&#xD;
      plagued by high rate of re-occlusion/stenosis because of barotrauma caused by the&#xD;
      intra-arterial ballooning and subsequent development of neointimal hyperplasia. Devices&#xD;
      coated with paclitaxel have been used successfully to limit restenosis by inhibiting the&#xD;
      biologic pathway that leads to intimal hyperplasia. However, a recent formal systematic&#xD;
      review and study-level meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating treatment&#xD;
      of the infra-popliteal arteries with paclitaxel-coated balloons compared with conventional&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty for critical limb ischemia (CLI) was recently published showing&#xD;
      amputation-free survival was significantly worse in use of paclitaxel coated balloons&#xD;
      compared to plain angioplasty. Furthermore current poor patency seen in BTK angioplasty is&#xD;
      likely contributed in part by small vessel size and poor luminal gain after standard&#xD;
      semi-compliant POBA. Vessel Preparation and Optimising POBA with High Pressure, Non-Compliant&#xD;
      balloons may help achieve Luminal Gain for rapid and sustained flow for wound healing. The&#xD;
      objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the 6-month safety and performance outcome of&#xD;
      the non-compliant high pressure JADE balloon for the treatment of infrainguinal stenotic&#xD;
      occlusive or stenotic TASC C &amp; D lesions in patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia.&#xD;
