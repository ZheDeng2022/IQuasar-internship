  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this present study was to evaluate the efficiency of the growth factors&#xD;
      delivered by concentrated growth factor (CGF) on the healing process of osteoporotic patients&#xD;
      with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study composed of osteoporotic female patients who were treated&#xD;
      with oral bisphosphonates (BPs) and diagnosed with MRONJ. For the CGF group, each patient was&#xD;
      treated with local application of CGF at the surgical site after removing the necrotic bone&#xD;
      while the surgical area was only primarily closed as traditional surgical therapy for the&#xD;
      control group. The patients underwent clinical examinations for 6 months postoperatively to&#xD;
      check the presence of infection and dehiscence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study comprised 28 elderly female osteoporotic patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with MRONJ at the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of a university hospital&#xD;
      between May 2016 and April 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the surgery, the sequentially numbered sealed envelopes were used to randomly assign&#xD;
      patients to the study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group (14 patients treated with CGF clots + primarily closure) Control group (14&#xD;
      patients treated without CGF placement + primarily closure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures were performed under local anesthesia by the same surgeon. After removal of&#xD;
      superficial bone sequestrum, the necrotic bone was removed with rotating burs, curettage was&#xD;
      performed, and the surface of the bone was smoothened (Fig. 2). CGF was then applied to the&#xD;
      surgical area in the study group (n=14), and the area was primarily closed after additional&#xD;
      releasing incisions were made to the periosteum to assure tension-free soft tissue closure&#xD;
      (Fig. 3). In the control group (n=14), the surgical area was only primarily closed without&#xD;
      any mobilization of the flap following sequestrectomy and bone curettage as a traditional&#xD;
      surgical therapy. A soft diet and daily irrigation with 0.12% chlorhexidine were prescribed&#xD;
      for 2 weeks postoperatively. The sutures were removed 14 days postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable of this study was soft tissue healing 6 months post-operatively.&#xD;
      The patients underwent weekly clinical examinations for the 1st month and then monthly&#xD;
      clinical examinations for 6 months postoperatively. At the time of the evaluation, soft&#xD;
      tissue coverage in the surgical site was assessed without signs of infection and/or necrotic&#xD;
      bone. The presence of infection was assessed as follows: erythema, swelling, bleeding on&#xD;
      probing and purulent exudate. The differences between the study groups were recorded and&#xD;
      considered to indicate postoperative healing. BP treatment status and ONJ classification of&#xD;
      each patient were recorded and these differences were also assessed in soft tissue healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, anamnestic and therapeutic data as patients' age, the type of BPs, timing of&#xD;
      medication, location of the exposed necrotic bone and MRONJ-promoting factors were recorded&#xD;
      for each patient.&#xD;
