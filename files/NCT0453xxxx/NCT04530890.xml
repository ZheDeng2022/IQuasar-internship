  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers the possibility of accessing the tumor genome from&#xD;
      circulating blood through a simple blood test. It is currently used for diagnostic,&#xD;
      prognostic and predictive purposes of response or resistance to oncological treatments. These&#xD;
      advances in ctDNA have been made possible by major developments in molecular biology&#xD;
      techniques in recent years, as the detection of ctDNA requires very sensitive techniques such&#xD;
      as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CtDNA overcomes this problem of very limiting tumor heterogeneity during a solid biopsy. All&#xD;
      of these applications make circulating DNA an increasingly essential tool in the management&#xD;
      of cancer patients. The studies are currently in most cases on small numbers and are&#xD;
      retrospective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, exosomes are also a biomarker of the future that can also be detected in the&#xD;
      bloodstream . Exosomes are nanovesicles 50 to 200 nm in diameter released into the&#xD;
      extracellular environment via the endosomal pathway by fusion with the plasma membrane. They&#xD;
      are very informative since they transport tumor genetic material in the form of DNA, mRNA and&#xD;
      miRNA, but also adhesion proteins, immunostimulatory molecules and cytoskeleton, enzymes and&#xD;
      Heats shock proteins ( HSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the ADIGYN study is to set up a large prospective cohort to assess the diagnostic,&#xD;
      prognostic and predictive impact of ctDNA and exosomes in digestive and gynecological /&#xD;
      breast cancers. From the circulating DNA, we characterize the ActDNA on the molecular level&#xD;
      thanks to the study of different point mutations usually used but also of new described&#xD;
      mutations having a therapeutic impact and the search for other genetic alterations having an&#xD;
      impact on the therapeutic strategy (such as microsatellite instability) or the study of&#xD;
      exosomes and their composition. To assess resistance to oncological treatments, ctDNA will be&#xD;
      analyzed at the start of treatment, during treatment, during progression and / or relapse and&#xD;
      also during monitoring or treatment break&#xD;
