      This study evaluates the efficacy of the addition of infliximab to conventional initial&#xD;
      treatment (intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG] plus aspirin) in early regression of coronary&#xD;
      artery lesion in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, blind-end, randomized controlled trial at 5 hospitals in&#xD;
      Shanghai, China. The KD children diagnosed within 14 days of onset according to the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for KD released by American Heart Association (AHA) in 2017 will be&#xD;
      considered for participants in the trial. The patients meeting eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the control group (receiving 2 g/kg*1 IVIG and 30 mg/kg/d&#xD;
      aspirin) or intervention group (receiving 2 g/kg*1 IVIG, 30 mg/kg/d aspirin and additional 5&#xD;
      mg/kg*1 infliximab) based on the randomly block design (block sizes 4). Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of each participant will be collected, including sex, age of onset, height,&#xD;
      body weight, subtype of KD, fever days before initial IVIG, other clinical manifestations,&#xD;
      echocardiographic findings at enrolment, and a series of pre-IVIG laboratory tests.&#xD;
      Two-dimensional echocardiography will be performed at least 7 timepoints: at admission, 2&#xD;
      weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after onset of KD to assess the&#xD;
      coronary artery lesions.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of the regression of coronary artery lesion (CAL) at one month of illness</measure>

    <description>The regression of CAL is defined as z &lt; 2 of all coronary arteries of LMCA, LAD, LCX, and the proximal and middle segment of the RCA.Two-dimensional echocardiography will be performed to evaluate CAL at 1 month of illness. The measurement of each patient included the diameter of the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the left anterior descending artery (LAD), the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX), and the proximal and middle segments of the right coronary artery (RCA). Z score of each coronary artery will be calculated (Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography, 2011, 24(1):60-74).</description>
