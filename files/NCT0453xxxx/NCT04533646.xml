      The aim of this study is to assess the utility of CGMs to determine the optimal method to&#xD;
      dose meal-time insulin. The investigators will examine glucose excursions in patients with CF&#xD;
      who will dose meal-time rapid-acting insulin by carbohydrate counting versus fixed-dose&#xD;
      rapid-acting insulin. The carbohydrate ratio and fixed doses will be determined by existing&#xD;
      doses, total daily insulin doses, body weight, and insulin sensitivity along with&#xD;
      predisposition to hypoglycemia. Bolus insulin dosing is an important part of CFRD management&#xD;
      due to the high nutritional demands of these patients. If dosed incorrectly, this could lead&#xD;
      to marked hyperglycemia and could worsen nutritional status due to urinary glucose losses. In&#xD;
      this project, the investigators will perform a within-subjects' comparison of the 2 standard&#xD;
      methods of meal-time rapid-acting insulin dosing.&#xD;

      Background and Introduction Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common&#xD;
      extra-pulmonary comorbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFRD is also associated&#xD;
      with an accelerated decline in pulmonary function, increased pulmonary exacerbations, and&#xD;
      increased mortality. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) involves the use of a small&#xD;
      disposable sensor sited in the subcutaneous interstitial fluid that makes frequent glucose&#xD;
      measurements. There is data suggesting that the Medtronic iPro continuous glucose monitors&#xD;
      (CGM) can predict hemoglobin a1c levels in patients with CFRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the utility of CGMs to determine the optimal method to&#xD;
      dose meal-time insulin. The investigators will examine glucose excursions in patients with CF&#xD;
      who will dose meal-time rapid-acting insulin by carbohydrate counting versus fixed-dose&#xD;
      rapid-acting insulin. The carbohydrate ratio and fixed doses will be determined by existing&#xD;
      doses, total daily insulin doses, body weight, and insulin sensitivity along with&#xD;
      predisposition to hypoglycemia. Bolus insulin dosing is an important part of CFRD management&#xD;
      due to the high nutritional demands of these patients. If dosed incorrectly, this could lead&#xD;
      to marked hyperglycemia and could worsen nutritional status due to urinary glucose losses. In&#xD;
      this project, the investigators will perform a within-subjects' comparison of the 2 standard&#xD;
      methods of meal-time rapid-acting insulin dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Postprandial interstitial fluid glucose levels in participants who utilize carbohydrate&#xD;
           counting to dose mealtime rapid-acting insulin will have improved control as defined as&#xD;
           the area under the curve and time in target compared to participants who used fixed-dose&#xD;
           mealtime insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who utilize carbohydrate counting will have fewer hypoglycemia events&#xD;
           compared to participants who use fixed-dose meal-time insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare within-subject glucose excursions defined as the percentage of time in target&#xD;
           glucose level, percentage of glucose in target, and peak postprandial glucose with fixed&#xD;
           insulin dosing versus carbohydrate count based insulin dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the frequency and duration of hypoglycemia (defined as the daily, weekly, and&#xD;
           average duration of the event) between insulin delivery methods described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the use of 'rule of 500' for carb counting estimation in patients with CFRD&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the effect of two methods of rapid-acting insulin delivery on fasting&#xD;
           glycemia&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study design involves a within-subjects comparison using a sequential cross over that occurs over a 2-week time frame. During the first seven days of wear, the participants will be asked to dose their mealtime rapid-acting insulin by fixed-dose, and the next seven days, participants will be asked to dose their mealtime rapid-acting insulin by carbohydrate counting. After the 14 days, participants will return their continuous glucose monitor (CGM) devices for analysis and interpretation.</intervention_model_description>
