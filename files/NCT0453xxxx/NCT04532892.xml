  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High demands, professional overload and emotional stress are well known negative influences&#xD;
      on mental health. Chronic stress-related occupational diseases, especially Burnout, are&#xD;
      becoming an important issue. Burnout can be defined as a negative affective state consisting&#xD;
      of emotional exhaustion, cognitive weariness and physical fatigue, which is caused by chronic&#xD;
      psychosocial stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no standard treatment for Burnout but different forms of psychological&#xD;
      interventions are usually attempted. Also the administration of anxiolytics, antidepressants&#xD;
      and sedatives only targets symptoms with a risk of addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, adaptogen plants have shown promising effects (e.g. Siberian Ginseng, Panax&#xD;
      Ginseng, Rhodiola rosea and Ashwagandha) by increasing the body's ability to resist stress&#xD;
      and exert a balancing effect on various systems of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is focused on the effect of a specialized nutraceutical, containing adaptogen&#xD;
      plants (Ashwagandha, Rhodiole rosea, Ginseng) as well as Vitamins and minerals (e.g. Vitamin&#xD;
      C) needed for a normal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation in subjects&#xD;
      suffering of early Burnout symptoms (pré-Burnout).&#xD;

      High demands, professional overload and emotional stress are well known negative influences&#xD;
      on mental health. Chronic stress-related occupational diseases, especially Burnout, are&#xD;
      becoming an important issue. Burnout is an outcome of chronic depletion of the individual's&#xD;
      coping resources resulting from prolonged exposure to stress, particularly work-related&#xD;
      stress. In Germany, 8% of the working population believe they suffer from burnout syndrome.&#xD;
      Among 7400 Czech Physicians, 34% feel they show symptoms and 83% perceive themselves at risk&#xD;
      for having a burnout. Currently, the prevention of burnout has been discussed worldwide as&#xD;
      absenteeism and other negative consequences related to job satisfaction, work performance and&#xD;
      patient care lead to an economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burnout can be defined as a negative affective state consisting of emotional exhaustion,&#xD;
      cognitive weariness and physical fatigue, which is caused by chronic psychosocial stress. The&#xD;
      3 major dimensions of Burnout are emotional exhaustion, depersonalizations (cynicism) and a&#xD;
      decreased sense of personal accomplishment or inefficacy. It is characterized by fatigue,&#xD;
      mood disorder, sleep problems and cognitive impairment but is difficult to differentiate from&#xD;
      depression as both illnesses are often related. The main difference with depression is at&#xD;
      physiological level, mainly in Cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased psychological stress affects the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis&#xD;
      regulation. During acute stress, plasma cortisol levels rise but during chronic stress,&#xD;
      cortisol levels decline leading to a state of depletion. This depletion leads to a smaller&#xD;
      increase of cortisol shortly after waking up, also known as the cortisol awakening response,&#xD;
      leading to a disruption of the circadian rhythm, fatigue and a decreased mental performance.&#xD;
      Next to cortisol, also DHEA levels are lower, especially in young Burnout patients. DHEA is&#xD;
      an active hormone with effects on its own and a precursor of androgens and estrogens. It has&#xD;
      a regenerative and protective role important for maintenance and restoration of health, thus&#xD;
      very important in Burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next to hormones, also nutritional deficiencies related to HPA axis dysfunction could play a&#xD;
      role in the development of Burnout. Vitamin C for example is needed for steroid biosynthesis,&#xD;
      Niacin derivates are cofactors and Pantothenic acid and folic acid are vital to maintain&#xD;
      steroid secretion from the adrenal cortex. Adrenocortical insufficiency has also been noted&#xD;
      during biotin deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of Burnout often occurs via psychological scales (e.g. Maslach Burnout Inventory)&#xD;
      with high scores for exhaustion and cynicism and low scores for professional efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no standard treatment for Burnout but different forms of psychological&#xD;
      interventions are usually attempted. Also the administration of anxiolytics, antidepressants&#xD;
      and sedatives only targets symptoms with a risk of addiction. Additionally, antidepressants&#xD;
      lower also the cortisol levels putting Burnout patients even at higher risk of spiraling into&#xD;
      Burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, adaptogens have also shown promising effects e.g. a clinical trial with Rhodiola&#xD;
      rosea in 60 patients provided evidence of an antifatigue effect and an improvement in burnout&#xD;
      symptoms. These botanicals (e.g. Siberian Ginseng, Panax Ginseng, Rhodiola rosea and&#xD;
      Ashwagandha) are defined as substances that increase the body's ability to resist stress and&#xD;
      exert a balancing effect on various systems of the body. These have shown to have an additive&#xD;
      and beneficial effect in relieving HPA axis dysfunction in combination with vitamins and&#xD;
      minerals and could thus have a beneficial effect in the treatment of Burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is focused on the effect of a specialized nutraceutical, containing adaptogens&#xD;
      (Ashwagandha, Rhodiole rosea, Ginseng) as well as Vitamins and minerals (e.g. Vitamin C)&#xD;
      needed for a normal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation in subjects&#xD;
      suffering of early Burnout symptoms (pré-Burnout).&#xD;
