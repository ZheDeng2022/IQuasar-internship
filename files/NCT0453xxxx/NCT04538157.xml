  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GOAL trial addresses patient-prioritised research topics and outcomes and will be&#xD;
      conducted, disseminated and implemented in partnership with patients and their caregivers.&#xD;
      This will be the first study, internationally, to evaluate the clinical and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), a highly promising intervention&#xD;
      for improving patient-important health outcomes in frail older people with Chronic Kidney&#xD;
      Disease (CKD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing number of frail patients with CKD, and multiple morbidities. Many of&#xD;
      them face rapid deterioration of health, referral to residential aged care facilities and&#xD;
      loss of independence. This substantively impairs their quality of life and has societal&#xD;
      ramifications, including very high costs of care. Patients and carers are often overwhelmed&#xD;
      by the multitude of decisions they have to make and may follow a care path that is in&#xD;
      contrast to their goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GOAL trial addresses patient-prioritised research topics and outcomes and will be&#xD;
      conducted, disseminated and implemented in partnership with patients and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that in frail older people with stages 3-5&#xD;
      CKD, Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (compared with usual care) will increase attainment&#xD;
      of patient-identified goals at 3 months follow up. The secondary objectives are to test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment will increase attainment of&#xD;
      patient-identified goals at 6 and 12 months follow up, improve their quality of life and&#xD;
      reduce frailty, hospital and residential aged care facility admissions while being safe and&#xD;
      cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial, a total of 500 adult CKD stage 3-5&#xD;
      patients will be recruited. Sites will be randomly allocated to either provide a&#xD;
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment to participants or usual care. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is goal attainment scaling at 3 months follow up. The secondary outcome measures will be goal&#xD;
      attainment scaling at 6 and 12 months, quality of life EQ-5D-5L, frailty index, mortality,&#xD;
      hospital and residential aged care facility admissions and cost-utility analysis.&#xD;
