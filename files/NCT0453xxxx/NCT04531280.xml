      This study examines the implications of providing hospital-level care in rural homes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home hospital care is hospital-level care at home for acutely ill patients. In multiple&#xD;
      publications mostly in urban environments, home hospital care delivered cost-effective,&#xD;
      high-quality, excellent experience care with similar quality and safety as traditional&#xD;
      hospital care. Most home hospital models deliver care in urban environments, not in rural&#xD;
      environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further improve the model, the investigators propose to determine the feasibility of home&#xD;
      hospital care in a rural home setting through a proof-of-concept approach.&#xD;

Neutral answers, such as &quot;I did not need to&quot;, and the most positive answer are coded as a &quot;non-problem&quot; (score = 0). The remaining responses are coded as &quot;problems&quot; (score = 1). A problem is defined as any aspect of health care that could be improved upon.
