  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      premature infants who had a history of intravitreal injection of (Ranibizumab) not less than&#xD;
      one year were examined for refractive state and biometry&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical records were collected in each group for birth history data, including gestational&#xD;
      age (GA), birth weight (BW), and postmenstrual age (PMA) at time of intravitreal injection.&#xD;
      The zone and stage of ROP were also recorded. All patients were evaluated for refractive&#xD;
      errors and cycloplegic refraction was performed using a handheld auto keratorefractometer&#xD;
      (Righton Retinomax K-plus2), and confirmed by retinoscopy examination. Refractive errors were&#xD;
      calculated as spherical equivalent and astigmatism in cylinder. The average corneal radius of&#xD;
      curvature was measured by handheld auto kerato-refractometer (Righton Retinomax K-plus2). The&#xD;
      biometric optic components, including anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and axial&#xD;
      length, were measured using A-scan ultrasound (model Echoscan US-4000 / 500; Nidek)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  premature infants who had a history of intravitreal injection of (Ranibizumab) not&#xD;
             less than one year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Three control groups with age and sex matched were included for comparison. First&#xD;
             group included premature infants who had ROP that regressed spontaneously without&#xD;
             intervention. Second group was corresponded to premature infants who were diagnosed to&#xD;
             have normal retinal vasculature from the first examination after birth. The third&#xD;
             group belonged to full term babies&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premature infants who received intravitreal injection of (Ranibizumab) less than one&#xD;
             year or had any ocular pathology&#xD;
