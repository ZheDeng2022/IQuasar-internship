  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary purpose is to assess the use feasibility and acceptability of the study phone app&#xD;
      called, &quot;Oabi&quot; app with patients diagnosed with overactive bladder disorder (OAB).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tracking overactive bladder disorder can be an important part of managing the disease. It can&#xD;
      help the patient and the health care providers keep a tab on what is working to help manage&#xD;
      OAB symptoms. Tracking urination patterns can actually help patients normalize their bladder&#xD;
      problems. By focusing on certain behaviors and habits that contribute to their OAB and&#xD;
      changing those behaviors, patients can effectively control OAB symptoms. The Oabi mobile&#xD;
      application has been created with the goal of helping patients learn more about their&#xD;
      day-to-day symptoms as well as track and self-manage their symptoms. Additionally, the Oabi&#xD;
      app connects patients with their HCP via a clinician portal to boost communication, and&#xD;
      encourage patient-provider interaction. The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      usability and acceptability of the Oabi mobile app.&#xD;
