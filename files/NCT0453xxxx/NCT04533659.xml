  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid growth rate and unique challenges as a new immigrant group call for a better&#xD;
      understanding of the social and health needs of the older Asian Americans (AAs) population.&#xD;
      Overwhelming numbers of AAs, a fast-growing first-generation immigrant group, suffer from&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its consequences of poorly controlled blood glucose. For the older&#xD;
      AAs, there are higher prevalence rates, worse diabetes control, and higher rates of&#xD;
      complications due to limited English proficiency and health literacy. Despite the evidence&#xD;
      concerning the effects of dietary interventions on glycemic control by well-controlled&#xD;
      feeding studies in mainstream Americans, a lack of clinical trials of culturally tailored&#xD;
      interventions often imposes serious barriers to translate and implement such fruitful and&#xD;
      innovative approaches in individuals from ethnic minority communities such as AAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will use a randomized, controlled design with a sample of 60 AAs aged 65&#xD;
      years or older. Metabolomics methodologies will be incorporated into this research to provide&#xD;
      a global picture of metabolites' responses to personalized behavioral nutrition (PBN)&#xD;
      intervention. The study results will obtain the necessary information to conduct a meaningful&#xD;
      community-based clinical trial to test the effectiveness of PBN in improving dietary patterns&#xD;
      and glycemic control in older AAs.&#xD;

      This study is designed with two aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine if PBN intervention improves glycemic control, weight control, and&#xD;
           metabolites profiles compared with the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to identify significant factors that influence the relative effectiveness of PBN and the&#xD;
           relative acceptability of PBN.&#xD;
