      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cancer treatment has been developed called &quot;gene transfer&quot; or &quot;gene therapy.&quot; It involves&#xD;
      taking white blood cells from a person (called apheresis), genetically modifying the cells in&#xD;
      a lab to recognize cancer, and then giving the cells back to the person. Researchers want to&#xD;
      see if this treatment can help people with metastatic squamous cell anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if treating cancer with a person s own white blood cells that have been genetically&#xD;
      modified can cause tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have metastatic squamous cell anal cancer for which standard treatments have not&#xD;
      worked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have had a tumor biopsy and apheresis to collect white blood cells under a&#xD;
      separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at the hospital for 3 to 4 weeks. They will have an intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      catheter placed in a large vein in the upper chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get chemotherapy drugs (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide), the cell&#xD;
      infusion, and aldesleukin through the IV. Pembrolizumab is given before and for three doses&#xD;
      given every three weeks after the cell infusion. Aldesleukin will help the cells grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take an antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal by mouth. They will get an&#xD;
      injection of filgrastim. It will stimulate the formation of white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine tests. They will have physical exams. Their symptoms&#xD;
      will be reviewed. They will have imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 6 and 12 weeks after they finish treatment, participants will have safety follow-up&#xD;
      visits. These visits will take 1 to 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the Clinical Center every 3 to 6 months for 3 years, and then as&#xD;
      determined by their doctor. They will be followed long term for up to 15 years on a separate&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can mediate&#xD;
           complete, durable regressions in 20-25% of patients with metastatic melanoma. Recent&#xD;
           studies have shown that these TIL predominantly recognize unique mutated or viral&#xD;
           neoantigens expressed by the cancer not shared by other melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of bulk autologous TIL to patients with a variety of other solid cancers,&#xD;
           including cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, have little if&#xD;
           any therapeutic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent studies in the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) have shown that&#xD;
           TIL from non-melanoma solid cancers can also contain T-cells reactive against nonshared&#xD;
           unique mutated neoantigens expressed in the cancer. The frequency of these Tcells is&#xD;
           very low (often &lt; 0.1%) and it is thus difficult to isolate and grow mutation reactive&#xD;
           T-cells to levels required for effective therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a single patient with chemo-refractory metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, we were able to&#xD;
           grow a relatively pure population of neoantigen reactive TIL and administration of these&#xD;
           cells mediated a near-complete regression of all metastatic disease now lasting 2.5&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have developed approaches to identify rare neoantigen reactive T-cells from common&#xD;
           non-melanoma cancers, to isolate their T-cell receptors (TCR), and to genetically&#xD;
           engineer autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to express these TCRs with high&#xD;
           efficiency. The neoantigen TCR gene-modified cells can recognize and destroy the&#xD;
           autologous cancer in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to reactivity to neoantigens derived from nonsynonymous mutations, T-cells&#xD;
           can recognize human papilloma virus (HPV) epitopes in patients with HPV-induced cancers.&#xD;
           The TCR from these reactive cells can be isolated and retrovirally-transduced into&#xD;
           autologous PBL with high efficiency. This clinical protocol will treat a single patient&#xD;
           with refractory anal cancer using the adoptive transfer of autologous PBL transduced&#xD;
           with genes encoding TCRs that recognize unique mutated or viral neoantigens expressed by&#xD;
           the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Under a single-patient IND, to treat a patient with metastatic HPV-16 positive squamous cell&#xD;
      anal cancer with autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) that have been transduced with&#xD;
      genes encoding T-cell receptors that recognize mutated or viral neoantigens in the autologous&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have measurable, metastatic disease as assessed per RECIST v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must sign the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing to sign Durable Power of Attorney Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have all regulatory approvals prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This patient will have already undergone resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for&#xD;
           generation of autologous TIL cultures. This will have been conducted under the NCI-SB&#xD;
           cell harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch&#xD;
           Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exomic sequencing and RNA-Seq will be performed to identify the mutations expressed in&#xD;
           the patient s cancer. Multiple autologous TIL cultures will be grown and tested for&#xD;
           reactivity against mutations from the autologous tumor using assays we have developed&#xD;
           that involve the exposure of autologous antigen-presenting cells to long peptides&#xD;
           containing the mutation or tandem mini-genes encoding the mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cell cultures with reactivity against mutated and viral neoantigens will be identified&#xD;
           and the individual T-cell receptors that recognize the neoantigens will be synthesized&#xD;
           and used to create retroviral supernatants for transduction of the TCR into the patient&#xD;
           s autologous PBL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be treated with a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative&#xD;
           regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by the infusion of autologous&#xD;
           transduced PBL and then high-dose aldesleukin. The patient will also receive&#xD;
           pembrolizumab on Day -2 prior to cell administration and three additional doses every&#xD;
           three weeks following the cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after cell infusion&#xD;
           and periodically thereafter.&#xD;
