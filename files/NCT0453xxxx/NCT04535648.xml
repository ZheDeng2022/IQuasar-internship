  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CRISPR-enterovirus detection system was constructed in this study for detection variety&#xD;
      genotypes of enterovirus rapidly in children suspected or diagnosed as enterovirus infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To construct CRISPR-enterovirus detection system, we screened the targets, primers and CrRNA&#xD;
      and evaluated the capability of this detecting system. Samples of feces, blood and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (the remainder of routine testing samples) from 500 children with&#xD;
      suspected or confirmed enterovirus infection were examined using the CRISPR technique. To&#xD;
      evaluate the CRISPR-enterovirus detection system, real-time PCR and traditional PCR as&#xD;
      comparison method was implemented. The method of real-time PCR and traditional PCR were used&#xD;
      to detect enterovirus and analyze the genotypes of enterovirus, respectively. According to&#xD;
      the results of CRISPR-enterovirus detection system and the comparison method, the positive&#xD;
      coincidence rate, negative coincidence rate and consistency of the two methods were&#xD;
      calculated. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of the CRISPR-enterovirus detection&#xD;
      system for detection of enterovirus were calculated.&#xD;

    <description>It is a binary variable (&quot;yes/no&quot;).If the system meet all the following criteria, it would be setted into &quot;yes&quot; .According to the results of CRISPR-enterovirus detection system and the comparison methodï¼š&#xD;
the positive coincidence rate and negative coincidence rate are both over 95.0%;&#xD;
the value of Kappa using to express the consistency of those two methods is over 0.75;&#xD;
the sensitivity and specificity of the CRISPR-enterovirus detection system for detection of enterovirus are over 90.0% and 95.0%;&#xD;
the coefficient of variation between batches is less 15.0%, and each batch detection takes less than 1 hour.</description>
