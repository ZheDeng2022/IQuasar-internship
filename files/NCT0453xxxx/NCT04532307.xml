    <textblock>
      Despite advances in efficacious, efficient and safe biomedical tools to reduce HIV&#xD;
      transmission and acquisition the HIV epidemic in South Africa(SA) remains an intractable&#xD;
      problem, with the lifetime risk of infection approaching 70% for a 15-year-old girl currently&#xD;
      living in northern KwaZulu-Natal, the Africa Health Research Institute(AHRI) research&#xD;
      setting. This is in part due to the difficulty in engaging adolescents and youth in HIV&#xD;
      interventions. We build on formative work to develop and tailor the interventions to young&#xD;
      people's needs. Our findings suggested that young people want to focus on sexual and&#xD;
      reproductive health(SRH) and value health-promotion from people of their own age and&#xD;
      background (peer-support). In a 2016 population-based study of 15-24-year-olds in the study&#xD;
      area we found that one in five had a curable Sexually Transmitted Infection(STI) of which&#xD;
      three quarters of did not report any symptoms and would not have been cured with current&#xD;
      syndromic management. We also found that home-based self-sampling and treatment for STIs was&#xD;
      acceptable and desirable to young people. Based on this we developed and conducted a 6-month&#xD;
      pilot of the Isisekelo Sempilo adolescent and youth friendly clinics. These are mobile and&#xD;
      fixed clinics that are linked to existing primary care services. The clinics deliver&#xD;
      nurse-led HIV-testing, prevention and care integrated with SRH. To date n=337 of those&#xD;
      referred from the community(~10%) have attended the clinic. In our setting &gt;85% of&#xD;
      school-leavers are unemployed; there are high levels of common mental disorders which&#xD;
      increase with age (rising to 32% of those aged 20-22). Systematic reviews have found that&#xD;
      community-based delivery of HIV care and peers are effective in supporting HIV care,&#xD;
      adherence and virologic suppression. However, none of these interventions have been tested&#xD;
      for HIV-prevention and in youth. Based on this we developed and piloted Thetha Nami, an&#xD;
      area-based peer-navigator intervention promoting psychosocial well-being in addition to&#xD;
      HIV-prevention to young people aged 15-29. Over a four-month period 24-pairs of peer&#xD;
      navigators approached 5872, 15-29-year-old men and women, of which 5272 (90%) accepted the&#xD;
      needs assessment. We aim to use advances in intervention design and evaluation to answer the&#xD;
      question, &quot;will these tailored HIV-prevention interventions developed in partnership with&#xD;
      young people arrest the HIV epidemic and improve well-being?&quot;&#xD;

      Study design: We will conduct a 2x2 factorial design intervention pilot trial including 1500&#xD;
      men and women aged 16-29-years old and living in the AHRI surveillance area. The study&#xD;
      duration will be 18 months. We will randomly offer one of four combinations of interventions&#xD;
      in a factorial trial to 1500 consenting men and women aged 16-29-years old and living in our&#xD;
      study area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes: (1) a reduction of the proportion of individuals with infectious HIV (i.e.&#xD;
      remaining HIV negative or with an undetectable HIV viral load on treatment if positive) and&#xD;
      (2) uptake of comprehensive HIV prevention services, including Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) if negative and antiretroviral (ART) if positive. We will also evaluate uptake of&#xD;
      contraception, incidence of pregnancy, mental health and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Recruitment: Research assistants (RAs) will approach 3000 randomly&#xD;
      selected 16-29-year old males and females selected from our demographic surveillance area in&#xD;
      their homes. From our experience we expect that 2000 will still be eligible, i.e. aged 16-29&#xD;
      and still living in the surveillance area. RAs will provide information about the study to&#xD;
      all eligible participants and consent (in the case of 16-17-year-olds assent with parental&#xD;
      consent) them to a) be offered an intervention and b) to be followed up at 12 months to&#xD;
      measure the outcome. We anticipate that n=1500 [75% (73-77%)] will consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: a) Standard of Care (SOC): RAs refer participants to adolescent and youth&#xD;
      friendly services with family planning, HIV testing and ART if positive and PrEP for those&#xD;
      eligible and negative (according to the South African national Department of Health&#xD;
      guidelines); b) SRH enhanced arm (Isisekelo Sempilo): Self-collected vaginal and urine&#xD;
      samples are collected at enrolment. RAs provide clinic appointment for results, treatment and&#xD;
      sexual health promotion and services. These promote fertility and family planning; HIV&#xD;
      testing, and benefits of ART including Undetectable=Uninfectious amongst positives and PrEP&#xD;
      for those eligible and negative; c) Peer-support (Thetha-Nami): RAs refer the participant to&#xD;
      a peer navigator in their community. Peer navigators will assess their health, social and&#xD;
      educational needs, provide mentorship, and help them access the services they need. The peer&#xD;
      navigator will facilitate attendance, adherence and retention at the clinic; or d) SRH +&#xD;
      peer-support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: We will measure linkage to clinical services within 60 days of randomisation&#xD;
      and adverse events. At 12 months from enrolment RAs will approach all those who consented at&#xD;
      baseline to conduct a tablet-based survey on uptake of HIV prevention and care services,&#xD;
      uptake of contraception and pregnancy, mental health (using PHQ9), and quality of life. They&#xD;
      will collect dry blood spot for HIV ELISA and HIV viral load, and offer point of-care HIV&#xD;
      testing, STI testing and treatment. We will conduct a process evaluation to assess service&#xD;
      users and providers and the community experience and any social harms. We will establish the&#xD;
      cost of delivering the intervention in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: With n=1500 we have the power to show an increase in linkage to clinical services&#xD;
      from 10% in SOC to 22% with peer-support or SRH only and 38% with peer-support and SRH. We&#xD;
      also have the power to detect a reduction in the proportion of 16-29-year olds with a&#xD;
      detectable HIV viral load from 7% to 3.5% at 12 months.&#xD;
