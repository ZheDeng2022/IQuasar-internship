      To assess changes in pain, physical function, health-related quality of life, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in patients with low back pain, without symptoms of radiculopathy, that&#xD;
      have not responded to conservative or traditional interventional measures and are having a&#xD;
      SPRINT percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulator placed as standard of care. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed periodically (by questionnaire) after the placement of the SPRINT, FDA approved 60&#xD;
      day, percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulator, targeting the bilateral medial branches at the&#xD;
      suspected level of pain generation. Neither the manufacturer nor the FDA are involved or will&#xD;
      have access to data from this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Low back pain is one of a few conditions which affects all individuals through the lifespan.&#xD;
      The etiology of low back pain is multifactorial and in many cases self-limiting, however it&#xD;
      also is the leading cause for working age adults to be disabled with more than $87 billion&#xD;
      spent on low back pain disorders in 2013. Listhesis of a vertebral body, chronic compression&#xD;
      fractures, lumbar disc herniation, and internal disc disruptions are some primary anatomical&#xD;
      abnormalities that can cause back pain and do not have great targeted treatments. that may&#xD;
      more common in these younger age groups reaching 39-42% with a predicted probability above&#xD;
      60% until age 50y. While the natural history of back pain suggests most individuals will&#xD;
      return to a prior level of function in 3-6 months, there is a high rate of recurrent episodes&#xD;
      which can cause short-term disability. Continued back pain can lead to decreased activity&#xD;
      levels and accelerate degenerative changes in the disc and facet joints as described by&#xD;
      Kirkaldy-Willis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines for treatment of axial low back pain include a 6-12-week course of&#xD;
      conservative care including medications, therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic and exercise&#xD;
      before an interventional paradigm of injections and/or surgical treatment. For those&#xD;
      individuals who do not improve with conservative care and have predominately axial pain,&#xD;
      options are limited as success rates from epidural steroid injections and surgery are 50% or&#xD;
      less. Other treatments include chymopapain injection, intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty&#xD;
      (IDET), nucleoplasty, methylene blue injection. All of which have 50% or less likelihood of&#xD;
      reducing pain more than 50%, although much of this data is from uncontrolled or prospective&#xD;
      case-control studies only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) recently gained FDA approval as an interventional&#xD;
      treatment of chronic back pain. PNS involves a minimally invasive percutaneous microelectrode&#xD;
      connected to an external impulse generator that adheres to the skin for up to 60 days and&#xD;
      then the entire system is removed. It is theorized that the neuromodulatory effects of PNS&#xD;
      interrupts the chronic pain cycle and allowing healthy recovery of afferent signaling and&#xD;
      limiting and perhaps reversing the maladaptive cortical plasticity involved in chronic pain.&#xD;
      There have been two prospective cohort studies published this year, both of which showed&#xD;
      meaningful clinical improvement in pain and function scores. One of these studies (Cohen et&#xD;
      al.) showed that more than 50% of the patients had greater than 50% improvement in pain at&#xD;
      one year after undergoing 2 months of implanted PNS treatment.&#xD;
