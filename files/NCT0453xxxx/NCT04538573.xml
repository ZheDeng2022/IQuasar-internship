    <textblock>
      Background: Each year, more than 40 severely burned children aged 7 to 17 are treated at the&#xD;
      CHU Sainte-Justine trauma center. The treatment of burns, dressing changes as well as&#xD;
      physiotherapy, occupational therapy and hydrotherapy are considered to be among the most&#xD;
      painful medical procedures. These are usually recurrent treatments that generate a lot of&#xD;
      anxiety and can leave their long-term negative impact on the child's memory and relationship&#xD;
      to pain. To date, no distraction has been tried to distract these children during these&#xD;
      painful procedures. The use of virtual reality as a distraction tool has proven itself as a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapeutic modality. However, very little data exists on its use in this&#xD;
      context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: VR distraction provides better pain relief during hydrotherapy, occupational&#xD;
      therapy and physiotherapy, in children from 7 to 17 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Within-subject/crossover study design. Each child serves as his own control and&#xD;
      receives both standard and experimental treatment during the same treatment session through a&#xD;
      randomized order. Convenience sampling of 20 children aged from 6 to 17 years old presenting&#xD;
      with a burn injury to the medical-surgical unit or rehabilitation clinics of the CHU&#xD;
      Ste-Justine and CRME. Standard pharmacological care as per the unit's protocol will be given&#xD;
      to the control group as opposed to VR distraction combined with the Standard care for the&#xD;
      experimental group. Pain (NRS 0-10) and anxiety (CFS, 0-4) will be measured before the&#xD;
      treatment session at (T0), after the first sequence of the session (T1) and after the second&#xD;
      sequence of the session (T2) followed by a measure of parents' and healthcare professionals'&#xD;
      level of satisfaction via a questionnaire developed and pretested by the team. Memory of pain&#xD;
      and anxiety will be assessed about a week after the procedure (T3). Data is also collected on&#xD;
      the occurrence of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The investigators believe that results of this study could transform a hospital&#xD;
      experience that is a priori negative, or even traumatic, into a fun and positive experience,&#xD;
      both for the children and the families by improving pain and anxiety management practices for&#xD;
      rehabilitation procedures for burn victims (hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, occupational&#xD;
      therapy) at a low cost.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric burn care procedures, in hydrotherapy, have been known to generate severe pain&#xD;
      intensity as well as moderate to high levels of anxiety. In the acute phase, burn patients&#xD;
      undergo several painful procedures such as wound debridement, passive range-of-motion (ROM)&#xD;
      exercises and dressing changes treatments. These procedures are important for proper&#xD;
      rehabilitation as they prevent contractures, muscle spasms and limited joint mobility, which&#xD;
      are mainly related to scarring and loss of skin elasticity as secondary complications&#xD;
      resulting with normal healing process following a burn injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrotherapy treatments for burn care are done with the use of opioids and benzodiazepines&#xD;
      for their pain and anxiety, strong medications alone are often inadequate to control their&#xD;
      pain and anxiety. Since those treatments cause a great deal of pain, high dosage is needed in&#xD;
      order to reach an acceptable relief with the medication. The delicate balance between pain&#xD;
      relief and the dosage used is often at the limit of respiratory depression. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods are rarely combined with the pharmacological treatments used to&#xD;
      relieve pain during those procedures even if they could decrease the necessary dose of&#xD;
      analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Reality (VR) is a distraction method that allows the user to interact with an&#xD;
      immersive environment generated by a computer stimulating different senses. The use of VR is&#xD;
      promising for pain reduction in varying settings. Other positive effects including reduction&#xD;
      of anxiety and general distress during different painful medical procedures (such as&#xD;
      venipuncture, wound care, chemotherapy and dental procedures) have been reported by children&#xD;
      and adults. Further, recent randomized-controlled trials, comparing VR and standard&#xD;
      distraction in children undergoing blood drawn procedures, demonstrated a significant&#xD;
      positive effect of VR on reduction of pain and anxiety and enhanced patients', caregivers'&#xD;
      and phlebotomist's satisfaction. Also, Gold and Maher concluded that VR was more effective&#xD;
      for children with higher anxiety sensitivity, adding another gain for the adoption of this&#xD;
      new technology in children's health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few authors have studied the effect of Virtual Reality (VR) on procedural pain and&#xD;
      anxiety management in burn children older than 6 years. Indeed, a review of the literature&#xD;
      has yielded only three studies who used VR with burn children. Schmitt et al., compared the&#xD;
      efficacy of VR with standard pharmacological care in an RCT on 54 children (6 to 19 years)&#xD;
      suffering from burn-related injuries with TBSA (Total Body Surface Area) varying from 1 to&#xD;
      50. Results showed better pain control and maximum ROM in children in the VR group. Another&#xD;
      study combined participants from three studies (to increase power) to compare the use of VR&#xD;
      with standard pharmacological care with children undergoing physical therapy following a&#xD;
      major burn. Results on 110 children also showed that VR significantly decreased pain and&#xD;
      unpleasantness related to pain in children with burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, Virtual Reality has shown positive effects with burn children who underwent&#xD;
      hydrotherapy sessions and dressing changes. Although, very few studies have looked at the&#xD;
      effect of VR on the management of pain, anxiety and memory of both in children undergoing&#xD;
      painful burn wound care. Distractions are an interesting non-pharmacological method that can&#xD;
      be used. We believe that Virtual Reality (VR) as an adjunct to current burn care (standard&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment), could be easily adopted by hydrotherapy staff as part of their&#xD;
      care as it is an easy to use and low-cost intervention. Also, we believe that it could help&#xD;
      make the overall recovery process less painful and less distressful for burn children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, there is evidence to suggest that reducing procedural pain and distress in the&#xD;
      short-term, will have long lasting effects on children's pain and health trajectories in the&#xD;
      long-term. The effect of pain on a developing child does not end after painful procedures&#xD;
      end; how children remember these experiences can have long lasting effects. Children who&#xD;
      recall pain in negatively-biased ways (i.e., they recall more pain than an earlier pain&#xD;
      report) experience more pain and distress at future pain experiences and are at risk for&#xD;
      developing persistent pain problems and fears and avoidance of medical care . Importantly,&#xD;
      children (and parents) who are more anxious and distressed prior to painful medical&#xD;
      procedures, and who experience higher pain during medical procedures, are the very children&#xD;
      who develop these negatively biased recalls. Additionally, one study of youth undergoing&#xD;
      vaccine injections showed that interventions to reduce pain and distress (distraction,&#xD;
      topical anesthetic) buffered against the development of negatively biased recalls. Therefore,&#xD;
      we will also examine the effect of VR distraction, a more immersive intervention, on&#xD;
      children's later recall of pain. This is innovative as we did not find any other studies&#xD;
      using VR and collecting data on pain and anxiety recalls in children following painful&#xD;
      medical procedures. Further, we will compare salivary Alpha-Amylase levels between groups,&#xD;
      which is a reliable and valid surrogate marker of stress that increases in response to&#xD;
      physical and psychological stressful conditions such as experience of medical procedures. It&#xD;
      is also more sensitive and rises more quickly after a painful procedure (10 min) than&#xD;
      cortisol (35-40 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, considering the lack of optimal pain and anxiety management during burn wound care&#xD;
      and the positive effect of an immersive distraction method such as VR for painful procedures,&#xD;
      using VR for burn wound care procedures may show promising results. To our knowledge, no&#xD;
      other studies have tested the effect of an immersive distraction such as VR for procedural&#xD;
      pain management in children undergoing these painful orthopedic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this within-subject randomized clinical trial is to examine the efficacy of an&#xD;
      immersive distraction (virtual reality) compared to the standard treatment for pain and&#xD;
      anxiety management in children requiring burn wound car in hydrotherapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Virtual Reality (VR) as an adjunct intervention to current burn care (standard&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment) will provide better pain and anxiety management than standard&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if VR distraction combined with analgesics is more effective than standard&#xD;
           treatment (analgesics alone) to manage procedural pain of children with burn injuries&#xD;
           during hydrotherapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare if VR distraction combined with analgesics is more effective than standard&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment to manage procedural anxiety of children with burn injuries&#xD;
           during hydrotherapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare if, in children with burn injuries, VR distraction combined with the standard&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment sequence generate less distressing recall of procedural pain&#xD;
           and anxiety than standard pharmacological treatment alone sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the occurrence of side effects between VR distraction combined with the&#xD;
           standard pharmacological treatment sequence and standard pharmacological treatment alone&#xD;
           sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare healthcare professionals' satisfaction levels between VR distraction combined&#xD;
           with pharmacological treatment sequence and standard pharmacological treatment alone&#xD;
           sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare children's satisfaction levels between VR distraction combined with standard&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment sequence and standard pharmacological treatment alone sequence&#xD;
           alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A within-subject randomized clinical trial design with randomized sequences. Given&#xD;
      the difficulty of ensuring any blinding conditions with the nature of the experimentation,&#xD;
      and in order to limit the interpersonal variability between participants, each child will&#xD;
      serve as their own control, hence receiving both standard (control) and experimental&#xD;
      treatments (VR) during the same treatment session through a randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample and Settings: Recruitment will be done through convenience sampling upon admission to&#xD;
      the surgical-trauma burn unit at CHU Ste-Justine, Montreal (Qc), Canada. Originally, this&#xD;
      study also included a followup with those same patients at the rehabilitation clinic for&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Unfortunately, due to the COVID sanitary crisis, recruiting personnel&#xD;
      availability and the difficulty of movement between units and to clinics, recruiting will be&#xD;
      limited to the burn unit. Using a within-subject design allows the possibility of recruiting&#xD;
      a minimum of 20 participants in order to have effectively 40 patients since they will act as&#xD;
      their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures and outcomes: Timepoints. Data will be collected by research assistants/nurses at&#xD;
      the following study times: before the procedure to establish baseline (T0), immediately after&#xD;
      the first sequence (T1), immediately after the second sequence (T2) and one week after the&#xD;
      procedure (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Since this is a pilot study there is usually no specific requirements regarding&#xD;
      the sample size. However, it is recommended by some authors to use about a total of 20&#xD;
      patients (overall, 40 patients since all patients will serve as their own control) to be able&#xD;
      to proceed to statistical analyses required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: Comparisons will be conducted within and between subjects for the&#xD;
      dependent variables for repeated measures. The mean difference in pain scores of patients at&#xD;
      each time-period will be compared using a paired t-test or Wilcoxon sign-rank test. Since the&#xD;
      use of rescue medication is a potential indication of a treatment failure, the primary&#xD;
      analysis will be supplemented by an analysis comparing the proportion of patients receiving&#xD;
      rescue medication anytime during the procedure. Interpretation of the primary analyses will&#xD;
      be made with reference to the data regarding rescue medication use. Data collected on&#xD;
      dichotomous variables will be analyzed using a chi-square test and post-hoc analyses if the&#xD;
      results are statistically significant.&#xD;
