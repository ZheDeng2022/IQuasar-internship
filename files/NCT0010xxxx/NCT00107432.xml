  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with malignant&#xD;
      mesothelioma. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the response rate (partial response (PR) and complete response (CR)) in&#xD;
      patients with malignant mesothelioma treated with BAY 43-9006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine 3-month failure free survival in patients with malignant mesothelioma treated&#xD;
      with BAY 43-9006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the median and overall survival of malignant mesothelioma patients treated&#xD;
      with BAY 43-9006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the toxicity profile of BAY 43-9006 in patients with malignant mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether mesotheliomas contain mutations in exons 11 and 15 of the B-raf gene&#xD;
      and correlate these findings with anti-tumor activity of BAY 43-9006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine whether the amount of expression of phospho-ERK1/2, as determined by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry from pre-treatment tumor specimens, correlates with anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of BAY 43-9006 in patients with mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine whether baseline levels and changes following BAY 43-9006 treatment in&#xD;
      angiogenic cytokines (VEGF and PDGF) correlate with anti-tumor activity of BAY 43-9006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 2 months for 1&#xD;
      year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically documented malignant mesothelioma, epithelial, sarcomatoid or mixed&#xD;
             type, not amenable to curative surgery; any site of origin of malignant mesothelioma,&#xD;
             including but not limited to: pleura, peritoneum, pericardium and tunica vaginalis is&#xD;
             allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathology blocks or slides from a core surgical biopsy must be available for&#xD;
             evaluation of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation by immunohistochemistry and for sequencing of&#xD;
             B-raf exons 11 and 15&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy naive or no more than one pemetrexed containing chemotherapy regimen;&#xD;
             chemotherapy may have been pemetrexed alone or in combination with any other agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior tyrosine kinase/signal transduction/angiogenesis inhibitor therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior intracavitary cytotoxic or sclerosing therapy (including bleomycin) are&#xD;
             acceptable; prior intrapleural cytotoxic chemotherapy will not be considered systemic&#xD;
             chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;= 3 weeks since major surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt;= 4 weeks since completion of prior radiation therapy, as long as measurable disease&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  &gt;= 4 weeks since the completion of prior pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No treatment with an investigational agent currently or within the last 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No patients with known brain metastases; patients with known brain metastases should&#xD;
             be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pleural rind only disease must have at least one level with one rind&#xD;
             measurement &gt;= 1.5 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease is defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least&#xD;
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques (CT, MRI, x-ray) or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance status of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to BAY 43-9006&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-pregnant and non-nursing because the effects of BAY 43-9006 on the fetus/infant&#xD;
             are unknown; in addition, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             an appropriate method of birth control throughout their participation in this study;&#xD;
             appropriate methods of birth control include abstinence, oral contraceptives,&#xD;
             implantable hormonal contraceptives (Norplant), or double barrier methods (diaphragm&#xD;
             plus condom)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancers and carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not eligible; patients are not&#xD;
             considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy if they have completed&#xD;
             therapy and are considered to have a less than 30% chance of risk of relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to:&#xD;
             ongoing active infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No patients on therapeutic anticoagulation; prophylactic anticoagulation (i.e., low&#xD;
             dose warfarin) of venous or arterial access devices is allowed provided that the&#xD;
             requirements for INR are met&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of bleeding diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No HIV positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy; patients with&#xD;
             immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving combination&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006&#xD;
