  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether topical application of PEP005 is safe for&#xD;
      the treatment of nodular basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are a common skin problem largely caused by long term sun&#xD;
      exposure. Current treatments include surgery, curettage/desiccation and simple excision,&#xD;
      which are often cosmetically disfiguring. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of&#xD;
      BCC lesions is thus being researched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sap from the plant Euphorbia peplus has been used for many years in Australia as a &quot;folk&quot;&#xD;
      remedy to treat a number of skin conditions. The active component of Euphorbia peplus has&#xD;
      been isolated and made into a gel applied directly to the skin by Peplin Ltd. To date, only&#xD;
      one well-controlled study with PEP005 gel in humans has been completed. Sixteen patients&#xD;
      received a single application of PEP005 0.01% or vehicle gel to actinic keratoses on the&#xD;
      chest, shoulders, back and/or arms. Results show good tolerance and evidence of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is designed to evaluate the safety of two applications of PEP005 gel in&#xD;
      patients with nBCC (nodular basal cell carcinoma) on the arms, shoulders, chest, face and/or&#xD;
      scalp, testing three concentrations according to two treatment regimens. Approximately 60&#xD;
      patients are planned to be included from multiple Australian centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and cosmetic outcome will be assessed and a recommended treatment regimen will be&#xD;
      determined. Assignment to treatment is random and patients and medical staff will be blinded&#xD;
      as to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have two visits for treatment application and will return for check-up visits&#xD;
      the day after the first application and several times thereafter for approximately 3 months.&#xD;
