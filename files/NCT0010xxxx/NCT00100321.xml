      This study will examine pancreatic tumor tissue and immune cells from patients with a&#xD;
      pancreatic tumor to look for markers on these cells that may be useful in developing new&#xD;
      treatments for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 16 years of age and older with any evidence of a primary pancreatic tumor that can&#xD;
      be surgically removed may be eligible for this study. Types of pancreatic tumors included in&#xD;
      this trial are pancreatic cancer, adenosquamous carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, IPMN&#xD;
      (intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasm), acinar cell carcinoma, pancreaticoblastoma,&#xD;
      mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystic neoplasms, solid-pseudopapillary cystic neoplasms,&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma, Vater (ampullary tumors) duodenal adenoma or cancer and common bile&#xD;
      duct tumors (cholangiocarcinoma.) The specific type of tumor does not have to be determined&#xD;
      before the operation. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest,&#xD;
      abdomen, and pelvis, blood and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram. Patients older than 50&#xD;
      years of age and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease may also have a thallium&#xD;
      cardiac stress test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo standard treatment for their pancreatic tumor, including surgery to&#xD;
      remove the tumor. Before, during, and after the operation, several blood samples are drawn as&#xD;
      part of routine patient care and for research tests. During the surgery, a small piece of&#xD;
      tumor tissue is taken for examination under the microscope and to grow cells in the&#xD;
      laboratory for tumor and immune cell studies. Some patients may undergo leukapheresis to&#xD;
      collect large numbers of white blood cells for study. For this procedure, blood is collected&#xD;
      through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine&#xD;
      that separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are&#xD;
      extracted and the rest of the blood (plasma, red cells, and platelets) is returned through&#xD;
      another needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who require additional treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation, may be treated&#xD;
      at NIH on another protocol or referred for appropriate treatment elsewhere.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effective standard treatment options are currently not available for exocrine pancreas&#xD;
           carcinomas. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, the most frequent exocrine tumor, is the&#xD;
           fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths in men or women in this country.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunotherapy for melanoma as studied in the Surgery Branch has resulted in striking&#xD;
           tumor regression in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procurement of lymphocytes and tumor from patients with pancreas cancer will facilitate&#xD;
           the identification of tumor-associated antigens leading to rational extensions of&#xD;
           adoptive therapy and vaccination directed against this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective: To obtain tissue, both tumor and lymphocytes, which can be used to&#xD;
           identify tumor antigens specific to the various histologies of pancreas and ampullary&#xD;
           cancer along with the HLA restricted epitopes of these antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objective: To treat patients with resectable pancreas neoplasms using standard&#xD;
           pancreatic resection and follow for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any patient greater than or equal to16 years of age with radiographic or endoscopic&#xD;
           evidence of a pancreatic mass, ampullary mass or malignant stricture without evidence of&#xD;
           distant metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have an ECOG performance score of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable&#xD;
           limits by standard of practice guidelines prior to biopsy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tissue acquisition trial in which tissues will be obtained at the time of surgical&#xD;
           operation for the resection of pancreas exocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue will be processed by the Surgery Branch Cell processing lab in accordance with&#xD;
           their standard practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No investigational therapy will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that 180 patients will be enrolled over 7 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Recovered from any serious toxicity experienced during previous treatment (chemo-,&#xD;
        radiation, hormone, immuno-, etc., therapy) for pancreas cancer to a grade 2 or less.&#xD;
