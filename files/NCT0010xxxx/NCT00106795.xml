  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine abnormalities in mitochondria (energy-producing machinery of cells)&#xD;
      and in genes related to mitochondria in the blood cells, muscle, and fat of HIV-positive&#xD;
      patients who are taking nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and in patients&#xD;
      not currently taking HIV medications, and compare the results to healthy volunteers. Many&#xD;
      patients with HIV infection take NRTIs to help control the infection. These medications may&#xD;
      damage cell mitochondria, possibly causing side effects such as fatigue. This study will&#xD;
      explore the relationship between changes in mitochondria and related genes and patient&#xD;
      reports of energy level, mood and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Healthy volunteers must test negative for the HIV antibody. HIV-positive&#xD;
      patients must have been diagnosed positive for at least 1 year. Patients who are taking&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy must have been taking the same drug regimen (with at least two NTRIs&#xD;
      and no protease inhibitors) for at least 3 months. HIV positive patients not taking&#xD;
      antiretroviral medication must not have had antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, brief physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, and questionnaires related to mood and energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified volunteers will undergo the following procedures during three or four study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete history and physical examination, blood tests, and questionnaires about energy&#xD;
      level, mood, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle and fat biopsy: Before the biopsy, blood is drawn to check blood counts and to test&#xD;
      for pregnancy in women who can become pregnant. The biopsy is done on an outpatient basis in&#xD;
      the operating room. The site of the biopsy (an area on the upper arm or upper leg) is numbed&#xD;
      with an injection under the skin. A 1-inch incision is made over the muscle to be biopsied&#xD;
      and a small sample of muscle tissue and small sample of fat are removed. The incision is then&#xD;
      closed and bandaged. Following the biopsy, you will be monitored for about 4 hours in the&#xD;
      clinic. Strenuous physical activity should be restricted in the week following biopsy to&#xD;
      allow healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination of biopsy site and possible apheresis: The biopsy site is examined for healing.&#xD;
      Apheresis may be scheduled for this visit or for an extra visit between the biopsy and the&#xD;
      final visit. This procedure for obtaining white blood cells for study is optional. For&#xD;
      apheresis, blood is withdrawn from a needle placed in a vein in the arm and the white cells&#xD;
      are separated from the rest of the blood. The white cells are extracted and the red cells and&#xD;
      plasma are then returned to the body through a second needle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Both HIV infection and antiretroviral nucleoside analogues (nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors or NRTIs) are known to affect mitochondrial DNA content and mitochondrial&#xD;
      function. A number of important clinical syndromes observed in HIV-infected persons relate to&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction including lactic acidosis, myopathy, cardiomyopathy, pancreatitis,&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy, and possibly lipodystrophy. Fatigue, one of the most prevalent&#xD;
      complaints among persons with HIV infection, may also be the result of mitochondrial&#xD;
      toxicity, though this has not been clearly established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability of minimally invasive tests to assess mitochondrial toxicity would greatly&#xD;
      facilitate understanding of the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to clinical&#xD;
      syndromes. Mitochondrial dysfunction ultimately results in lactic acidosis; however, venous&#xD;
      lactate measurements are neither adequately sensitive nor specific for identification of&#xD;
      early mitochondrial dysfunction. Muscle and liver biopsies are currently considered to be the&#xD;
      reference standards for the evaluation and diagnosis of mitochondrial toxicity in muscle and&#xD;
      liver, but these invasive tests are impractical for routine and repeated evaluations. The&#xD;
      recent development of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to accurately&#xD;
      quantify the mtDNA copy numbers per cell in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may&#xD;
      allow non-invasive assessment of mitochondrial toxicity. This technique has been applied in a&#xD;
      limited fashion to muscle, adipose tissue and liver samples as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study seeks to examine the relationship between fatigue and other clinical&#xD;
      parameters and markers of mitochondrial dysfunction. The goals of this study are threefold:&#xD;
      1) to investigate the relationship between subjective fatigue ratings and mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction through measurements of mtDNA depletion in skeletal muscle 2) to determine&#xD;
      whether there is a relationship between evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle and&#xD;
      evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in lymphocytes or adipose tissue suggesting that&#xD;
      examination of lymphocytes or adipose tissue may be adequate for the accurate diagnosis of&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction and 3) to identify genes and proteins as potential biomarkers for&#xD;
      fatigue and mitochondrial toxicity. For this cross-sectional study, three groups of&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled: HIV positive patients on NRTI-containing and&#xD;
      protease-inhibitor sparing regimens (n=30), HIV patients currently taking no antiretroviral&#xD;
      medications (n=30) and healthy controls (n=15). HIV patients on NRTIs will be stratified&#xD;
      according to their fatigue level (0-3, 4-7 or 8-10). Participants will complete a battery of&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding fatigue and undergo muscle and adipose tissue biopsy.&#xD;
