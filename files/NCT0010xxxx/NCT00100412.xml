      This research project is a follow-up to the prior VA-funded study that found that chronic&#xD;
      fatigue reported by many Gulf War veterans may be a symptom of dysfunctional cardiovascular&#xD;
      stress response regulation. Specifically, ill veterans had diminished autonomic responses&#xD;
      during demanding psychosocial tasks involving high level cognitive processing and emotional&#xD;
      stress. There was a close relationship between clinical status of ill veterans and their&#xD;
      inability to mount an appropriate physiological response under stress. The main objective of&#xD;
      the present investigation is to determine the specific mechanism through which this&#xD;
      abnormality may contribute to Gulf War-related chronic fatigue. We also observed that Gulf&#xD;
      veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had the most dampened autonomic activation&#xD;
      to stressors involving higher brain activities. The second major focus of this study is to&#xD;
      explore the role of a psychiatric disorder, specifically PTSD, as a factor in abnormalities&#xD;
      in stress response regulation. This aspect of the study may also provide pertinent&#xD;
      information as to the role of stress of military deployment as a contributing factor in&#xD;
      post-Gulf War illnesses.&#xD;

      Objective: Our previous VA-funded study found that chronic fatigue reported by some Gulf War&#xD;
      veterans may be a symptom of dysfunctional cardiovascular stress response regulation.&#xD;
      Specifically, ill veterans had diminished autonomic responses during tasks involving higher&#xD;
      brain activities, including cognitive processing and psychosocial stress. Gulf veterans with&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had the most dampened autonomic activation to stressors&#xD;
      involving higher brain activities. There was a close relationship between the clinical status&#xD;
      of ill veterans and their inability to mount an appropriate physiological response under&#xD;
      stress. The main objective of the present investigation is to determine the specific&#xD;
      mechanism through which this abnormality may contribute to Gulf War-related chronic fatigue.&#xD;
      The second major focus of this study is to explore the role of stress of military deployment&#xD;
      as a contributing factor in post-Gulf War illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: The research plan is to establish the mechanisms of blood pressure&#xD;
      hyporeactivity in Gulf War veterans with chronic fatigue and PTSD. Two possibilities are&#xD;
      being examined: one, that abnormal cardiovascular responses to stressors involve reduced&#xD;
      responsiveness of the major cardiovascular effector systems, the peripheral arterial&#xD;
      vasculature and the heart, to sympathetic stimulation; and two, that the locus of abnormality&#xD;
      is in the brain, resulting in inadequate activation of the sympathetic nervous system during&#xD;
      stressful behavioral activities. The role of wartime stress will be examined by specifically&#xD;
      focusing on abnormalities in stress response regulation associated with Gulf War-related&#xD;
      PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is being performed on four groups of Gulf War veterans, including those&#xD;
      with symptoms that fulfill the 1994 CDC case definition for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),&#xD;
      those with PTSD, those who have both CFS and PTSD, and healthy control veterans. A total of&#xD;
      90 veterans will be studied. The study protocol uses standard laboratory procedures to&#xD;
      characterize abnormalities in regulation of cardiovascular function using selective&#xD;
      pharmacological and behavioral challenges. Performance of central mechanisms of sympathetic&#xD;
      activation during mental challenge is evaluated by measuring increases in plasma&#xD;
      catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, during social-evaluative speech stressor.&#xD;
      Collected plasma samples are analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography assays.&#xD;
      The hypotheses of target organ dysfunction are evaluated using graded intravenous infusions&#xD;
      of two drugs, phenylephrine and dobutamine, and by measuring the resultant cardiovascular&#xD;
      responses. Phenylephrine and dobutamine are synthetic catecholamines, analogues of endogenous&#xD;
      chemical messenger substances released by sympathetic nerve fibers and by adrenal medulla&#xD;
      during stress response activation. Phenylephrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist that&#xD;
      increases blood pressure by constricting peripheral blood vessels. Dobutamine is&#xD;
      beta-adrenergic agonist that stimulates myocardium to increase force of contraction and&#xD;
      cardiac output. Stimulus-response curves for vasoconstrictor and inotropic adrenergic&#xD;
      receptor mechanisms are constructed, from which measures of vasomotor and cardiac function,&#xD;
      and autonomic reflex mechanisms are derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance: Our research has suggested that there is a biomedical marker in Gulf&#xD;
      veterans with illnesses characterized by severe unexplained chronic fatigue -- a diminished&#xD;
      cardiovascular reactivity to cognitive stressors. Although this problem was served in all&#xD;
      veterans with fatiguing illness, it was worst in the subset of those veterans who also had&#xD;
      PTSD. Our data also suggested that the markedly diminished cardiovascular response to stress&#xD;
      exhibited by this group may contribute to their functional impairment. The present&#xD;
      investigation will determine (1) whether this impairment is due to PTSD, to the medical&#xD;
      disorder of unexplained severe fatigue, or to an interaction between the two diagnoses, and&#xD;
      (2) where in the system of blood pressure regulation lies the cause of abnormal stress&#xD;
      responses. This work, therefore, may lead to better understanding of the causes of Gulf War&#xD;
      Illnesses as well as ways to treat them.&#xD;
