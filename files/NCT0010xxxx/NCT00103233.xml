      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Trastuzumab may also help vinorelbine work&#xD;
      better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving vinorelbine together with&#xD;
      trastuzumab may be an effective treatment for breast cancer. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      giving vinorelbine together with trastuzumab is more effective than vinorelbine alone in&#xD;
      treating breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vinorelbine and trastuzumab to see how&#xD;
      well they work compared to vinorelbine alone in treating women with progressive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare progression-free survival (PFS) of women with HER2-positive progressive&#xD;
           metastatic breast cancer treated with vinorelbine with or without trastuzumab&#xD;
           (Herceptin®).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare overall survival and time to treatment failure in patients treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the response rate (complete and partial, confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients&#xD;
           with measurable disease treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate baseline circulating tumor cells (CTC) with PFS, overall survival, and disease&#xD;
           progression status at 9 weeks in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate 4-week CTC with subsequent PFS and overall survival of patients treated with&#xD;
           these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 90 minutes and vinorelbine IV&#xD;
           over 10 minutes on day 1 of course 1. Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
           and vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in all subsequent courses.&#xD;
           If trastuzumab is discontinued due to toxicity, patients may continue to receive&#xD;
           vinorelbine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease&#xD;
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 292 patients (146 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 3 years.&#xD;
