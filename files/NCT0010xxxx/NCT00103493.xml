  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether an oral health education program that is&#xD;
      tailored to caregivers' understanding and acceptance of information on how to prevent tooth&#xD;
      decay will lead to improvement in behaviors conducive to good oral health and reduction in&#xD;
      tooth decay in his or her children.&#xD;

      The Detroit Dental Health Project (DDHP) is a seven-year research study designed to identify&#xD;
      the determinants of variation in prevalence and incidence of dental caries among low-income&#xD;
      African-American children in Detroit. The children were randomly selected from housing units&#xD;
      located in the lowest income areas (less than 250% of the poverty line). After over a year of&#xD;
      preparation and testing, the DDHP listed over 18,000 housing and non-housing units in 118&#xD;
      randomly selected low-income neighborhoods in Detroit. A total of 12,000 housing units were&#xD;
      randomly sampled and contacted over a period of one year (September 2001 - August 2002) in&#xD;
      order to recruit a representative sample of African American children. Field interviewers&#xD;
      contacted the selected housing units. The recruitment process located and scheduled around&#xD;
      1,400 families to visit the Dental Assessment Center (DAC). Of those, 1,021 visited the DAC&#xD;
      and completed examinations and interviews (Phase I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective of this project is to develop an effective multi-component&#xD;
      tailored/targeted behavioral intervention to promote and maintain good oral health and&#xD;
      prevent oral diseases among low-income children. To achieve this, a multimedia-based&#xD;
      multi-level intervention has been designed to be easy to use and easy to disseminate for&#xD;
      large-scale use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the Multi-Component Tailored/Targeted Intervention that will be delivered&#xD;
      using motivational interviewing and a targeted educational video designed and produced for&#xD;
      the specific population in comparison with the non-tailored health education (targeted&#xD;
      educational video only - control group) will be tested in a randomized controlled trial. In&#xD;
      Phase II of the Detroit Dental Health Project, the 1,021 low-income African Americans&#xD;
      recruited will be randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups. A dental&#xD;
      examination will provide the baseline measurement and changes in the outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed in the follow-up examination after two years. Participants in the control and&#xD;
      intervention groups will complete a questionnaire about their oral health and related&#xD;
      behaviors. Participants in the control group will receive standard oral hygiene and caries&#xD;
      risk counseling using only the educational video without any motivational interviewing&#xD;
      (equivalent to a counseling session conducted by a dentist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1,021 families have been randomized using a list of randomly generated numbers. The&#xD;
      allocation of the assignment is being concealed from the analysis team and the examining&#xD;
      dentist. After each session, the participants receive a &quot;recipe&quot; for oral health with a&#xD;
      picture of their child. The control group participants receive a standard plan; whereas the&#xD;
      caregivers in the intervention group receive the specific plan they have developed with the&#xD;
      motivational interviewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention/control session, the participants are being followed by telephone&#xD;
      contact to review the progress in oral health behaviors and answer questions. Follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered after 2-4 weeks, at 6 months, and 2 years after the&#xD;
      intervention/control session.&#xD;
