      This study will explore the range and type of medical and developmental problems in patients&#xD;
      with Muenke syndrome, a condition that results when one or more of the suture between the&#xD;
      bones of the skull close before birth. Because of the premature closure, the skull is not&#xD;
      able to grow in its natural shape; instead, it compensates with growth in areas of the skull&#xD;
      where the sutures have not yet closed. This can result in an abnormally shaped head, wide-set&#xD;
      eyes, and flattened cheekbones. Patients may also have an enlarged head, abnormalities of the&#xD;
      hands or feet, and hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which is involved in the development&#xD;
      and maintenance of bone tissue, plays a role in Muenke syndrome. In some cases, the FGFR3&#xD;
      mutation is inherited from a parent with Muenke syndrome; in other cases, where there is no&#xD;
      family history of the disorder, the mutation occurs anew. A better understanding of this gene&#xD;
      may lead researchers to develop better treatments and genetic counseling for people affected&#xD;
      by Muenke syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Muenke syndrome and their blood relatives may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Family members with confirmed Muenke syndrome will have genetic counseling, and patients&#xD;
      undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical records and test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about the patient's prenatal, birth, newborn, and past medical history;&#xD;
           family history; growth and development; medications; and current therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical, neurological, ear, nose and throat, dental, and eye examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing to assess cognitive thinking abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hearing evaluation. This includes an audiology test in which the patients listens to&#xD;
           soft tones through earphones; a power reflectance test in which a chirping sound is&#xD;
           heard through an earpiece placed at the entrance to the ear canal, and possibly an&#xD;
           ABR/ASSR test, in which electrodes are attached to the forehead, earlobes, and behind&#xD;
           the ears to measure brain waves in response to certain conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce&#xD;
           detailed pictures of the brain. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow&#xD;
           cylinder (the scanner), wearing ear plugs to muffle loud noises that occur with&#xD;
           electrical switching of the magnetic fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan of the middle and inner ear. This test is similar to the MRI, but uses a dye&#xD;
           injected in a vein to enhance the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of the skull. CT uses x-rays to produce 3-dimensional images of the part of the&#xD;
           body studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dental evaluation with x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skeletal survey (x-rays of all bones of the body).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developmental assessment of IQ testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for research purposes. A cell line may be established for use in future&#xD;
           research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical photographs to demonstrate clinical features, including side and front views of&#xD;
           the face, head, and other parts of the body that may be involved in Muenke syndrome,&#xD;
           like the hands and feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other consultations or tests as clinically indicated&#xD;

      Craniosynostosis is a common craniofacial abnormality caused by premature fusion of one or&#xD;
      several sutures of the skull. The prevalence of craniosynostosis is approximately 1 in 2,100&#xD;
      to 3,000 births. Originally described by our group, Muenke syndrome (OMIM # 602849) is a&#xD;
      specific form of craniosynostosis caused by a single nucleotide transversion in fibroblast&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), c.749C&gt;G, resulting in p.Pro250Arg. Individuals carrying&#xD;
      the defining mutation variably manifest coronal suture craniosynostosis, developmental delay,&#xD;
      deafness, and carpal and tarsal bone fusion. The purpose of the present study is to increase&#xD;
      our understanding of the clinical manifestations of Muenke syndrome through detailed&#xD;
      physical, developmental, neurologic, dental, ophthalmologic, otolaryngologic, audiologic,&#xD;
      radiologic, and genetic/genomic studies. We also plan to examine the spectrum of clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of Muenke syndrome to facilitate early diagnosis and clinical management,&#xD;
      including genetic counseling. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll approximately 10-20&#xD;
      probands, as well as their family members each year, with an enrollment ceiling of 200&#xD;
      probands. Our study has three arms. The clinical arm is the major focus of our study.&#xD;
      Patients and their families will be seen at the NIH Clinical Center and Children's National&#xD;
      Medical Center. Individuals with Muenke syndrome who are unable or unwilling to come to the&#xD;
      NIH, can submit their medical records, including a copy of the molecular testing, for review.&#xD;
      The second arm is genetic/genomic studies with the goal of investigating modifying factors&#xD;
      that relate to disease severity and expression. The third arm consists of a cognitive&#xD;
      function, development and hearing questionnaire to be completed by patients online, via phone&#xD;
      or mail.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have had confirmation of a Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 by a CLIA-certified&#xD;
        laboratory. Our research team must receive a photocopy of the positive test result in order&#xD;
        to enroll a patient in the study. All races and genders are known to be at risk for Muenke&#xD;
        syndrome. Nationality or place of origin is not a specific barrier to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family members (typically parents or siblings) of probands with Muenke syndrome are also&#xD;
        eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since the penetrance of Muenke syndrome is incomplete, any at risk individual will be&#xD;
             given the option of enrolling in the research study for FGFR3 testing. Those&#xD;
             individuals who are found to carry the p.Pro250Arg mutation may benefit from&#xD;
             interventions like hearing screening or speech evaluations that would alter their&#xD;
             medical management. Variable expressivity is another characteristic of Muenke syndrome&#xD;
             and carrier status and adequate genetic counseling are important. Individuals with the&#xD;
             mutation will be invited to participate in the clinical and/or medical record review&#xD;
             arms of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unaffected family members of a proband enrolled in the clinical protocol may choose to&#xD;
             provide a blood sample and/or participate in the behavioral arm of the study. These&#xD;
             information will be used only for purposes of further research on Muenke syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient of interest cases. Geneticists and genetic counselors may refer individuals who are&#xD;
        suspected to have Muenke syndrome, but who have not yet been tested for the FGFR3 Pro250Arg&#xD;
        mutation. The purpose of enrolling these subjects is to evaluate a wider spectrum of&#xD;
        patients for the mutation causing Muenke syndrome. Testing for the Pro250Arg mutation maybe&#xD;
        performed at the discretion of our research group. Those individuals who are found to carry&#xD;
        the Pro250 Arg mutation may be invited to participate in the study. Individuals who do not&#xD;
        carry the mutation but that have an affected first degree family member will be invited to&#xD;
        participate in the&#xD;
&#xD;
        genomic and/or survey arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf&#xD;
             of their children as minors) or assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We reserve the right to exclude individuals for whom the medical risks of travel and&#xD;
             evaluation at NIH appear to outweigh the benefits of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Description and justification of inclusion/exclusion of participants. (age, gender,&#xD;
        ethnicity, prisoners, pregnant women, fetuses, decisionally-impaired, healthy volunteers,&#xD;
        lab personnel)&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is our intention to remove as many economic, cultural, geographic, racial, and gender&#xD;
        barriers as we reasonably can to promote participation of individuals with Muenke syndrome&#xD;
        and their families for research purposes. The study will include pediatric and&#xD;
        decisionally-impaired individuals, because these characteristics are possible with Muenke&#xD;
        syndrome. Pregnant or nursing women may be limited in their participation in some aspects&#xD;
        of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As described above, Muenke syndrome has been demonstrated to occur in persons of different&#xD;
        ethnic backgrounds. We would make every reasonable effort to encourage the enrollment and&#xD;
        participation of a wide spectrum of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Pregnant women will not be excluded.&#xD;
