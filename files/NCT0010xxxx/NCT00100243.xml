  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label study in subjects with androgen-independent prostate cancer who&#xD;
      have progressed following treatment with an LHRH agonist. Up to 22 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Enrollment will be monitored to ensure that not all subjects are enrolled based on rising&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) criterion only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated with abarelix (Plenaxis) 100 mg intramuscularly (IM) every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for 12 weeks (total dose of 600 mg).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer that has progressed within&#xD;
             60 days of the start of screening despite castrate levels of testosterone from&#xD;
             treatment with an LHRH agonist. Progression will be defined as one or more of the&#xD;
             following: *A rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA over a&#xD;
             reference value (PSA #1). The first rising PSA (PSA #2) must be taken at least one&#xD;
             week after PSA #1. A third PSA (PSA #3) is required to be greater than PSA #2; if not,&#xD;
             a fourth PSA (PSA #4) is required to be greater than PSA #2, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The appearance of new metastatic lesions on a bone scan, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of known lesions or the appearance of new metastatic lesions on CT,&#xD;
                  MRI, chest x-ray, or other radiographic evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject whose hormonal therapy includes an anti-androgen must have the anti-androgen&#xD;
             discontinued prior to the start of screening (at least 6 weeks for bicalutamide and at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks otherwise). If there is a reduction in the PSA after anti-androgen&#xD;
             withdrawal, the subject must continue to demonstrate progression as defined above&#xD;
             after anti- androgen withdrawal to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status ≤ 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy ≥ 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum testosterone less than or equal to 50 ng/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL (if progression is determined from a rise in PSA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WBC greater than or equal to 3,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematocrit ≥ 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin (direct or total) less than or equal to 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) less than or equal to 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject is ineligible to participate in the study if he meets any of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment for prostate cancer with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiopharmaceutical such as strontium or samarium&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diethylstilbesterol or another estrogen agonist or antagonist&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ketoconazole&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Currently taking PC SPES&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to a LHRH agonist or GnRH antagonist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical illnesses, including malnutrition, that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator would preclude protocol treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiovascular illness defined as NYHA class III or IV congestive heart&#xD;
             failure or unstable angina within 6 months, myocardial infarction within 12 months,&#xD;
             deep venous thrombosis within 2 years, or any history of acute pulmonary embolism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or superficial bladder&#xD;
             cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any uncontrolled infection, including HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other experimental therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc &gt; 450 msec on a screening ECG obtained by the investigator&#xD;
