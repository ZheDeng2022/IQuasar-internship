      This trial will test the safety and efficacy of a rTMS device for the treatment of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD). It is hypothesized that rTMS will have an antidepressant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a 10-week, randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter trial in outpatients recruited in&#xD;
      both academic and private research centers. It is comprised of three major phases: pre-study&#xD;
      screening, acute treatment, and post-treatment taper. Eligible patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two rTMS treatment groups. One group will receive active rTMS treatment and one will&#xD;
      receive an inactive, or sham, treatment. Each treatment takes about 45 minutes and is done on&#xD;
      an outpatient basis. All trial related medical care is provided at no cost to the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;

      This trial will test the safety and efficacy of a rTMS device for the treatment of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depression is one of the most prevalent and profoundly debilitating diseases worldwide.&#xD;
      In a recent report, it is estimated that by the year 2020, depression will be second only to&#xD;
      heart disease in magnitude of disease burden as determined by disability-adjusted life years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite major advances in the treatment of depression in the last three decades, further&#xD;
      improvements are needed. For instance, with respect to antidepressant pharmacotherapy, only&#xD;
      1/3 of patients are estimated to have a nearly full resolution of their clinical symptoms&#xD;
      with their first medication trial. Indeed, partial remission or lack of response to treatment&#xD;
      is experienced by the majority of patients. Even with serial trials of antidepressant&#xD;
      medication, at least 10 to 15% of patients with major depression are estimated to experience&#xD;
      limited benefit and remain chronically depressed with significant psychosocial morbidity.&#xD;
      Some patients cannot tolerate the dosage and duration of antidepressant treatments required&#xD;
      for treatment trials to be considered adequate. In such patients, intolerance of somatic&#xD;
      treatments for major depression leads to chronicity and impaired function, and likely hinders&#xD;
      long-term compliance with treatments. For many patients with treatment resistant depression&#xD;
      (TRD), more complex regimens of polypharmacotherapy, or the use of electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
      (ECT) are the only currently available treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising alternative to treatments&#xD;
      such as ECT or pharmacotherapy for patients presenting with MDD. An rTMS procedure is&#xD;
      non-invasive, does not require anesthesia, and may be delivered in an appropriately staffed&#xD;
      outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By creating a time-varying magnetic field that is unimpeded by the scalp and skull, TMS can&#xD;
      focally and painlessly stimulate the cortex of awake individuals. Through the principle of&#xD;
      magnetic induction, the localized pulsed magnetic field generated in the coil at the surface&#xD;
      of the head induces an electrical current that depolarizes underlying superficial neurons. It&#xD;
      is widely thought that rTMS produces its behavioral effects solely through the induction of&#xD;
      current flow in cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors have driven the investigation of rTMS for the treatment of MDD. Early reports&#xD;
      of changes in mood in normal participants, the non-invasive nature of rTMS, the favorable&#xD;
      side effect profile compared to ECT, and the non-response of a number of MDD patients to&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and/or ECT, all have likely played a role. Since the initial studies, there&#xD;
      has continued to be high interest in rTMS as an antidepressant treatment. Multiple trials&#xD;
      have been conducted from researchers in diverse environments around the world. However, until&#xD;
      now, there have been no rigorously conducted large, multicenter rTMS clinical trials in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with MDD. Because the published research has largely been conducted in&#xD;
      single centers, the sample sizes in these antidepressant trials have been small. However, the&#xD;
      majority of more than 20 reports have found modest to large antidepressant effects that&#xD;
      increase over the trial period. By design, this trial will provide more robust information&#xD;
      regarding the antidepressant effect of rTMS in the adult population of MDD patients.&#xD;
