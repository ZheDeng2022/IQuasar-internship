  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether supplementation with phosphatidylcholine&#xD;
      lowers plasma homocysteine concentrations in healthy men.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high homocysteine concentration is a potential risk for cardiovascular disease. Plasma&#xD;
      homocysteine concentrations can be lowered through betaine supplementation. However, effects&#xD;
      of choline supplementation, the precursor for betaine, on plasma homocysteine concentrations&#xD;
      in healthy humans are unknown. If supplementation with choline or phosphatidylcholine, the&#xD;
      form in which choline occurs in foods, lowers homocysteine concentrations, then extra intake&#xD;
      of these compounds may lower cardiovascular disease risk in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: We compared the effects of supplementation with phosphatidylcholine to the&#xD;
      effects of a placebo on fasting and post-methionine concentrations of plasma homocysteine in&#xD;
      healthy men.&#xD;
