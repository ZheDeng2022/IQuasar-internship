      Insomnia reduces quality of life, increases risks for other illnesses, and enhances health&#xD;
      care costs/utilization. Several efficacy studies have shown that Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) for insomnia improves sleep and diurnal complaints among highly screened samples;&#xD;
      however, its effectiveness among �real-world� primary care patients is yet to be tested. This&#xD;
      project is highly relevant to the VA health care mission, given the high prevalence of&#xD;
      insomnia in middle-aged and older adults. Pilot data from this VA suggest that 40% of primary&#xD;
      care patients report trouble sleeping.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia reduces quality of life, increases risks for other illnesses, and enhances health&#xD;
      care costs/utilization. Several efficacy studies have shown that Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) for insomnia improves sleep and diurnal complaints among highly screened samples;&#xD;
      however, its effectiveness among �real-world� primary care patients is yet to be tested. This&#xD;
      project is highly relevant to the VA health care mission, given the high prevalence of&#xD;
      insomnia in middle-aged and older adults. Pilot data from this VA suggest that 40% of primary&#xD;
      care patients report trouble sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project tests the incremental benefits of adding CBT to usual primary care for reducing&#xD;
      sleep disturbance, diurnal dysfunction, quality of life concerns and health care utilization&#xD;
      among veterans enrolled in the DVAMC Primary Care Clinics. Study hypotheses predict that&#xD;
      patients who receive CBT along with usual care will show greater improvements in sleep, mood,&#xD;
      and quality of life, as well as larger reductions in health care utilization than will those&#xD;
      who receive usual care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-blind, randomized, parallel group, clinical effectiveness study of 106&#xD;
      veteran insomnia sufferers. Eligibility criteria include: meeting structured interview&#xD;
      criteria for insomnia, mean subjective total wake time of &gt; 60 minutes per night, mental&#xD;
      status score &gt; 27 on Folstein MMSE, no unstable medical or psychiatric disorder, no&#xD;
      polysomnographic evidence of sleep apnea or periodic limb movements, and approval of primary&#xD;
      provider. Participants are randomly assigned to CBT + Usual Care or to Usual Care Control&#xD;
      condition which provides therapist contact but no active behavioral treatment. Measures of&#xD;
      sleep, mood, and quality of life are obtained before and after treatment and at a 6-month&#xD;
      follow up. Computerized utilization data is obtained for the six months preceding and&#xD;
      following treatment. A series of multivariate and univariate statistical tests will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major activities over the past year involved ongoing recruiting and enrolling participants.&#xD;
      The study closed to enrollment on 7/19/05. Of 357 patients who completed screening&#xD;
      procedures, 81 were eligible and enrolled in the project. Of these, five are in the&#xD;
      pre-treatment phase, one is in the treatment phase, and 12 are in the post-treatment phase.&#xD;
      Fifty-one patients have completed all study procedures. Eleven patients dropped out prior to&#xD;
      completing the study, and one patient withdrew consent. A 1-year no cost extension was&#xD;
      requested on 7/26/05 because of unavoidable delays in subject recruitment and enrollment, and&#xD;
      we are awaiting a response.&#xD;
