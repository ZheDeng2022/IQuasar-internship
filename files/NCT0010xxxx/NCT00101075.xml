    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out how effective oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      capecitabine are against advanced cancer of the salivary gland. The safety of this treatment&#xD;
      as well as how long the cancer responds or stays in a stable state due to the treatment will&#xD;
      also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of two investigational agents called oxaliplatin and capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational agents have not received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the&#xD;
      way they are being used in this study. This means an investigation drug is still under study&#xD;
      to determine what a safe dose is, what the side effects are and whether or not it is&#xD;
      effective in the disease or condition being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin and capecitabine are chemotherapy agents that have been approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      use in other cancers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic diagnosis of any of the following malignancies originating from salivary&#xD;
             tissue: adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma,&#xD;
             malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated&#xD;
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be incurable on the basis of unresectable local or distant disease as&#xD;
             determined by the patient's surgeon and not be potentially curable by radiation&#xD;
             therapy as determined by a radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received radiation to any site with the following caveat: the sites&#xD;
             used for evaluation for response are either not previously irradiated or they have&#xD;
             shown progression of disease post radiation and there has been a time interval of one&#xD;
             month since these sites were radiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of less than 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least uni-dimensionally measurable disease documented within one&#xD;
             month of initiation of treatment. Measurement may be by physical exam or&#xD;
             radiologically. Attempts should be made to photo document all tumor sites assessed by&#xD;
             physical examination with a metric ruler within the photo for measurement&#xD;
             confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to go through the process of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;

             hormonal,homeopathic, natural, or alternative medicine) of anti-neoplastic therapy&#xD;
