  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to identify a dose of Liposome Entrapped c-raf Antisense&#xD;
      Oligonucleotide Easy-to-Use (LErafAON-ETU) which maximizes potential benefits of the compound&#xD;
      to patients with advanced cancer, without compromising their safety. This study will also&#xD;
      assess the processing of LErafAON-ETU by the body over time. Patients will receive an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of LErafAON-ETU each week. Multiple blood samples will be taken for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic analysis during the first treatment; two samples will be taken during both&#xD;
      the second and third treatments. Patients will be eligible to continue treatment until the&#xD;
      occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In LErafAON-ETU, antisense oligonucleotides specific to c-raf, are associated with liposomes,&#xD;
      which are microscopic membrane-like structures created from lipids (fats). Raf-1 is a protein&#xD;
      which plays a critical role in many aspects of cellular activation and growth. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is thought to be an important factor that may support tumor development. LErafAON-ETU&#xD;
      potentially limits the ability of a cell to produce the Raf-1 protein.&#xD;

      This Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study is designed to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose of LErafAON-ETU in patients who have advanced cancer considered unresponsive&#xD;
      to available, conventional modalities or treatments. LErafAON-ETU will be administered as an&#xD;
      IV infusion once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (a Treatment Cycle). A complete&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of raf-1 antisense oligonucleotide will be assessed in week 1 only;&#xD;
      limited pharmacokinetic sampling will be done prior to and at the end of infusion in weeks 2&#xD;
      and 3 only. Tumor/disease evaluation will be performed upon completion of 6 infusions (2&#xD;
      Cycles). Dose escalation will not occur until the safety and tolerability at a given dose&#xD;
      level has been confirmed for 1 Cycle.&#xD;

          -  Be ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have advanced (local and/or metastatic) histologically documented cancer not&#xD;
             considered responsive to available conventional modalities or treatment (i.e., no life&#xD;
             prolonging therapy or therapy with a greater potential for patient benefit is&#xD;
             available).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an ECOG Performance status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a life expectancy of &gt;12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have recovered from acute toxicities of prior treatment: *No treatment with&#xD;
             radiotherapy or with cytotoxic or biologic agents within 3 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
             At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since any prior surgery or granulocyte-stimulating&#xD;
             growth factor therapy. Chronic treatment with non-investigational&#xD;
             gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or other hormonal or supportive care is&#xD;
