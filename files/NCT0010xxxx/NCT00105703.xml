      Despite established clinical practice guidelines, wide variations exist in the care of&#xD;
      chronic heart failure (CHF) patients in Veterans Health Administration. Previous randomized,&#xD;
      controlled studies have suggested that a nurse case management model may improve the outcomes&#xD;
      of care for patients with CHF. However, these studies involved selected groups of patients&#xD;
      (i.e., those who agreed to participate in randomized trials) in selected settings (i.e.,&#xD;
      tertiary care facilities); so, the findings are not likely to be indicative of the true&#xD;

      BACKGROUND / RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite established clinical practice guidelines, wide variations exist in the care of&#xD;
      chronic heart failure (CHF) patients in Veterans Health Administration. Previous randomized,&#xD;
      controlled studies have suggested that a nurse case management model may improve the outcomes&#xD;
      of care for patients with CHF. However, these studies involved selected groups of patients&#xD;
      (i.e., those who agreed to participate in randomized trials) in selected settings (i.e.,&#xD;
      tertiary care facilities); so, the findings are not likely to be indicative of the true&#xD;
      effectiveness of case management in a large population of CHF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE(S):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the impact of a nurse practitioner case management model compared&#xD;
      with usual care in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Outcomes include&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, compliance with medication guidelines,&#xD;
      mortality, readmissions, bed days of care, outpatient visits, emergency room visits, and&#xD;
      pharmacy costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CHF will be identified by review of admission/discharge logs, review of clinic&#xD;
      schedules, and referrals from medical personnel. All patients in the northern half of VISN 11&#xD;
      (Ann Arbor, Detroit, Saginaw, and Battle Creek) will participate in a case management&#xD;
      program, in which they will receive care from nurse practitioners who will be supported by&#xD;
      practice guidelines, treatment algorithms, and guidance from cardiologists at the VA Ann&#xD;
      Arbor Health Care System. Patients in the southern half of the VISN (Indianapolis and&#xD;
      Danville) will make up the comparison group and will receive usual care for CHF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will complete baseline and one and two year follow-up questionnaires&#xD;
      on health related quality of life, including the SF-36V and the Minnesota Living With Heart&#xD;
      Failure Questionnaire. Patient satisfaction will be assessed using the VA National Ambulatory&#xD;
      Care Survey. Additional data on the use of health care resources over the two years following&#xD;
      each patientï¿½s index hospitalization will be collected from the Patient Treatment File (PTF)&#xD;
      and the Outpatient Census (OPC) File. Data on compliance with medication guidelines will be&#xD;
      obtained from the VISN 11 pharmacy database. Multivariate analyses will be used, with the&#xD;
      main study outcomes as dependent variables and intervention vs. comparison group membership&#xD;
      as independent variables, controlling for baseline differences between intervention and&#xD;
      comparison groups. Additional analyses will compare the study outcomes for patients served by&#xD;
      primary versus tertiary sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participating providers at the beginning,&#xD;
      middle, and end of the study, to determine satisfaction with the program, as well as specific&#xD;
      components that were perceived to help or hinder its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATUS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All two-year follow-up questionnaires have been received and entered. Medical record&#xD;
      abstraction, which includes data on severity of disease, will continue through Dec 2007. All&#xD;
      interviews with medical center staff have been conducted, transcribed, and coded. We are in&#xD;
      the process of pulling one-year prior and one and two-year post data on comorbidities and&#xD;
      resource utilization. Analysis of survey, medical record, interview, and secondary data will&#xD;
      continue through spring of 2008, when the final report will be written.&#xD;

             as defined by meeting (1) or (2) below:&#xD;
