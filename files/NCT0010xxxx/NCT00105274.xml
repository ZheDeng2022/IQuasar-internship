    <textblock>
      Velocardiofacial syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome, has been&#xD;
      associated with many features such as a cleft palate, heart defects, and learning, speech and&#xD;
      feeding problems. It is caused by the absence of a number of genes on chromosome 22, but the&#xD;
      mechanism by which this inborn abnormality causes the clinical problems is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study by the National Institute of Mental Health and the Office of Rare Diseases, we&#xD;
      are recruiting participants with 22q11.2 syndrome to come for a three-day stay to our main&#xD;
      campus in Bethesda, MD, to participate in a study in which we will investigate the genetic&#xD;
      makeup of their cells together with several studies of brain function with advanced research&#xD;
      imaging. The goal of this study is to understand how the genes missing in 22q11.2 syndrome&#xD;
      are related to the increased occurrence of psychiatric problems, such as psychosis, in this&#xD;
      syndrome. Participants must be 18-50 years of age, have some high school education and not&#xD;
      currently be taking antipsychotic medication. Travel costs to Bethesda for participants and&#xD;
      an accompanying person will be paid, and participants are reimbursed for their time in&#xD;
      participating in the study. A blood draw is required. All research procedures have been&#xD;
      designated as &quot;minimal risk&quot; procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      22q11.2 (DiGeorge MIM#188400, Velocardiofacial MIM#192430) syndrome is a hemizygous&#xD;
      microdeletion on 22q11.2 of typically 3Mb, encompassing approximately 30 genes and mediated&#xD;
      by aberrant homologous recombination and unequal crossing-over events between&#xD;
      intrachromosomal flanking low-copy repeats (LCRs). The incidence is 1:4000 live births. While&#xD;
      somatic symptoms include congenital cardiovascular and craniofacial abnormalities, recurrent&#xD;
      infections and hypocalcemia1 , the most prevalent group of symptoms are neuropsychiatric and&#xD;
      include cognitive dysfunction with mild mental retardation, behavioral difficulties and&#xD;
      psychosis. The syndrome is associated with a lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia-like&#xD;
      illness (phenotypically mostly similar to sporadic schizophrenia) of approximately 25 times&#xD;
      that of the general population making the presence of this hemideletion the strongest known&#xD;
      risk factor for the development of schizophrenia excepting the presence of a monozygotic twin&#xD;
      with the illness. The 22q11 region is implicated in the risk architecture of schizophrenia by&#xD;
      several linkage studies and harbors a number of proposed susceptibility genes including genes&#xD;
      for Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and ZDHHC8. The neural&#xD;
      basis of these pronounced neurocognitive and psychiatric abnormalities is unknown. The&#xD;
      present work proposes to (a) study a group of exceptionally high-functioning, normal&#xD;
      intelligence, psychosis-free individuals with 21q11.2 syndrome using a hierarchical&#xD;
      multimodal imaging approach to define the intermediate systems level phenotype of the disease&#xD;
      combined with deletion mapping techniques and (b) to study the functional effects of single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms in genes in the hemideleted region that have been implicated in&#xD;
      schizophrenia, taking advantage of the unique fact that the hemizygous deletion allows&#xD;
      immediate construction of molecular haplotypes and of potential epistatic allelic effects.&#xD;
      This work is expected to (a) elucidate the pathophysiology of the CNS manifestations of the&#xD;
      22q11.2 syndrome and yield a brain intermediate phenotype that will allow studies in small&#xD;
      and atypical deletion individuals in an effort to define individual genes responsible for&#xD;
      neurocognitive deficit and increased risk for psychosis, (b) facilitate the identification of&#xD;
      functional mechanisms underlying increased risk for schizophrenia for individual&#xD;
      susceptibility genes in the deletion and for interacting risk alleles within the deleted&#xD;
      locus and (c) prepare the ground for a clinical protocol in which the results from (a) and&#xD;
      (b) can be applied to a prospective study evaluating early diagnostic and interventional&#xD;
      approaches based on genetic risk and intermediate phenotype ascertainment in this group of&#xD;
      patients at high risk for the development of psychosis.&#xD;
