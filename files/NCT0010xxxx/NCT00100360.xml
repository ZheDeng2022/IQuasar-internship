      This study will explore possible hormonal causes of menstrual-related mood disorders (MRMD)&#xD;
      by stopping the menstrual cycle with a drug called Lupron and then giving in sequence two&#xD;
      menstrual cycle hormones, progesterone and estrogen. The study will first evaluate Lupron's&#xD;
      effectiveness in treating MRMD and will then examine the effects of giving estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone on mood and behavior. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET) and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to study serotonin receptors and transporters -&#xD;
      molecules in the brain that are thought to play a major role in mood changes related to the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menstruating women between 18 and 50 years of age who are in good health, not pregnant, and&#xD;
      not taking medications may be eligible for this study. Women with MRMD must have had at least&#xD;
      moderately severe MRMD or behavioral disturbances for at least 6 months within 2 years of&#xD;
      entering the study. Healthy controls must have no history of MRMD or behavioral disturbances.&#xD;
      Candidates undergo physical and neurological examinations, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      and blood and urine tests. Results of a recent Pap smear (no longer than 12 months before&#xD;
      beginning the study) must be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug treatment: Lupron is injected into a muscle once a month for 5 months. After the&#xD;
           second month, participants receive estrogen or progesterone, or both, daily. Estrogen is&#xD;
           delivered through a skin patch (20 micrograms per day) and the progesterone is taken as&#xD;
           a rectal or vaginal suppository twice a day for the remaining 12 weeks of the study.&#xD;
           Every day, all participants wear a skin patch and insert two suppositories, but at some&#xD;
           point during the 12 weeks, active medication is replaced with placebo to allow the drugs&#xD;
           to wash out of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and blood draw: A physical examination and blood tests are done at&#xD;
           the start of the study and several times during the study to assess general health,&#xD;
           evaluate liver and kidney function, and measure blood cell counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response to treatment drugs: Responses to Lupron, estrogen, and progesterone are&#xD;
           evaluated periodically with interviews and symptoms self-rating scales. Control subjects&#xD;
           also take paper and pencil psychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET imaging: A total of six PET scans are done at three time points during hormone&#xD;
           treatment. PET uses small amounts of a radioactive chemical called a tracer that&#xD;
           &quot;labels&quot; active areas of the brain. For the procedure, the subject lies on the scanner&#xD;
           bed. A special mask is fitted to the head and attached to the bed to help keep the&#xD;
           subject's head still during the scan so the images will be clear. A brief scan is done&#xD;
           just before the radioactive tracer is injected to help in analyzing the PET data. After&#xD;
           the tracer is injected through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in the arm, pictures are&#xD;
           taken for about 2 hours, during which the subject lies still on the scanner bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan: MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues&#xD;
           and organs. For this procedure, the patient lies on a table that is moved into the&#xD;
           scanner (a narrow cylinder) and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping&#xD;
           sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 1 hour.&#xD;

      The central serotonergic (5HT) system is one of the candidate systems that may mediate the&#xD;
      abnormal mood and behavioral response to ovarian steroids observed in women with&#xD;
      menstrual-related mood disorders (MRMD). Numerous studies have attempted to measure 5HT&#xD;
      system function in women with MRMD and controls; however, previous studies were restricted to&#xD;
      the evaluation of indirect measures of 5HT function (e.g., platelet 5HT uptake or responses&#xD;
      to serotonergic pharmacologic challenges). Radioligand imaging of specific components of the&#xD;
      5HT system currently represents the most direct measure of central serotonergic function&#xD;
      available. In this study we will image serotonergic measures during pharmacological&#xD;
      conditions previously demonstrated to induce a remission and a subsequent provocation of mood&#xD;
      symptoms in women with MRMD but not controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has two outcome measures (5HT(1A) binding and SERT binding), two groups of&#xD;
      subjects (women with MRMD and controls), and three distinct hormonal conditions&#xD;
      (hypogonadism, estrogen replacement, and progesterone replacement). Our principal aim in this&#xD;
      study is to investigate differences in the outcome measures in women with MRMD compared to&#xD;
      controls. Our primary hypothesis is that 5HT(1A) binding will be decreased and SERT binding&#xD;
      will be increased in women with MRMD. A secondary hypothesis is that women with MRMD, but not&#xD;
      controls, will display reproductive steroid modulation of 5HT(1A) and SERT binding. This&#xD;
      study will help test existing hypotheses about the pathophysiologic relevance of serotonin&#xD;
      function in MRMD and the role of reproductive steroids in serotonergic regulation. First, we&#xD;
      selected 5HT(1A) receptor binding as an outcome measure for the following reasons: 5HT(1A)&#xD;
      function is modulated by both estradiol and progesterone, abnormalities of 5HT(1A) binding&#xD;
      have been reported in both depressive and anxiety disorders as well as possibly MRMD, 5HT(1A)&#xD;
      receptors have been identified as potential mediators of estradiol's antidepressant-like&#xD;
      effects in the forced swim test, and the 5HT(1A) system is involved in the regulation of GABA&#xD;
      activity abnormalities of which have been implicated in MRMD. Second, we selected SERT&#xD;
      binding as an outcome measure for the following reasons: selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors, but not traditional antidepressants, are effective treatments for MRMD;&#xD;
      abnormalities of SERT binding have been reported in depressive disorders in women,&#xD;
      preliminary data suggest that women with MRMD are characterized by an elevated frequency of&#xD;
      the long, more transcriptionally active polymorphism of the serotonin transporter (5HTTLPR)&#xD;
      (Roca et al); women with MRMD have altered imipramine binding and platelet 5HT uptake&#xD;
      compared to controls as well as altered platelet paroxetine binding (which normalize with&#xD;
      successful treatment with GnRH agonist); and, finally, SERT message, binding and protein have&#xD;
      been reported to be changed by ovarian steroids in preclinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the effects of hormonal condition on 5HT(1A) (receptor) binding will&#xD;
      differ in patients and controls. Specifically, we anticipate that 5HT1A binding will be&#xD;
      decreased in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in patients with MRMD but not controls. Such a&#xD;
      decrease, if a trait characteristic, will be demonstrable irrespective of hormonal state.&#xD;
      However, as symptoms of MRMD are directly precipitated by estradiol or progesterone (see&#xD;
      below), it is possible that symptoms are accompanied by state and steroid-dependent changes&#xD;
      in 5HT(1A) binding and function. Consequently, our secondary hypothesis is that estradiol or&#xD;
      progesterone induces changes in 5HT(1A) (receptor) binding in women with MRMD but not in&#xD;
      control women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, we hypothesize that women with MRMD will have increased SERT binding activity&#xD;
      compared to controls, consistent with the therapeutic efficacy of selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors in this condition. However, a secondary hypothesis is that estradiol or&#xD;
      progesterone-induced changes in SERT binding will occur in a hormone-dependent and mood&#xD;
      state-dependent manner. Specifically, consistent with the literature in rodents, acute&#xD;
      changes in ovarian steroids will increase SERT binding in association with the induction of&#xD;
      symptoms in women with MRMD but not controls.&#xD;
