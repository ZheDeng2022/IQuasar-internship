      The purpose of this study is to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in racial and&#xD;
      ethnic minorities in Hawaii.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there has been great progress in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality in the U.S. over&#xD;
      the past 40 years, some minority groups have not benefitted from this progress, and continue&#xD;
      to have lower life expectancy and higher CVD morbidity. On average, minorities have more&#xD;
      limited access to medical care, receive less aggressive care, and receive fewer diagnostic&#xD;
      and therapeutic cardiac procedures than non-minority populations. Additionally, most minority&#xD;
      groups adhere poorly to prescribed medical regimens and often present to emergency&#xD;
      departments rather than primary care physicians for complications of advanced chronic CVD&#xD;
      conditions. Thus, research to reduce health disparities by improving CVD outcomes in&#xD;
      minorities offers potential for a substantial positive impact on public health. Academic&#xD;
      medical centers and institutions that are capable of carrying out such research, however,&#xD;
      often lack access to minority patients and have difficulty gaining the trust of those they&#xD;
      are able to treat. Minority communities often report greater satisfaction when receiving care&#xD;
      from minority providers and are reluctant to receive treatment outside their minority&#xD;
      healthcare serving systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, minorities have high rates of elevated cholesterol, hypertension, cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Other behavioral, environmental, and&#xD;
      occupational risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, such as sleep problems are also common&#xD;
      among minorties. These risk factors all contribute to excess CVD morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Heart failure (HF) is also a major public health problem. The impact of HF on minority&#xD;
      populations, such as Native Hawaiians and other Pacific peoples, is unknown. Native Hawaiians&#xD;
      are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF and one of the highest rates of CVD&#xD;
      mortality in the U.S. The causes of minority health disparities are complex and are not&#xD;
      understood completely. Although evidence of genetic, biologic, and environmental factors is&#xD;
      well documented, poor outcomes are also attributed to incomplete treatment. Such treatment&#xD;
      may be due to limited access to health care or, in some cases, break-down of the medical&#xD;
      system or failure of the physician and/or patient to allow for optimal health care, even when&#xD;
      access is not impaired. The complex interactions of behavior, socio-economic status (SES),&#xD;
      culture, and ethnicity are important predictors of health outcomes and sources of health&#xD;
      disparities. Despite efforts to elucidate genetic and environmental risk factors and to&#xD;
      promote cardiovascular health in high-risk populations, trends in CVD outcomes suggest that&#xD;
      CVD health disparities continue to widen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Partnerships Program to Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involves collaboration&#xD;
      between research-intensive medical centers (RIMCs) that have a track record of NIH-supported&#xD;
      research and patient care and minority healthcare serving systems (MSSs) that lack a strong&#xD;
      research program. Each Partnership Program will design and carry out multiple&#xD;
      interdisciplinary research projects that investigate complex biologic, behavioral, and&#xD;
      societal factors that contribute to CVD health disparities and facilitate clinical research&#xD;
      within the MSS. The aim will be to improve CVD outcomes and reduce health disparities.&#xD;
      Additionally, each program will provide reciprocal educational and skills development&#xD;
      programs to train investigators to conduct research that is aimed at reducing cardiovascular&#xD;
      disparities, thereby enhancing research opportunities and enriching cultural sensitivity and&#xD;
      cardiovascular research capabilities at both institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Request for Applications for Partnership Programs to Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities&#xD;
      was released in September, 2003. The awards were made in September, 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address heart failure disparities among native Hawaiians and Pacific peoples, a&#xD;
      partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen&#xD;
      Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of Native Hawaiian Health. Partners of the HFD Program&#xD;
      include tha following: MedStar Research Institute, Oahu-based Community Health Centers&#xD;
      (CHCs), and the Hawaii EXPORT Center, an NIH-funded initiative addressing diabetes-associated&#xD;
      disparities in native Hawaiians and Pacific peoples. The HFD Program will address the&#xD;
      following aims: determine the reliability and validity of echocardiograms performed by&#xD;
      community-based health workers compared to a professionally trained sonographer as the &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot;; determine if a culturally competent educational program for heart failure reduces&#xD;
      HF hospitalizations and mortality compared to usual care; characterize ethnic differences in&#xD;
      the HF syndrome in hospitalized native Hawaiians and Pacific peoples compared to Caucasians;&#xD;
      construct HF pedigrees using probands identified at the Queen Emma Clinic for a future HF&#xD;
      linkage study in native Hawaiians and Pacific peoples; educate community-based health workers&#xD;
      to perform echocardiography scans for the detection of HF in a high risk population of native&#xD;
      Hawaiians and Pacific peoples; and train new investigators to conduct research focused on CVD&#xD;
      disparities in general, and HF in particular. By achieving these aims, the HFD Program will&#xD;
      improve access to HF care at Community Health Centers that serve native Hawaiians and Pacific&#xD;
      peoples, fill a gap in knowledge of CVD disparities in native Hawaiians and Pacific peoples,&#xD;
      and provide a foundation for future studies on genetic determinants of HF.&#xD;
