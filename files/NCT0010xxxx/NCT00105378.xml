      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of nursing home visits in independently&#xD;
      living elderly people on their functional performance and health-related quality of life. The&#xD;
      general practitioner (GP) can refer elderly people to this intervention model after&#xD;
      identification of a problem in cognition, mood, behavior, mobility, or nutrition. A&#xD;
      specialist geriatric nurse visits the patients at home up to six times and coaches the&#xD;
      patient in cooperation with the GP and geriatrician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General practitioners (GPs) in the Western world have to anticipate the increasing age and&#xD;
      health care demands of their patients. A considerable proportion of those older patients have&#xD;
      reduced functional status and quality of life, which may affect their feelings of autonomy&#xD;
      and ability to live independently. Even with considerable disability, most patients prefer to&#xD;
      stay at home. Because of their complex clinical presentations and needs, these patients&#xD;
      require a special approach to their evaluation and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediate care is a possible answer to these changing demands, although the efficacy of&#xD;
      these programs is a subject of vivid debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the Dutch Geriatric Intermediate Care Programme (DGIP) we developed an Intermediate Care&#xD;
      model to study efficacy aspects of problem based intermediate care. DGIP is an intermediate&#xD;
      care program in which the GP refers elderly patients with a problem in cognition, mood,&#xD;
      behavior, mobility, and nutrition. A geriatric specialist nurse applies a guideline based&#xD;
      intervention in a maximum of six visits during a maximum of three months. The nurse starts&#xD;
      the intervention with the application of the EASYcare instrument for geriatric screening. The&#xD;
      EASYcare instrument assesses (instrumental) activities of daily life, cognition, mood, and&#xD;
      includes a goal setting item. During the intervention the nurse regularly consults the&#xD;
      referring GP and a geriatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of the Dutch EASYcare Study Geriatric Intermediate care&#xD;
           Programme compared to regular medical care in improving health related quality of life&#xD;
           in independently living elderly persons and their informal caregivers who contact the GP&#xD;
           with one of a variety of geriatric problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the costs of the Dutch EASYcare Study Geriatric Intermediate care&#xD;
           Programme.&#xD;
