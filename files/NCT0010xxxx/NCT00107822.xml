    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of one treatment of S-Caine™ Peel (skin&#xD;
      numbing cream) applied on healthy skin before a painful dermatologic procedure in children.&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate how well the S-Caine™ Peel eases the pain of the procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The practice of dermatology is seeing a rise in the number of surgical and laser procedures&#xD;
      as technological advances have expanded the number of conditions amenable to these evolving&#xD;
      therapies. Skin biopsies, shave excisions, deep excisions, electro-surgical procedures,&#xD;
      intralesional injections, and laser surgery are frequently performed by dermatologists on a&#xD;
      daily basis. Some pain accompanies almost all of these procedures, and a local anesthetic is&#xD;
      commonly used. Traditionally, intracutaneous injection of lidocaine (with or without&#xD;
      epinephrine) has been the anesthetic of choice. However, patients undergoing these procedures&#xD;
      are often afraid of needles and syringes and the pain associated with injections. As a&#xD;
      result, topical anesthetic agents have been explored and developed as painless alternatives&#xD;
      to injected anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-Caine™ Peel (lidocaine 7% and tetracaine 7% cream) consists of a new eutectic formulation&#xD;
      of lidocaine and tetracaine. S-Caine Peel is a topical local anesthetic cream that forms a&#xD;
      pliable peel on the skin when exposed to air. S-Caine Peel is not occluded during&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain associated with medical procedures is often under-treated in children. Children&#xD;
      often undergo painful procedures with little or no anesthetic, even when effective therapy is&#xD;
      available. Reasons for not providing available therapy in children include concerns over&#xD;
      adverse side effects, as well as the length of time necessary to provide adequate anesthesia.&#xD;
      Recent guidelines strongly advocate for the proactive treatment of pain in children,&#xD;
      including the pain associated with medical procedures.&#xD;
