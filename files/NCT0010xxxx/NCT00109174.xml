  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure in the brain the&#xD;
      transfer of [13]C as it is naturally metabolized from glucose to specific chemical&#xD;
      transmitters. From this method, we can measure the rate of production of an important&#xD;
      excitatory neurotransmitter (glutamate) as well as an inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA)....&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      13C is a stable (i.e., non-radioactive) isotope of carbon with a natural abundance of ~1%.&#xD;
      Following infusion of [13C]glucose and/or [13C]acetate, in vivo MRS (magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy) can monitor the rate of flux of the 13C atom from glucose and/or acetate to&#xD;
      glutamate to glutamine. Thus, this procedure can provide measure of glutamate (GLU) and&#xD;
      glutamine (GLN) turnover in brain. We have established parameters to obtain these&#xD;
      measurements in nonhuman primate brain. The current protocol seeks approval to optimize MRS&#xD;
      parameters and to develop new MRS techniques for human brain using the GE 3T, the Siemens 3T,&#xD;
      and the Siemens 7T device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All subjects will be aged 18 65 years, without serious medical illnesses&#xD;
      and meet criteria listed in Section VI A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Subjects will receive either oral administration of [13C]glucose or an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of [13C]glucose and/or [13C]acetate to approximately double their plasma glucose&#xD;
      levels. The plasma acetate level will remain within the physiological range observed in&#xD;
      humans (Lebon et al, 2002). While lying in the 3T or 7T device, serial data acquisitions will&#xD;
      be obtained over ~2 h to optimize the experimental conditions so as to measure the 13C&#xD;
      signals from GLU, GLN and other metabolisms in brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary goal of this study is to measure GLU/GLN turnover in brain.&#xD;
      With no additional data acquisition, we can also obtain information on the synthesis of GABA,&#xD;
      the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in brain. GLU is converted to GABA via the enzyme&#xD;
      glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). While monitoring the transfer of 13C signal from GLU to&#xD;
      GLN, we can simultaneously measure the transfer of 13C signal from GLU to GABA and thereby&#xD;
      measure the activity of GAD (Li et al 2005). In addition to directly measure 13C signals, 13C&#xD;
      labeling to brain metabolites can also be measured indirectly by detecting proton MRS during&#xD;
      infusion of [13C]glucose and/or [13C]acetate.&#xD;
