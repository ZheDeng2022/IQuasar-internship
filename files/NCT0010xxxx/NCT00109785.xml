      RATIONALE: Imaging procedures such as PET scans may improve the ability to monitor the&#xD;
      effectiveness of chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well PET scans work in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer who will undergo chemotherapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the biologic activity of locally advanced breast cancer as measured by&#xD;
           retention of iodine I 124 iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) on positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
           scans pre- and postchemotherapy is different between patients whose tumor shrinks after&#xD;
           treatment in comparison to patients whose tumor is stable or continues to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate that incorporation of IUdR into tumor is in the tumor DNA at 24-36 hours&#xD;
           post injection, as documented by tissue analysis and immunohistochemistry and that this&#xD;
           correlates with the subsequent change in tumor dimension and proliferative activity of&#xD;
           the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the pre and post treatment results of fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scanning and&#xD;
           IUdR PET scanning in the same breast lesions as a basis for assessment of the relative&#xD;
           metabolic change during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further assess the biologic activity of metastatic tumor sites and their changes in size&#xD;
           following chemotherapy to standard parameters that are used to evaluate change in tumor&#xD;
           size, obtained under clinical standard of care for breast cancer, which will include CT&#xD;
           scans as well as bone scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the accuracy of noninvasive measurement of PET measurement of the left&#xD;
           ventricular cardiac chamber clearance of radioactivity as a substitute for arterial&#xD;
           plasma sampling for determining metabolic rates of FDG and IUdR uptake into tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate metabolic changes in tumors as they are affected by specific chemotherapy in&#xD;
           comparison to changes in tumor dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: For this study, the chemotherapy administered for an individual patient is at the&#xD;
      discretion of the patient's primary attending physician. After chemotherapy, the patient is&#xD;
      evaluated for surgical resection of the tumor. If the tumor is unresectable, the patient may&#xD;
      be offered radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of positron emission tomography (PET) scans is performed within 2 weeks&#xD;
      before the first dose of chemotherapy. The second group of PET scans occur no more than 7&#xD;
      weeks after chemotherapy and prior to local therapy, either surgery or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET scan before initiation of chemotherapy consists of 4 imaging sessions. There is one&#xD;
      iodine I-124 iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) PET scan (3 imaging sessions) at 1, 4-8, and 24 hours&#xD;
      after IUdR infusion, followed by one fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scan (1 imaging session) 45&#xD;
      minutes after FDG infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
