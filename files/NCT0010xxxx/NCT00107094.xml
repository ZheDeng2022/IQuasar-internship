&#xD;
               -  T &gt;1 cm, N0, M0 and both ER and PR negative;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T1-2 and 1 sentinel node with micrometastasis &lt;2 mm with or without axillary&#xD;
                  dissection, M0;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  T1-2 and &gt;1 sentinel node micrometastasis or 1 node with a macrometastasis &gt;2 mm&#xD;
                  and/or T3 must have axillary dissection, M0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative surgical margins to lumpectomy or mastectomy specimen (no ink on invasive&#xD;
             cancer and no ink on DCIS [ductal carcinoma in situ]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate wound healing, as determined by the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It has not been longer than 84 days since the date of definitive surgery&#xD;
             (e.g.,mastectomy or, in the case of a breast-sparing procedure, axillary dissection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous invasive cancers if treated &gt;5 years prior to entering this study, except&#xD;
             basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, the&#xD;
             latter are not required to have occurred more than 5 years prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior invasive breast cancer if diagnosed &gt;5 years prior to entering study. Patients&#xD;
             must have finished adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to registration. Patients with&#xD;
             prior DCIS are eligible. Patients with DCIS who were treated with tamoxifen must have&#xD;
             finished tamoxifen prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values must be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White blood cell count: ≥3,000/mm3;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count: ≥1,500/mm3;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets: ≥100,000/mm3;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin: ≥8 g/dL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin: ≤ the institution's ULN (upper limit of normal);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine: ≤1.5 mg/dL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT and alkaline phosphatase may be up to 2.5 × institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All staging studies including physical exam, chest x-ray, and bone scan must show no&#xD;
             evidence of metastatic disease, including suspicious lymphadenopathy or skin nodules&#xD;
             on physical exam. A chest x-ray and bone scan are mandatory; however, all other&#xD;
             staging studies are at the treating physician's discretion. Any other staging test&#xD;
             (e.g., CT scans, MRI studies, ultrasound of abdomen, PET scans) must be negative for&#xD;
             metastatic disease. An abdominal CT scan or PET scan is mandatory for patients with&#xD;
             liver function tests elevated above the ULN to rule out metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a negative serum pregnancy test within 10 days prior to registration&#xD;
             (patients of childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;

             positive surgical margins, staging work-up, or physical examination suspicious for&#xD;
             malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage IIIb breast cancer (T4 disease, i.e., patients with fixed tumors, peau d'orange&#xD;
             skin changes, skin ulcerations, or inflammatory changes).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt;Grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical illness, other than that treated by this study, which would limit&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease including recent (&lt;6 months) myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, or congestive heart failure.&#xD;

             who are known to be HIV positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled disease such as uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obese patient to whom the Investigator is not comfortable administering full doses of&#xD;
             study drugs as calculated by the BSA (body surface area).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving concurrent immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of other malignancy within the last 5 years, which could affect the&#xD;
             diagnosis or assessment of high-risk breast cancer.&#xD;
