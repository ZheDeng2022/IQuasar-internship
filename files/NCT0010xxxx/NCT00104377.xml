  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grass MATA (modified pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate) has been developed to provide&#xD;
      pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with hypersensitivity to grass and rye&#xD;
      pollen. Different doses of Grass MATA will be administered and immunological changes&#xD;
      following this treatment will be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Grass MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients&#xD;
      with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross reacting grass pollens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grass pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an&#xD;
      allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus&#xD;
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important&#xD;
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities, is not seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A), a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of&#xD;
      Salmonella minnesota, is included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the&#xD;
      immunogenic effect of the product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to&#xD;
      a TH1-like T cell profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess specific immunological changes (IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and&#xD;
      IgE) in allergic subjects following 2 subcutaneous injections of different doses of study&#xD;
      medication (Grass MATA or placebo) administered 3 weeks apart. The immunological changes will&#xD;
      be used to assess the performance of the R7 IgG reactivity assay over a range of clinically&#xD;
      efficacious doses.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of at least 1 season of moderate to severe seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis&#xD;
             without bronchial asthma due to an IgE mediated allergy to pollen from grasses and rye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test to grass pollen and to rye pollen allergen extract&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test to positive histamine control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative skin prick test to negative control&#xD;
