  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect data needed to design a treatment trial for patients with Fabry&#xD;
      disease using the experimental drug AT-1001. Fabry disease is an inherited metabolic disorder&#xD;
      in which an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A, which normally breaks down fatty substances&#xD;
      called glycolipids, is missing or does not function properly. As a result, glycolipids&#xD;
      accumulate in various tissues, causing liver, kidney, nerves, skin, muscle and blood vessel&#xD;
      problems. No treatment is given in this survey study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males 18 years of age and older with Fabry disease who have certain genetic mutations&#xD;
      associated with enhancement of alpha-galactosidase A activity may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures over 5 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), routine&#xD;
      urinalysis, measurements of height, weight, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      breathing rate, and temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests, 24-hour urine collection, vital signs and sweat test. The sweat test (also&#xD;
      called QSART, or quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test) measures the amount of sweat in a&#xD;
      particular area of skin. A small amount of medication called acetylcholine is put on an area&#xD;
      of the skin and a small electric current is applied to stimulate the sweat glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests, 24-hour urine collection, vital signs, and skin biopsy. For the skin biopsy, a&#xD;
      small area of skin is numbed and a punch device is used to remove a 3-mm (1/8-inch) layer of&#xD;
      skin for microscopic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests, 24-hour urine collection, vital signs, and QSART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, patients are scheduled at some point in the 5-day study for an eye&#xD;
      examination, brain magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), and a heart examination and&#xD;
      echocardiogram. MRA uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to provide images of the&#xD;
      blood vessels in the head and neck. It can detect abnormalities such as aneurysms, vessel&#xD;
      malformations, and thickening of the vessel walls. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound test&#xD;
      that shows how well the heart pumps blood and if there is thickening of the heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are taking enzyme replacement therapy discontinue treatment for up to 6 weeks&#xD;
      (no more than two missed infusions) to allow accurate measurement of the amount of&#xD;
      alpha-galactosidase A the patient's body produces by itself. They provide weekly blood&#xD;
      samples between the time they stop treatment and enter the study. The samples are used to&#xD;
      monitor the removal of the enzyme from the body and the possible buildup of Gb(3) in the&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed to characterize the clinical and laboratory profile of patients&#xD;
      with Fabry disease who have residual levels of Alpha-galactosidase (Alpha- Gal A) activity.&#xD;
      Normally these are patients with the later onset or milder forms of the disease, sometimes&#xD;
      referred to as the cardiac and/or renal variants. Enzyme Enhancement Therapy is a novel&#xD;
      therapeutic approach to treatment of lysosomal storage diseases that has recently been&#xD;
      proposed, for patients who produce low levels of endogenous enzyme. We plan to evaluate this&#xD;
      therapy in later-onset Fabry disease patients and in preparation we need to develop sensitive&#xD;
      outcome measures for this subset of patients. Thirty patients with enhanceable Alpha- Gal A&#xD;
      activity will be recruited. If on enzyme replacement therapy, they will be asked to miss up&#xD;
      to two biweekly infusions. These patients, along with five control patients with&#xD;
      non-enhanceable(classic) Fabry disease, will undergo a comprehensive five day evaluation at&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center that will include a complete physical examination, functional studies&#xD;
      of the heart, eye, kidney and sweat function, imaging of the brain and the heart and a number&#xD;
      of blood and urine tests, as well as a skin biopsy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age 18 and older males&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be included if they possess an Alpha-Gal A mutation that in previous&#xD;
             investigations has been associated with enhancement of enzyme activity, as judged by&#xD;
             the Principal Investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients whose general health prevents them from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant disease unrelated to Fabry disease (e.g. diabetes, cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who refuse to sign the informed consent form or who are unable to travel to&#xD;
             the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
