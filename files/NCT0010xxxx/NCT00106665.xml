    <textblock>
      This study seeks to define the morbidity of critical care polyneuropathy and to confirm that&#xD;
      this diagnosis is, in fact, independently associated with increased mortality. Secondary&#xD;
      information regarding the reasons for ICU readmission in patients with weakness may help in&#xD;
      formulating cogent discharge strategies for these patients. Measurement of weakness using&#xD;
      handgrip strength may provide a useful surrogate marker for weakness that may be more easily&#xD;
      and uniformly applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The development of ICU-associated weakness is independently associated with excess&#xD;
           attributable mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The development of ICU-associated weakness is associated with an increased need for ICU&#xD;
           readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readmission to the ICU will be a result of the development of recurrent respiratory&#xD;
           failure or insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handgrip strength testing will detect ICU-associated weakness with an equivalent&#xD;
           sensitivity as the comprehensive bedside muscle strength exam.&#xD;

      Study Overview: This study will enroll patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation to&#xD;
      identify the presence of newly acquired weakness in the ICU. Eligible patients are those that&#xD;
      require the use of mechanical ventilation for greater than or equal to five days, because&#xD;
      this is a significant risk factor for weakness. These patients will be enrolled and followed&#xD;
      to detect the true relative mortality between weak and strong patients in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify patients with relevant and significant weakness, this study identifies weakness&#xD;
      in patients who survive and return to a state of normal consciousness. As such these&#xD;
      patients, once enrolled, need to be screened daily for awakening. Once awake an assessment of&#xD;
      peripheral muscle strength will be performed with a standard bedside neuromuscular exam and&#xD;
      handgrip manometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Data Collection: After consent, demographic information and risk factors for&#xD;
      neuromuscular disease for each patient will be recorded. Blood pressure values and other data&#xD;
      regarding the subjects' severity of illness will be collected. Any previous use of medicines&#xD;
      during the current hospitalization that are associated with the development of weakness will&#xD;
      be collected as well. Also any previous history of other chronic disease known to be&#xD;
      associated with weakness (e.g. diabetes, immune system deficiency, end-stage liver disease or&#xD;
      kidney disease) will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen for awakening (SA):Once daily the patient will be assessed for awakening using a&#xD;
      standard (RASS). When the patient awake and able to follow commands they will be assessed for&#xD;
      muscle strength exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Research Council Strength Exam:The examiner will perform their exam on the first day&#xD;
      that the patient is eligible by RASS screening. This same examiner will return at least&#xD;
      twenty hours, but no more than forty-eight hours later to perform a repeat exam. The exam&#xD;
      will be based on the Medical Research Council standard exam. Functions assessed:Upper&#xD;
      extremity: wrist flexion, arm flexion, shoulder abduction. Lower extremity: ankle&#xD;
      dorsiflexion, knee extension and hip flexion. Handgrip assessment: On the same day as the MRC&#xD;
      exam the patient will be asked to perform a handgrip maneuver using the JamarÂ® handgrip&#xD;
      manometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilator use, Re-intubation, Recurrent ICU admission, Tracheostomy use, ICU Length of Stay&#xD;
      and Hospital LOS&#xD;
