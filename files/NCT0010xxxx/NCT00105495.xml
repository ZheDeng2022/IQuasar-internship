      The purpose of this study is to determine whether deferiprone has superior efficacy in&#xD;
      removing excess iron from the heart when compared with deferoxamine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial. The study&#xD;
      population is participants with thalassemia major who are receiving regular chelation therapy&#xD;
      with deferoxamine. A total of sixty (60) participants will be enrolled among the&#xD;
      investigative sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether deferiprone exhibits superior&#xD;
      efficacy in removing excess iron from the heart compared to that of the standard therapy,&#xD;
      deferoxamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the relative efficacy of deferiprone with respect to&#xD;
      that of deferoxamine as assessed by serum ferritin concentration and liver iron&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy measure in this study will be the participants' cardiac iron status, as&#xD;
      determined by heart MRI T2* assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy measure will be by serum ferritin concentration and liver iron&#xD;
      concentration. This will be measured by the Superconducting Quantum-Interference Device&#xD;
      (SQUID) BioSusceptometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of treatment is 12 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of thalassemia major as confirmed by laboratory and clinical criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are well transfused-maintaining a mean pre-transfusion Hb&#xD;
             (hemoglobin) no less than 9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between 18 and 36 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving ongoing chelation therapy with deferoxamine for at least the past five&#xD;
             years. Those who have been exposed to deferiprone for&#xD;
&#xD;
             ≤ 6 months but not within the last 2 years prior to commencement of this study will be&#xD;
             considered eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal heart MRI T2* greater than or equal to 8 ms and &lt; 20 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, fertile, and is neither pregnant nor lactating, confirms she will use an&#xD;
             effective method of contraception for the length of the trial and has a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test immediately prior to commencement of study drug OR has had a tubal&#xD;
             ligation OR a hysterectomy OR is post menopausal (at least 1 year no menses prior to&#xD;
             enrollment in the study) OR their only sexual partner has been sterilized (if male).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If male and fertile, he confirms that he and/or his partner will use an effective&#xD;
             method of contraception for the length of the trial.&#xD;
