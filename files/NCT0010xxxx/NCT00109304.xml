    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the safety and tolerability of a new investigational&#xD;
      vaccine referred to as VEE IA/B V3526, which may induce production of specific antibodies in&#xD;
      vaccinated humans, and may protect them against infection with the Venezuelan Equine&#xD;
      Encephalitis (VEE) Virus.&#xD;

      Safety Objectives: 1) To determine preliminary safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of&#xD;
      VEE IA/B V3526 in VEE-naïve healthy volunteers after single dose subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      administration; 2) To evaluate virological safety by assessing serum viremia and viral&#xD;
      shedding in nose and throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity Objectives: 1) To assess the humoral immune response (plaque reduction&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT)) against VEE subtype IA/B after SC administration of&#xD;
      different dose-levels of the VEE IA/B V3526 vaccine candidate; 2) To assess duration of&#xD;
      immune response over six months after the VEE IA/B V3526 vaccination based on PRNT; and 3) To&#xD;
      identify two suitable VEE IA/B V3526 vaccine dose-levels for future administration in dose&#xD;
      optimization and expanded safety studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives: 1) To collect and store serum for future development of&#xD;
      immunogenicity assays (e.g., ELISA) against multiple VEE subtypes IA/B, IE, IIIA, and other&#xD;
      possible subtypes; 2) To collect and store serum for future use in the development of a&#xD;
      passive transfer challenge model; 3) Collect VEE IA/B V3526 positive serum (Positive Control&#xD;
      Serum) at the Day 21 visit.&#xD;
