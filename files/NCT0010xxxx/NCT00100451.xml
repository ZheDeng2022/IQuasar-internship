  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether exercise alters the way in which the body&#xD;
      stores and breaks down fat. A second objective is to evaluate how these effects are&#xD;
      influenced by your age and gender. These studies are important because aging, male gender,&#xD;
      and menopause are associated with an increased storage of abdominal fat which is frequently&#xD;
      accompanied by diabetes, a high blood cholesterol level, high blood pressure and greater&#xD;
      risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. Increasing evidence suggests that these&#xD;
      abnormalities and many other effects of aging may be partly due to lack of exercise.&#xD;

      The physiologic cause(s) of the age-related increase in total body and abdominal fat mass are&#xD;
      not well-understood. The purpose of this study is to determine whether aging is associated&#xD;
      with decreased whole body lipolytic and other metabolic responses to epinephrine and insulin,&#xD;
      whether these responses may be augmented by exercise training or in older women by estrogen&#xD;
      administration and to investigate whether such metabolic changes are related to reductions in&#xD;
      abdominal adiposity. Our objectives in this project are as follows: (1) to characterize age&#xD;
      and gender differences in lipolysis and other aspects of metabolism at rest and during graded&#xD;
      dose epinephrine infusion with or without a pancreatic islet clamp in healthy non-obese men&#xD;
      and women aged 20-40 and 55-75 years, (2) to evaluate relationships between metabolic&#xD;
      responses to epinephrine or insulin and portally and nonportally-drained visceral and&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue mass in these individuals, (3) to delineate the effects of acute&#xD;
      and chronic exercise on lipolytic and other metabolic responses to epinephrine and insulin&#xD;
      and on adipose tissue distribution in healthy younger and older men and women, and (4) to&#xD;
      investigate whether 7 days and 12 months or estrogen and cyclic progesterone replacement&#xD;
      therapy or placebo in healthy 55-75 year old women alter lipolytic and other metabolic&#xD;
      responses to epinephrine and insulin and adipose tissue distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rates of lipolysis, oxygen uptake, fat and carbohydrate oxidation, and total&#xD;
      triglyceride-free fatty acid (FFA) substrate cycling will be determined by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analyses of blood samples obtained&#xD;
      during infusions of the stable isotope tracers [D5] glycerol and [1 -13C] palmitate in the&#xD;
      baseline state, during a pancreatic islet clamp in half of all male and female participants,&#xD;
      and in all participants during a subsequent 4-stage graded dose epinephrine infusion. These&#xD;
      data will be expressed in relation to total body wieght, fat mass, and fat-free mass,&#xD;
      assessed from measurements of body density made by hydrostatic weighing. Adipose tissue&#xD;
      distribution will be characterized by determination of the cross-sectional area and volume of&#xD;
      portally and nonportally-drained visceral and subcutaneous fat deposits identified by&#xD;
      radiographic density criteria on computed tomographic scans obtained at the level of the&#xD;
      nipple, umbilicus, gluteal region, and midthigh. Insulin action on glucose disposal will be&#xD;
      assessed during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Age and gender differences and their&#xD;
      interactions with exercise and the plasma epinephrine concentration in the baseline state and&#xD;
      during submaximally and maximally stimulating rates of epinephrine infustion will be&#xD;
      evaluated by analysis of variance and covariance. Relationships between effects of estrogen&#xD;
      treatment or exercise of adipose tissue distribution and responses to epinephrine and insulin&#xD;
      will be assessed by multiple regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that increased age will be associated with lower epinephrine-induced rates of&#xD;
      lipolysis, fat oxidation, and triglyceride-FFA substrate cycling and decreased insulin action&#xD;
      in both men and women when expressed in relation to total fat mass. We further hypothesize&#xD;
      that these age-related differences will be at least partly ameliorated by exercise training&#xD;
      and by treatment with estrogen in conjunction with a decrease in visceral abdominal and total&#xD;
      body adiposity.&#xD;
