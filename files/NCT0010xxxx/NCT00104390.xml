      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the residual allergenicity of Grass MATA (modified&#xD;
      pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate) by skin prick testing. This is done by a comparison of&#xD;
      the wheal response after skin prick testing with aqueous native and modified allergen,&#xD;
      modified tyrosine adsorbed allergen and Grass MATA MPL (modified tyrosine adsorbed + MPL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grass MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients&#xD;
      with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross reacting grass pollens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A), a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of&#xD;
      Salmonella minnesota, is included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the&#xD;
      immunogenic effect of the product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to&#xD;
      a TH1-like T cell profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grass pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an&#xD;
      allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus&#xD;
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important&#xD;
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities, is not seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modification is greater than 75 %, so that only a small amount of unmodified allergen is&#xD;
      remaining in the product. The purpose of this study is to assess residual allergenicity of&#xD;
      the modified grass/rye pollen in Grass MATA MPL using skin prick testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this skin prick test, the following test products will be compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 concentrations of aqueous native allergen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aqueous modified allergen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modified tyrosine adsorbed allergen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grass MATA MPL (modified tyrosine adsorbed + MPL)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test to grass and rye pollen allergen extract&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test to positive histamine control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative skin prick test to negative control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specific IgE for grass and rye as documented by a RAST or equivalent test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential may enter the study if they have a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test and they have been practicing adequate contraception for 3 months prior&#xD;
             to the study and continue to do so during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of acute or subacute atopic dermatitis, chronic dermatitis,&#xD;
             urticaria factitia, or urticaria due to physical/chemical influence or any other skin&#xD;
             conditions which might interfere with the interpretation of skin prick test results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual inspection of the forearms indicates potential problems with the conduct or&#xD;
             interpretation of the skin prick tests; both forearms must be available for testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has bronchial asthma or other lower respiratory tract condition (i.e.,&#xD;
             emphysema, bronchiectasis)&#xD;
