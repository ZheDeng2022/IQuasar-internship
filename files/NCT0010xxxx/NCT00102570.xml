      This study will evaluate children with allergies and collect medical data and biological&#xD;
      specimens from them periodically to learn more about the diseases and gain information that&#xD;
      may be useful in developing new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 6 months to 18 years of age with a possible diagnosis of asthma, rhinitis,&#xD;
      anaphylaxis, hives, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, stinging insect allergy, and other&#xD;
      allergic and inflammatory diseases may be eligible for this study. Biological parents of&#xD;
      patients may also be enrolled to provide a blood sample for genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo tests appropriate for the diagnosis and management of their allergy.&#xD;
      They include the tests outlined below and, when necessary, additional blood tests, tissue&#xD;
      biopsies (surgical removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination), computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary function test: This test evaluates lung function. The patient blows hard into&#xD;
           a tube attached to a machine to measure the airflow from the lungs. At home, the patient&#xD;
           uses a small plastic device called a peak flow meter to measure lung function. Patients&#xD;
           whose lung function measures less than 80 percent the value predicted for his or her age&#xD;
           may be given the medicine albuterol to see if lung function improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin prick testing: Drops of up to 55 different allergens (foreign substances, such as&#xD;
           pollen and certain foods or medicines that cause reactions like sneezing, hives, eczema,&#xD;
           and others) are placed on the back or arm. The skin under the allergen is then scratched&#xD;
           with a pointed tool. If the person is allergic, the skin around the scratch develops a&#xD;
           small area of itching, redness, or swelling that goes away after 30 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acoustic rhinometry: To learn the effect of allergies on the size of the nasal cavity,&#xD;
           the nasal canal size is measured by placing a small round probe on the nostril. The&#xD;
           device sends out and receives a sound wave signal from which the size of the nasal canal&#xD;
           is calculated, recorded and stored graphically on a computer screen. The procedure is&#xD;
           repeated three times with each nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computerized assessment of learning and mood: Patients who are age 10 or older may take&#xD;
           this computer test to find out if allergies affect learning and mood. The test measures&#xD;
           the child's ability to understand directions, solve problems, and remember things. It&#xD;
           also includes questions about how the child feels in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral assessment system for children: Patients who are age 8 or older may take this&#xD;
           true/false questionnaire to assess mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood may be drawn for the following purposes: in lieu of skin prick testing to&#xD;
           determine sensitivity to allergens; to look for reasons for the severity or cause of an&#xD;
           allergy; for research studies on the immune system, including markers of allergy; for&#xD;
           genetic tests to determine inherited factors that increase the risk of developing&#xD;
           allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are scheduled for follow-up visits based on their diagnosis and severity of illness.&#xD;
      Most patients return for within one month of their first study visit and then, in general,&#xD;
      once a month when allergies are severe, and every few months when they are more stable.&#xD;
      Visits include an updated history and physical examination, blood tests, and possibly some of&#xD;
      the tests described above. Patients may also have intradermal skin testing, in which&#xD;
      allergens that are used for skin prick testing are injected into the forearms or upper arms&#xD;
      just below the surface of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who test positive to allergens may be offered standard treatment with allergy shots.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atopic disorders, including but not limited to asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis, urticaria,&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and stinging insect allergy are exceedingly common in the&#xD;
      pediatric population. The impact that these disorders have on health, educational and social&#xD;
      activities and costs of medical care are profound and widespread. In order to understand&#xD;
      disease and improve therapy, the study of pediatric allergy is justifiably an important&#xD;
      health priority and the goal of this protocol. This purpose will be fostered through the&#xD;
      following objectives: 1) To gather a database of clinical and immunological data and to&#xD;
      better clinically and immunologically characterize disease onset, progression and remittance&#xD;
      of these disorders; 2) to foster collaborative studies in pediatric allergic disease with&#xD;
      other institutions and 3) to provide a cohort of pediatric patients for residents in the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center/NIAID Allergy and Immunology training program. Up to 500 new patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to attain these goals. Patients will undergo screening history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and clinical laboratory evaluation according to the standard of practice in the&#xD;
      community. Although imaging studies and tissue biopsies will be performed only when&#xD;
      clinically indicated, blood samples for cellular and biochemical studies may be collected for&#xD;
      research purposes. Treatment plans will be individualized for each patient and the number and&#xD;
      length of additional visits and diagnostic evaluations will vary accordingly. Standard&#xD;
      immunotherapy for allergic disease may be offered. Through the assessment, analysis, and&#xD;
      treatment of a large cohort of patients, we will better understand disease manifestations,&#xD;
      trends, outcomes, and mechanisms of pediatric allergy and lay the groundwork for discovery of&#xD;
      new therapeutic modalities.&#xD;
