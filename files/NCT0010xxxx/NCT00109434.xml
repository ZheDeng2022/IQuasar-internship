  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out how often low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)&#xD;
      happens during the night after exercise in the late afternoon. The study also will see if&#xD;
      there are any factors that can predict if low blood sugar is going to develop. Blood samples&#xD;
      will also be drawn to measure two hormones-glucagon and epinephrine (adrenaline)-to see how&#xD;
      they are affected by exercise. Glucagon helps to raise the blood sugar when it is low.&#xD;
      Epinephrine causes symptoms that make the person aware that the blood sugar is low. From the&#xD;
      blood sample, other substances in the blood may also be measured to see how they are affected&#xD;
      by exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second purpose of the study is to find out whether exercise affects the accuracy of a&#xD;
      continuous glucose sensor (CGMS made by Medtronic Minimed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also look at the accuracy of different home glucose meters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children and adults with type 1 diabetes have a drop in the blood sugar during exercise.&#xD;
      When someone has low blood sugar, the body tries to return the blood sugar to normal. Some&#xD;
      studies show that after exercise, the blood sugar may drop later in the day or during the&#xD;
      night. However, it is not known how often this happens. Also, not enough is known about how&#xD;
      exercise affects blood sugar or the awareness of low blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies in adults have shown that exercise may affect the body's natural response to low&#xD;
      blood sugar and exercise in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, each subject will have two in-patient hospital stays 1 to 4 weeks apart, each&#xD;
      lasting about 24 hours: one with no exercise and one with a 75-minute exercise session in the&#xD;
      late afternoon. (The order of the exercise and sedentary days will be determined at random.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to each hospital admission, each subject will keep a detailed diary of insulin use and&#xD;
      hypoglycemia for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each of the two admissions, the insulin regimens and diet will be as similar as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each of the 2 admissions, the following will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A CGMS sensor will be inserted and calibrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An intravenous catheter for the collection of blood samples will be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sugar measurements will be made with an Ultra, BD Logic, and Freestyle meter every&#xD;
           half hour beginning at 10:00 p.m. through 6:00 a.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for glucagon, epinephrine, and glucose will be collected hourly from 10:00&#xD;
           p.m. to 6:00 a.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the exercise day only,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the morning, the subject will run on the treadmill for about 5 minutes to determine&#xD;
           the settings needed to achieve a heart rate of 140.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise will begin at approximately 4:00PM and will consist of 15 minutes on a&#xD;
           treadmill at a heart rate of approximately 140 followed by a 5-minute rest period. This&#xD;
           cycle will be repeated 3 more times for a total of four 15-minute exercise periods with&#xD;
           5-minute rest periods in between (75 minutes total). A heart rate monitor will be worn&#xD;
           throughout the time of exercise to ascertain the effort put forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BG (blood glucose) measurements will be made using the Ultra, BD Logic, and Freestyle&#xD;
           meters (1) prior to starting the exercise, (2) during each of the 3 rest periods, (3)&#xD;
           immediately following the exercise session, and (4) at 15 minute intervals for one hour&#xD;
           following the completion of the exercise. Blood samples will be collected for the&#xD;
           central lab at the times of sampling for glucagon and epinephrine.&#xD;
