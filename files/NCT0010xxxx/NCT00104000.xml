      This study will examine whether surface electrical stimulation on the skin of the throat&#xD;
      will: 1) move the larynx (voice box); 2) move the vocal folds in the larynx; and 3) cause&#xD;
      less movement of the larynx when applied during swallowing. It is important that the larynx&#xD;
      moves up and forward while swallowing so that food does not go into the airway. A device&#xD;
      called VitalStim® (Registered Trademark), which provides electrical stimulation to the skin&#xD;
      on the neck and under the chin, is widely used to treat people who have problems swallowing.&#xD;
      This study will determine if VitalStim can move the voice box or the vocal folds in the&#xD;
      larynx. This information is important for patients who have long-term problems raising or&#xD;
      closing their larynxes when they swallow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 20 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and&#xD;
      nasoendoscopy. For the latter procedure, the inside of the subject's nose is sprayed with a&#xD;
      decongestant, opening the nasal passages. A small flexible tube called a nasoendoscope is&#xD;
      passed through the nose to the back of the throat. The scope allows observation of the larynx&#xD;
      while the subject speaks, sings, whistles and makes prolonged vowel sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are familiarized with the VitalStim device before beginning the experimental&#xD;
      procedures. The device consists of two sets of electrodes and a stimulation unit. The&#xD;
      electrodes are placed on the neck and under the chin. Stimulation causes different&#xD;
      sensations, according to the intensity level. They include &quot;tingling/crawling,&quot; &quot;vibrating&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;warm/burning,&quot; and &quot;grabbing.&quot; Subjects then undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasoendoscopy with muscle stimulation: The inside of the nose is sprayed with a&#xD;
           decongestant and the nasoendoscope is passed through one nostril to the back of the&#xD;
           throat. Electrodes are placed on the throat area and under the chin. Stimulation is&#xD;
           delivered 10 times at various places on the neck and under the chin while the subject&#xD;
           sits quietly. This test shows if the vocal folds in the voice box move with surface&#xD;
           electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Videofluoroscopy with muscle stimulation at rest and during swallowing: This is an x-ray&#xD;
           study of the head and neck during swallowing and at rest to determine how stimulation&#xD;
           affects the level of the voice box in the neck. Electrodes are placed under the chin and&#xD;
           on the throat. The subject swallows 5 milliliters of barium, a contrast material that&#xD;
           can be seen easily on x-ray. The x-ray machine is turned on for a few seconds at a time&#xD;
           during each swallow of the barium and another 10 times while the subject is remaining&#xD;
           still without swallowing.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surface electrical stimulation at rest using various electrode placements produces&#xD;
           different hyo-laryngeal movements of in healthy adult humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One surface electrical stimulation array (placement 3b) reduces hyo-larynegeal movement&#xD;
           in healthy humans during swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: healthy adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study will employ a repeated measures design. Surface electrodes will be used to&#xD;
      stimulate submental and laryngeal muscles either alone or in combination both at rest and&#xD;
      during swallowing while using videofluoroscopy and nasolaryngoscopy to record hyo-laryngeal&#xD;
      movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Kinematic analyses of hyo-laryngeal movements using image processing and&#xD;
      marking from video-recordings will quantify movement with stimulation.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Healthy volunteers will be without cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, otolaryngological,&#xD;
        psychiatric or speech, swallowing and hearing problems as determined by medical history and&#xD;
        examination by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Rheumatic fever, mitral valve prolapse, or cardiac arrhythmias as&#xD;
             determined by medical history, physical and EKG. A physician will auscultate for&#xD;
             cardiac murmurs prior to any study to exclude volunteers who might be at risk for&#xD;
             endocarditis. Subjects will have an EKG as part of the screening for participation in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy will exclude women from participation because the study involves radiation&#xD;
             exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  None of the Healthy volunteers will have a reduction in the range of vocal fold&#xD;
             movement during the nasoendoscopy that might suggest laryngeal paralysis or paresis,&#xD;
             joint abnormality or neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy Volunteers who have a cardiac demand pacemaker, dementia, exhibit non-stop&#xD;
             vocalization, significant reflux due to use of a feeding tube, or drug toxicity will&#xD;
             not be included for VitalStim, as these are contraindications to use of the device.&#xD;
