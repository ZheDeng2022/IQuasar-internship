      This study will examine the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on short-term&#xD;
      memory in healthy adults. Healthy people use their brains to answer short-term memory&#xD;
      questions in a different way than do patients with schizophrenia. Attention and memory&#xD;
      deficits in schizophrenia patients significantly hamper their recovery and rehabilitation,&#xD;
      yet there are no effective treatments for these impairments. TMS is a method of brain&#xD;
      stimulation that may be able to change the electrical activity of the nerve cells of the&#xD;
      brain and improve certain brain functions. This study will explore the effect of TMS on&#xD;
      memory and perhaps discover brain processes that may be helpful in developing new ways to&#xD;
      treat schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age, excluding pregnant women, may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), and urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). These tests are done in&#xD;
           participants who have not had structural and functional MRIs as participants in NIMH's&#xD;
           2-day schizophrenia study within 90 days of entering the current study. MRI is done to&#xD;
           locate the place in the brain to simulate with TMS and fMRI is done to look at brain&#xD;
           activity while the subject solves short-term memory tasks. Both tests are done at the&#xD;
           same session. Before the scan, four vitamin E capsules are taped to the subject's scalp.&#xD;
           After the capsules are in place, the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into the&#xD;
           scanner - a narrow cylinder with a strong magnetic field. During the scan, subjects are&#xD;
           asked to do some simple tests, such as watching pictures on a screen or pressing buttons&#xD;
           in response to numbers they were shown a few seconds earlier. Scanning may take up to 2&#xD;
           hours, but usually lasts between 45 and 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS. For this procedure, subjects receive either active TMS or a sham procedure&#xD;
           (placebo) that imitates TMS but does not use real electrical stimulation. For TMS, an&#xD;
           insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp and a brief electrical current is passed&#xD;
           through it. This generates magnetic pulses that travel through the scalp and skull and&#xD;
           cause small electrical currents in the cortex, or outer part of the brain. The&#xD;
           stimulation may cause muscle twitching in the scalp or face and may also cause small&#xD;
           movement of the limbs. During the procedure, electrodes are taped to the scalp to record&#xD;
           the electrical activity of the brain while short-term memory is tested. Two tests make&#xD;
           up a set. There are a total of six test sets; each set takes about 3 minutes. Five&#xD;
           periods of electrical stimulation are delivered before each test set. Each period of&#xD;
           stimulation lasts 5 seconds, followed by a 10-second rest period. The stimulation-rest&#xD;
           intervals continue until five periods of TMS have been applied. For the memory test,&#xD;
           subjects press a key on a computer keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible in a&#xD;
           test of their ability to remember a string of numbers, or letters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires. At the beginning and end of the TMS session, participants fill out&#xD;
           questionnaires that assess their mood, ability to concentrate, and level of anxiety.&#xD;

      Psychiatrists have recognized cognitive dysfunction as the principal impediment to recovery&#xD;
      and psychosocial rehabilitation of patients with schizophrenia since the first edition of&#xD;
      Emil Kraepelin's 1893 masterwork, Dementia Praecox. While currently available pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      may improve psychotic symptoms, there is still no largely effective treatment for impairments&#xD;
      of critical executive functions - attention and working memory - that are widely considered&#xD;
      the functional nexus of this extremely costly illness. Thus, it appears heuristically&#xD;
      reasonable to consider putative modes of treatment that may specifically target these&#xD;
      deficits. For example, abundant evidence supports the assumption that pre-task alpha band&#xD;
      power, measured as mean peak frequency, is inversely associated with reaction time (RT) - an&#xD;
      index of encoding efficiency - in a working memory task. Additionally, recent evidence&#xD;
      suggests pre-task alpha peak frequency predicts outcome on tests of working memory. Evidence&#xD;
      also suggests patient with schizophrenia have low pre-task alpha peak frequency, and slower&#xD;
      RT on working memory paradigms, such as the n-back and Sternberg compared with healthy&#xD;
      controls; taken together, the weight of evidence lends plausibility to the assumption that an&#xD;
      increase in patients' pre-task alpha band power might be associated with a faster reaction&#xD;
      time. Notably in this regard, recent evidence suggests transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) may increase pre-task alpha, and is associated with a faster RT in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      There are as yet no reports of the effect of TMS on alpha band peak frequency, or reaction&#xD;
      time, in patients with schizophrenia. A critical obstacle to progress in the clinical&#xD;
      neuroscience of TMS effects in human subjects until now has been the absence of a means to&#xD;
      determine the optimal subject-specific brain region to target with TMS. Cortical targets for&#xD;
      stimulation are customarily selected on the basis of group mean data, with the tacit&#xD;
      assumption that candidates for TMS all utilize the same distributed neural circuit to perform&#xD;
      a particular cognitive task. This untested assumption is a conceivable source of the&#xD;
      confusing discrepancy of TMS clinical trial outcomes, for example, in the depression&#xD;
      treatment literature. In this regard, a group from our laboratory recently reported the use&#xD;
      of structural equation modeling (SEM) based path analysis to construct group and&#xD;
      subject-specific models of the 2-back working memory task in healthy subjects studied with&#xD;
      PET. The results of this investigation suggest there may be a significant association between&#xD;
      cognitive strategy, circuit path, and memory performance. We found higher scores were&#xD;
      associated with activation of a left hemisphere distributed circuit, and a verbal cognitive&#xD;
      strategy, while lower scoring subjects utilized a right hemisphere circuit, and a&#xD;
      visuo-spatial strategy. Notably, these findings are congruent with those of previous studies&#xD;
      that used different methods of analysis and a similar paradigm. Taken together, these data&#xD;
      suggest that a trial of TMS aimed at improving working memory reaction time by elevating&#xD;
      pre-task alpha power should first identify the predominant nodes of a subject-specific&#xD;
      working memory sub-network as putative sites of stimulation. There are no reports of such an&#xD;
      approach to TMS target selection in either healthy controls, or patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      In this proof of concept with healthy subjects protocol, our principle assumption is alpha&#xD;
      frequency TMS directed to a subject-specific predominant node (right or left DLPFC) of a&#xD;
      distributed neural network reduces reaction time on the n-back and Sternberg working memory&#xD;
      paradigms.&#xD;
