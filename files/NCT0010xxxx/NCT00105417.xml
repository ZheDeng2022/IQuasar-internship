    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether interleukin-7 (IL-7) a drug similar to the natural IL-7&#xD;
      protein produced by the body, is safe to use in people infected with HIV. IL-7 is important&#xD;
      in immune system function. In humans, it can extend the life of immune cells called T-cells&#xD;
      and increase their function and maturation; in mice, it can speed up immune system recovery&#xD;
      following chemotherapy of transplantation; and in monkeys, it can make T-cells increase in&#xD;
      numbers. If this study shows that IL-7 is safe, other trials will determine if it can improve&#xD;
      the numbers or function of T-cells in HIV-infected people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with HIV infection who have been taking anti-HIV&#xD;
      medications for at least 12 months, whose CD4 counts are at least 100 cells/microliter, and&#xD;
      whose viral load is no more than 50,000 copies/milliliter may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a physical examination, blood and urine tests, including a blood&#xD;
      test for HLA type (a genetic test of markers of the immune system), chest x-ray,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, and ultrasound of the spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures during 9 visits, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-entry visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief physical examination, including examination of lymph nodes and spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, including questions about current and past medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for viral load, immune responses, and other routine safety tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete physical examination, including examination of lymph nodes and spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine urine test and urine pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for viral load, immune responses, and other routine safety tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-7 dosing. Participants are randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of IL-7 (3,&#xD;
           10, 30, 60 or 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight) or placebo (a salt solution&#xD;
           that does not contain IL-7). The dose may be given in one or more injections, with&#xD;
           higher doses possibly requiring as many as seven or eight injections. The injections are&#xD;
           given subcutaneously (under the skin), usually in the arm or leg. After the injection,&#xD;
           patients are monitored closely for 12 hours for skin or allergic reactions. Blood is&#xD;
           drawn before the injection and again at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the&#xD;
           injection to check blood levels of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients come to the clinic 7 times during follow-up-every day for the first 4 days after the&#xD;
      injection, then at 14 days, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the injection. At most study visits,&#xD;
      patients have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief physical examination, including examination of lymph nodes and spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine urine test and urine pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for viral load, immune responses, and other routine safety tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test to measure the amount of study medication in the blood 1, 2, and 3 days after&#xD;
           the injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram 1 day after the injection&#xD;

      Interleukin 7 is an essential cytokine for the thymic development and the post-thymic&#xD;
      survival, expansion and maturation of the T lymphocytes in humans. Therapeutic use of IL7 in&#xD;
      mouse models has shown enhancement of immune reconstitution after chemotherapy or bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation. The rationale for using IL-7 as immunotherapy in HIV infection would be to&#xD;
      support the expansion, survival and functional properties of T lymphocytes and enhance immune&#xD;
      reconstitution. More specifically, IL7 may provide the means to support CD4 expansions in&#xD;
      patients with good viral suppression but persistent low CD4 counts (immunologic&#xD;
      non-responders) or in patients who have no available antiretroviral options. Finally, given&#xD;
      the role of IL7 in T cell memory maturation and survival, IL-7 may be a promising vaccine&#xD;
      adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of rhIL7 in non-human primates have shown that T cell proliferation and expansion can&#xD;
      be achieved at doses that are well tolerated without significant toxicity. A safety study in&#xD;
      cancer patients is currently ongoing at the NCI. A5214 (Pleiades) will be the first study of&#xD;
      rhIL7 to evaluate the safety of a single subcutaneous injection in HIV infected adults.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects (CD4 greater than 100 cells/micro l and VL less than 50,000 copies/ml, on&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy for at least one year) will be stratified by viral load (less than 50&#xD;
      or 50-50,000 copies/ml) and will be randomized 3:1 to receive rhIL7 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleiades is a phase I, double-blind trial that will test the safety of a single subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection of IL-7 at 5 different doses (3, 10, 30, 60 and 100 micro g/kg) tested&#xD;
      sequentially. Four subjects will enroll in each dose level and dose escalation will occur&#xD;
      only after all subjects complete four weeks without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities as&#xD;
      reviewed by the safety monitoring committee. Secondary end points include a PK study of rhIL7&#xD;
      as well as immunologic studies throughout the duration of the study to assess evidence of IL7&#xD;
      biologic activity with markers of T cell activation, proliferation and differentiation as&#xD;
      well as expression of the alpha chain of the IL7 receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group (AACTG) study and the NIAID will participate as a&#xD;
      site. The NIAID site will follow all NIAID IRB reporting requirements and all grade 1 and 2&#xD;
      toxicities will be included in the annual review. Children will be excluded and a separate&#xD;
      study will be required in the future after the safety and biologic activity of this agent is&#xD;
      established in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll a total of 40-80 patients followed for a total of eight weeks, with&#xD;
      approximately 15-20 anticipated to enroll in our site.&#xD;
