      Brief Summary: 800 RRMS Subjects currently treated with Avonex or Copaxone will be randomized&#xD;
      to either continue on their current therapy or receive Rebif therapy. The subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for 2 years. The primary objective is to compare the time to worsening to a medium&#xD;
      level of concern as defined by the Canadian Multiple Sclerosis Working Group (CMSWG)&#xD;
      treatment optimization recommendations.&#xD;
