  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether lowering of fasting homocysteine&#xD;
      concentrations improves vascular function in healthy volunteers, irrespective of the&#xD;
      homocysteine-lowering agent.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high plasma homocysteine is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death.&#xD;
      However, it remains uncertain whether homocysteine per se, low status of folate, or other&#xD;
      factors related to methionine metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. Previous studies have shown that a high concentration of homocysteine in blood is&#xD;
      related to an impaired vascular function in the arteries, an indicator of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk. Virtually all intervention trials used folic acid as a homocysteine-lowering&#xD;
      agent, which may however affect vascular function through mechanisms not related to&#xD;
      homocysteine. We investigated whether lowering of fasting homocysteine concentrations via&#xD;
      supplementation with betaine or folic acid improves vascular function in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      in order to distinguish between effects of folic acid and of homocysteine-lowering per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: We compare the effects of supplementation with folic acid to the effects of&#xD;
      betaine, and to the effects of a placebo on plasma homocysteine concentrations and vascular&#xD;
      function in healthy humans.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willing not to use supplements containing B-vitamins, antioxidant vitamins (A,&#xD;
             beta-carotene, C and E) or n-3 fatty acids/fish oil supplements from screening day (&gt;2&#xD;
             months before start of the study) until end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing not to be blood or plasmapheresis donor from 4 weeks before the screening day,&#xD;
             and 4 weeks before the start of the study until the end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any chronic or acute disease (e.g. diabetes, renal disease, inflammation).&#xD;
&#xD;

             consumptions/week for men.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight loss or gain &gt; 2 kg in the month prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any special diet (prescribed, slimming, macrobiotic or total vegetarian). Sole&#xD;
             exclusion of meat and fish from an otherwise 'normal' western diet is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactose intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of supplements containing B-vitamins more than once weekly in the period from 3&#xD;
             months before the screening day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any other trial up to 3 months before this study.&#xD;
