      This study will explore the risks and causes of Parkinson's disease, a chronic progressive&#xD;
      nervous system disorder. Patients typically have tremors, muscle weakness and a shuffling&#xD;
      gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Parkinson's disease, their relatives and healthy volunteers may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates must be 18 years of age or older. Patients whose parkinsonism is due&#xD;
      to a secondary cause, such as infection or injury, and healthy volunteers who have a first&#xD;
      degree family member (parent, grandparent, child, sibling) with Parkinson's disease are&#xD;
      excluded from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked about possible symptoms they may have and about their general health.&#xD;
      They provide a blood sample to obtain DNA for genetic analysis to look for genetic&#xD;
      differences that might be related to risks for Parkinson's disease. White blood cells may be&#xD;
      treated in the laboratory to grow a cell line, which provides a source of substances in the&#xD;
      blood without having to draw samples repeatedly.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) was noted to have a familial component as early as 1880. More&#xD;
      recently, the discovery of several genetic factors influencing Parkinson's disease has&#xD;
      emphasized the importance of heredity in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The goal of this protocol will be to contribute to the genetic understanding of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. Clinical data will be collected in order to document the features of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease in affected individuals (phenotyping). Genetic characterization will be&#xD;
      undertaken for the discovery of specific genes which cause or contribute to the risk for&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (genotyping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study design has two components. The first (aim 1) involves positional cloning&#xD;
      for gene discovery in families with apparent Mendelian inheritance. The second (aim 2) will&#xD;
      utilize an association study design, using genetic case-control methods for assessment of&#xD;
      genetic risk factors. We will examine individuals affected by Parkinson's disease and their&#xD;
      family members towards Specific Aim 1. Specific Aim 2 will involve evaluation of individuals&#xD;
      with apparent sporadic Parkinson's disease, and also, healthy adult volunteers who will be&#xD;
      recruited as control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures for Specific Aim 1 are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The identification of new genes causal for Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The identification of new mutations in known genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures for Specific Aim 2 are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The discovery of gene variants which confer risk for Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The validation of already reported polymorphisms as risk factors for PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures (both Specific Aims 1 and 2): Genotype/phenotype correlations for&#xD;
      specific genetic forms of Parkinson's disease. For example, we will assess if a particular&#xD;
      age of onset, cardinal or secondary feature of PD or associated clinical course is associated&#xD;
      with a given genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future Direction: Because 1) the larger sample base the greater the likelihood of the&#xD;
      discovery of genes of minor effect and 2) discoveries of genetic risk factors require&#xD;
      validation in additional sample series, it is likely that renewal of this protocol will be&#xD;
      sought after five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: We aim to enroll a total of 2500 subjects over five years. These will&#xD;
      include approximately 500 samples for the Mendelian studies (Specific Aim 1), and 2000 for&#xD;
      association studies (Specific Aim 2). These estimates are based both on feasibility and on&#xD;
      statistical power. Subjects will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
