    <textblock>
      Current management of patients with TIA (transient ischemic attack) or minor stroke includes&#xD;
      the prompt investigation and treatment in the days and weeks after the event. However, new&#xD;
      evidence shows patients are at the highest risk of stroke in the first few days after the&#xD;
      TIA, with 50% of strokes which happen in the three months following TIA occurring within&#xD;
      48-72 hours. To date, there is no evidence to guide physicians on how to safely reduce this&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FASTER trial is focusing on the initial period of high risk, starting patients on stroke&#xD;
      prevention treatments in the hours following a TIA or minor stroke. The drugs to be tested&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective in the similar setting of cardiology, reducing recurrent&#xD;
      cardiac events in patients with unstable angina when commenced with the same speed after an&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be on aspirin. The trial will see if adding another drug, clopidogrel, has&#xD;
      an additional benefit in reducing the number of strokes after TIA or minor stroke within&#xD;
      three months of TIA or minor stroke. It will also look if the very early introduction of&#xD;
      simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering therapy, reduces stroke after TIA or minor stroke, both&#xD;
      by itself and in addition to clopidogrel. The final aim of the trial is to ensure that these&#xD;
      treatments are safe to be used in this population of patients.&#xD;

      The Fast Assessment of Stroke and Transient ischemic attack to prevent Early Recurrence&#xD;
      (FASTER) is a randomized clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of hyper-acute&#xD;
      initiation of stroke prevention treatments in patients with a minor stroke or transient&#xD;
      ischemic attack (TIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group of individuals has been recognized as being at high risk of recurrent events.&#xD;
      Johnston et al. (2000) were the first to suggest that the risk of stroke after TIA was&#xD;
      front-loaded in the first few days. This has been confirmed elsewhere with Lovett et al.&#xD;
      (2003) having shown in the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project that the 7-day risk of&#xD;
      recurrent stroke was 8.6%, and a 30-day risk of 12.0%. These findings are similarly found in&#xD;
      the Oxford Vascular Study; 8.0% and 11.5% respectively for a recurrent event (Coull et al.,&#xD;
      2004). The NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) study also&#xD;
      supports the finding of high risk of early recurrent stroke. 8.5% of patients with a&#xD;
      hemispheric TIA suffered a recurrent stroke within one week rising to 20% at 90-days&#xD;
      (Eliasziw et al., 2004). This data suggest that patients with carotid stenosis are at the&#xD;
      highest risk of early recurrent stoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one in four patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within three hours of symptom&#xD;
      onset are being treated with t-PA (Barber et al., 2001). The most common reason for exclusion&#xD;
      from treatment is that a patient's deficit will be too mild for treatment or will have&#xD;
      completely resolved thereby not meriting the risks of treatment with tPA. These are the&#xD;
      patients that have a higher risk of early recurrence. The clinical imperative is to identify&#xD;
      hyper-acute treatment strategies to minimize that risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FASTER is a double blind, randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design with&#xD;
      patients followed for 90-days. Patients will be randomized within 24 hours of symptom onset&#xD;
      to one of four possible treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspirin and Clopidogrel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspirin and Simvastatin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspirin and Clopidogrel and Simvastatin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. A rapid commencement of clopidogrel plus aspirin within 24 hours of acute TIA or minor&#xD;
      stroke is more effective than aspirin in reducing the 90-day risk of stroke by an absolute&#xD;
      difference of 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. A rapid commencement of simvastatin plus aspirin within 24 hours of acute TIA or minor&#xD;
      stroke is more effective than aspirin in reducing the 90-day risk of stroke by an absolute&#xD;
      difference of 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. A rapid commencement of clopidogrel plus aspirin plus simvastatin within 24 hours of acute&#xD;
      TIA or minor stroke is more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the 90-day risk of&#xD;
      stroke by an absolute difference of 4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. The incidence of adverse events is not different among treatment groups.&#xD;
