  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the HOPE-2 study is to determine whether long term supplementation with folic&#xD;
      acid, vitamins B6 and B12 aimed at homocyst(e)ine reduction reduces the rates of major fatal&#xD;
      and nonfatal cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease and/or&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in most&#xD;
      developed countries and accounts for approximately 40% of all deaths in Canada. Reductions in&#xD;
      cholesterol, lowering of blood pressure and smoking cessation have been shown to be effective&#xD;
      strategies in cardiovascular prevention; however, these major &quot;classical cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors&quot; along with nonmodifiable risk factors, cannot fully explain why certain individuals&#xD;
      develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, while others do not. Other &quot;emerging&quot;&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors are currently under investigation. There is a large body of&#xD;
      consistent, biologically plausible evidence linking hyperhomocyst(e)inemia to cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk and the association is graded. A simple, nontoxic therapeutic intervention in the form&#xD;
      of multivitamins - folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 - has been shown to be highly effective&#xD;
      in reducing homocyst(e)ine levels, irrespective of the underlying cause. To date, however,&#xD;
      there are no good clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of homocyst(e)ine-lowering&#xD;
      therapies in reducing major cardiovascular events. The impact of this simple intervention on&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains to be demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: Evaluate if long-term therapy with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12&#xD;
      compared to placebo reduces the risk of major fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the Study: The &quot;homocyst(e)ine theory of atherosclerosis&quot; remains an important&#xD;
      unanswered question in cardiovascular medicine. If indeed a combination of multivitamins is&#xD;
      found to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events, it is expected that this safe,&#xD;
      inexpensive and easily administered therapy would be widely used world-wide. Therefore, the&#xD;
      results of this trial could have a significant public health impact.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women and men 55 years of age or over with established CVD and at high risk for future&#xD;
             fatal and nonfatal CV events, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Documented coronary artery disease (CAD);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Documented peripheral vascular disease (PVD);&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Documented cerebrovascular disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Diabetes with one of the following; additional cardiovascular risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) hypertension (BP &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic or on treatment); ii)&#xD;
             total cholesterol &gt;5.2 mmol/L (&gt;200 mg/dl); iii) HDL cholesterol &lt;0.9 mmol/L (3.5&#xD;
