    <textblock>
      The safety and tolerability of tyrosine adsorbed ragweed pollen allergoid with monophosphoryl&#xD;
      lipid A (MPL) was planned to be evaluated. For this purpose, a total of 4 injections of&#xD;
      either increasing doses of the study drug or placebo (tyrosine) was planned to be&#xD;
      administered in 7-day intervals to healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RagweedMATAMPL (tyrosine adsorbed ragweed pollen allergoid with monophosphoryl lipid A&#xD;
      (MPL®)) has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with&#xD;
      proven type I hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen. MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A), a purified,&#xD;
      detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of Salmonella minnesota, is included in the&#xD;
      product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the product and to&#xD;
      enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to a TH1-like profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ragweed pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient,&#xD;
      an allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus&#xD;
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important&#xD;
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities is not seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was planned to be a phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of RagweedMATAMPL in healthy volunteers. Fifteen (15) volunteers were&#xD;
      planned to be randomized to receive up to 4 subcutaneous injections of either increasing&#xD;
      doses of RagweedMATAMPL or Placebo over 7 day intervals.&#xD;
