      Conventional rehabilitation does not restore normal, safe gait to many stroke survivors.&#xD;
      Functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) using intramuscular (IM) electrodes (FNS-IM)&#xD;
      improved persistent gait deficits for patients with chronic stroke (1-7 years post stroke),&#xD;
      but required a long protocol of 6-18 months. For chronic deficits, a shortened response to&#xD;
      treatment (3 months) was obtained by combining FNS-IM with body weight-supported treadmill&#xD;
      training (BWSTT). Gains included strength, coordination, gait kinematics, walking endurance,&#xD;
      and quality of life. Gait deficits treated in the chronic phase are more resistant to&#xD;
      treatment than in the early recovery phase, because chronic, abnormal movement patterns are&#xD;
      more ingrained. Therefore, during the early recovery phase, it is likely that a relatively&#xD;
      greater treatment response will be obtained. The purpose of the proposed work is to test the&#xD;
      combination FNS-IM + BWSTT during the early recovery phase following stroke. Hypothesis I is:&#xD;
      FNS-IM + BWSTT will restore volitional gait more completely for subjects during the early&#xD;
      recovery phase following stroke, compared to BWSTT alone. Subjects will be admitted at 1-11&#xD;
      months after stroke. Thirty five subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment&#xD;
      groups. They will be treated for 48 sessions, four sessions/week. Primary outcome measures&#xD;
      will be: kinematic swing phase gait components, energy cost of gait, and an index of walking&#xD;
      endurance. Secondary outcome measures will be kinematic stance phase gait components and gait&#xD;
      speed. The second set of hypotheses will test the relationship between restoration of&#xD;
      mobility and measurements of impairment, function and quality of life.&#xD;

      speed. The second set of hypotheses will test the relationship between restoration of&#xD;
      mobility and measurements of impairment, function and quality of life. Additionally,&#xD;
      co-variates will be assessed at entry into the study: gender, age, mood, co-morbidities, time&#xD;
      since stroke, and weeks of prior rehabilitation. Data for outcome measures will be collected&#xD;
      at weeks 1, 6, 12, and 6 months after the end of treatment. For Hypothesis I testing,&#xD;
      contrasts will be made between the two treatment groups. A separate regression model will be&#xD;
      analyzed for each outcome measure. The post-test score for a given primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will serve as the dependent variable in a regression model. The two independent variables&#xD;
      will be the treatment assignment information (as a dichotomous variable) and the pretest&#xD;
      score on the given outcome measure (the covariate). In additional model analyses for the&#xD;
      second set of hypotheses, the relationships will be ascertained between mobility restoration&#xD;
      and impairment, function, and quality of life. Mobility deficits following stroke pose a&#xD;
      significant economic, social, and psychological hardship to the individual and to society.&#xD;
      Development of techniques that improve lower extremity function will improve the quality of&#xD;
      life and reduce associated health care costs for patients after stroke. The results of the&#xD;
      proposed study have the potential to provide a new acute stroke treatment that will increase&#xD;
      the rate of recovery, produce a more comprehensive recovery of motor function, safer gait,&#xD;
      greater functional independence, and enhanced quality of life.&#xD;
