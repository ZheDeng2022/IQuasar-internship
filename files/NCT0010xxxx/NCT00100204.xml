    <textblock>
      This study will examine saliva samples from healthy volunteers and patients with various&#xD;
      diseases to learn more about how disease affects the mouth and salivary glands. It will use a&#xD;
      method called salivary proteomics to identify multiple proteins in saliva and discover if&#xD;
      there are protein patterns unique to specific diseases. The study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the salivary proteome in patients with Sjogren's syndrome,&#xD;
           graft-versus-host disease, diabetes, sarcoidosis, cystinosis, dental caries, and&#xD;
           immunodeficiencies and in patients who have had head and neck radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the possible use of salivary proteomics for early diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the potential use of salivary proteomics for prognosis and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in NIH clinical studies who have Sjogren's syndrome, graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease, diabetes, sarcoidosis, cystinosis, dental caries, or an immunodeficiency, or&#xD;
      patients undergoing head and neck radiation may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical and dental history, head and neck examination, and photographs of any&#xD;
      mouth sores or disease. Healthy volunteers also have blood drawn for routine laboratory&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have saliva collected from the floor of the mouth, the parotid salivary glands&#xD;
      in the cheek, and the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands under the tongue. Patients&#xD;
      with certain diseases also provide a urine sample. Saliva samples are collected as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One time from healthy volunteers and patients with Sjogren's syndrome, diabetes,&#xD;
           sarcoidosis, cystinosis and immunodeficiencies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five times from patients undergoing stem cell transplant: at baseline before transplant&#xD;
           and about 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three times from patients undergoing head and neck radiation: at baseline before&#xD;
           radiation and at 3 and 6 months after the conclusion of radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnostic potential of the proteomic methods has been explored by several groups in&#xD;
      recent years. Saliva contains many proteins, some of which are altered in various disease&#xD;
      states. In this study, saliva is to be sampled in patients with head and neck radiation,&#xD;
      diabetes, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, Sjogren's syndrome, cystinuria, methylmalonic&#xD;
      acidemia and other conditions. Various novel analytical and data-processing tools will be&#xD;
      used to infer characteristic salivary protein and salivary analyte signatures of these&#xD;
      disorders. In some cases, these data will be evaluated with data for the oral flora present&#xD;
      in the saliva and plaque of these patient groups and relate the presence and levels of&#xD;
      particular bacteria to the proteomic profile.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Male and female subjects of all ages and racial groups will be included. The&#xD;
                  lower age limit will be determined by the ability to cooperate with saliva&#xD;
                  collection methods: i.e. 6 months to 100 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients will be recruited from current NIH Clinical Center pools or the outside&#xD;
                  community. Patients must be diagnosed with cystinosis, sarcoidosis, head and neck&#xD;
                  cancer, Sjogren's syndrome or diabetes by their institute physician. Controls&#xD;
                  will be recruited from various NIH populations who are generally healthy and&#xD;
                  without one of the diseases listed above or through the NIH Healthy Volunteer&#xD;
                  Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients with both benign and malignant disease undergoing bone marrow transplant&#xD;
                  or hematopoeitic stem cell transplant will be eligible. Among patients with&#xD;
                  malignant disease both solid tumors and leukemias will be included. Patients who&#xD;
                  can be diagnosed unequivocally with GVHD via biopsy of the affected organ system&#xD;
                  will be included in the disease group. Patients will be included in control group&#xD;
                  when GVHD can be reliably excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. For caries studies, we will examine salivary samples already collected from a&#xD;
                  large twin cohort study in Brazil. These samples were collected from twins and&#xD;
                  their siblings as part of a study of early childhood caries. Results from that&#xD;
                  study suggest that genetics has a role in the development of caries. Whole&#xD;
                  salivary samples have been collected and frozen for further analysis. These&#xD;
                  samples will be examined for differences in salivary proteins which may be&#xD;
                  associated with the development of early childhood caries. Samples are coded with&#xD;
                  a unique numerical identifier with clinical diagnosis for caries, as well as&#xD;
                  subject age, gender and ethnicity. No other patient information is linked to this&#xD;
                  identifier to ensure patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients receiving autologous HCT or peripheral stem cell transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients unable to cooperate with saliva collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Controls with a medical history or laboratory findings consistent with Sjogren's&#xD;
             syndrome, sarcoidosis, diabetes, or generally poor health, or controls taking&#xD;
             medications known to alter salivary protein profiles.&#xD;
