      Narrative medicine addresses the therapeutic benefits that derive from patients forming and&#xD;
      telling their personal stories. It offers an innovative model for improving health outcomes.&#xD;
      When a patient with cancer and marked suffering writes a narrative of what he or she is going&#xD;
      through, this process may reduce pain and improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we seek to evaluate the effectiveness of writing a narrative on pain intensity and&#xD;
      health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized single blind (evaluator) controlled trial. Patients with cancer pain&#xD;
      of intensity at least 5/10 with a minimum Karnofsky score of 50% will be randomized into&#xD;
      three groups: 1. Narrative group. Patients will write a story about their illness for at&#xD;
      least 20 minutes once a week for 3 weeks; 2. Writing-control group. Patients will fill a pain&#xD;
      diary once a week for three weeks; 3. Control group. Subjects will not write/fill anything.&#xD;
      Pain will be evaluated using the numerical scale before randomization and then weekly for 8&#xD;
      weeks. We will also evaluate how pain interferes with general activity, mood, work, relation&#xD;
      with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life using the Brief Pain Inventory. As secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, we will evaluate health related quality of life, with the treatment outcomes of&#xD;
      pain survey, which is a modification of the SF 36 (short form health survey), and a global&#xD;
      measure of well-being before randomization, and then at 4 and 8 weeks. We will also evaluate&#xD;
      the emotional disclosure of the narratives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use an intention to treat analysis. To analyze the effect of the treatment on pain&#xD;
      intensity, quality of life, and well-being, we will employ an analysis of repeated measures&#xD;
      using generalized estimating equations. We will include in the regression models the&#xD;
      treatment group, the emotional disclosure score, the time, and the interaction between&#xD;
      treatment group and time.&#xD;

      Background and Significance: To our knowledge there are no randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs) that evaluate the benefits of narrative medicine, but there has been research on the&#xD;
      effect of writing about traumatic events on health outcomes which resembles writing a&#xD;
      narrative. However, the populations included have been almost exclusively young healthy&#xD;
      students or workers, and the majority of studies have been performed by the same research&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: We will recruit patients with cancer who report a pain intensity of at&#xD;
      least 5/10. We will include patients who are still able to read and write. To evaluate this&#xD;
      physical ability, we will use the Karnofsky scale. The minimum score a patient needs to have&#xD;
      will be 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a randomized single blind (evaluator) controlled trial. Patients will&#xD;
      sign an informed consent. Patients will be randomized into three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Narrative group. Patients will write a story about their illness for at least 20 minutes&#xD;
      once a week for 3 weeks; 2. Writing-control group. Patients will fill a pain diary (requiring&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes) once a week for three weeks; 3. Control group. Subjects will not&#xD;
      write/fill out anything.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the narrative group will be asked to write about their illness and how it has&#xD;
      affected their lives. We will not guide the narrative in any other way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of office visits will be the same in the three groups; all patients will be seen&#xD;
      weekly up to a total of 8 weeks. In addition, the pain physician will fill a check list to&#xD;
      make sure that the presence and severity of symptoms important to patients, such as pain,&#xD;
      nausea, anorexia, constipation, and lack of sleep are addressed in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the content of the narratives. For the evaluation of the narratives, we will&#xD;
      use a Likert scale that goes from no emotional disclosure to very much emotional disclosure.&#xD;
      We will also count the number of cognitive words and the number of positive and negative&#xD;
      emotion words. The quantitative analysis of vocabulary will be performed with a text-analysis&#xD;
      computer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Reduction of pain intensity is the primary outcome. Pain intensity will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a registered nurse, who is not aware of the group allocation, before&#xD;
      randomization and then weekly for 8 weeks. To evaluate pain, we will use the numerical rating&#xD;
      scale in which 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Health related quality of life and the sense of well-being are secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. For the evaluation of health related quality of life, we will employ the treatment&#xD;
      outcomes of pain survey (TOPS) which is a modification of the SF-36 for patients with pain.&#xD;
      Patients will fill the questionnaire with the help of a registered nurse, who is not aware of&#xD;
      the group allocation, before randomization, and then at 4 weeks and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the evaluation of global well-being, we will use a Likert scale that goes from very bad&#xD;
      to excellent. Patients will be asked the global measure of well-being weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will evaluate how pain interferes with general activity, mood, work, relation&#xD;
      with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life using the interference factors of the Brief Pain&#xD;
      Inventory (BPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to Treatment: We will call all participants once a week to remind them about&#xD;
      writing the story, the pain dairy, or to come to the office visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: We will use an intention to treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the effect of the treatment on pain intensity, we will employ an analysis of&#xD;
      repeated measures using generalized estimating equations (GEE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of the exposure on quality of life, we will follow the same procedure&#xD;
      described above. The outcome of interest will be the score of each dimension evaluated in the&#xD;
      TOPS. As explanatory variables, we will include in the regression models the treatment group,&#xD;
      the time, and the interaction between treatment group and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the effect of the exposure on pain interference, we will employ GEE (similar to&#xD;
      the procedure we described above). The outcome of interest will be the BPI global score,&#xD;
      which is a sum of the scores of each one of the dimensions evaluated (general activity, mood,&#xD;
      work, relation with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life). If the BPI global score is&#xD;
      different among groups, we then proceed to evaluate each dimension separately to determine&#xD;
      which one is affected by narrative medicine. As explanatory variables, we will include in the&#xD;
      regression models the treatment group, the time, and the interaction between treatment group&#xD;
      and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of the exposure on the global measure of well-being, we will use a&#xD;
      similar approach described for pain intensity and quality of life. The outcome variable will&#xD;
      be the well-being score and the explanatory variables will be treatment group, the time, and&#xD;
      the interaction between treatment group and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of the quality of the narrative on each of the outcomes evaluated&#xD;
      (pain intensity, pain interference, quality of life, and well-being) we will include in the&#xD;
      corresponding regression model, in addition to the explanatory variables (treatment group,&#xD;
      the time, the interaction between treatment group and time), the emotional disclosure score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the subjectivity of the emotional disclosure evaluation, two physicians will perform&#xD;
      the evaluation (the pain physician and the psychiatrist). We will measure the agreement&#xD;
      between the two evaluators using the Kappa statistics for ordinal variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify and characterize those patients who best respond to narrative medicine, we will&#xD;
      include in all the regression models described above the gender, education level, age of the&#xD;
      subject, and the interaction between these variables and the treatment group. The evaluation&#xD;
      of the interactions will permit us to determine if the effect of narrative medicine depends&#xD;
      on the gender, education level, or age of the patients. In addition, we will use latent&#xD;
      growth curve analyses to explore the effect of these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the feasibility of narrative intervention, we will compare the number of&#xD;
      patients who adhere to the treatment in each group using a chi square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period: The exposure will have a duration of 3 weeks and then we will continue the&#xD;
      follow up for 5 more weeks, for a total of 8 weeks. We estimate that in 12 months we can&#xD;
      finish the recruitment and follow up of the patients and that we need 3 more months to&#xD;
      analyze the data and to prepare the manuscript for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: We have shown that a difference of 2 units in a scale from 0 to 10 is clinically&#xD;
      important to patients. To detect such difference between the groups with 80% power and an&#xD;
      alpha error of 0.05, assuming that the baseline pain intensity in our patients will be on&#xD;
      average 6 ± 4, we estimated the need for 63 patients per group. To allow for a 10% loss of&#xD;
      follow up, we will include a total of 70 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assure that patients with advanced cancer will be similarly distributed in the three&#xD;
      groups, we will use a stratified randomization. Our measure of disease severity will be the&#xD;
      Karnofsky scale. The cutoff will be 80%. A score of 80% or higher indicates that the patient&#xD;
      is able to work.&#xD;
