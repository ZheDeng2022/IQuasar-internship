      This study will determine the dose of sodium nitrite that can safely be used to prevent&#xD;
      constriction, or tightening, of the arteries. Narrowed arteries in the brain can cause&#xD;
      stroke. Animal studies show that nitrite injections improve blood flow and that injections&#xD;
      over long periods of time prevent damage to the arteries in the brain; however, there is no&#xD;
      information on the effects of prolonged nitrite infusion in humans. This study will establish&#xD;
      the safe dose and side effects of nitrite infusion in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened for high or low blood pressure, aspirin use, pregnancy, and blood&#xD;
      levels of nitrite and methemoglobin (a substance that temporarily and slightly lowers the&#xD;
      oxygen carried in the red blood cells). Pregnant women are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are admitted to the Clinical Center for 16 1/4 days, the first 2 days in the&#xD;
      hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). Upon admission they provide a medical history, have&#xD;
      physical and cardiovascular examinations, and blood tests. For the infusion procedure, a&#xD;
      catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the wrist or the crease of the&#xD;
      elbow to measure blood pressure, and catheters are placed in a vein in each arm for&#xD;
      administering the nitrite and withdrawing blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the morning of day 1, after initial blood pressure and heart rate measurements are taken&#xD;
      and a blood sample is drawn, a saline (salt water) infusion is started. Blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate are monitored every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then every hour for 6 hours, then&#xD;
      every 2 hours for 12 hours. Blood samples are collected every 4 hours for 24 hours. On day 2,&#xD;
      the sodium nitrite infusion begins. Blood pressure and methemoglobin are monitored every 10&#xD;
      minutes for the first 2 hours. If blood pressure remains stable, the frequency of&#xD;
      measurements is decreased to every 30 minutes for 4 hours, then every 1 hour for the next 6&#xD;
      hours, and then every 4 hours for 12 hours. If the pressure continues to remain stable,&#xD;
      monitoring continues every 8 hours for the rest of the study. Blood is drawn periodically&#xD;
      from the catheter to determine the amount of nitrite and methemoglobin in the body, with&#xD;
      decreasing frequency from several times during the first hour of the infusion to every 24&#xD;
      hours. After the first 24 to 48 hours of the nitrite infusion, participants are transferred&#xD;
      from the ICU to a general nursing unit fo...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is beneficial in treatment of many animal models of diseases like heart and&#xD;
      brain ischemia, reperfusion injury, and delayed cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage. It also has been shown to open blood-brain barrier facilitating transfer of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents, dilate constricted pulmonary arteries, and inhibit apoptosis, as&#xD;
      well as modulate angiogenesis. Until recently, all these biological effects were attributed&#xD;
      to the regional synthesis of nitric oxide by the endothelium and its local influence of&#xD;
      vascular tone. However, &quot;NO bioactivity&quot; may be transported in blood and have biological&#xD;
      effects at a distance from the site of entry into the circulation. These effects of NO are&#xD;
      mediated by intravascular NO-stores. Candidates are protein and heme-bound NO species (RXNO)&#xD;
      in plasma or erythrocytes and the oxidative NO-metabolite nitrite. Cumulating evidence&#xD;
      suggests that nitrite may serve as a major intravascular storage pool for NO. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that (1) regional, intra-arterial infusion of nitrite elicits a downstream&#xD;
      vasodilator response in humans and (2) intravenous long-lasting administration prevents&#xD;
      development of delayed cerebral vasospasm in a primate model of subarachnoid hemorrhage&#xD;
      (SAH). These studies suggest a potential new therapeutic approach to many diseases. Despite&#xD;
      extensive data documenting the pharmacokinetics and safety of the bolus and short&#xD;
      intravascular infusions of nitrite, there are no human data evaluating safety and toxicity of&#xD;
      prolonged delivery of nitrite, which would be required for treatment of vascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the following objectives: (1) to determine the safety and (2) toxicity of a&#xD;
      48-hour and 14-day intravenous infusion of nitrite. The study should also help to elucidate&#xD;
      the mechanism(s) through which nitrite ions contribute to vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include sixteen 48-hour infusion healthy volunteers (out of 40&#xD;
      screened volunteers) of both genders, age 21-60, who will have a continuous intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of sodium nitrite (the source of the drug will be determined by a CRADA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I toxicity study of intermediate (48-hour) intravenous infusion of sodium&#xD;
      nitrite in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen healthy volunteers of both genders, age 21-60, will have a 48-hour continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite during which the subjects' clinical condition, blood&#xD;
      levels of nitrite/methemoglobin, hematology, blood chemistry, and pressure will be&#xD;
      meticulously monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first subject will receive the sodium nitrite infusion at 12 mg/48 hours. This dose,&#xD;
      according to our knowledge from the former studies and detailed analysis of pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of sodium nitrite, will result in blood levels of sodium nitrite below 80 nmol/L, levels that&#xD;
      are significantly below levels reported as normal (0.5 micromol/L to 1 micromol/L). Thus, we&#xD;
      will use the modified accelerated titration design for Phase I Clinical studies. In the&#xD;
      accelerated design the initial patient will start with the dose 1 nmol/min/kg/48hr, i.e. 12&#xD;
      mg total over 48 hours for a person weighting 60 kg. Cohorts of one new subject per dose&#xD;
      level and double dose steps will be used during the initial accelerated stage. When the first&#xD;
      instance of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed at any dose level, the next lower dose&#xD;
      level cohort will be expanded to three patients and revert to the use of conventional&#xD;
      modified Fibonacci escalation/de-escalation. If no DLT is observed at level 10, the cohort&#xD;
      will be expanded to a total of three and de-escalated as appropriate. If no more than one&#xD;
      subject among three patients experience DLT at this dose, level 10 will be considered to be&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this 48-hour infusion phase 1 trial will be submitted to FDA before initiation&#xD;
      of a 14-day clinical study.&#xD;
