      This study will compare the side effects of two treatments for diabetic macular edema, in&#xD;
      which blood vessels in the retina (tissue that lines the back of the eye) become leaky and&#xD;
      the retina and macula (the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision)&#xD;
      swell, causing vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with diabetes mellitus and macular edema in one or both&#xD;
      eyes may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure HbA1c, a measure of the patient's diabetes control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity and eye pressure, and to examine pupils, lens,&#xD;
           retina and eye movements. The pupils are dilated with drops for this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye photography to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in&#xD;
           the future. Photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that flashes a&#xD;
           bright light into the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinograms (ERG) to measure electrical responses generated in the retina.&#xD;
           Wearing eye patches, the patient sits in a dark room for 30 minutes. Then, electrodes&#xD;
           are taped to the forehead and an earlobe. The eye patches are removed, the surface of&#xD;
           the eye is numbed with eye drops, and contact lenses are placed on the eyes. The patient&#xD;
           looks inside a white globe that emits a series of light flashes for about 20 minutes.&#xD;
           The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina when the light&#xD;
           flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness. The eye is examined with a&#xD;
           machine that produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These measurements are&#xD;
           repeated during the study to determine whether retinal thickening is improving,&#xD;
           worsening, or staying the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with macular edema in both eyes receive laser therapy in one eye and triamcinolone&#xD;
      injections in the other. Patients with just one affected eye are randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either laser or triamcinolone treatment. Those who receive only laser therapy may later&#xD;
      receive triamcinolone injections in the second eye if it, too, develops macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the laser treatment, the eye surface is numbed with drops and a contact lens is placed on&#xD;
      the eye during the laser beam application. Before the treatment, patients may have&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography, in which pictures of the retina are taken using a yellow dye. The&#xD;
      dye is injected into a vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eye. The camera flashes a&#xD;
      blue light in the eye and takes pictures that show the amount of dye leakage into the retina.&#xD;
      This helps guide the laser treatment. Patients return for follow-up visits every 4 months for&#xD;
      3 years. If the macular edema is gone, no additional treatment is given and patients are&#xD;
      followed as often as every 2 months. If the edema does return, additional treatments may be&#xD;
      done at subsequent visits. Patients whose vision worsens considerably at the end of 1 year&#xD;
      may be treated with a steroid injection, unless the other eye has also been treated with&#xD;
      triamcinolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the triamcinolone injections, numbing drops, antibiotic drops, and drops to dilate the&#xD;
      pupil, and possibly and anesthetic injection, are put in the eye before the medicine is&#xD;
      injected into the vitreous (jelly-like substance inside the eye). Then, the patient lies on&#xD;
      his or her back for 30 minutes before being discharged home. Patients return for follow-up&#xD;
      visits 4 days and 4 weeks after the injection, and then every 4 months for 3 years. Patients&#xD;
      whose edema resolves are followed as often as every 2 months. Those whose edema returns have&#xD;
      additional injections at the 4-month visits. Patients whose condition does not improve after&#xD;
      1 year or whose vision worsens may undergo laser treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of visual impairment in the United States. Diabetic&#xD;
      Macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of diabetic retinopathy that produces loss of central&#xD;
      vision. Data from the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) estimate&#xD;
      that after 15 years of known diabetes, the prevalence of diabetic macular edema is&#xD;
      approximately 20% in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), 25% in patients with type 2&#xD;
      DM who are taking insulin, and 14% in patients with type 2 DM who do not take insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a review of three early studies concerning the natural history of diabetic macular edema,&#xD;
      Ferris and Patz found that 53% of 135 eyes with diabetic macular edema, presumably all&#xD;
      involving the center of the macula, lost two or more lines of visual acuity over a two year&#xD;
      period. In the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), 33% of 221 untreated eyes&#xD;
      available for follow-up at the 3-year visit, all with edema involving the center of the&#xD;
      macula at baseline, had experienced a 15 or more letter decrease in visual acuity score&#xD;
      (equivalent to a doubling of the visual angle, e.g., 20/25 to 20/50, and termed moderate&#xD;
      visual loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of an unsatisfactory outcome following laser photocoagulation in some eyes with&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema has prompted interest in other treatment modalities. One such&#xD;
      treatment is pars plana vitrectomy. These studies suggest that vitreomacular traction, or the&#xD;
      vitreous itself, may play a role in increased retinal vascular permeability. Removal of the&#xD;
      vitreous or relief of mechanical traction with vitrectomy and membrane stripping may be&#xD;
      followed by substantial resolution of macular edema and corresponding improvement in visual&#xD;
      acuity. However, this treatment may be applicable only to a specific subset of eyes with&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema. It also requires a complex surgical intervention with its inherent&#xD;
      risks, recovery time, and expense. Other treatment modalities such as pharmacologic therapy&#xD;
      with oral protein kinase C inhibitors and antibodies targeted at vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) are under investigation. The use of intravitreal corticosteroids is another&#xD;
      treatment modality that has generated recent interest.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (Subject-Level Inclusion Criteria:)&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria (1-6) must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is&#xD;
             present:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of&#xD;
                  diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least one eye meets the study eye criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If only one eye eligible, fellow eye meets criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient understands that (1) if both eyes are eligible at the time of randomization,&#xD;
             one eye will receive intravitreal triamcinolone ancetonide and one eye will receive&#xD;
             laser, and (2) if only one eye is eligible at the time of randomization and the fellow&#xD;
             eye develops DME later, then the fellow eye will not receive intravitreal&#xD;
             triamcinolone ancetonide if the study eye received intravitreal triamcinolone&#xD;
             ancetonide (however, if the study eye was assigned to the laser group, then the fellow&#xD;
             eye may be treated with the 4mg dose of the study intravitreal triamcinolone&#xD;
             ancetonide formulation, provided the eye assigned to laser has not received an&#xD;
             intravitreal injection; such an eye will not be a study eye but since it is receiving&#xD;
             study drug, it will be followed for adverse effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
             (Subject-Level Exclusion Criteria:)&#xD;
&#xD;
             A patient is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria (7-13) are&#xD;
             present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and glycemic&#xD;
             control).&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Patients in poor gylcemic control who, within the last 4 months, initiated intensive&#xD;
             insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do so in the next 4&#xD;
             months should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of study entry that involved&#xD;
             treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at the time of study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known allergy to any corticosteroid or any component of the delivery vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of systemic (e.g., oral, IV, IM, epidural, bursal) corticosteroids within 4&#xD;
             months prior to randomization or topical, rectal,or inhaled corticosteroids in current&#xD;
             use more than 2 times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not&#xD;
             covered by another clinical center during the 3 years of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Blood pressure greater than 180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110).&#xD;
&#xD;
             - If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, patient&#xD;
             can become eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (Study Eye Inclusion Criteria:)&#xD;
&#xD;
             The patient must have at least one eye meeting all of the inclusion criteria (a-d) and&#xD;
             none of the exclusion criteria (e-x) listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A patient may have two study eyes only if both are eligible at the time of&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The eligibility criteria for a study eye are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Best corrected E-ETDRS visual acuity score of greater than or equal to 24 letters&#xD;
                  (i.e., 20/320 or better) and less than or equal to 68 letters (i.e., worse than&#xD;
                  20/40).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  - There will be an enrollment limit of approximately 10% of eyes with visual&#xD;
                  acuity of 64 to 68 letters.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema based on clinical exam&#xD;
                  involving the center of the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Mean retinal thickness on two OCT measurements greater than or equal to 250&#xD;
                  microns in the central subfield.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and patient cooperation sufficient for&#xD;
                  adequate fundus photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  (Study Eye Exclusion Criteria:)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular&#xD;
                  edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  - An eye should not be considered eligible: (1) if the macular edema is&#xD;
                  considered to be related to cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or OCT&#xD;
                  suggests that vitreoretinal interface disease (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or&#xD;
                  epiretinal membrane) is the primary cause of the macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
                  visual acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal&#xD;
                  atrophy, pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hare exudates, nonretinal&#xD;
                  condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course&#xD;
                  of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,&#xD;
                  neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be&#xD;
                  decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing&#xD;
                  acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. History of prior treatment with intravitreal corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. History of peribulbar steroid injection within 6 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. History of focal/grid macular photocoagulation within 15 weeks (3.5 months) prior&#xD;
                  to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Patients are not required to have had prior macular photocoagulation&#xD;
                       to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: If prior macular photocoagulation has been performed, the investigator&#xD;
                       should believe that the patient may possibly benefit from additional&#xD;
                       photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within 4 months prior to&#xD;
                  randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Anticipated need for PRP in the 4 months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. History of prior pars plana vitrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle,&#xD;
                  any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 6 months or anticipated within the&#xD;
                  next 6 months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
              16. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
              17. Intraocular pressure greater than or equal to 25 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
              18. History of open-angle glaucoma (either primary open-angle glaucoma or other cause&#xD;
                  of open-angle glaucoma; note: angle-closure glaucoma is not an exclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  A history of ocular hypertension is not an exclusion as long as (1)&#xD;
                       intraocular pressure is less than 25 mmHg, (2) the patient is using no more&#xD;
                       than one topical glaucoma medication, (3) the most recent visual field,&#xD;
                       performed within the last 12 months, is normal (if abnormalities are present&#xD;
                       on the visual field they must be attributable to the patient's diabetic&#xD;
                       retinopathy), and (4) the optic disc does not appear glaucomatous.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: if the intraocular pressure is 22 to less than 25 mmHg, then the above&#xD;
                       criteria for ocular hypertension eligibility must be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
              19. History of steroid-induced intraocular pressure elevation that required&#xD;
                  IOP-lowering treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
              20. History of prior herpetic ocular infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
              21. Exam evidence of ocular toxoplasmosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
              22. Aphakia.&#xD;
&#xD;
              23. Exam evidence of pseudoexfoliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
              24. Exam evidence of external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion,&#xD;
                  or significant blepharitis.&#xD;

               2. No prior treatment with intravitreal corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Intraocular pressure less than 25 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. No history of open-angle glaucoma (either primary open -angle glaucoma or other&#xD;
                  cause of open-angle glaucoma; note: angle-closure glaucoma is not an exclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  A history of ocular hypertension is not an exclusion as long as (1)&#xD;
                       intraocular pressure is less than 25 mmHg, (2) the patient is using no more&#xD;
                       than one topical glaucoma medication, (3) the most recent visual field,&#xD;
                       performed within the last 12 months, is normal (if abnormalities are present&#xD;
                       on the visual field they must be attributable to the patient's diabetic&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Note: if the intraocular pressure is 22 to less than 25 mmHg, then the above&#xD;
                       criteria for ocular hypertension eligibility must be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. No history of steroid-induced intraocular pressure elevation that required&#xD;
