      This study will evaluate the effects of the experimental drug talampanel on dyskinesias&#xD;
      (involuntary movements) that develop in patients with Parkinson's disease as a result of&#xD;
      long-term treatment with levodopa (Sinemet). The drug will be tested alone and in combination&#xD;
      with amantadine-a drug commonly used to alleviate dyskinesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 21 and 80 years of age with Parkinson's disease and dyskinesias may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and baseline evaluation. Participants are evaluated with a medical history,&#xD;
      physical and neurologic examinations, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG) and&#xD;
      pregnancy test, if applicable. A chest x-ray and MRI or CT scan of the brain are done if&#xD;
      needed. Patients stop taking all antiparkinsonian medications for one month (2 months if&#xD;
      taking Selegiline) before the study begins and throughout its duration, except for certain&#xD;
      medicines allowed, including Sinemet, Mirapex and Requip. Amantadine can be taken up to 1&#xD;
      week before beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-finding phase. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days for a&#xD;
      levodopa &quot;dose-finding&quot; procedure. For this test, patients stop taking Sinemet and instead&#xD;
      have it infused through a vein. During the infusions, the drug dose is increased slowly until&#xD;
      parkinsonian symptoms improve or unacceptable side effects occur or the maximum study dose is&#xD;
      reached. Symptoms are monitored frequently. At given times during the infusion, saline is&#xD;
      given instead of Sinemet. The infusions usually begin in the early morning and continue until&#xD;
      evening. Patients resume taking Sinemet between infusions. (Patients who have had dosing&#xD;
      infusions in the last 3 months do not have to undergo this phase of the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the dose-finding phase, patients are randomly assigned to take placebo (a &quot;sugar pill&quot;)&#xD;
      or talampanel. Those taking talampanel also receive amantadine at their usual dosages. At&#xD;
      some point in the study, amantadine is replaced with placebo. Patients in the talampanel&#xD;
      group also receive placebo for portions of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active study phase. At study weeks 1, 5 and 7, patients are admitted to the Clinical Center&#xD;
      overnight for a levodopa infusion with talampanel or placebo. The day before the infusion,&#xD;
      patients have a brief physical examination, blood and urine tests, an EKG, and a review of&#xD;
      symptoms or changes in their condition. The next day, they receive an infusion of levodopa at&#xD;
      the dose determined in the dose-finding phase. Then they take a pill containing either&#xD;
      talampanel or placebo. Their parkinsonian symptoms and dyskinesias are evaluated and&#xD;
      videotaped every 30 minutes for about 6 hours. Blood is drawn and an EKG is obtained. At the&#xD;
      end of the infusions and ratings, patients resume their regular Parkinson's medications and&#xD;
      are given a new supply of study medications to take home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At weeks 2, 3, 4 and 6, patients come to the Clinical Center for a review of drug side&#xD;
      effects. They have blood drawn and receive a new supply of study medications that last until&#xD;
      the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up. Two weeks after the study ends, patients are contacted by phone for a review of&#xD;
      side effects or they return to the clinic for an evaluation.&#xD;

      Objective: to evaluate the acute effects of talampanel, a novel antagonist of AMPA type&#xD;
      glutamate receptors, on the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor&#xD;
      response complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease and dopaminergic&#xD;
      therapy related motor complications, between the age of 21 and 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: randomized, controlled, proof-of-principle pilot study lasting approximately 7&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcome Parameters: the pharmacokinetic characteristics of orally administered&#xD;
      talampanel will be measured by means of plasma drug assays, its therapeutic efficacy will be&#xD;
      evaluated using validated motor function scales, and safety will be monitored by means of&#xD;
      frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;
