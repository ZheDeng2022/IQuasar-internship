      This study will determine the safety and side effects of an experimental adenoviral vector&#xD;
      vaccine given to patients who previously received a different HIV vaccine&#xD;
      (VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP) in a prior NIAID study. The study will also monitor participants for&#xD;
      the social impact of being in an HIV vaccine study (e.g., problems with insurance, health&#xD;
      care, friends, family, employment, housing, and so forth). The study vaccine is made using an&#xD;
      adenovirus (a common virus that causes upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold,&#xD;
      eye infection, urine infection or diarrhea) that has been modified to contain DNA that codes&#xD;
      for three HIV proteins. The modified virus cannot reproduce in the body and cannot cause HIV&#xD;
      disease or adenoviral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers who previously received three injections of the VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP under&#xD;
      the NIAID study VRC 007 (protocol 04-I-0254) may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive one injection of the adenoviral vector vaccine. It is given the day they&#xD;
      enroll in the study, as a single injection in an upper arm muscle. Also on that day they have&#xD;
      a brief physical examination, medical history, blood and urine tests, pregnancy test for&#xD;
      women, and counseling, as needed, about HIV and pregnancy avoidance. Subjects are observed&#xD;
      for side effects for at least 30 minutes after the vaccination and are required to telephone&#xD;
      the clinic staff 1 to 2 days after the injection for follow-up. In addition, they are given a&#xD;
      diary card to take home, on which they record their temperature and any symptoms daily for 5&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects return to the clinic for 5 follow-up visits at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 after the&#xD;
      injection. At each visit they are checked for health changes or problems since the last&#xD;
      visit, asked how they are feeling and what medications they are taking. They have blood drawn&#xD;
      at every visit and urine samples collected at most visits. They are tested for HIV three or&#xD;
      more times and are questioned about their sexual behavior and drug use. They also complete a&#xD;
      &quot;social impact&quot; questionnaire at the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are asked to undergo apheresis at the week 4 visit. This procedure allows collection&#xD;
      of a larger number of white blood cells than can be obtained by a simple blood draw. The&#xD;
      white cells are studied to see how the immune system responds to the study vaccine. For&#xD;
      apheresis, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine that&#xD;
      separates the components. The white blood cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is&#xD;
      returned to the body through the same needle. Subjects who do not undergo apheresis have&#xD;
      about 1/3 cup of blood sample drawn using a needle.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a Phase I open-label study to examine safety, tolerability and immune&#xD;
      response of a multiclade HIV adenoviral vector vaccine as a booster vaccination in uninfected&#xD;
      adults. The hypothesis is that this vaccine will be safe as a booster vaccine and elicit&#xD;
      immune responses to HIV. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      a VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP booster vaccination in uninfected subjects who previously received 3&#xD;
      injections of VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP. The secondary objectives include immunogenicity&#xD;
      evaluations, adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) antibody titers, and social impacts. Exploratory&#xD;
      evaluations include epitope mapping and other immunogenicity evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd) is a recombinant product composed of 4&#xD;
      adenoviral vectors (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade&#xD;
      B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers who previously received three injections of&#xD;
      VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP at a dosage of 4 mg in the VRC 007 study (04-I-0254). The subjects in&#xD;
      these groups were between 20 and 36 years old at time of enrollment in VRC 007; those who&#xD;
      participate in VRC 010 will be no more than 36 weeks older at the time of enrollment into VRC&#xD;
      010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Up to fourteen volunteers will receive one 1 mL injection of the study agent at a&#xD;
      dosage of 1010 particle units (PU) intramuscularly (IM) in a deltoid muscle. Safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity will be evaluated by follow-up visits over the subsequent 24 weeks. The&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sample for immunogenicity studies collected at Week&#xD;
      4 after vaccination will be obtained by apheresis if the subject is willing and eligible for&#xD;
      apheresis and an apheresis appointment can be conveniently scheduled in the interval&#xD;
      specified; otherwise PBMCs will be obtained from 80 mL blood collected by phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Subjects will be evaluated at 6 or more clinical visits for 24 weeks after&#xD;
      the study injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the vaccine administered at a dose of&#xD;
      10(10) PU by IM injection. Secondary endpoints are immunogenicity as indicated by&#xD;
      HIV-specific antibody through Week 4, cellular immune responses through Week 6, Ad5 antibody&#xD;
      titer at Week 0 and Week 4 and social impact at Week 24. Exploratory analyses include&#xD;
      immunogenicity at Weeks 12 and 24, Ad5 antibody titer at Week 24 and epitope mapping of the&#xD;
      CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses at Week 4.&#xD;
