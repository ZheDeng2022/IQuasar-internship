      The purpose of the study is to determine whether exercise has further beneficial effects on&#xD;
      improving cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol level or&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, when added to the standard program of health check followed by life style&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;

      Multiple risk factors contribute to the causation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Past studies indicate that exercise exerts its protective effects on the disease through&#xD;
      actions on multiple cardiovascular risk factors simultaneously; however, the studies focused&#xD;
      on the effect of exercise predominantly on subjects with a single risk factor. Does exercise&#xD;
      differentially act on various risk factors in the same subject? Do subjects with multiple&#xD;
      risk factors respond differently to exercise than those predominantly with a single risk&#xD;
      factor do? To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      exercise on subjects with multiple risk factors. Exercise in fitness clubs has uniquely&#xD;
      fitting features for middle to older aged people with multiple risk factors: access is&#xD;
      relatively easy because there are usually many clubs throughout the city; the control of&#xD;
      exercise intensity or heart rate is made precise, rendering exercise safer when treadmills or&#xD;
      bicycles are used as a mainstay of aerobic exercise as in this study; and cardiac arrest, the&#xD;
      most feared complication of exercise, will be most likely to be properly handled since in&#xD;
      recent years the installment of automated external defibrillators has been increasingly&#xD;
      popular in many clubs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Exercise vs. standard care comparison is to be made only for the first 6-month&#xD;
      period. The second 6-month period is for follow-up and other purposes.&#xD;
