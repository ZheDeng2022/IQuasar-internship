  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of combining a laser treatment called&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy, or PDT, with injections into the eye of the steroid triamcinolone&#xD;
      acetonide for treating age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The macula is the part of the&#xD;
      retina in the back of the eye that determines central or best vision. AMD can severely impair&#xD;
      central vision, affecting a person's ability to read, drive, and carry out daily activities.&#xD;
      This vision loss is caused by the formation of abnormal blood vessels behind the retina that&#xD;
      leak blood under the macula. PTD stops the growth of these blood vessels and slows the rate&#xD;
      of vision loss; however, it has only a temporary effect and does not work in all patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it may actually cause some swelling and re-growth of blood vessels.&#xD;
      Triamcinolone acetonide can help lessen swelling and scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 50 years of age and older with AMD may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, medical evaluation, and eye examinations (see below).&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) PDT plus 1 mg TAC-PF;&#xD;
      2) PDT plus 4 mg TAC-PF; or 3) PDT plus sham injection (a syringe with no needle is pressed&#xD;
      against the eye). Treatments are given the day the patient enrolls in the study and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for 2 years, as long as the therapy is thought beneficial. Patients who must&#xD;
      discontinue TAC-PF injections may still be treated with PDT if medically necessary. In&#xD;
      addition to treatment, patients undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination: Visual acuity and eye pressure are measured, and the lens, retina,&#xD;
           pupils and eye movements are examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus photography: Photographs of the back of the eye are taken using a special camera&#xD;
           with a bright flash.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lens photography: Photographs of the lens are taken to look for development of&#xD;
           cataracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography: Pictures of the retina are taken to look for abnormal blood&#xD;
           vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in&#xD;
           the eyes. The retina is photographed using a camera that flashes a blue light into the&#xD;
           eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina,&#xD;
           indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography: This test uses light to produce a 2-dimensional&#xD;
           cross-sectional picture of the retina. The patient looks into a machine called an&#xD;
           optical coherence tomograph at a pattern of flashing and rotating red and green lights,&#xD;
           first with one eye and then the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PDT: A needle is placed in an arm vein and a drug called verteporfin (VisudyneÂ®&#xD;
           (Registered Trademark)) is infused into the vein over 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, the&#xD;
           eye is anesthetized with numbing drops. A special contact lens is then placed on the eye&#xD;
           and the laser beam is directed to the eye for 83 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAC-PF or injections (for those in the TAC-PF treatment groups): Numbing and anesthetic&#xD;
           drops are placed on the surface of the eye before injection of TAC-PF. Another&#xD;
           anesthetic is then applied to the lower part of the eye with a cotton swab. After a few&#xD;
           minutes, TAC-PF is injected into the vitreous (jelly-like substance inside the eye).&#xD;
           Patients receiving sham injections undergo the identical procedure, except a syringe&#xD;
           with no needle is pressed against the eye to seem like a real injection. All patients&#xD;
           receive antibiotic drops to put in their eye for 2 days after each treatment. Patients&#xD;
           return to the clinic anytime from 2 to 7 days after each treatment for a check of&#xD;
           vision, eye pressure, and treatment side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are seen in the clinic for additional checks at 4 weeks and 4 months after the first&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in&#xD;
      persons over the age of 50. The major cause of vision loss in this disease is due to the&#xD;
      development of choroidal neovascularization. Several clinical trials have shown that eyes&#xD;
      with neovascularization portending 4 disc areas or less or all lesions with predominately&#xD;
      classic composition (lesions having at least 50% of vessels which can be readily demarcated&#xD;
      with fluorescein angiography) can benefit from treatment with photodynamic therapy&#xD;
      (verteporfin - PDT). However, this treatment only results in a reduction in the number of&#xD;
      participants who suffer moderate and severe vision loss. Few participants demonstrate an&#xD;
      improvement in visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathologic studies have demonstrated the presence of an inflammatory response in the&#xD;
      retina and choroid of participants with choroidal neovascularization as well as in eyes&#xD;
      receiving verteporfin - PDT. Therefore, the use of triamcinolone acetonide, which possesses&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory as well as anti-angiogenic properties, may be beneficial in participants&#xD;
      with neovascular AMD undergoing verteporfin - PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be organized as a controlled, participant masked, randomized, multi-center&#xD;
      Phase II/III study that will investigate the efficacy of a preservative - free intravitreal&#xD;
      formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC-PF) in AMD participants undergoing verteporfin -&#xD;
      PDT. Unlike studies that use steroids containing benzyl alcohol, this study will evaluate&#xD;
      preservative-free steroids. Three hundred participants with neovascular AMD, undergoing&#xD;
      verteporfin - PDT, will be randomly assigned to receive either a sham intravitreal injection,&#xD;
      a 1 mg intravitreal injection of TAC-PF, or a 4 mg intravitreal injection of TAC-PF.&#xD;
      Depending on a participant's response, treatments as randomized, may be repeated at 3-month&#xD;
      intervals. Participants will complete a maximum of 2 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of participants who experience a&#xD;
      moderate vision loss defined as a drop of greater than or equal to 15 letters in&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity from baseline verteporfin - PDT treatment to month 12. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include assessments of the safety of the adjunct therapy; additional vision&#xD;
      changes observed between baseline, month 3, month 12, and month 24; lesion changes observed&#xD;
      between baseline, month 3, month 12 and month 24; and changes observed in lens opacities&#xD;
      between baseline, month 12, and month 24.&#xD;

                  discrete or bright hyperfluorescence in the early transit phase of the angiogram.&#xD;

                  visual angle if Snellen acuities are available from either an outside referral&#xD;
                  center or within the participating center (e.g., 20/80 to 20/160 - a doubling of&#xD;
                  the visual angle is required because of the measurement variability of Snellen&#xD;
                  acuities)).&#xD;
