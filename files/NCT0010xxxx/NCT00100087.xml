      The study will investigate the safety and feasibility of using the TheraSight(TM)&#xD;
      Brachytherapy System for treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized study of three doses of radiation (assigned 1:1:1)&#xD;
      delivered by the TheraSight(TM) Brachytherapy System in participants with choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization (CNV) secondary to wet (exudative) AMD. Each participant receives a single&#xD;
      dose of radiation delivered by one-time only brachytherapy. Participants are followed for&#xD;
      three years after the radiation treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 50 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active primary or recurrent subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD with minimally classic or&#xD;
             occult lesion, where an active lesion is defined as one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) An increase &gt; 10% in lesion size (greatest linear dimension) on screening&#xD;
             fluorescein angiography compared to previous fluorescein angiography no more than 180&#xD;
             days preceding screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  b) Subretinal hemorrhage associated with CNV within 90 days of screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  c) Visual acuity loss &gt; 1 Snellen line in screening visual acuity compared to&#xD;
                  previous visual acuity no more than 180 days preceding screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesion &lt; 6 mm greatest linear dimension (GLD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Submacular blood must comprise less than 75% of the total lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subretinal fibrosis must comprise less than 25% of the total lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study eye best-corrected vision of 20/100 or poorer measured on an ETDRS chart (&lt; 48&#xD;
             letters correct)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fellow eye best-corrected vision that is at least one line better on an ETDRS chart&#xD;
             than the best-corrected vision of the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HbA1c &lt; 6%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Read and signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior AMD therapy treatment, including but not limited to laser and photodynamic&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or planned participation in the next 180 days in other experimental trials&#xD;
             involving treatment of neovascular AMD in the study eye, ocular devices, or trials&#xD;
             involving treatment for ocular conditions other than AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior ophthalmic surgery for the study eye other than cataract extraction and/or&#xD;
             capsulotomy. A minimum interval of 180 days must elapse between cataract extraction or&#xD;
             capsulotomy and study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Likely need for cataract surgery in study eye during the 180 days following&#xD;
             TheraSight(TM) System treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of other eye diseases that could compromise visual acuity in the study eye or&#xD;
             that, in the clinical judgment of the evaluating study ophthalmologist, might create&#xD;
             special risk for the study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNV due to other causes such as ocular histoplasmosis or pathologic myopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Endstage fibrotic disciform lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes requiring diet modification, or medication, or insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current history of malignancy (except participants having basal cell carcinoma that&#xD;
             was treated successfully, or other malignancy operated on or treated and in remission&#xD;
             for five years prior to inclusion in the trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertensive retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event within the last year; examples include&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to complete follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to fluorescein dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation to the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy at time of surgical procedure.&#xD;
