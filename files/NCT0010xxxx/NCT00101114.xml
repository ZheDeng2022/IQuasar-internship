  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving sorafenib with interferon alfa works in&#xD;
      treating patients with metastatic or unresectable kidney cancer. Sorafenib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Interferon alfa&#xD;
      may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of kidney cancer. Sorafenib&#xD;
      may help interferon alfa work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response (confirmed complete and partial responses) of patients with advanced&#xD;
      renal cell cancer treated with the combination of BAY-43-9006 and interferon alfa-2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the probability of treatment failure at 6 months and the median overall survival&#xD;
      of this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen. III. To&#xD;
      investigate in a preliminary manner the association of tumor response with measures of&#xD;
      increased signaling through the Ras-Raf pathway (p-MAPK, p-JNK, p-p38, and p-AKT), with VHL&#xD;
      gene status, and whether changes in levels of IL-6 and tumor markers of hypoxia including&#xD;
      PAI-1, VEGF, and osteopontin correspond with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28 and interferon alfa subcutaneously&#xD;
      on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of brain metastases or who currently have treated to untreated&#xD;
             brain metastases are not eligible; patients with clinical suspicion of brain&#xD;
             metastases must have a brain CT or MRI negative for metastatic disease obtained within&#xD;
             56 days prior to registration and must not have any new symptoms since radiographic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any ongoing requirement for systemic corticosteroid therapy is not permitted; topical&#xD;
             and/or inhaled steroids are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be on drugs known to be potent inhibitors of the CYP 3A4 enzyme as&#xD;
             BAY 43-9006 is at least partially metabolized by this enzyme in the liver; the&#xD;
             possible effect that inhibitors of this enzyme may have on the metabolism of BAY&#xD;
             43-9006 is unknown; therefore, patients who are on the following drugs are not&#xD;
             eligible (patients should not take these drugs while receiving protocol treatment):&#xD;
             ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, products containing grapefruit juice,&#xD;

             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because raf kinase inhibitor agents&#xD;
             as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;

             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated&#xD;
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any&#xD;
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If Day 28, 42, or 56 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the&#xD;
