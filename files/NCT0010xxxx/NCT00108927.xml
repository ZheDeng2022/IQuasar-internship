      The goal of our research program is to successfully translate empirical knowledge regarding&#xD;
      diabetes treatment and management into sustainable clinical practice. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that implementation of a multicomponent intervention will result in meaningful improvement in&#xD;
      clinical performance measures at the clinic that include average A1c (Hemoglobin A1c),&#xD;
      average systolic blood pressure, and national clinical performance measures at a reasonable&#xD;
      cost to the health system.&#xD;

      The focus of the study is on the primary care environment, where the majority of patients&#xD;
      with diabetes seek on-going health care. The proposed group-randomized and controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial-targeted at 24 primary care clinics-evaluates the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      TRANSLATE intervention, a multifaceted diabetes intervention program promoting better&#xD;
      comprehensive diabetes management. The intervention begins by evaluating the organizational&#xD;
      structures of primary care offices and identifying existing barriers in these small complex&#xD;
      systems. A set of nine well-developed intervention components-selected from among some of the&#xD;
      most successful strategies in the literature for altering clinical outcomes-are then&#xD;
      introduced to correct existing deficiencies at each clinic. The TRANSLATE components function&#xD;
      as an interdependent system, providing substantial support to both the provider and patient.&#xD;
      Key features include the targeting of high-risk patients, a patient reminder system for&#xD;
      routine visits, both passive and patient-specific physician reminders, a disease-specific&#xD;
      networked reporting system, and physician education. Implementation is facilitated by a local&#xD;
      diabetes intervention team assisted by a site coordinator and a local physician champion.&#xD;
      Notably, the model does not centralize care, but rather promotes dissemination of care&#xD;
      delivery improvements by promoting infrastructure changes at the primary care clinic where&#xD;
      most care is delivered. Quality improvement methods are employed to optimize implementation&#xD;
      in each unique clinic setting. Upper level administrative personnel are integrated into the&#xD;
      regular review of implementation measures and resource use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that implementation of the TRANSLATE intervention will result in&#xD;
      meaningful improvement in physiologic outcome measures and important disease process&#xD;
      measures-at a reasonable cost-within primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project are to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      TRANSLATE program by comparing intervention and control clinics on the following three&#xD;
      clinical and economic outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the change in A1c and systolic blood pressure values among all patients with diagnosed&#xD;
           diabetes mellitus in participating primary care clinics over 12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the quality of diabetes care delivery as measured by the distribution and prevalence of&#xD;
           appropriate A1c, microalbumin, low density lipoprotein measurements, and foot exams over&#xD;
           12 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the economic impact on the health care delivery system as measured by the short- and&#xD;
           long-term cost from the perspective of the health care system.&#xD;
