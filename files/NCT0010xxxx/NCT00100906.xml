      RATIONALE: Tretinoin may help cells that are involved in the body's immune response to work&#xD;
      better. Interleukin-2 may stimulate the white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. Giving&#xD;
      tretinoin together with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving three different doses of&#xD;
      tretinoin together with interleukin-2 works in treating patients with stage IV kidney cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the ratio of dendritic cells (DC) to circulating immature cells (ImC) before&#xD;
           and after treatment with 3 different doses of tretinoin in patients with stage IV renal&#xD;
           cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess in vitro immune response assays to tetanus toxoid and influenza virus peptide&#xD;
           before and after treatment with tretinoin and interleukin-2 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency of treatment-related side effects in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine clinical objective response and progression-free survival of patients treated&#xD;
           with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate DC:ImC ratio with clinical objective response in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate the extent of change of the DC:ImC ratio with tretinoin dose and tretinoin&#xD;
           blood levels in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Specimens are stratified according to&#xD;
      patient prognostic factors, tumor bulk, and extent of dendritic cell to circulating immature&#xD;
      cell ratio derangement. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 tretinoin doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-36 patients (9-12 per treatment arm) will be accrued for&#xD;
      this study within 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>Patients were assigned to one of three ATRA dose levels, at a 1:1:1 ratio, using a randomly permuted list assignments, with the assignment generally being made on the initial day of treatment.&#xD;
Week 1: One dose daily of IL-2 for 5 days followed by 2 days off.&#xD;
Weeks 2-6: One dose daily of IL-2 for 5 days followed by 2 days off.&#xD;
After the IL-2: 2-3 weeks rest, with no treatment. During this time a repeat physical exam, history and X-ray scans will be performed. If there has not been progression (worsening) of the patient's tumor, they will continue to a second 8-week treatment schedule.&#xD;
This schedule will be the same as the first, unless the patients dose had to be reduced. If so, patient's will get that reduced dose. It consists of 1 week of ATRA, 1 week of rest, followed by 6 weeks of IL-2. The same blood tests are collected during that second cycle.</description>
