  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety of a twice-a-day dosing regimen of the experimental drug&#xD;
      Enzastaurin in patients with malignant glioma (a cancerous brain tumor) who are and who are&#xD;
      not taking certain anti-seizure medicines. Enzastaurin may prevent the formation of new blood&#xD;
      vessels that tumors need to grow. It has shown some effect against brain tumors in animals&#xD;
      and in some patients with recurrent gliomas. This study will see if the drug can help&#xD;
      patients with gliomas and how much drug they should be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with malignant glioma that has recurred after standard&#xD;
      therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination,&#xD;
      blood and urine tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans,&#xD;
      and an electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are divided into two groups of patients-those who are and those who are not&#xD;
      taking certain anti-seizure medications-in order to determine if the anti-seizure medication&#xD;
      alters the way the body handles Enzastaurin. Patients in both groups are further divided into&#xD;
      different dosing regimens: some in each group take Enzastaurin once a day for 3 weeks,&#xD;
      followed by twice a day for 3 weeks; others in the group take the drug twice a day for 3&#xD;
      weeks followed by once a day for 3 weeks. The medication is taken by mouth every day.&#xD;
      Treatment is given in 6-week cycles and may continue for 1 year unless the tumor grows or the&#xD;
      patient develops unacceptable drug side effects. In addition to drug treatment, patients have&#xD;
      the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical, and neurological examinations every 3 weeks during the first&#xD;
           cycle and then every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI or CT scan of the head before starting each new cycle. MRI uses a magnetic field and&#xD;
           radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. CT uses x-rays to provide&#xD;
           3-dimensional views of the part of the body being studied. For both procedures, the&#xD;
           patient lies on a table that slides into the cylindrical scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests every week during the first cycle and every 3 weeks after that.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram on days 21 and 42 of the first cycle, just before taking the drug and&#xD;
           30 minutes and 4 hours after taking the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetic studies within 3 days of day 21 of the first cycle. Several blood&#xD;
           samples are drawn to measure levels of Enzastaurin. Patients taking the drug once a day&#xD;
           have blood samples drawn before the morning dose and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours after the&#xD;
           dose. Patients taking the drug twice a day have samples drawn before the morning dose,&#xD;
           at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 hours after the dose, and then 12 hours after the evening dose. In&#xD;
           addition, on day 1 an extra tube of blood is drawn at the time of the Enzastaurin dose&#xD;
           and 4 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamic MRI with spectroscopy or PET. These tests are done to help distinguish live&#xD;
           tumor from dying tumor. The experience of dynamic MRI with spectroscopy is the same as&#xD;
           standard MRI and is done at the same time as the standard procedure. PET uses a&#xD;
           radioactive substance to show cellular activity in specific tissues of the body. The&#xD;
           patient is given an injection of a sugar solution in which a radioactive isotope has&#xD;
           been attached to the sugar molecule. A special camera detects the radiation emitted by&#xD;
           the radioisotope, and the resulting images show how much glucose is being used in&#xD;
           various parts of the body. Because rapidly growing cells, such as tumors, take up and&#xD;
           use more glucose than normal cells do, this test can be used to show active tumors.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzastaurin is a macrocyclic bisindolylmaleimide which disrupts the intrinsic&#xD;
      phosphotransferase activity of conventional and novel PKC isoforms via an interaction at the&#xD;
      ATP binding site, displays selectivity in inhibiting the isoforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies demonstrate potent anti-angiogenic activity of enzastaurin and studies in&#xD;
      normal volunteers and solid tumor patients demonstrate the drug is very well tolerated at&#xD;
      doses that achieve a biologically active serum concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the maximally tolerated dose of enzastaurin in patients with refractory primary&#xD;
      brain tumors not on any enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) and for patients on&#xD;
      EIAEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if twice a day dosing results in higher systemic exposure of enzastaurin and its&#xD;
      metabolites than once a day dosing in patients not on EIAEDs and those on EIAEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain exploratory data regarding the relationship between the activity of the PKC-b&#xD;
      pathway (specifically GSK3-b activation) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of treated&#xD;
      patients and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain exploratory information about the anti-tumor activity of enzastaurin at the higher&#xD;
      doses specified in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically proven malignant glioma will be eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified into Group A or Group B based on their concomitant medications.&#xD;
      Patients who are on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine or&#xD;
      trileptal will be enrolled into Group B while patients who meet the eligibility criteria and&#xD;
      are not on any enzyme inducers, will be entered into Group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of December 2005, three DLT's were observed at dose level 1 and it was determined that&#xD;
      this was not a tolerable dose. A third dose level has been added using a lower dose for Group&#xD;
      A patients only. Twelve patients will be entered at the third dose level in Group A only.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with histologically proven malignant glioma will be eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
        Malignant glioma include glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA),&#xD;
        anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant&#xD;
        glioma NOS (not otherwise specified). Additionally, patients with primitive neuroectodermal&#xD;
        tumors (PNETs) of the central nervous system, progressive low-grade gliomas and&#xD;
        radiographically diagnosed brain stem gliomas refractory to standard treatment will be&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan. This scan&#xD;
        should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dosage that has&#xD;
        been stable for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of&#xD;
        imaging and registration a new baseline MR/CT is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI&#xD;
        or CT must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be&#xD;
        eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. &lt;TAB&gt;They have recovered from the effects of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. &lt;TAB&gt;Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for&#xD;
             eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease&#xD;
             post-operatively, a CT/ MRI should be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  at least 4 weeks post-operatively, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  within 14 days of registration, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If the 96 hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be&#xD;
             repeated. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and&#xD;
             registration, a new baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at&#xD;
             least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 4 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old, and with a life expectancy&#xD;
             greater than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 2 weeks from any&#xD;
             noncytotoxic investigational agent, 4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy, two weeks&#xD;
             from vincristine, 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration,&#xD;
             and 1 week for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide,&#xD;
             cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to the&#xD;
             definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC greater than or equal to&#xD;
             3,000/micro l, ANC greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3), platelet count of greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 100,000/mm(3), and hemoglobin greater than or equal to10 gm/dl),&#xD;
             adequate liver function (SGOT and bilirubin less than or equal to 2 times ULN), and&#xD;
             adequate renal function (creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL and/or creatinine&#xD;
             clearance greater than or equal to 60 cc/min) before starting therapy. These tests&#xD;
             must be performed within 14 days prior to registration. Eligibility level for&#xD;
             hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise&#xD;
             the patients' ability to tolerate this therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to&#xD;
             measure differences of intervention effects. Males and females will be recruited with&#xD;
             no preference to gender. No exclusion to this study will be based on race. Minorities&#xD;
             will actively be recruited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients must practice adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior treatment with an enzyme inducing antiepileptic drug must have been discontinued&#xD;
             at least 14 days prior to study entry for Group A patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who, in the view of the treating physician, have significant active cardiac,&#xD;
             hepatic, or renal diseases are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             No concurrent use of other standard chemotherapeutics or investigative agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients known to have an active malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who have an active infection requiring IV antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;

             metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
             QTc with Bazett's correction that is unmeasurable, or greater than or equal to 460&#xD;
             msec on screening ECG. If a patient has QTc greater than or equal to 460 msec on&#xD;
             screening ECG, a second screen ECG may be repeated at least 24 hours apart. The&#xD;
             average QTc from the 2 screening ECGs must be less than 460 msec in order for the&#xD;
             patient to be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             EKG demonstrating clincically significant arrythmia (multifocal premature ventricular&#xD;
             contraction [PVC], bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia) that is&#xD;
             symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3), or asymptomatic sustained&#xD;
             ventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who have baseline EKGs suggestive of past or present cardiac ischemia will&#xD;
             not be eligible unless they have an appropriate (as defined by the P.I. of this trial)&#xD;
             negative cardiac work up (i.e. echocardiogram, stress test).&#xD;
