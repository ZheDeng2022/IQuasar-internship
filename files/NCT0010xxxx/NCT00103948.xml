    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age range - Adult patients, 25 to 70 years of age inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gender distribution - Men and women. -- Women of childbearing potential (&lt;1 year&#xD;
             postmenopausal) must be practicing effective contraception and have a negative serum&#xD;
             bHCG at Screening. Pregnant and/or lactating females are excluded. Patients who become&#xD;
             pregnant during the study will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnostic evidence of CADASIL either by (1) identification of a NOTCH3 mutation&#xD;
             (excluding polymorphisms) or (2) presence of typical deposits on an electron&#xD;
             microscopy of a skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment - (1) Subjects or their study partners must give a description of&#xD;
             cognitive problems and one of the following: (2a) MMSE score of 10-27 (inclusive) or&#xD;
             (2b) Trails B score, 1.5 standard deviations below the mean after adjustment for age&#xD;
             and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Head MRI - Evidence of disease consistent with CADASIL, and no evidence of another&#xD;
             disease, which might account for cognitive impairment or dementia (as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator/physician at the site). (The latter may be determined with a CT head scan&#xD;
             for eligibility purposes. The MRI would still be needed.) Must be obtained within 6&#xD;
             months of the Screening/Baseline visit. If no such head MRI had been previously&#xD;
             obtained, a head MRI will be obtained as part of Screening/Baseline after all other&#xD;
             inclusion and exclusion criteria (except clinical laboratory determinations) are&#xD;
             satisfied. Patients in whom an MRI is contraindicated can have a CT instead, however,&#xD;
             MRI is the preferred modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Race and ethnicity - Any race and ethnic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Health - Generally healthy, ambulatory or ambulatory-aided (i.e., walker, cane or&#xD;
             wheelchair) outpatient. Speech, motor function, comprehension, and corrected vision&#xD;
             and hearing must be sufficient for compliance with all testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory values must be within normal limits, or if abnormal, must be&#xD;
             judged clinically insignificant by the Investigator/ physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency who are on a stable dose of medication for at&#xD;
             least 12 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline and who have normal serum B12 levels at&#xD;
             Screening/ Baseline will be eligible. Patients who might otherwise have been eligible&#xD;
             can be re- screened when they meet this criterion. This stable dose of Vitamin B12&#xD;
             must be maintained throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism who are on a stable dose of medication&#xD;
             for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening, have a normal TSH and free T4 at screening,&#xD;
             and are considered euthyroid will be eligible. Patients who might otherwise have been&#xD;
             eligible can be re-screened when they meet this criterion. This stable dose must be&#xD;
             maintained throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a reliable study partner who has regular contact with the patient&#xD;
             (e.g., an average of 4 or more contacts per week), can observe for possible adverse&#xD;
             events, and can accompany the patient to all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes, or peripheral&#xD;
             vascular disease, may be enrolled in the study provided that the following standards&#xD;
             are met. -- Hypertension must be medication controlled (sitting SBP &lt; 175, sitting DBP&#xD;
             &lt; 100 mm Hg) and cardiac disease (e.g., angina pectoris, congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             right bundle branch block, or arrhythmias) is stable on appropriate medication for 12&#xD;
             weeks prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Peripheral vascular disease must have been stable for 12 weeks prior to Screening. No&#xD;
        elective surgical procedures should be planned during the course of the study (e.g., hernia&#xD;
        repair and bunion removal). Patient with diabetes must be stable as demonstrated by an&#xD;
        HbA1c of &lt;= 8.0% or a random serum glucose value of &lt;= 170 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with CADASIL are at risk for stroke/TIA and may be enrolled in the study&#xD;
             provided that no new strokes have been diagnosed or identified to have occurred within&#xD;
             the three months prior to Screening. Patients who might otherwise be eligible can be&#xD;
             screened 12 weeks after the stroke. Patients with TIAs are eligible without a waiting&#xD;
             period. Patients who are already enrolled will continue in the study as assessed by&#xD;
             the Investigator/ physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with CADASIL may suffer depression. Such patients are eligible for enrollment&#xD;
             if they are stable on medication for 12 weeks and have an MADRS score &lt; 20. Patients&#xD;
             with an MADRS score &gt;= 20 may be re-screened after 12 weeks on a stable dose of&#xD;
             medication. This stable dose must be maintained throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minor medical conditions must be stable before study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are taking Gingko Biloba or Vitamin E and have been taking stable doses&#xD;
             of these compounds for 8 weeks are allowed in the study. This stable dose must be&#xD;
             maintained throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological disorders affecting cognition or the ability to assess it that are not&#xD;
             associated with CADASIL, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's disease, normal&#xD;

             vasculitis or infections of the central nervous system, subdural hematoma, as well as&#xD;
             Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) disease, a history of significant head trauma&#xD;
             followed by persistent neurological deficits, sleep disorders affecting level of&#xD;
             consciousness, or known structural brain abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric disorders affecting the ability to assess cognition that are not typically&#xD;
             associated with CADASIL, such as schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol abuse or dependence in &lt;= 5 years by DSM-IV criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active or clinically significant conditions affecting absorption, distribution, or&#xD;
             metabolism of the study medication (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic disease,&#xD;
             or severe lactose intolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (sitting systolic &gt;= 175 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt;= 100 mmHg)&#xD;
             as assessed by the Investigator regardless of whether the patient is taking&#xD;
             antihypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of clinically significant, active gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic,&#xD;
             respiratory, infectious, endocrine, or cardiovascular system disease. A patient so&#xD;

             enrollment if Inclusion Criteria 2) and 3) are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with left bundle branch block are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignant neoplasms (does not include basal or squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients and/or study partners who are unwilling or unable to fulfill the requirements&#xD;
             of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to cholinesterase inhibitors or piperidine-containing drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any unapproved prior or concomitant medications as defined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that would make the patient or study partner, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, unsuitable for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involvement in any other investigational trial in the preceding 12 weeks or likely&#xD;
             involvement in any other investigational study drug trial during the course of this&#xD;
             study. Prior to enrollment, the study director or medical monitor must approve&#xD;
             involvement in investigational trials that do not involve a study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with changes in doses of concomitant medication, not otherwise described,&#xD;
