  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide follow-up evaluation and care of patients who have undergone&#xD;
      allogeneic (donor) stem cell transplantation at the NIH Clinical Center. Patients are&#xD;
      monitored for their response to treatment, disease relapse, and later-occurring effects of&#xD;
      the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 10 and 80 years of age who received a donor stem cell transplant at the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center under an NHLBI protocol may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have&#xD;
      had their first transplant at least 3 years before entering the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are generally seen in the clinic every 12 months for some or all of the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodic physical examinations, eye examinations, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: A sample of bone marrow is obtained for microscopic&#xD;
           examination. The patient is given local anesthesia or conscious sedation. An area of the&#xD;
           hipbone is numbed, a thin needle is inserted through the skin into the bone, and a small&#xD;
           amount of marrow is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue biopsy: A small piece of tissue or tumor is obtained for microscopic examination.&#xD;
           Depending on the site of the biopsy, the tissue may be removed using a cookie&#xD;
           cutter-like &quot;punch&quot; instrument, a needle, or a knife. The area is numbed and the tissue&#xD;
           is removed with the appropriate tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging tests to visualize organs, tissues, and cellular activity in specific tissues.&#xD;
           For these tests, the patient lies on a table that slides into the scanner. They may&#xD;
           include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Nuclear scans use a sensitive camera to track a small amount of radioactive&#xD;
                material (radioisotope) that is given to the patient by mouth or through a vein.&#xD;
                The scan may show abnormal areas of tissue in the bones, liver, spleen, kidney,&#xD;
                brain, thyroid, or spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnetic field and radio waves to examine&#xD;
                small sections of body organs and tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Computerized tomography (CT) uses x-rays and can be done from different angles to&#xD;
                provide a 3-dimensional view of tissues and organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Positron emission tomography (PET) uses a fluid with a radioisotope attached to it&#xD;
                to show cellular activity in specific tissues. The fluid is given through a vein&#xD;
                and travels to the cells that are most active (like cancer cells), showing if there&#xD;
                is an actively growing tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary (lung) function tests: The patient breathes into a machine that measures the&#xD;
           volume of air the person can move into and out of the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart function tests may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Electrocardiogram (EKG) evaluates the electrical activity of the heart. Electrodes&#xD;
                placed on the chest transmit information from the heart to a machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Echocardiogram (Echo) is an ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create an&#xD;
                image of the heart and examine the function of the heart chambers and valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) is a nuclear medicine test that uses a small&#xD;
                amount of radioactive chemical injected into a vein. A special scanner creates an&#xD;
                image of the heart for examining the beating motion of the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease relapse or progression, or transplant-related problems may be treated with standard&#xD;
      medical, radiation, or surgical therapy, or patients may be offered experimental therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While patients surviving more than three years from SCT have a high probability of being&#xD;
      cured of their underlying disease, they are still at risk from several categories of&#xD;
      complications which could remain lifelong risks including late recurrence (or continued&#xD;
      persistence) of original disease, late effects from transplant related GVHD, immune&#xD;
      dysfunction, or consequences from the chemotherapy and/or radiation given during transplant&#xD;
      conditioning. Since these complications are iatrogenic, the long term follow-up of SCT&#xD;
      patients is the ethical responsibility of the transplant team. In addition, collecting data&#xD;
      on late occurring complications allows for prospective evaluation of the long term&#xD;
      consequences of surviving a particular transplant treatment approach (i.e. total body&#xD;
      irradiation versus chemotherapy conditioning, T cell depleted versus T cell replete&#xD;
      transplants). This protocol is designed to allow for long term evaluation, data collection,&#xD;
      and when needed, standard medical care of patients (and when appropriate their stem cell&#xD;
      donor) who have received allogeneic stem cell transplantation in NHLBI protocols. This may&#xD;
      include patients with bone marrow failure states, cytopenias, hemoglobinopathies, metastatic&#xD;
      solid tumors, or hematologic malignancies. No investigational treatments will be administered&#xD;
      on this protocol. Participation will not constitute a promise of long-term medical care at&#xD;
      the NIH, nor will it provide for the evaluation and treatment of any non-transplant related&#xD;
      medical problems. This protocol will provide access to NIH hematologists experienced in the&#xD;
      care of post transplant patients who can help transplant patients and their local physician&#xD;
      manage post transplant complications. In return, data collected from subjects and their&#xD;
      donors (when applicable) will provide NIH researchers valuable information and/or laboratory&#xD;
      samples for the purposes of better understanding the long term consequences of stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation and identifying areas in need of future research.&#xD;
