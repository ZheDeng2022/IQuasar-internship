      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of intraperitoneal&#xD;
      tgDCC-E1A that can be given in combination with paclitaxel as a treatment for patients with&#xD;
      recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. How the cancer responds to this treatment will&#xD;
      also be studied. Researchers will also ask the patients if they will allow additional tumor&#xD;
      samples to be collected and extra blood samples to be drawn. These samples will be used to&#xD;
      learn about the biological response before and after treatment.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate toxicity and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal&#xD;
           tgDCC-E1A in combination with intravenous paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure tumor response of intraperitoneal tgDCC-E1A in combination with intravenous&#xD;
           paclitaxel and compare to intravenous paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure time to progression and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the biological effects of combined tgDCC- E1A and paclitaxel in ovarian&#xD;
           cancer cells as measured by laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epithelial ovarian cancer is a significant public health problem. It is the sixth most common&#xD;
      cancer in women worldwide. Globally, it is estimated that 162,000 new cases are diagnosed per&#xD;
      year, and that 106,000 women die from the disease per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer are often subtle. Seventy-five percent of subjects will&#xD;
      present with advanced stage III and IV disease. Standard treatment for stage III/IV subjects&#xD;
      consists of surgical debulking to the maximal extent possible and chemotherapy with&#xD;
      paclitaxel plus a platinum compound (cisplatin or carboplatin). Despite high initial response&#xD;
      rates, the overall survival for this group is poor, with only 20% of stage III and less than&#xD;
      5% of stage IV subjects surviving five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer varies depending upon the interval between prior&#xD;
      treatment and recurrence. Twenty percent of subjects are classified as &quot;platinum-refractory&quot;,&#xD;
      in that they fail to have even a partial response to a platinum-containing regimen. Subjects&#xD;
      with recurrent or progressive disease less than six months after initial therapy have a poor&#xD;
      response rate to repeat treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, and are generally&#xD;
      considered to have &quot;platinum-resistant&quot; disease. In contrast, subjects with recurrent disease&#xD;
      greater than six months after initial therapy have better response rates to repeat treatment&#xD;
      with platinum-containing regimens, and are generally considered to have &quot;platinum-sensitive&quot;&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus for the treatment of &quot;platinum-refractory&quot; or &quot;platinum-resistant&quot;&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, a class of individuals who are particularly challenging to treat. Prognosis&#xD;
      is poor, and treatment is primarily palliative in nature. Responses to a variety of single&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents, as well as to a combination of agents in largely phase II trials&#xD;
      have been similar, ranging from 10-35%. Intravenous (IV) paclitaxel, given alone or in&#xD;
      combination with other agents is a standard treatment for subjects who have relapsed. In an&#xD;
      attempt to increase the dose intensity of paclitaxel therapy, weekly IV paclitaxel has been&#xD;
      recommended. This treatment schedule is well tolerated, but the response rate in heavily&#xD;
      pretreated subjects is still only 28.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that this group of subjects is poorly responsive to conventional chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      consequently has limited options, an alternative approach to treatment is warranted. The use&#xD;
      of a gene therapy agent with anti-tumor effects and the ability to sensitize cancer cells to&#xD;
      traditional chemotherapy is appealing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overview of the Effect of E1A Gene Transfer on Cancer Cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      E1A, a gene derived from Adenovirus type 5, has been shown to have potent anti-neoplastic&#xD;
      activity through a variety of mechanisms, including down-regulation of HER-2/neu&#xD;
      overexpression, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of metastasis, and reversion of tumor&#xD;
      cells toward a differentiated epithelial phenotype. The E1A gene has also been shown to have&#xD;
      an additive effect in vitro and in vivo on the apoptosis induced by chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The E1A gene has been successfully transfected into human cells both in vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo using tgDCC-E1A (E1A-Lipid Complex), which consists of the E1A plasmid (pE1A-K2)&#xD;
      complexed to the cationic lipid gene delivery system comprised of DC-Cholesterol&#xD;
      3b[N-(N'N'-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl] cholesterol hydrochloride and DOPE&#xD;
      (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rationale for Use of Cationic Lipids to Deliver DNA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cationic lipids can form complexes with negatively charged DNA plasmids and facilitate the&#xD;
      transfer of genes to target cells. They are useful agents for delivery of gene therapy&#xD;
      because they are synthesized chemically, are simple to manufacture, and pose no infectious&#xD;
      risk. The cationic derivative of cholesterol, 3b[N-(N'N'-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl]&#xD;
      cholesterol hydrochloride (DC-Chol) is an ideal cationic lipid for therapeutic use, as the&#xD;
      cationic charge is provided by a non-toxic tertiary amine with a biodegradable carbamoyl&#xD;
      bond. DC-Chol can be used to prepare liposomes in combination with the neutral&#xD;
      1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) with a DC-Chol to DOPE ratio of 6:4.&#xD;
      This liposome combination can be mixed with a plasmid encoding E1A to form tgDCC-E1A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final preparation of tgDCC-E1A can be made within a range of lipid:DNA ratios, all of&#xD;
      which have been shown in cell culture and in animal models to result in expression of E1A.&#xD;
      Clinical trials of tgDCC-E1A for injection into solid tumors have used a final preparation&#xD;
      with a lipid:DNA ratio of 1 nmol lipid to 1 microgram DNA [tgDCC-E1A (1:1)]. Early clinical&#xD;
      trials evaluating intracavitary administration (e.g. intraperitoneal infusion for ovarian&#xD;
      cancer) used a preparation with a lipid:DNA ratio of 10 nmol lipid to 1 microgram DNA&#xD;
      [tgDCC-E1A (10:1)]. More recent protocols of intraperitoneal delivery for ovarian cancer have&#xD;
      used a preparation with a lipid:DNA ratio of 3 nmol lipid to 1 microgram DNA [tgDCC-E1A&#xD;
      (3:1)], as will this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rationale for Intraperitoneal Delivery of tgDCC-E1A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peritoneal cavity is a common site of tumor recurrence after initial &quot;radical&quot; surgical&#xD;
      treatment of ovarian malignancies. Dissemination in this cavity is often widespread. Because&#xD;
      of the unusual natural course of ovarian cancer (characterized by its tendency to be confined&#xD;
      to the peritoneal cavity), control of metastatic disease in the peritoneal cavity is an&#xD;
      important and challenging problem, which can be improved by direct delivery of drug into the&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
