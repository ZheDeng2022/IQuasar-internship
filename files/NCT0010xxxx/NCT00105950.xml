  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine how effective and safe a new investigational drug,&#xD;
      lapatinib, is in treating patients with treatment refractory or relapsed inflammatory breast&#xD;
      cancer. Tumor tissue collected pre-treatment and at Day 28 will be examined for biologic&#xD;
      activity by IHC (immunohistochemistry). Treatment will consist of daily oral therapy with&#xD;
      lapatinib. A patient may continue treatment as long as they are receiving benefit. Blood&#xD;
      samples for hematology and chemistry panels, MUGA/ECHO (multigated&#xD;
      acquisition/echocardiogram) exams and physical exams will be performed throughout the study&#xD;
      to monitor safety.&#xD;

      This Phase II open label, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effects of oral lapatinib administered as a single agent therapy to patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory inflammatory breast cancer. Eligible patients must have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer based on clinicopathologic criteria, tumor that is&#xD;
      readily accessible for biopsy, and must have previously received treatment with an&#xD;
      anthracycline and taxane-containing regimen (30 patients) plus trastuzumab (90 patients).&#xD;
      Patients enrolled must have tumors that overexpress ErbB2, with or without co-expression of&#xD;
      ErbB1. The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the objective response rate&#xD;
      (defined as complete response plus partial response). Secondary objectives are to evaluate&#xD;
      clinical benefit including quality of life parameters, progression-free survival, overall&#xD;
      survival, time-to-response, response duration, safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      effects on intracellular mediators that regulate tumor cell growth and survival, as well as&#xD;
      effects on proteomic profile, and circulating levels of extracellular domains of ErbB1 and&#xD;
      ErbB2 in peripheral blood.&#xD;
