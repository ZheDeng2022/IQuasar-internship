    <textblock>
      This study will examine brain and noradrenaline function in panic disorder. Noradrenaline is&#xD;
      a brain chemical that is involved in the regulation of emotion, anxiety, sleep, stress&#xD;
      hormones such as cortisol, and other body functions that are disturbed in panic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with panic disorder between 18 and 60 years of age may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with psychiatric and medical histories, a&#xD;
      physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw to obtain DNA for genetic studies of panic disorder - particularly of a gene&#xD;
           that helps control noradrenaline activity - and to grow cell lines that can be frozen&#xD;
           and used for future research on the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging: MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images&#xD;
           of body tissues and organs. For this procedure, the subject lies on a table that is&#xD;
           moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking&#xD;
           and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 60&#xD;
           minutes, during which the patient is asked to lie still for 10 to 15 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yohimbine injection with PET scanning: Catheters (plastic tubes) are placed in two&#xD;
           veins, one to administer yohimbine, a drug that increases noradrenaline activity in the&#xD;
           body for about 60 minutes, and one to draw blood samples. Yohimbine often causes&#xD;
           temporary trembling, goosebumps, and clammy palms, and may cause emotions such as&#xD;
           elation, anxiety, panic attacks, or depression. During yohimbine administration,&#xD;
           subjects undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. PET uses small amounts of&#xD;
           a radioactive chemical called [fluoro-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose that &quot;labels&quot; active areas&#xD;
           of the brain, showing patterns of glucose (sugar) metabolism. For the procedure, the&#xD;
           subject lies on the scanner bed, with a special mask fitted to his or her head and&#xD;
           attached to the bed to help keep the head still. A brief &quot;transmission&quot; scan is done&#xD;
           just before the radioactive tracer is injected in order to calibrate the scanner. After&#xD;
           the tracer is injected through the catheter, pictures are taken for about an hour, while&#xD;
           the subject lies still on the scanner bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saline injection with PET scanning: The procedure is the same as that described above,&#xD;
           except a saline solution is administered as placebo instead of yohimbine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A considerable body of preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that dysregulated activity&#xD;
      of noradrenergic systems in the brain is involved in the development of mood disturbance,&#xD;
      anxiety, and fear. Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies of the noradrenergic system&#xD;
      provide a basis for relating increased activity of this system to the behavioral expression&#xD;
      of fear and anxiety and the somatic symptoms and cardiovascular changes that accompany severe&#xD;
      anxiety states. Previously, extensive research has been done on the role of noradrenergic&#xD;
      mechanisms in panic disorder (PD), and it has been suggested that in at least a subgroup of&#xD;
      PD patients an abnormality of noradrenergic mechanisms may exist. Studies in patients with PD&#xD;
      using the alpha2-adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonist yohimbine showed that a subgroup of PD&#xD;
      patients exhibit abnormalities in the regulation of noradrenergic function. Yohimbine, which&#xD;
      activates noradrenergic neurons, has been shown to produce greater increases in anxiety,&#xD;
      somatic symptoms, blood pressure and plasma levels of the noradrenergic metabolite MHPG in&#xD;
      some patients with PD relative to healthy controls. The effect of yohimbine on brain regions&#xD;
      hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of PD has not been determined in PD patients&#xD;
      using modern neuroimaging techniques. The anxiogenic effects of yohimbine do not occur in all&#xD;
      PD patients, although the neurobiological basis for this differential response to yohimbine&#xD;
      has not been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project proposes to address these two unresolved questions. The effects of&#xD;
      yohimbine on regional cerebral glucose metabolism will be determined in PD patients and&#xD;
      healthy controls. In addition, preliminary data will be obtained as to whether the behavioral&#xD;
      and cerebral metabolic responses to yohimbine relate to functional polymorphisms of the COMT&#xD;
      gene which affect catecholamine metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is predicted that yohimbine will produce decreases in cerebral metabolism in the&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate. Healthy controls will&#xD;
      exhibit an inverse direction of change in these brain regions. These findings would be&#xD;
      similar to those we have previously observed in PTSD patients and may reflect an altered&#xD;
      dose-response effect of yohimbine in PD and PTSD relative to controls since preclinical&#xD;
      pharmacological studies of stress have shown that high levels of norepinephrine release in&#xD;
      the brain decrease brain metabolism whereas lower levels increase brain metabolism. In terms&#xD;
      of polymorphisms of the COMT and other catecholamine systems-related gene polymorphisms, it&#xD;
      is predicted that the low-activity COMT (met allele) alleles will be associated with greater&#xD;
      behavioral and cerebral metabolic responses to yohimbine.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Up to 120 drug-free subjects (ages 18-60) will be selected who additionally meet criteria&#xD;
        for one of 3 subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        I. PD, current (n=30), as defined by DSM-IV criteria for PD, and still symptomatic as&#xD;
        defined by at least 1 panic attack/week or a CGI score of at least 4. In case of co-morbid&#xD;
        depression it will be ensured that PD is the primary diagnosis. This means that PD preceded&#xD;
        the onset of MDD. These patients will be drug-free for at least 2 weeks prior to being&#xD;
        enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        II. PD, remitted (n=30), as defined by DSM-IV criteria for PD, and asymptomatic as no&#xD;
        longer meeting criteria for PD while being drug-free during the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        III. Healthy Control Sample. Sixty subjects (ages 18-60) who have not met criteria for any&#xD;
        major psychiatric disorder (axis I diagnosis according to DSM-IV). A control subject will&#xD;
        be matched to each PD subject for age, gender, menopausal and estrogen replacement status,&#xD;
        and handedness. The control subjects will have no known first-degree relatives with any&#xD;
        axis I disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Symptomatic PD patients must not have taken any antidepressant or other medications likely&#xD;
        to alter monoamine neurochemistry or cerebrovascular and cardiovascular function for at&#xD;
        least 2 weeks prior to the challenge studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Remitted PD patients will be drug-free for at least 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will also be excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. evidence for an axis I psychiatric disorder (DSM-IV criteria) other than panic&#xD;
             disorder with/without agoraphobia with/without comorbid depression,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy, i.e.&#xD;
             hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, seizures,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. a history of drug (including BZDs) or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime&#xD;
             history of alcohol or drug dependence (DSM IV criteria),&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing at screening or on the days of&#xD;
             the challenge studies),&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. current breast feeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. are smokers,&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. presence of an axis II personality disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. current treatment with fluoxetine, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. history of an adverse reaction associated with the administration of yohimbine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects beyond age 60 are excluded.&#xD;
