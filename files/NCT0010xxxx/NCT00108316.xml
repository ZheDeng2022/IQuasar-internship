      This study is designed to understand if a biological measurement, of how platelets respond to&#xD;
      serotonin (a chemical in the blood sometimes referred to as SERT), can provide information&#xD;
      that will determine an &quot;ideal dose,&quot; one specifically tailored for each individual's&#xD;
      chemistry. The biological measurement will be obtained by testing a blood sample. There will&#xD;
      be approximately 120 control subjects expected for enrollment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this dose-ranging three-arm study of fluoxetine is to study the&#xD;
      kinetics of the serotonin transporter in platelets and relate this to antidepressant response&#xD;
      by comparing the manipulation of serotonin and platelet measure to standard treatment as it&#xD;
      now exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN: The project will examine two methods of dose adjustment of selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment: The first method emulates the current standard clinical&#xD;
      practice, i.e., titrating the dosage based upon the subject's current depression&#xD;
      symptomatology (standard treatment arm). The second method utilizes the measurement of the Km&#xD;
      to create a dosage tailored to the individual to approach the optimum treatment Kapp&#xD;
      (biological treatment arm). Additionally, the placebo arm will control for treatment failure&#xD;
      and high placebo response. This application is a double-blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      randomized, dose ranging study in male and female outpatients with Major Depressive Disorder.&#xD;
      The proposed study will take place over a period of 12 weeks recruiting 117 subjects (in&#xD;
      order to achieve 90 completers, 30 in each arm, assuming 30% dropout rate) over a five year&#xD;
      period who are diagnosed with Major Depression according to DSM-IV criteria. Following a 1&#xD;
      week screening period during which safety assessments are completed and evaluated and the Km&#xD;
      and dosage are calculated, the subjects will be blindly randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      the standard treatment, the biological arm or the placebo arm. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      clinic at weeks 4, 8, and 12 for ratings and platelet Km determinations. Response will be&#xD;
      measured and dosage adjustment will be made at weeks 4 and 8. A final determination of&#xD;
      response will be made at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Responders will be identified according to conventional criteria will be defined as&#xD;
      those subject who 1) have a 50% or more improvement from baseline scores, as measured on the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), 2) no longer meet Major Depressive criteria according to&#xD;
      DSM-IV; and 3) score &lt; 10 on the HAM-D 17 item or &lt;15 on the 24-item HAM-D. The efficacy&#xD;
      measures will be the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D): The seventeen item scale is designed&#xD;
      to measure depression level; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): A scale&#xD;
      designed to provide additional subjective information to determine depressive symptoms; The&#xD;
      Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Cloninger Temperament Character Index (TCI) are patient&#xD;
      rated scales which measure feelings and personality traits. The safety parameters include&#xD;
      physical examinations, vital signs, collection of adverse events, and 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Previous studies have indicated fluoxetine is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      depression. This study is designed to provide additional information concerning the methods&#xD;
      for determining dose. Potentially, the information gained from this research may provide a&#xD;
      more cost-effective way of finding an effective dose than the trial and error approach&#xD;
      generally used.&#xD;
