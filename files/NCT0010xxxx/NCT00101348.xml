      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of&#xD;
      erlotinib and bevacizumab when given with cetuximab and how well giving erlotinib and&#xD;
      cetuximab together with or without bevacizumab works in treating patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      unresectable kidney, colorectal, head and neck, pancreatic, or non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in&#xD;
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor&#xD;
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab and bevacizumab&#xD;
      may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving erlotinib&#xD;
      together with cetuximab and/or bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of erlotinib when combined with cetuximab in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell, colorectal, head and neck, pancreatic,&#xD;
      or non-small cell lung cancer (part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the MTD of bevacizumab when combined with cetuximab and erlotinib in these&#xD;
      patients (part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the toxic effects, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of these regimens in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the antitumor activity of these regimens, in terms of tumor response,&#xD;
      short-term survival, and progression-free survival, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare, preliminarily, the toxicity and antitumor activity profiles of these regimens in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib and&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Patients also receive&#xD;
      cetuximab IV over 3 hours on day 1 and over 1 hour on days 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Patients receive erlotinib as in part 1 at the MTD and cetuximab as in part 1.&#xD;
      Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 1Â½ hours on day 1 and over 1 hour on day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the MTD is determined.&#xD;
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month.&#xD;
