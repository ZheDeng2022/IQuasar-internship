      Static magnetic therapy is increasingly used to alleviate pain; however, its efficacy has not&#xD;
      been determined yet. The aims of this proposal are to evaluate the effect of magnetic therapy&#xD;
      on pain intensity levels, opioid requirements, and opioid side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double blind, controlled trial is proposed. Patients from 8 years old and older&#xD;
      subjected to a variety of surgical procedures with pain of intensity at least 5/10 will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups: Magnetic therapy or Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices will be placed around the surgical wound for 2 hours. Every ten minutes, patients&#xD;
      will rate their pain intensity on a 0-10 numerical rating scale, and morphine will be&#xD;
      administered until pain intensity is ≤ 4/10. Pain intensity will be the primary outcome.&#xD;
      Opioid requirements and opioid side effects will be secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect a difference of 1 unit (from 0 to 10) between the groups with 80% power, assuming&#xD;
      that the baseline pain intensity is 7.9 ± 2.0, we estimated the need for 70 patients per&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use an intention-to-treat analysis. To analyze the effect of the treatment on pain&#xD;
      intensity, an analysis of repeated measures using generalized estimating equations will be&#xD;
      used. The proportion of subjects in each group who exhibit 50% or more pain relief one hour&#xD;
      after application of the magnetic devices and the number needed to treat will also be&#xD;
      calculated. To analyze the effect of the treatment on opioid requirements, a difference in&#xD;
      morphine requirements between groups two hours after placement of the magnets will be&#xD;
      estimated. To analyze the effect of the treatment on opioid side effects, a variable that&#xD;
      summarizes the presence of any side effect two hours after the placement of the magnets will&#xD;
      be created, and the absolute risk difference for developing any side effect will be&#xD;
      estimated. Ninety five percent confidence intervals will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal would contribute substantially to the complementary medicine field, not only&#xD;
      because of its scientific rigor, but also because the pain model that it evaluates&#xD;
      strengthens the validity of the results.&#xD;
