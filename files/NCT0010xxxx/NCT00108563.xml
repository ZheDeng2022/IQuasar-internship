      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of interferon and ribavirin&#xD;
      combination therapy in people with Hepatitis C. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess how often depressive symptoms occur in patients taking combination alpha&#xD;
           interferon plus ribavirin or pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy for Hepatitis&#xD;
           C, when depressive symptoms occur, and how severe the depressive symptoms are when they&#xD;
           do occur;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify potential predictors for the development of depressive symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify if citalopram, an antidepressant medication, can prevent or lessen the&#xD;
           severity of depressive symptoms brought about by interferon therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with active depression in the previous 3 months and/or those with BDI (Beck&#xD;
