      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine brain activity in children age 10-18 with disruptive behavior&#xD;
      problems, including conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and attention&#xD;
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), compared with children without behavioral problems.&#xD;
      Our goal is to examine differences in how emotions, social situations, and problem-solving&#xD;
      situations are processed in the brain across these groups of children.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to investigate the neuro-cognitive underpinnings of the&#xD;
      emotional dysfunction linked to childhood behavioral disturbance; in particular, Conduct&#xD;
      Disorder with elevated callous-unemotional (CU) traits (CD+CU), Conduct Disorder with non&#xD;
      elevated CU traits (CD-CU), but also ADHD. The functional hypotheses that we are testing with&#xD;
      both neuro-cognitive and neuro-imaging paradigms are that: (1) CD+CU, but not ADHD, is&#xD;
      associated with dysfunction in the formation and operational use of stimulus-punishment and,&#xD;
      to a lesser extent, stimulus-reward association information; (2) CD-CU is associated with&#xD;
      heightened threat sensitivity and impairment in executive systems involved in emotional&#xD;
      regulation; and (3) that ADHD and CD-CU, is associated with impairment in executive systems&#xD;
      related to the representation and execution of task demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 children with Conduct Disorder (CD) and high CU traits (the CD+CU group); 160 children&#xD;
      with CD and low CU traits (the CD-CU group); 160 children with ADHD; and 160 healthy&#xD;
      volunteer children. All children will be between the ages of 10 and 17. Both males and&#xD;
      females will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will have two phases: i) neuropsychological assessment and training in an&#xD;
      MRI simulator (up to 4 hours); ii) The MRI scanning session (up to 2 hours, no more than 90&#xD;
      minutes in scanner). Participants, if they are willing, may be invited to participate in more&#xD;
      than one scanning session (up to a maximum of 3 120 minute sessions) or neuro-cognitive&#xD;
      testing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behaviorally, we predict that children with CD+CU and children with CD-CU will present with&#xD;
      impairment on tasks that involve either the formation or operational use of particular&#xD;
      stimulus-punishment associations (e.g., the subjective value learning task and emotional&#xD;
      interrupt task). However, the nature of this impairment with be qualitatively different. For&#xD;
      example, we predict that youth with CD+CU will show reduced interference by emotional&#xD;
      distracters on the emotional interrupt task but that youth with CD-CU will show decreased&#xD;
      interference. In contrast, we predict that children with ADHD, but no CD, will show no&#xD;
      behavioral impairment on such tasks. However, we predict that children with ADHD and children&#xD;
      with CD-CU will present with impairments on executive function tasks (e.g., the Number Stroop&#xD;
      paradigm). In contrast, we predict that children with CD+CU will show no impairment on these&#xD;
      tasks. At the anatomical level, we anticipate reduced activation of emotional related systems&#xD;
      in children with CD+CU, but increased activation in children with CD-CU, during emotional&#xD;
      impact tasks (in particular, reduced activation of the amygdala, regions of orbitofrontal&#xD;
      cortex and anterior cingulate). We anticipate that the neural response of children with ADHD&#xD;
      during these tasks will be less anomalous. We anticipate that the neural response of children&#xD;
      with ADHD and children with CD-CU during the performance of response control tasks to be&#xD;
      anomalous (with considerable greater recruitment of anterior and posterior compensatory&#xD;
      systems).&#xD;

               1. Individuals with CD + CU: Male and female subjects aged 8-18 who score equal to&#xD;
                  or more than 20 on the APSD/PCL-YV. Children with antisocial behavioral problems&#xD;
                  on medications with psychotropic effects will be considered if their target&#xD;
                  behaviors persist despite the use of medications. In these children, only simple&#xD;
                  stimulant medications will be held for 48 hours. These include methylphenidate,&#xD;
                  amphetamine and their derivatives including Ritalin, Ritalin SR, Ritalin LA,&#xD;
                  Methylin, Methlin ER, Metadate CD, Concerta, Dexedrine, Dextrostat, Dexedrine&#xD;
                  Spansule, Adderall, Adderall XR, and Focalin. Medications like Strattera&#xD;
                  (atomoxetine), bupropion (Wellbutrin), modafinil (Provigil), or valproic acid&#xD;
                  (Depakote), or other mood stabilizers are not safe to stop suddenly and children&#xD;
                  taking these medications will not be asked to stop them.&#xD;

                  persist despite the use of medications. In these children, only simple stimulant&#xD;
                  medications will be held for 48 hours. These include methylphenidate, amphetamine&#xD;

                  other mood stabilizers are not safe to stop suddenly and children taking these&#xD;
                  medications will not be asked to stop them.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Individuals with ADHD: Male and female subjects aged 8-18 who currently meet&#xD;
                  DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. The diagnosis will be made on the basis of a K-SADS-PL&#xD;
                  interview with the parent and a t score &gt;65 on the hyperactivity-impulsivity&#xD;
                  subscale of the Connors Teacher Scale. Participants in this group will have APSD&#xD;
                  scores &lt;20.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Comparison individuals: Male and female subjects aged 8-18 who are free from any&#xD;
                  current or past psychopathology (all will score less than 20 on the APSD/PCL-YV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Ongoing medical illness other than those listed in the inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
             respective groups that require use of any medication that may have psychotropic&#xD;
             effects. For example, a patient with history of mild asthma that did not require&#xD;
             medication may be included, however a patient with asthma requiring use of beta&#xD;
             blockers, steroids, etc. would not be included. For children with ADHD or healthy&#xD;
             volunteer children, a contraindication to discontinuing medication for 48 hours. Only&#xD;
             simple stimulant medications will be held for 48 hours. These include methylphenidate,&#xD;

             Methlin ER, Metadate CD, Concerta, Dexedrine, Dextrostat, Dexedrine Spansule,&#xD;
             Adderall, Adderall XR, and Focalin. Medications like Strattera (atomoxetine),&#xD;
             bupropion (Wellbutrin), or modafinil (Provigil) are not safe to stop suddenly and&#xD;
             children with ADHD taking these medications will not be included.&#xD;

          5. Individuals with ADHD will be evaluated through the KSAD and clinical review by a&#xD;
             psychiatrist. Those children who receive diagnosis of mood disorders through this&#xD;
             evaluation process will be excluded. Additional explicit exclusions include active&#xD;
             psychosis, Pervasive Developmental Disorders and Tourette s syndrome. Children with&#xD;
             anxiety disorders will be included given the high comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety&#xD;
             disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any other psychiatric disorder that is sufficiently severe to require specific&#xD;
             treatment, with the exception of those listed in the inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
             respective groups.&#xD;

             MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Claustrophobia: participants will be questioned about potential discomfort in being in&#xD;
             an enclosed space, such as an MRI scanner.&#xD;
