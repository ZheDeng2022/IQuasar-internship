      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there has been great progress in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality in the U.S. over&#xD;
      the past 40 years, some minority groups have not shared fully in this progress and continue&#xD;
      to have lower life expectancy and higher CVD morbidity. On average, minorities have less&#xD;
      access to medical care, receive less aggressive care and fewer diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      cardiac procedures, and adhere poorly to prescribed medical regimens. Thus, research to&#xD;
      reduce health disparities by improving CVD outcomes in minorities offers potential for a&#xD;
      substantial positive public heath impact. Academic medical centers and institutions capable&#xD;
      of carrying out such research, however, often lack access to and the trust of minority&#xD;
      patients. Minority patients often receive fragmented care because they lack access to regular&#xD;
      medical care, present to emergency departments rather than primary care physicians for&#xD;
      complications of an advanced chronic CVD condition, and are less likely to follow medical&#xD;
      regimens. Minority communities often harbor distrust of clinical research. Minority patients&#xD;
      report greater satisfaction when receiving care from minority providers and are reluctant to&#xD;
      receive treatment outside their minority healthcare serving systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, minorities have high rates of hypertension, elevated cholesterol, cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, as well as other behavioral,&#xD;
      environmental, and occupational risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, such as sleep&#xD;
      problems - all elements that contribute to excess CVD morbidity and mortality. The causes of&#xD;
      minority health disparities are complex and incompletely understood. Although evidence of&#xD;
      genetic, biologic, and environmental factors is well documented, poor outcomes are also&#xD;
      attributed to under-treatment. Such under-treatment may be due to limited access to health&#xD;
      care or, in some cases, break-down of the medical system, or failure of the physician and/or&#xD;
      patient to allow for optimal health care, even when access is not impaired. The complex&#xD;
      interactions of behavior, socio-economic status (SES), culture, and ethnicity are important&#xD;
      predictors of health outcomes and sources of health disparities. Despite efforts to elucidate&#xD;
      genetic and environmental risk factors and to promote cardiovascular health in high-risk&#xD;
      populations, trends in CVD outcomes suggest that CVD health disparities continue to widen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Partnerships Program to Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involves collaboration&#xD;
      between research-intensive medical centers (RIMCs) that have a track record of NIH-supported&#xD;
      research and patient care and minority healthcare serving systems (MSSs) that lack a strong&#xD;
      research program. Each Partnership Program will: a) design and carry out multiple&#xD;
      interdisciplinary research projects that investigate complex biological, behavioral, and&#xD;
      societal factors that contribute to CVD health disparities and facilitate clinical research&#xD;
      within the MSS to improve CVD outcomes and reduce health disparities, and b) provide&#xD;
      reciprocal educational and skills development programs so that investigators will be able to&#xD;
      conduct research aimed at reducing cardiovascular disparities and thereby enhance research&#xD;
      opportunities, enrich cultural sensitivity, and improve cardiovascular research capabilities&#xD;
      at both institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Request for Applications for Partnership Programs to Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities&#xD;
      was released in September 2003. The awards were made in September 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Mississippi Medical Center (the Research Intensive Medical Center) and&#xD;
      Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center (the Minority Healthcare Serving System) will&#xD;
      address cardiovascular health disparities among African Americans through establishment of&#xD;
      its HEAT Partnership. HEAT is an acronym for Hypertension Education and Treatment. The HEAT&#xD;
      Partnership is organized into four cores. The administrative core includes the principal&#xD;
      investigators from both the RIMC and the MSS as well as the core directors and co-directors.&#xD;
      Specific aims of the Research Core are to: (1) provide a series of workshops for healthcare&#xD;
      providers that focus on assessment and treatment of hypertensive patients according to&#xD;
      current guidelines; (2) enroll a sufficient number of patients with uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
      to participate in the study and encourage each of them to continue treatment throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the intervention as a means of promoting lifetime hypertension control; (3)&#xD;
      provide a program of patient education that includes (a) a series of workshops for the&#xD;
      intervention participants that focus on the impact of hypertension, and the efficacy of&#xD;
      proper diet and exercise in managing hypertension; (b) a patient advocate, who will serve as&#xD;
      a liaison between patient and provider; and (c) a &quot;health partner&quot; from the patient's social&#xD;
      circle of acquaintances who will help reinforce the workshop lessons in a participatory&#xD;
      manner; and (4) compare the results of the intervention group and the control group, and&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Specific aims of the Education Core are to:&#xD;
      (1) enhance cultural competency among healthcare providers and address its impact on health&#xD;
      disparities among the nation's racial and ethnic minority populations; (2) explore issues of&#xD;
      race, racism, and health disparities in research and medical care, particularly as they&#xD;
      affect African Americans in Mississippi; and (3) provide career development training for new&#xD;
      investigators capable of conducting research to reduce cardiovascular health disparities.&#xD;
      Specific aims of the Community Outreach Core are to: (1) conduct focus group sessions in&#xD;
      selected vulnerable populations to assess the level of awareness about hypertension and&#xD;
      identify realistic lifestyle hypertension-prevention goals for the intended audience; (2)&#xD;
      pursue partnerships with community-based organizations to enhance the activities of the&#xD;
      Outreach Core; and (3) develop and disseminate culturally and linguistically appropriate&#xD;
      education materials to the lay public about hypertension, including detection, diagnosis, and&#xD;
      strategies for its prevention.&#xD;
