      The purpose of this study is to determine whether topical application of PEP005 is safe for&#xD;
      the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are a common skin problem largely caused by long term sun&#xD;
      exposure. Current treatments include surgery, curettage/desiccation and simple excision,&#xD;
      which are often cosmetically disfiguring. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of&#xD;
      BCC lesions is thus being researched. Sap from the plant Euphorbia peplus has been used for&#xD;
      many years in Australia as a &quot;folk&quot; remedy to treat a number of skin conditions. The active&#xD;
      component of Euphorbia peplus has been isolated and made into a gel applied directly to the&#xD;
      skin by Peplin Ltd. To date, only one well-controlled study with PEP005 gel in humans has&#xD;
      been completed. Sixteen patients received a single application of PEP005 0.01% or vehicle gel&#xD;
      to actinic keratoses on the chest, shoulders, back and/or arms. Results show good tolerance&#xD;
      and evidence of activity. The current study is designed to evaluate the safety of two&#xD;
      applications of PEP005 gel in patients with superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) on the&#xD;
      arms, shoulders, chest, face and/or scalp, testing three concentrations according to two&#xD;
      treatment regimens. Approximately 60 patients are planned to be included from multiple&#xD;
      Australian centers. Efficacy and cosmetic outcome will be assessed and a recommended&#xD;
      treatment regimen will be determined. Assignment to treatment is random and patients and&#xD;
      medical staff will be blinded as to the treatment. Patients will have two visits for&#xD;
      treatment application and will return for check-up visits the day after the first application&#xD;
      and several times thereafter for approximately 3 months.&#xD;
