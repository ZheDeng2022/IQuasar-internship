      One of the principal safeguards mandated by the Federal Regulations governing clinical&#xD;
      research with children is the assent requirement: children who are capable must provide an&#xD;
      affirmative agreement to participate unless the research &quot;holds out a prospect of direct&#xD;
      benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only&#xD;
      in the context of the research&quot; (46.408). Despite the importance of the assent requirement,&#xD;
      the Federal regulations offer no guidelines on its implementation. In the present study, we&#xD;
      propose to survey children and one of their parents in order to obtain information concerning&#xD;
      children's role in making decisions concerning their participation in clinical research. Five&#xD;
      elements of children's involvement in the decision-making process with respect to their&#xD;
      participation in clinical research will be assessed: 1) receipt of information concerning the&#xD;
      available options; 2) understanding of this information; 3) assessment of the available&#xD;
      options; 4) expression of a preferred option; and 5) coordination with parental&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups will be enrolled: 1. Minor/Parent pairs where the minor is participating in, or&#xD;
      is in follow-up for, a drug treatment research study for cancer 2. Minor/Parent pairs where&#xD;
      the minor is participating in, or is in follow-up for, a drug treatment research study for&#xD;
      asthma, and 3. Minor/Parent pairs where the minor is receiving on-going clinical care for&#xD;
      asthma. Children 7-14 years of age will be enrolled. Total enrollment will be 400 subject&#xD;
      pairs, approximately 150 in cancer research, 150 in asthma research and 100 involved in&#xD;
      clinical care for asthma, with approximate balance between the sites. Two formalized survey&#xD;
      instruments - research/clinical minor, research/clinical parent - will be developed in&#xD;
      consultation with Research Triangle Institute (RTI).&#xD;
