      This study will explore clinical and genetic aspects of Usher syndrome, an inherited disease&#xD;
      causing deafness or impaired hearing, visual problems, and, in some cases, unsteadiness or&#xD;
      balance problems. Patients with type 1 Usher syndrome usually are deaf from birth and have&#xD;
      speech and balance problems. Patients with type 2 disease generally are hearing impaired but&#xD;
      have no balance problems. Patients with type 3 disease have progressive hearing loss and&#xD;
      balance problems. All patients develop retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disease that causes poor&#xD;
      night vision and eventually, blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of any age with Usher syndrome may be eligible for this study. Patients who have had&#xD;
      eye and hearing evaluations are asked to send their medical records to the research team at&#xD;
      the National Eye Institute (NEI) for review. They are also asked to have a blood sample drawn&#xD;
      by a medical professional and sent to NEI for genetic analysis. Finally, they are interviewed&#xD;
      about their family histories, particularly about other relative with eye disease. Patients&#xD;
      who have not been evaluated previously have the following tests and procedures at NIH:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family medical history, especially regarding eye disease. A family tree is drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for genetic studies of Usher syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity and eye pressure, and to examine pupils, lens,&#xD;
           retina, and eye movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram (ERG) to test the function of visual cells. Wearing eye patches, the&#xD;
           patient sits in a dark room for 30 minutes. Electrodes are taped to the forehead and the&#xD;
           eye patches are removed. The surface of the eye is numbed with eye drops and contact&#xD;
           lenses are placed on the eyes. The patient looks inside a hollow, dark globe and sees a&#xD;
           series of light flashes. Then a light is turned on inside the globe and more flashes&#xD;
           appear. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina when&#xD;
           the light flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected&#xD;
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina&#xD;
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if&#xD;
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel&#xD;
           abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hearing tests to help determine the patient's type of Usher syndrome. Tests to evaluate&#xD;
           hearing include examination of both ears with an otoscope, evaluation of the middle ear&#xD;
           and inner ear, and hearing tests using earphones that deliver tones and words the&#xD;
           subject listens and responds to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vestibular testing for balance function. Balance testing involves three procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videonystagmography: This test records eye movements with little cameras. First the patient&#xD;
      follows the movements of some small lights. Next, while wearing goggles, the patient lies on&#xD;
      an exam table and turns to the right and left. Lastly, a soft stream of air is blown into the&#xD;
      patient's ears four times, once in each ear with cool air and once in each ear with warm air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotary chair test: With electrodes placed on the forehead, the patient sits in a rotary chair&#xD;
      in a dark room. Several red lights appear on the wall of the room and the patient follows the&#xD;
      lights as they move back and forth. Then the chair turns at several speeds, all slower than a&#xD;
      merry-go-round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular evoked potential: Electrodes are placed behind the patient's ear and at the base&#xD;
      of the neck. Seated in a reclining chair and wearing earphones, the patient hears a brief&#xD;
      series of loud clicking sounds. When the sounds are on, the patient is asked to lift his or&#xD;
      her head up a few inches from the chair. The electrodes record information from the muscles&#xD;
      in the neck as the sounds enter the ear.&#xD;

      Background and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Usher syndromes are a group of clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous&#xD;
      autosomal recessive syndromes. On the basis of clinical findings, at least three types exist.&#xD;
      Patients with Usher type I are born deaf, have vestibular problems, and are thought to&#xD;
      perceive night blindness in early childhood. Patients with Usher type II are born with a&#xD;
      hearing deficit but are able to develop intelligible speech, do not have balance problems;&#xD;
      night vision problems, and visual field changes are noted later. Patients with Usher type III&#xD;
      are born with relatively good hearing that deteriorates over a decade or more; they can have&#xD;
      progressive balance problems and they report night blindness in childhood or teens. Seven&#xD;
      genes have been mapped so far for Usher type I while five of these genes have been&#xD;
      identified. For Usher type II, four genes have been mapped and three of these have been&#xD;
      identified while there is one cloned gene for Usher type III. Quite a lot of information is&#xD;
      still unknown regarding the genetic nature of this syndrome. The picture of the three&#xD;
      clinical types of Usher syndrome has also not been well studied up to this point and cross&#xD;
      sectional studies seems to be the only source of the information available so far, regarding&#xD;
      the natural history of the disease. The aim of this protocol is to better study the natural&#xD;
      history of the disease and also make specific genotype-phenotype correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 200 participants, including patients affected with all three clinical types of&#xD;
      Usher syndrome and up to 200 unaffected relatives will be enrolled to the protocol.&#xD;
      Unaffected family members, primarily parents and siblings will be enrolled to provide a blood&#xD;
      sample when considered helpful for linkage analysis. Family members will be considered&#xD;
      unaffected if they have had a previous normal examination and they don t have any symptoms of&#xD;
      decreased night or peripheral vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo ophthalmologic, audiologic and vestibular evaluation in order to be&#xD;
      clinically characterized. Blood will be obtained by all participating subjects for the&#xD;
      molecular studies. Patients who cannot come to NIH or a collaborating Institution for&#xD;
      participation will be asked to provide a blood sample for genotyping and a copy of their&#xD;
      ophthalmologic, audiology and vestibular records, to classify phenotype. Each off-site&#xD;
      participant will be consented over the phone by an NEI investigator. All participants will be&#xD;
      requested to fill out a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affected participants will be phenotypically categorized in one of the three clinical types&#xD;
      based on audiology and vestibular findings&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible participants must:&#xD;

             clinical characteristics for USH1, USH2 and USH3 as defined by the Usher syndrome&#xD;
             consortium. ; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. be unaffected family members of a proband with Usher s syndrome, primarily parents and&#xD;
             siblings. Family members will be considered unaffected by history if they have had&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients will be ineligible if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. had an intrauterine infection, perinatal/congenital infections, or intrauterine and&#xD;
             birth complications. These conditions can result in damage to both the auditory or&#xD;
             visual system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have concurrent inherited or acquired conditions that affect the visual and/or&#xD;
             auditory system and significantly alter the phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both affected and unaffected individuals will be ineligible if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are unwilling or unable to provide a blood sample or unable to undergo the study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Are younger than 2 years old.&#xD;
