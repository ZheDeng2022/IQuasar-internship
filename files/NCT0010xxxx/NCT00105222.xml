  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how nitrite infusions affect exercise tolerance (how much a person&#xD;
      can exercise before having to stop). Exercise ability is limited by how fast oxygen can be&#xD;
      delivered to the body and how fast the body can produce energy. Both of these processes are&#xD;
      affected by nitric oxide (NO), a gas produced by cells that line blood vessels. NO is&#xD;
      important in regulating blood vessel dilation, and consequently, blood flow. Nitrite may act&#xD;
      as a storehouse for nitric oxide and be able to improve exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age who can use an exercise bicycle may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram, breathing tests, blood tests, and a pregnancy test for women&#xD;
      who are able to bear children. Pregnant women are excluded from the study. The screening&#xD;
      session includes practice exercise on the bicycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants exercise on a stationery exercise bicycle for about 30 minutes on each of two&#xD;
      study days. During the test, they breathe in and out of a mouthpiece that allows inhaled and&#xD;
      exhaled respiratory gases to be measured. Before subjects begin to exercise, a small tube is&#xD;
      placed in the artery of their forearm inside the elbow. A longer tube called a central line&#xD;
      is placed in a deeper vein in the neck after the area has been numbed. A thinner tube, called&#xD;
      a pulmonary artery catheter, is placed through the central line and advanced into the&#xD;
      chambers of the heart, through the heart valve, and into the lung artery. This catheter&#xD;
      measures various pressures directly in the heart and lungs. Blood samples are drawn through&#xD;
      the catheter also, to avoid the need for multiple needle sticks. Another tube is placed in&#xD;
      the vein of the other arm to deliver medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty minutes after all the tubes are placed, a blood sample is drawn for baseline&#xD;
      measurements. Then, either saline (sterile salt water) or nitrite is injected into the tube&#xD;
      in the arm vein. Thirty minutes after the injection, the subject starts exercising on the&#xD;
      bicycle. The work setting on the bicycle is increased every minute, and the subject pedals&#xD;
      until he or she is too tired to continue. During the test, a small blood sample is collected&#xD;
      every 2 minutes. Heart rate, blood pressure, and heart rhythms are continuously monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the test on the first day, participants are admitted to the hospital to rest for the&#xD;
      remainder of the afternoon and evening. The tubes are kept in place for the following&#xD;
      morning, when the procedure is repeated exactly as before, except that subjects who received&#xD;
      saline the first day are given nitrite the second day, and vice versa.&#xD;

      During exercise, there is a lag in the rate at which oxygen uptake (VO2) rises to meet energy&#xD;
      demand. It is uncertain whether this limitation is due to inadequate O2 delivery to working&#xD;
      muscle, limitations to the rate at which mitochondria can generate ATP to meet demand, or by&#xD;
      a combination of both. Both of these limitations may be modulated by nitric oxide. Nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) has been implicated in numerous physiological functions, including control of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle vasodilation and oxidative metabolism. During exercise, NO will both&#xD;
      vasodilate skeletal muscle and modulate (inhibit) mitochondrial respiration. The latter&#xD;
      effect could either decrease oxygen extraction by limiting the ability of mitochondria to&#xD;
      utilize oxygen, or paradoxically increase oxygen utilization by inhibiting mitochondria&#xD;
      proximal to blood vessels, an effect that facilitates oxygen diffusion to distal tissue and&#xD;
      mitochondria (NO dependent facilitated oxygen diffusion). Previous studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that NO production increases during exercise and regional inhibition of NO production from&#xD;
      endothelial NO synthase reduces exercise-dependent blood flow by approximately 10%. NOS&#xD;
      inhibitors such as N(G) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) have been shown to decrease&#xD;
      exercise tolerance, and NO precursors (L-arginine) to increase exercise tolerance.&#xD;
      Administration of inhaled NO during exercise has not been shown to increase exercise&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the potential role of nitrite bioconversion to NO during hypoxia, is likely that&#xD;
      nitrite plays an important role in modulating exercise physiology. We therefore hypothesize&#xD;
      that during aerobic, and in particular anaerobic exercise, erythrocyte and plasma nitrite&#xD;
      will be converted to NO and modulate muscle blood flow, mitochondrial respiration, oxygen&#xD;
      diffusion and ultimately maximal oxygen consumption. While we expect these effects will&#xD;
      increase maximal oxygen consumption and increase work output, it is also distinctly possible&#xD;
      that NO production from nitrite during exercise will inhibit mitochondrial respiration and&#xD;
      decrease maximal oxygen consumption. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of aerobic-to-anaerobic exercise on circulating nitrite stores in erythrocytes and&#xD;
      plasma in the arterial and central venous circulation and the effects of systemic nitrite&#xD;
      infusion on aerobic and anaerobic exercise capacity. Physiological parameters including&#xD;
      maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), maximal CO2 and NO production (VCO2max and VNOmax),&#xD;
      maximal work, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), anaerobic threshold, and pulmonary gas&#xD;
      exchange (VO2, VCO2, VE) will be monitored during exercise with and without nitrite&#xD;
      infusions. Our primary endpoint will be VO2 max with nitrite infusion compared to VO2 max&#xD;
      with saline placebo infusion.&#xD;
