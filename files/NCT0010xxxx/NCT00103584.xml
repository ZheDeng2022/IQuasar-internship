  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of LC16m8, a modified&#xD;
      vaccinia vaccine. After consent and thorough screening (including safety labs, EKG, and&#xD;
      medical history), healthy, previously unvaccinated volunteers between the ages of 18-34 will&#xD;
      receive a single vaccination of either LC16m8 or the current US-licensed smallpox vaccine,&#xD;
      Dryvax. Volunteers will be blindly randomized to a treatment group in a 4:1 ratio (4 LC16m8&#xD;
      to 1 Dryvax recipient). Follow-up clinical evaluations, laboratory testing, EKGs and cardiac&#xD;
      assessments will be done at regularly scheduled follow-up visits for 1 year after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;

             for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In good health, as ascertained by medical history, clinical assessment, and baseline&#xD;
             (screening) laboratory assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative ELISA for HIV or, if indeterminate, Western blot or other assay confirming&#xD;
             that the serostatus does not reflect HIV infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Negative urine glucose by urinalysis (UA).&#xD;

          -  Adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine â‰¤1.5 mg/dL; urine protein &lt;100&#xD;
             mg/dL, or trace or negative proteinuria by UA, and an estimated creatinine clearance&#xD;
             of &gt;55 mL/min. Renal function is measured to ensure that subjects could meet criteria&#xD;
             for use of Vistide, should this be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cell count (WBC) within normal&#xD;
             limits for males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EKG and EEG (for those being tested) baseline readings within normal limits (these&#xD;
             will be read at a central site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from donating blood (other than study-related) throughout the study&#xD;
             and for a period of at least 21 days (or until scab separation) after vaccination. In&#xD;
             some cases, state laws are more restrictive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for females at screening and within 2 days prior to&#xD;
             vaccination.&#xD;

             effective birth control methods and not become pregnant during the course of the&#xD;
             study. A female is considered to have childbearing potential unless post-menopausal or&#xD;
             surgically sterilized. Effective birth control methods include licensed, approved&#xD;
             hormonal methods such as pills, patch, injection, or implant.&#xD;
