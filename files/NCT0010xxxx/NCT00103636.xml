  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of extending the dwell time of&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous cannulas on clinical outcomes and cost.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among hospitalized patients, intravenous therapy is the most common invasive procedure. It is&#xD;
      associated with a phlebitis rate of between 1.1% and 63% and a central venous catheter&#xD;
      related bacteremia rate of approximately 3.0%. Catheter related blood-stream infections have&#xD;
      an attributable mortality rate of 12% to 25%. Factors thought to be associated with these&#xD;
      complications include insertion techniques, catheter securement, type of catheter used, type&#xD;
      of infusate and additives, post-insertion catheter care and length of time the catheter&#xD;
      remains in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Centers of Disease Control Guidelines provide direction for intravenous therapy&#xD;
      management including a recommendation that peripheral intravenous catheters should be&#xD;
      re-sited every 72-96 hours. Data underpinning the recommendation was collected in 1992, over&#xD;
      a decade ago. Since that time, there have been improvements in catheter design and&#xD;
      composition, and prospective surveillance studies have demonstrated the safety of longer&#xD;
      dwell times. To date, these observations have not been validated in adults, using randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-siting intravenous cannulas causes discomfort to patients and has a high recurrent cost.&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study is to compare the rates of peripheral catheter-related&#xD;
      blood stream infection, catheter-related local infection, phlebitis and obstruction between&#xD;
      two groups of patients - those having routine catheter changes every 72 hours and those&#xD;
      having catheter changes only when clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      That changing intravenous peripheral catheters when indicated by clinical signs compared to&#xD;
      changing intravenous catheters every 3 days reduces the incidence of intravenous catheter&#xD;
      related morbidity.&#xD;
