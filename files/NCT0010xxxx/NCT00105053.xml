      This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with prostate cancer with&#xD;
      the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Prostate cancer vaccine. It will establish the proper&#xD;
      vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The&#xD;
      vaccine contains killed prostate cancer cells containing a mouse gene that causes the&#xD;
      production of a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the&#xD;
      immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the&#xD;
      patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the&#xD;
      tumor to remain stable or shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 19 years of age or older with hormone refractory prostate cancer that has recurred&#xD;
      or no longer responds to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will&#xD;
      be screened with medical history and physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest&#xD;
      x-rays and CT scans. MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans may be obtained if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive twelve vaccinations two weeks apart from each other. The vaccines&#xD;
      will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase&#xD;
      I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the&#xD;
      vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase&#xD;
      II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be&#xD;
      safe in Phase I. Monthly blood samples will be drawn during the 6 months of vaccine&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 2 months for the&#xD;
      remaining first year (6 months) after vaccination and then every 3 months for the next 2&#xD;
      years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FACT-P Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's&#xD;
           general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment,&#xD;
           monthly during treatment, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It&#xD;
           includes questions on the severity of prostate cancer symptoms and the ability to&#xD;
           perform normal activities of daily life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer found in American men, other than skin&#xD;
      cancer. The American Cancer Society estimated that there were about 230,900 new cases of&#xD;
      prostate cancer in the United States in the year 2004. About 29,900 men will die of this&#xD;
      disease. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, exceeded only by&#xD;
      lung cancer. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to prostate cancer immunotherapy&#xD;
      using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans in an attempt to&#xD;
      vaccinate patients against their prostate cancer. The expression of the murine alpha (1,3)&#xD;
      galactosyltransferase [alpha (1,3) GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of alpha&#xD;
      (1,3) galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These&#xD;
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs&#xD;
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing&#xD;
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of&#xD;
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most&#xD;
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally&#xD;
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies&#xD;
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with hormone&#xD;
      refractory prostate cancer will undergo a series of twelve intradermal injections with a&#xD;
      vaccine composed of irradiated allogeneic prostate cancer cell lines (HAP-1 and HAP-2) that&#xD;
      have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based&#xD;
      retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha (1,3) GT gene. Endpoints of the study include&#xD;
      determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and&#xD;
      immunological responses.&#xD;
