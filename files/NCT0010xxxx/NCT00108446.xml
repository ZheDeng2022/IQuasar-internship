      This study is being done to collect new information on irritable bowel syndrome, a disease&#xD;
      that causes abdominal pain that does get better with treatment or keeps coming back&#xD;
      (&quot;chronic&quot;). To better understand what causes the irritable bowel syndrome, we are studying&#xD;
      drugs used to treat pain, dextromethorphan, naloxone, fentanyl, and lidocaine. We will study&#xD;
      the effects these drugs have on experimental pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dextromethorphan is used in non-prescription cough syrups. Naloxone is used for reversing the&#xD;
      effects of narcotic pain relievers. Fentanyl is a narcotic used to treat pain and to make a&#xD;
      person relaxed (sedated) before anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to see what kinds of&#xD;
      pain are affected by these drugs in persons who have irritable bowel syndrome and persons who&#xD;
      do not have this problem.&#xD;

      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic&#xD;
      abdominal pain and altered bowel function (diarrhea and/or constipation) that effects up to&#xD;
      20% of the United States population. Although the pathophysiology of IBS is unknown, visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity (i.e., decreased pain thresholds in response to gut distension) is a&#xD;
      biological marker of the disorder. The mechanisms that lead to visceral hypersensitivity,&#xD;
      however, are currently unknown. As a consequence of our current VA-supported studies, our&#xD;
      laboratory has acquired evidence that patients with IBS and visceral hypersensitivity also&#xD;
      have cutaneous hypersensitivity in response to experimental thermal pain stimuli. These new&#xD;
      findings differ from previous investigations that indicated IBS-associated hypersensitivity&#xD;
      is limited to the gut. Rather, our data suggest that patients with IBS have alterations in&#xD;
      central pain processing mechanisms that may represent the underlying pathophysiological basis&#xD;
      for visceral and cutaneous hypersensitivity. Based on our preliminary data, we propose that&#xD;
      alterations in spinal processing mechanisms are similar in patients with IBS to those that&#xD;
      have been described for patients with other chronic pain disorders. Cutaneous&#xD;
      hypersensitivity is also seen in other chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia where&#xD;
      altered central pain processing mechanisms have been shown to be responsible for maintaining&#xD;
      hypersensitivity. In our current proposal, we hypothesize that IBS patients have increased&#xD;
      peripheral and central afferent processing of nociceptive cutaneous and visceral stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Objective #1. To determine if lidocaine applied to the rectum decreases&#xD;
           visceral hyperalgesia, as tested by nociceptive rectal distension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Objective #2. To determine if lidocaine applied to the rectum decreases&#xD;
           cutaneous heat hyperalgesia to test for the presence or absence of central hyperalgesia&#xD;
           in IBS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Objective #3. To determine the relationships between doses of IV lidocaine,&#xD;
           serum levels of IV lidocaine, and their anti-hyperalgesic effects, as tested by rectal&#xD;
           distension and cutaneous heat stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective #4. To determine the effect of rectal lidocaine on clinical pain and&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed studies will test the central hypothesis using well-controlled sensory stimuli&#xD;
      designed to separately evaluate central and peripheral mechanisms. The objectives will be&#xD;
      accomplished by systematically applying and comparing pharmacological and psychophysical&#xD;
      studies to IBS patients and controls. This application is an extension of the principal&#xD;
      investigator's current VA Advanced Career Development Award that examines the neurobiology of&#xD;
      visceral hypersensitivity in Persian Gulf veterans who returned home with chronic abdominal&#xD;
      pain. The proposed Clinical Research Program will study afferent mechanisms of visceral and&#xD;
      cutaneous hypersensitivity in veterans with IBS. Our laboratory is uniquely positioned to use&#xD;
      our expertise in psychophysical and pharmacologic evaluation of patients with fibromyalgia to&#xD;
      study patients with IBS. The results of this current proposal will lead to larger clinical&#xD;
      trials with sodium-channel blockers (i.e., lidocaine, mexiletine) as potential therapeutic&#xD;
      agents for veterans with IBS.&#xD;
