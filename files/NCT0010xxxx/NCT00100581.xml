  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of HIV infected people in the U.S. are also infected with hepatitis&#xD;
      C virus (HCV). The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of anti-HIV therapy on&#xD;
      treatment of HCV with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (PEG/RBV).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 15% to 30% of HIV infected people in the U.S. are also infected with HCV. Since&#xD;
      the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of HIV, HCV infection has&#xD;
      emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HCV/HIV coinfected patients. One&#xD;
      infection often accelerates the progression of the other, and effective management strategies&#xD;
      for both infections need to be developed for HCV/HIV coinfected patients. This study will&#xD;
      determine whether HIV ART followed by HCV therapy taken concurrently with ART results in&#xD;
      better treatment outcomes compared to HCV therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last up to 102 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      arms. Arm A participants will receive 24 to 30 weeks of ART consisting of tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) and either efavirenz (EFV) or&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). If deemed eligible, Arm A participants will continue their ART&#xD;
      regimen and begin a concurrent PEG/RBV regimen for up to 48 weeks. At Week 48, participants&#xD;
      in Arm A will stop PEG/RBV and will be followed for an additional 24 weeks on ART alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B participants will receive PEG/RBV alone for up to 48 weeks. At Week 48, participants in&#xD;
      Arm B will be followed for an additional 48 weeks with no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 20 study visits over 102 weeks for Arm A participants and 18 study visits over&#xD;
      96 weeks for Arm B participants. Blood collection and clinical assessment will occur at all&#xD;
      visits, and urine collection will occur at selected visits. Participants will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete adherence questionnaires. Participants in this study are encouraged to also&#xD;
      enroll in ACTG A5128.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  HCV genotype 1 infected&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4 count of 300 cells/mm3 or greater within 45 days prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ART-naive or off ART for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to accept randomly assigned study treatment&#xD;
