  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      M40403 was found to be effective in reducing pain in animal models and in clinical studies of&#xD;
      subjects who were experiencing pain after dental surgery. The proposed study is designed to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of M40403 when co-administered with an opioid in subjects&#xD;
      with pain due to cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      M40403 in subjects with pain related to cancer. Because the effects of M40403 have not been&#xD;
      previously investigated in subjects with cancer-related pain, the safety of single doses of&#xD;
      0.0625, 0.125, and 0.25 mg/kg of M40403 will be evaluated in an open label phase of the&#xD;
      study. These doses of M40403 are similar to doses that were used in subjects who were&#xD;
      experiencing pain in prior clinical studies with M40403.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has somatic or visceral pain due to solid tumor cancers (adrenal, basal cell, and&#xD;
             breast cancers; transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder or uroepithelium;&#xD;
             cholangiocarcinoma; small intestine/colon/rectal cancers; adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
             esophageal/gastric cancers; hepatocellular, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers;&#xD;
             bony/soft tissue sarcomas; small cell lung cancer; non small cell lung cancer; and&#xD;
             adenocarcinomas of unknown primary origin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has moderate to severe pain as measured by the Pain Intensity Assessment (categorical&#xD;
             scale), and a pain intensity measurement of greater than or equal to 40 mm by visual&#xD;
             analog scale (VAS) prior to the morning dose of pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable chronic cancer pain as evidenced by a stable, scheduled opioid regimen over 7&#xD;
             days prior to treatment with study medication and fewer than 3 rescue doses per day&#xD;
             averaged over the 3 days prior to treatment with study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone or an oxycodone/acetaminophen&#xD;
             combination for the treatment of cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status of 0 to 2 by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If taking concomitant medication, subject has been on a steady regimen for the past 2&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;

             opinion, may interfere with study participation or completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of chronic analgesic or tranquilizer use (except for the subject's&#xD;
             current pain medication [morphine, hydromorphone, and oxycodone, or an&#xD;
             oxycodone/acetaminophen combination]) or known substance abuse within 90 days prior to&#xD;

             anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants,&#xD;
             antiarrhythmics, bisphosphonates or gabapentinoids will not be initiated during the&#xD;
             study. Patients receiving stable doses of these agents for pain management or other&#xD;
             indications for &gt;1 week prior to the screening visit may continue treatment with these&#xD;
             provided that the dose remains constant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is unwilling to abstain from alcohol from at least 8 hours prior to dosing with study&#xD;

             hours prior to dosing until time of discharge from the study unit.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would&#xD;
             contraindicate study participation, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST),&#xD;
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine level greater than&#xD;
