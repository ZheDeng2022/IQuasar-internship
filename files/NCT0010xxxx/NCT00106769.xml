  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine intended to prevent West Nile&#xD;
      virus (WNV) infection and determine if it causes side effects. WNV symptoms may vary from&#xD;
      fever and headache, to a polio-like syndrome with paralysis. Infection rarely results in&#xD;
      death. The vaccine used in this study contains DNA that instructs the body to produce a small&#xD;
      amount of a protein found in WNV. If the body creates resistance or immunity to these&#xD;
      proteins, then the vaccine may protect against WNV. Study participants cannot get WNV from&#xD;
      the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 years and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, including a pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant. Patients undergo the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine injections: Vaccines are given as injections in the upper arm, using a&#xD;
           needleless system called the Biojector 2000. The first injection is on study day 0, the&#xD;
           second on day 28 (+/-) 7 days, and the third on day 56 (+/-) 7 days. There must be at&#xD;
           least 21 days between injections. The pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential&#xD;
           is repeated the day of each vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diary card: Participants are given a 5-day diary card after each injection to record&#xD;
           their temperature and any symptoms and side effects they may experience for up to 5 days&#xD;
           after the injection. The diary cards are returned to the clinic at visits scheduled 2&#xD;
           weeks after each injection. Side effects and symptoms also must be reported immediately&#xD;
           to a study nurse or doctor, and a clinic visit may be required for an examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic visits: At day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32, participants have a&#xD;
           medical history, physical examination (if needed) and blood tests. Vital signs and&#xD;
           weight are also recorded. Lymph nodes are examined at day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and&#xD;
           12, and urine samples are collected at day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the blood drawn during this study is used for genetic tests to see if different types&#xD;
      of immune response to a vaccine are related to genetic differences in people.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a Phase I open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune&#xD;
      response of a recombinant DNA vaccine, VRC-WNVDNA017-00-VP. The hypothesis is that this&#xD;
      regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to the West Nile&#xD;
      virus. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of the&#xD;
      investigational vaccine. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: VRC-WNVDNA017-00-VP is composed of a single closed circular DNA plasmid&#xD;
      that encodes the WNV viral proteins precursor transmembrane (PrM) and envelope (E). Vaccine&#xD;
      vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly (in deltoid muscle) using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 50 years old) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Fifteen volunteers will be enrolled and receive 3 injections on the schedule&#xD;
      shown in the schema. The protocol requires nine clinic visits and three telephone follow-up&#xD;
      contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 32 weeks clinical follow-up for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the regimen; secondary immunogenicity&#xD;
      endpoints are an ELISPOT and an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for WNV-specific&#xD;
      T cell responses and a WNV ELISA assay. The principal timepoints for ICS and ELISPOT are Week&#xD;
      0 (baseline), Week 8 and Week 12. ICS and ELISPOT at other study timepoints, as well as other&#xD;
      immunogenicity assays through Week 32, will be completed as exploratory evaluations. Stored&#xD;
      sera will be tested for WNV neutralizing antibody once an assay is developed.&#xD;
