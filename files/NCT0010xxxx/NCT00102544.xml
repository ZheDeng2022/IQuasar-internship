  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of an experimental tracking device&#xD;
      for locating abnormalities during invasive procedures, such as biopsy or ablation, that&#xD;
      cannot easily be visualized by usual imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scans or ultrasound. Some lesions, such as certain liver or kidney tumors, small endocrine&#xD;
      abnormalities, and others, may be hard to find or only visible for a few seconds. The new&#xD;
      method uses a needle with a miniature tracking device buried inside the metal that tells&#xD;
      where the tip of the needle is located, somewhat like a mini GPS, or global positioning&#xD;
      system. It uses a very weak magnet to localize the device like a miniature satellite system.&#xD;
      This study will explore whether this system can be used in the future to more accurately&#xD;
      place the needle in or near the desired location or abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have a lesion that needs to be biopsied or an ablation&#xD;
      procedure that requires CT guidance may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened&#xD;
      with a medical history and review of medical records, including imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the biopsy or ablation procedure as they normally would, with the&#xD;
      following exceptions: some stickers are placed on the skin before the procedure and a very&#xD;
      weak magnet is placed nearby. The needles used are similar to the ones that would normally be&#xD;
      used except that they contain a metal coil or spring buried deep within the needle metal. The&#xD;
      procedure involves the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Small 1-cm plastic donuts are place on the skin with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A planning CT scan is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The CT scan is sent to the computer and matched to the patient's body location with the&#xD;
           help of a very weak magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The needle used for the procedure is placed towards the target tissue or abnormality and&#xD;
           the &quot;smart needle&quot; location lights up on the old CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A repeat CT is done as it normally is to look for the location of the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After the procedure the CT scans are examined to determine how well the new tool located&#xD;
           the needle in the old scan.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of targeting lesions or a specific area for surgery, angiography,&#xD;
      CT-guided, or ultrasound-guided biopsy, or ablation, currently may be limited by the&#xD;
      visibility of a target during the procedure. Accurate therapeutic intervention may depend&#xD;
      upon accurate device placement, which may be very difficult in certain settings, such as when&#xD;
      a liver tumor only is visible for a brief moment in time during the transient arterial phase&#xD;
      of a contrast injection, soon disappearing on dynamic imaging. Surgery, angiography, image&#xD;
      guided therapies and diagnostic procedures could be vastly improved by enabling the use of&#xD;
      pre-procedural imaging during the procedure [such as location of difficult to visualize or&#xD;
      transiently visible targets]. Tracking devices allow the use of pre-operative imaging during&#xD;
      the procedure. Having this information available could vastly improve targeting accuracy of&#xD;
      surgery, angiography, CT-guided, or ultrasound-guided biopsy or ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A method of improving targeting could potentially benefit patients in the future by reducing&#xD;
      total radiation exposure during CT scan or fluoroscopic monitoring of a biopsy, or decreasing&#xD;
      certain surgical risks, although these are not specific subjects of this study. Various&#xD;
      methods of device tracking have been used in the past throughout the 20th century in&#xD;
      neurosurgery with the use of stereotactic frames for a similar purpose, to register&#xD;
      pre-operative imaging to the patient during invasive procedures to guide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the clinical utility of electromagnetic tracking during interventional procedures&#xD;
      in specific patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients must have a pre-operative CT, MR, or PET scan performed at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age greater than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients must be actively enrolled on an NIH protocol and be scheduled for surgery,&#xD;
           angiography, or CT- or ultrasound-guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory interventional study examining the use of a guidance system for&#xD;
      navigating and monitoring devices like biopsy and ablation needles, ultrasound transducers,&#xD;
      needle guides, guidewires, scalpels, and cauterization devices (herein referred to as&#xD;
      device(s) ) for localization in relation to pre-operative images.There are 9 cohorts included&#xD;
      in this protocol. The Open/Laparoscopic surgery and Angiography surgery cohorts are no longer&#xD;
      open for accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prostate biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percutaneous biopsy for diagnostic correlation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. percutaneous ablation for needle placement compilations&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Open/Laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Auto registration for biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Auto registration for ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. PET registration&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. prostate biopsy on which to determine the predictive value and relative strength of each&#xD;
           MRI sequence in predicting cancer at a specific prostate core location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total accrual ceiling for this protocol is 3195 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cohorts open for accrual are using exploratory interventions to define the specific&#xD;
      patient population where fusion used during interventional procedures may have clinical&#xD;
      value, and to characterize that clinical value in a specific patient population, such as but&#xD;
      not limited to patients with specific regions of the prostate targeted, specific prostate&#xD;
      volumes, prior negative prostate biopsies, or PSA values within a specific range.&#xD;
