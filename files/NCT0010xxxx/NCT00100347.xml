  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-center, open-label, escalating dose study is to assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of PPI-2458 in subjects with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)and solid tumors.&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated every other day (QOD) with PPI-2458 while being monitored closely&#xD;
      for adverse events.&#xD;

      The study will first determine the dose level that maximally inhibits MetAP2 in white blood&#xD;
      cells (WBC). Once this dose level is reached, the study will proceed into the next cohort&#xD;
      (dose level) to investigate the dose level that maximally inhibits MetAP2 in tumor tissue&#xD;
      biopsies. Free MetAP2 levels (WBC and/or tumor tissue) will be analyzed during the first&#xD;
      cycle (28 days) of treatment. Cohorts are expected to enroll every two cycles until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD)is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Initial Treatment Phase of two treatment cycles of PPI-2458, subjects may continue&#xD;
      into a Continuous Treatment Phase at the discretion of the Investigator. In order to be&#xD;
      eligible for the Continuous Treatment Phase of the protocol, subjects must have received some&#xD;
      benefit (e.g., stable disease) as assessed by the Investigator within the Initial Treatment&#xD;
      Phase and must continue to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
