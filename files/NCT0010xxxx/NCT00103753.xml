  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia major is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin synthesis, rendering individuals&#xD;
      dependent upon lifelong blood transfusions. Consequently, iron overload occurs and patients&#xD;
      have shortened life expectancy with the most common cause of death being heart failure. This&#xD;
      trial tests whether the combination of traditional therapy (deferoxamine) with a newer drug&#xD;
      (deferiprone) will prove more effective in removing cardiac iron than deferoxamine alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia Major (TM) is a hereditary anemia resulting from a single gene defect that&#xD;
      results in abnormal red cell production. The survival of affected individuals is dependent&#xD;
      upon lifelong blood transfusions. Unfortunately, this causes total body iron overload, and&#xD;
      50% of the patients in the UK are dead by the age of 35. Approximately 70% of these deaths&#xD;
      result from heart failure which results as a consequence of cardiac iron toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) technique (which exploits the fact that T2* signal&#xD;
      decay relates to tissue iron) developed at the Royal Brompton Hospital provides a&#xD;
      non-invasive and reproducible assessment of cardiac iron. CMR therefore provides a very&#xD;
      useful method to assess response to new treatments in this condition. Using cardiac T2* as a&#xD;
      primary endpoint, we will investigate whether the oral chelator, deferiprone in combination&#xD;
      with traditional treatment (deferoxamine), is superior in removing cardiac iron as compared&#xD;
      to deferoxamine alone. This trial will provide the first randomized controlled,&#xD;
      double-blinded, evidence for the efficacy of combination treatment in TM.&#xD;
