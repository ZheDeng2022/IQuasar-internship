             occurring during the parent study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of central nervous system disease (e.g., primary brain tumor or seizures&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned&#xD;
             participation in an experimental drug study other than a Genentech-sponsored rhuMAb&#xD;
             VEGF cancer study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (within 3 weeks of the first infusion of this study) major surgical procedure,&#xD;
             biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant traumatic injury&#xD;
