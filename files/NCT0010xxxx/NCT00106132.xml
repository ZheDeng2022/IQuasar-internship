      This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of two treatments-injections of&#xD;
      triamcinolone acetonide into the eye vs. standard laser therapy-for macular edema (swelling&#xD;
      in the center of the retina) that is caused by blockage in a retinal blood vessel. Edema&#xD;
      caused by blockage in a large vessel is called central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Edema&#xD;
      caused by blockage in a smaller vein is called branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).&#xD;
      Triamcinolone acetonide is a steroid drug that reduces swelling; the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration has approved it for injection into joints and muscles to treat inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with macular edema due to CRVO or BRVO of between 3 and 18&#xD;
      months' duration may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical&#xD;
      history, blood pressure measurement, and urine pregnancy test for women who can become&#xD;
      pregnant. Screening also includes the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity and eye pressure, and to examine the cornea,&#xD;
           lens, and retina. The pupils are dilated with drops for this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected&#xD;
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina&#xD;
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if&#xD;
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel&#xD;
           abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness. The eye is examined with a&#xD;
           machine that produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. The patient is seated in&#xD;
           front of a machine and looks at a pattern of flashing and rotating red and green lights,&#xD;
           first with one eye and then with the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus photography to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur&#xD;
           in the future. Photographs of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a bright&#xD;
           light into the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive triamcinolone injections or standard treatment.&#xD;
      Triamcinolone is given in either a 1-mg or 4-mg dose. Standard treatment for CRVO and for&#xD;
      BRVO with excessive blood in the retina is observation. Standard treatment for BRVO without&#xD;
      excessive blood is laser therapy. Patients with BRVO who do not qualify for laser therapy&#xD;
      when they enter the study may have it later if blood clears enough to permit treatment. The&#xD;
      procedures for triamcinolone injections and laser therapy are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triamcinolone acetonide: The eye is numbed with anesthetic drops and the study drug is&#xD;
           injected into the vitreous, the jelly-like substance located between the back of the&#xD;
           lens and the retina. Patients apply antibiotic drops at home for 3 days following the&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser treatment: The eye is numbed with anesthetic drops and a special contact lens is&#xD;
           placed on the eye during the laser beam application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are followed every 4 months for 3 years. Additional visits may be scheduled if&#xD;
      needed. Patients who receive triamcinolone injections are also examined within 1 week of each&#xD;
      injection and 1 month after each injection. At the 4-month visits patients undergo repeat eye&#xD;
      examination and fundus photography. Optical coherence tomography is done at some visits, and&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography is repeated at months 4, 12 and 24. Blood pressure is measured at&#xD;
      months 12, 24 and 36. Patients may be retreated with triamcinolone injections or laser&#xD;
      therapy as often as every 4 months, depending on their response to treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Macular edema is a major cause of vision loss in patients with central retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
      (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Currently, there is no effective treatment&#xD;
      for macular edema associated with CRVO. For macular edema associated with BRVO, grid laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation may be an effective treatment, but many patients derive limited benefit from&#xD;
      this treatment. Therefore, the development of new treatment modalities to treat macular edema&#xD;
      caused by these two conditions is an important research goal. The Standard Care vs.&#xD;
      COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study will compare the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of standard care with intravitreal injection(s) of triamcinolone acetonide to treat macular&#xD;
      edema associated with CRVO and BRVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCORE Study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, Phase III trial to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of standard care versus triamcinolone acetonide injection(s) for the&#xD;
      treatment of macular edema associated with CRVO and BRVO. In each of the two disease areas,&#xD;
      630 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups: standard care,&#xD;
      intravitreal triamcinolone 4 mg, or intravitreal triamcinolone 1 mg. For CRVO participants,&#xD;
      standard care consists of observation of the macular edema. For BRVO participants, standard&#xD;
      care consists of immediate grid laser photocoagulation for study eyes without a dense macular&#xD;
      hemorrhage. For study eyes of BRVO participants with a dense macular hemorrhage, standard&#xD;
      care is observation followed by grid laser photocoagulation if and when clearing of the&#xD;
      hemorrhage permits grid laser photocoagulation. For all three groups, neovascular&#xD;
      complications will be treated as necessary. Repeat treatments will be provided as clinically&#xD;
      indicated based on protocol-specific guidelines. Participants will be followed for 3 years&#xD;
      after randomization. The primary efficacy outcome of this study is improvement by 15 or more&#xD;
      letters from baseline in best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score at the 12-month visit.&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy outcomes include change between baseline and each efficacy outcome&#xD;
      assessment visit in best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score, change in retinal thickness at&#xD;
      the center of the macula and change in area of retinal thickening as assessed by stereoscopic&#xD;
      color fundus photography, and change in retinal thickness and calculated retinal thickening&#xD;
      as assessed by optical coherence tomography. Safety outcomes include injection-related&#xD;
      adverse events such as infectious endophthalmitis, non-infectious endophthalmitis, retinal&#xD;
      detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage and steroid-related adverse events, which include&#xD;
      cataract and elevated intraocular pressure.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        General Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sex: Participants may be male or female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ocular Inclusion Criteria (study eye):&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Participants must have center-involved macular edema secondary to either CRVO or BRVO.&#xD;
        Eyes may be enrolled if macular edema has been documented for at least 3 months and not&#xD;
        longer than 18 months (by patient history or ophthalmologic diagnosis). The following&#xD;
        definitions are used for the purposes of the SCORE Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A CRVO is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhage or other biomicroscopic&#xD;
             evidence of retinal vein occlusion (e.g. telangiectatic capillary bed) and a dilated&#xD;
             venous system (or previously dilated venous system) in all 4 quadrants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A BRVO is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhage or other biomicroscopic&#xD;
             evidence of retinal vein occlusion (e.g. telangiectatic capillary bed) and a dilated&#xD;
             venous system (or previously dilated venous system) in 1 quadrant or less of retina&#xD;
             drained by the affected vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO) is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhage&#xD;
             or other biomicroscopic evidence of retinal vein occlusion (e.g. telangiectatic&#xD;
             capillary bed) and a dilated venous system (or previously dilated venous system) in&#xD;
             more than 1 quadrant but less than all 4 quadrants. Typically, a HRVO is a retinal&#xD;
             vein occlusion that involves 2 altitudinal quadrants. For the purposes of the SCORE&#xD;
             Study, eyes with HRVO will be treated as eyes with BRVO and analyzed with the BRVO&#xD;
             group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. ETDRS visual acuity score of greater than or equal to 34 letters (approximately 20/200)&#xD;
        and less than or equal to 73 letters (approximately 20/40) by the ETDRS visual acuity&#xD;
        protocol at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Mean retinal thickness on two OCT measurements greater than or equal to 250 microns&#xD;
        (central subfield) at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Media clarity, pupillary dilation and participant cooperation sufficient for adequate&#xD;
        fundus photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Stable visual acuity. This is defined as a less than 10 letter improvement in&#xD;
        best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score between the screening visit and the randomization&#xD;
        visit. Those patients with a 10 or more letter improvement between the screening and&#xD;
        randomization visits will be declared temporarily ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Participants with any of the following conditions are ineligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
        the study (e.g., chronic alcoholism or drug abuse, personality disorder or use of major&#xD;
        tranquilizers indicating difficulty in long term follow-up, likelihood of survival of less&#xD;
        than 3 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of study entry that involved&#xD;
        treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;

        other inclusion criteria are met) in the study if the second reading demonstrates a&#xD;
        systolic blood pressure equal to or less than 180 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure is&#xD;
        110 mmHg or less. If the blood pressure is brought to 180 mmHg systolic or less and 110&#xD;
        mmHg diastolic or less by antihypertensive treatment, the patient can become eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
