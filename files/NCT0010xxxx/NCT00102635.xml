  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the modulation of intermediate biological&#xD;
      endpoints of the combination of 4-HPR and SCH66336, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI),&#xD;
      across 4 randomly assigned dose levels in patients with locally advanced or recurrent head&#xD;
      and neck cancer. We will also assess the activity, safety, tolerability and side effects of&#xD;
      4-HPR/SCH66336 and hope to establish a phase II regimen.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug fenretinide is a retinoid that is similar to vitamin A. It is believed that&#xD;
      fenretinide can cause cancer cells to die. SCH66336 is a drug that blocks farnesyl protein&#xD;
      transferase (a substance needed by cancer cells to grow). It is believed that SCH66336 may&#xD;
      selectively stop cancer cells from growing while not affecting normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both SCH66336 and fenretinide are taken orally and must be swallowed whole (i.e., the drugs&#xD;
      may not be broken to make swallowing easier). Individuals who cannot take the study&#xD;
      medications whole by mouth cannot enroll in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study participants will receive SCH66336 twice a day for each day of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
      Participants will also take fenretinide twice a day on Days 1-7 of the same cycle. Before&#xD;
      beginning treatment, participants will have a complete physical exam, including measurement&#xD;
      of height, weight, and vital signs. Participants will have blood and urine tests, a chest&#xD;
      x-ray, and an ECG (heart function test). Females who are able to become pregnant must have a&#xD;
      negative blood pregnancy test. In addition, all participants will have a neurological exam&#xD;
      and will complete a questionnaire about their night vision. Some individuals may need an eye&#xD;
      exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning treatment, participants will have a biopsy of their tumor and will provide a&#xD;
      sample of their buccal mucosa (inner cheek). In the biopsy, a sample of tumor tissue will be&#xD;
      removed with a large needle. The buccal mucosa sample will be obtained by scraping the inside&#xD;
      of the cheek. Participants will also have an extra blood sample (about 2 tablespoons) drawn.&#xD;
      The tumor, buccal mucosa, and blood samples are all being obtained for research purposes only&#xD;
      and will not directly benefit the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, a physician will examine participants at least once a week for the first&#xD;
      cycle of treatment. A treatment cycle is 3 weeks. Participants will also have weekly blood&#xD;
      tests. After the first cycle of treatment, participants will have exams every 3 weeks. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will have urine tests every 3 weeks, a neurological exam after the&#xD;
      first 3 weeks and then as needed, and a chest x-ray every 3 weeks. Every 3 months,&#xD;
      participants will complete a questionnaire about their night vision and will have an eye&#xD;
      exam, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on this study, individuals will also participate in a pharmacokinetic study to measure&#xD;
      the levels of the drugs in the blood. On the first day of treatment, the participant will&#xD;
      have blood samples (about 1 teaspoon each) drawn before taking fenretinide and then 1, 2, 4,&#xD;
      6, 9, and 12 hours after taking fenretinide. The participant will not take the first dose of&#xD;
      SCH66336 until after these blood samples have been taken. Additional blood samples (about 1&#xD;
      teaspoon each) will be taken at these same times on Day 7 of the first treatment cycle and on&#xD;
      Day 1 of the second treatment cycle. A single blood sample (about 1 teaspoon) will be taken&#xD;
      before taking the study drugs on Day 7 of treatment Cycles 3, 4, 5, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have biopsies of their tumors, extra blood tests and will provide buccal&#xD;
      mucosa samples on Days 7 and 21 of the first treatment cycle. These biopsies, cheek&#xD;
      scrapings, and extra blood tests are for research purposes only and will not directly benefit&#xD;
      the participant. Approximately two tablespoons of blood will be drawn during each of these&#xD;
      extra blood tests. This blood, buccal mucosa (cheek), and tumor tissue will be studied to&#xD;
      learn how the treatment drugs work in the body and what effects they have. Participants may&#xD;
      remain on the study as long as they are responding to the SCH66336/fenretinide combination&#xD;
      and as long as their physician feels it is of benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing treatment, participants will be contacted about every 3 months to check on&#xD;
      the disease status. Participants will come to M.D. Anderson for clinical evaluations every 3&#xD;
      months for a period of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fenretinide is in the form of capsules and SCH66336 is in the form of tablets. Participants&#xD;
      will take the fenretinide capsules by mouth twice a day for seven days in a row at the start&#xD;
      of each treatment cycle. Participants will take the SCH66336 tablets twice a day for 21 days&#xD;
      in a row in each cycle. Participants will be given a &quot;pill diary&quot; in which they should record&#xD;
      when they take the study medications and how many capsules and tablets they take.&#xD;
      Participants will bring this diary and any unused medication when they return to the clinic&#xD;
      for their check-ups. At the beginning of a treatment cycle, participants should take both&#xD;
      drugs together at least 8 hours apart with either a high-fat meal or a glass of whole milk.&#xD;
      Participants should continue taking the SCH66336 tablets at least 8 hours apart and with a&#xD;
      meal or a glass of whole milk during Days 8-21 of each treatment cycle. Participants will not&#xD;
      take fenretinide capsules during Days 8-21 of a treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on this study, participants may not drink grapefruit juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The FDA has authorized the use of this drug combination in&#xD;
      research but has not approved it for widespread use. About 40 individuals will take part in&#xD;
      this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.&#xD;
