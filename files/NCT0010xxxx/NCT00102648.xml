    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lonafarnib when given together&#xD;
      with temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme that is has come back or did not respond to previous treatment with temozolomide.&#xD;
      Lonafarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving lonafarnib together with temozolomide may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose Sarasar (SCH66336, lonafarnib) when combined with&#xD;
      Temodar (temozolomide) in an alternating week schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the toxicities of the Sarasar and Temodar combination treatment using this&#xD;
      dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate response as measured by 6-month progression-free survival and objective&#xD;
      tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lonafarnib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 and 15-21 and&#xD;
      lonafarnib PO twice daily (BID) on days 8-14 and 22-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>In the historical dataset, the proportion of patients remaining alive and free from progression at 6 months was 15% (95% confidence interval for ranged from 10% to 19%). We will set p0 to 15% and we will set p1 to 30% (looking for a doubling of the 6-month PFS rate). Based on these design parameters, a two-stage design would require that at least 4 of the initial 19 patients are without progression at 6 months.</description>
