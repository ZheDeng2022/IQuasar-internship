      This study will investigate the efficacy of aerobic exercise and progressive resistance&#xD;
      training (PRT), singularly and combined, on changes in walking endurance for&#xD;
      mildly-to-moderately affected chronic stroke patients. Specifically, we will determine the&#xD;
      relative importance of training induced changes in muscle strength versus aerobic fitness on&#xD;
      increases in gait velocity and 6-min walking distance, and assess the concomitant functional&#xD;
      and psychosocial impact of increased muscle strength, aerobic fitness and improved gait. This&#xD;
      longitudinal study will be conducted as a double blinded factorial randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of exercise training for chronic stroke patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participation in a 10-week exercise program consisting of aerobic, resistance or&#xD;
           combined aerobic+resistance training will produce a 20% or greater increase of 6-min&#xD;
           walking distance compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aerobic fitness will increase equally in the combined aerobic+resistance program and&#xD;
           aerobic program alone, greater than that in the resistance program only, where effect is&#xD;
           measured in terms of maximal and submaximal cardiorespiratory exercise performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lower limb muscle strength will increase equally in the combined aerobic+resistance&#xD;
           program and resistance program alone, greater than the increase in strength for aerobic&#xD;
           training, where effect is measured in terms of measures of lower limb strength, power&#xD;
           and endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan Synopsis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine treatment efficacy, a 2x2 factorial double-blinded randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will be conducted, the two factors being aerobic training and PRT. Forty-eight subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to one of four groups comprising (i) aerobic exercise training&#xD;
      [AEROBIC; n=12]; (ii) PRT [RESISTANCE; n=12]; (iii) combined aerobic training and PRT&#xD;
      [AEROBIC+RESISTANCE; n=12], or (iv) control [CONTROLS; n=12]. AEROBIC and RESISTANCE groups&#xD;
      will also include a &quot;sham&quot; treatment for the other factor, and the order of presentation of&#xD;
      treatment versus &quot;sham&quot; will also be randomized within each exercise session. All subjects&#xD;
      will attend 3 times per week for 10 weeks. Subjects will be recruited from various hospitals,&#xD;
      peer support groups and previous participants of an acute stroke research project that we are&#xD;
      now conducting. All will be screened by a medical practitioner for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and then allocated to one of the four groups by the trial coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEROBIC Training Group: These subjects will undertake 30 min of leg cycling per exercise&#xD;
      session. Leg cycling will be performed at a pedaling cadence of 50 rev/min in the seated&#xD;
      posture using a standard seated cycle ergometer to elicit a target heart rate equivalent to&#xD;
      50% VO2peak - 70% VO2peak. Subjects in this group will also undertake 30-min of &quot;sham&quot;&#xD;
      resistance training consisting of stretching and calisthenics lacking any strength&#xD;
      development characteristics. Cycle ergometry will be used to develop aerobic fitness, rather&#xD;
      than fast walking, because previous studies have shown that stroke patients do not have the&#xD;
      capacity to walk at a sufficient pace to provide an adequate stimulus to the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESISTANCE Training Group: These subjects will undertake 30 min of PRT per exercise session&#xD;
      using pneumatic resistance equipment and free weights. Standard PRT principles governing&#xD;
      frequency, volume, duration, and intensity of exercise known to provide maximal adaptation in&#xD;
      both healthy and frail adults will be followed. Legs will be trained unilaterally to maximize&#xD;
      neural recruitment of the impaired side and prevent substitution of stronger muscles for&#xD;
      weaker ones. Subjects will perform 3 sets of 8 repetitions at 80% of the one repetition&#xD;
      maximum with each muscle group. Subjects in this group will also undertake 30-min of &quot;sham&quot;&#xD;
      aerobic training consisting of motorized passive leg cycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEROBIC+ RESISTANCE Training Group: Subjects in the AEROBIC+RESISTANCE training group will&#xD;
      undertake 30 min of leg cycling exercise as described for the AEROBIC group in addition to 30&#xD;
      min of PRT as described for the RESISTANCE group per exercise session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL Group: Subjects in this group will undertake 30-min of &quot;sham&quot; aerobic training&#xD;
      consisting of motorized passive leg cycling and 30-min of &quot;sham&quot; resistance training&#xD;
      consisting of stretching and calisthenics lacking any strength development characteristics&#xD;
      per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Subjects will undertake a 6 min walking test for maximum distance. The 6-min&#xD;
      test has been selected as our primary outcome because walking distance is an important&#xD;
      criteria for 'community ambulation', it avoids the problem of gait velocity being relevant&#xD;
      only for short-distance ambulation and has a prior history of investigation in previous&#xD;
      studies of low intensity aerobic and resistance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Cardiorespiratory Fitness will be assessed from cardiorespiratory variables collected&#xD;
      during (i) a maximal effort cycle test, (ii) a multi stage submaximal exercise cycle test,&#xD;
      and (iii) a dual stage treadmill walking test, performed on separate days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Lower limb Muscular Strength and Endurance will be assessed from maximal muscle force,&#xD;
      maximal muscle power and muscle endurance using pneumatic resistance machines (leg press,&#xD;
      knee extension) and free weights (hip abduction, ankle dorsiflexion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Mobility Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal (velocity, step time, single support, double support) and spatial (step length and&#xD;
      stride length) variables will be collected using a gait analysis system. Balance in standing&#xD;
      and coordinated stability will be assessed using a sway-meter that measures displacements of&#xD;
      the body at the level of the waist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Scales and Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide an assessment of changes in the subjects' psychological and functional states, a&#xD;
      stroke impact scale, a self-efficacy scale and the health-related quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment efficacy for the primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed using univariate&#xD;
      and multivariate analysis of variance. Where within-group differences are found, appropriate&#xD;
      multiple comparisons a posteriori analyses will be used. If significant multivariate effects&#xD;
      are evident, the standardized discriminant function coefficients will be examined to give an&#xD;
      indication of the relative importance of each variable in explaining the variance in the&#xD;
      group by time effect. To allow for the possibility that all or some of these data may be&#xD;
      covariates upon the primary outcome, multiple regression analysis will be utilized to explore&#xD;
      the relative importance of aerobic fitness, muscle power, strength or endurance and mobility&#xD;
      measures upon 6-min walk distance.&#xD;
