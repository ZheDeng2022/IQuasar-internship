  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the immune response caused by investigational Fluarix&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy people aged between 18-64 years in the U.S.A. Up to 1050 volunteers at 4&#xD;
      centers will receive Fluarix or Placebo (saline), and their responses will then be compared.&#xD;
      Subjects will be placed by age into 2 groups (18 to 49 years old and 50 to 64 years old),&#xD;
      then randomly assigned to receive a dose of Fluarix or Placebo by injection into a muscle.&#xD;
      There will be 2 phases in this study: (1) the active study phase (2 visits) for all subjects;&#xD;
      and (2) the cross-over phase, only for subjects enrolled in the placebo group who accept to&#xD;
      receive Fluarix. Blood samples will be obtained in order to measure immune response to the&#xD;
      vaccine. On the day of vaccination, volunteers will receive a diary card to record&#xD;
      information on symptoms experienced during the next 3 days. Subject participation in either&#xD;
      group will be up to 2 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled Phase III study to evaluate&#xD;
      the immunogenicity and the safety of GSK Bio influenza vaccine (Fluarix) administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly in healthy adults aged 18 to 64 years. Vaccination is currently the most&#xD;
      effective means of controlling influenza and preventing its complications and mortality in&#xD;
      persons at risk. Following vaccination, seroprotective antibody titers are achieved in a high&#xD;
      proportion of vaccinated subjects. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK Bio) has been marketing&#xD;
      an inactivated influenza split vaccine (Fluarix®) since 1992. More than 126 million doses&#xD;
      have been distributed and the vaccine is registered in 78 countries. It has been well&#xD;
      tolerated and has proven to be highly immunogenic when injected by the intramuscular route.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A male or female age between18-64 years at the time of the vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of&#xD;
             the protocol (e.g., return for follow-up visit and completion of the diary cards)&#xD;
             should be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written informed consent obtained from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical&#xD;
             examination before entering into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. either surgically&#xD;
             sterilized or one year post-menopausal. If subject is of childbearing potential, she&#xD;
             must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions (e.g. intrauterine&#xD;
             contraceptive device; oral contraceptives or other equivalent hormonal contraception,&#xD;
             e.g. progestogen-only implantable, cutaneous hormonal patch or injectable&#xD;
             contraceptives, diaphragm or condom in combination with contraceptive jelly, cream or&#xD;
             foam) for 30 days prior to vaccination. She must also have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             at study entry and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after&#xD;
             completion of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the&#xD;
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the administration of the study vaccine, or&#xD;
             planned use during the study period.&#xD;
