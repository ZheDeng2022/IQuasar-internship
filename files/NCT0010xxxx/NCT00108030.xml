  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this project is to improve walking ability in persons following stroke&#xD;
      using 'treadmill training plus power training'. This modality addresses the two major&#xD;
      impairments followings stroke: weakness and incoordination, as well as loss of fitness.&#xD;
      Importantly, this training will be presented at higher intensity and greater volume than is&#xD;
      currently received. Furthermore, to ensure that persons continue to maintain the level of&#xD;
      improvement from an intensive exercise program, we will also implement a behavioral change&#xD;
      for long-term maintenance of exercise behavior in a less supervised environment. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 102 sub-acute stroke patients to ascertain the&#xD;
      efficacy of this approach to improving walking ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Walking endurance will be increased to a greater degree in a patient group receiving&#xD;
           treadmill plus muscle power training compared with a treadmill training only group, or&#xD;
           'usual care' group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gait stability, muscle function, aerobic fitness and balance will improve more in a&#xD;
           group receiving treadmill plus muscle power training, than either those in treadmill&#xD;
           training or usual care patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Habitual activity levels will be higher in the group receiving treadmill plus muscle&#xD;
           power training compared with a treadmill training only group or 'usual care' group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The change in 6-minute walk distance will be positively related to changes in muscle&#xD;
           power, strength and endurance, aerobic fitness, gait mechanics, and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Baseline depression and low self-efficacy will be associated with less robust&#xD;
           adaptations to all types of training and lower rates of long-term compliance to the&#xD;
           exercise prescription in the experimental groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine treatment efficacy, a single blinded, randomized controlled trial will be&#xD;
      conducted. One hundred and two subjects will be randomly allocated to one of three groups&#xD;
      comprising: (i) &quot;Treadmill training + Power training&quot; (TT+POWER), (ii) &quot;Treadmill training&quot;&#xD;
      (TT), or (iii) &quot;Usual Care&quot; (USUAL). Those in the TT+POWER and TT will also receive 'usual&#xD;
      care'. Subjects will be recruited within a week or two following their stroke, at which time&#xD;
      they would be expected to be medically stable. Subjects in the training groups will attend&#xD;
      training for 10 weeks, 3 times per week. Following the ten-week training program, subjects&#xD;
      will be given a home-based training package to follow for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treadmill Training: The emphasis of the weight-supported treadmill training program will be&#xD;
      initially to emphasize walking alignment. The amount of support will be reduced as quickly as&#xD;
      possible to attain full weight-bearing on the motorized treadmill. Once a subject has&#xD;
      attained full weight-bearing with correct segmental alignment, the emphasis will be on&#xD;
      improving aerobic fitness whilst maintaining proper walking alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treadmill Training + Power Training: Subjects will undertake 30 min treadmill training, as&#xD;
      described above, followed by 30 min of power training using pneumatic resistance equipment&#xD;
      (Keiser Sports Health, Inc., Fresco, CA, USA) (leg press, knee extension and flexion, hip&#xD;
      abduction, and plantarflexion). Standard principles governing frequency, volume, duration,&#xD;
      and intensity of exercise known to provide maximal adaptation in both healthy and frail&#xD;
      adults will be followed. Legs will be trained unilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based program: Following 10 weeks of training, subjects will be given a home-based&#xD;
      training program to continue indefinitely. Subjects in the TT+Power group will be given&#xD;
      weights with instructions on use, and a walking program whereas those in the TT group will be&#xD;
      given a walking program. To encourage compliance with the program, subjects will be&#xD;
      telephoned weekly, and visited monthly. Subjects also will be requested to fill in a weekly&#xD;
      log sheet detailing their exercise sessions and other physical activities, which is mailed to&#xD;
      the trainer for feedback each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Outcomes will be measured prior to commencement of training, after 10 weeks&#xD;
      training, and then after 6-months home based exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome is the distance walked in 6-min. This test was selected because walking&#xD;
      distance is an important criterion for community ambulation. It is related to functional&#xD;
      impairment as well as strength of the lower limb muscles and aerobic fitness, avoids the&#xD;
      problem of gait velocity being relevant only for short-distance ambulation, and is a robust&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Other walking variables and balance variables: The total number of steps taken during&#xD;
           waking hours, using an accelerometer with a large capacity data logger. Temporal and&#xD;
           spatial variables associated with walking, as well as balance will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lower limb muscular strength, power and endurance will be assessed using the pneumatic&#xD;
           resistance machines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cardiorespiratory fitness will be assessed from variables collected during a maximal&#xD;
           effort cycle test and a multistage exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Scales and questionnaires will provide an assessment of changes in the subject's&#xD;
           psychological and functional states. Scales include a stroke impact scale, a&#xD;
           self-efficacy scale, health related qualify of life questionnaire, and a geriatric&#xD;
           depression scale.&#xD;
