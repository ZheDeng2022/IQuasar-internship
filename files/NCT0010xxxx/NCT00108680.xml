  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of unilateral versus bilateral exercise training&#xD;
      for recovering movement abilities in chronic stroke patients. After a stroke, some people&#xD;
      have improved their movement ability by exercising the arm affected by the stroke. Others&#xD;
      have improved by exercising both arms together. This study will compare these two kinds of&#xD;
      exercise to see which might work best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and people who have had a stroke more than 6 months ago may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Stroke patients must have some weakness in their stroke-affected arm. All&#xD;
      participants must be 18 years of age or older. Candidates are screened with a clinical and&#xD;
      neurological examination. Women who can become pregnant have a pregnancy test. Stroke&#xD;
      patients have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the brain if they have not had one&#xD;
      in the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: This procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues&#xD;
      and organs. The subject lies on a table that slides into the scanner (a narrow cylinder),&#xD;
      wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur during the scanning process. The&#xD;
      procedure lasts about 45 minutes, during which time the subject must lie still for up to 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing sessions: There are six test sessions - two to familiarize the subject with the&#xD;
      reaching test, two to do the reaching test plus transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      before and after an exercise session, and two to do the reaching test plus TMS one day after&#xD;
      the exercise session. The sessions are on consecutive days, with a 1-week break after session&#xD;
      3. The procedures involved are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reaching test: The subject responds as quickly as possible to a &quot;GO&quot; signal presented on&#xD;
           a computer monitor by performing a reaching movement with his or her arm. The activity&#xD;
           from the arm muscles is recorded using surface electrodes. During this test, a&#xD;
           questionnaire is used to determine the subject's attention, fatigue, and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS: For this test, a wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is&#xD;
           passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the&#xD;
           stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other&#xD;
           simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg,&#xD;
           and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the&#xD;
           coil. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes&#xD;
           taped onto the skin of the arms. The subject performs the reaching test while TMS is&#xD;
           delivered at various times after getting the &quot;GO&quot; signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm exercises: The subject is seated in front of an exercise device that has two handles&#xD;
           that slide forward and backward along a set of tracks. The subject is asked to slide&#xD;
           either one or both handles back and forth repeatedly, alternating 5 minutes of arm&#xD;
           exercise with 5 minutes of rest for 30 minutes.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proposed that individuals with stroke may benefit to a greater degree by training&#xD;
      with both arms simultaneously than by training with the paretic arm alone. The purpose of&#xD;
      this protocol is to identify the extent and the mechanisms of paretic arm performance&#xD;
      improvement after a single session of bilateral arm training compared to a single session of&#xD;
      unilateral paretic arm training in individuals with moderate-severity chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of individuals with chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-blinded, counterbalanced, crossover design will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint measures will include paretic arm peak acceleration and disinhibition of the&#xD;
      stroke-affected cortical hemisphere as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in&#xD;
      the context of a reaching task. These measures will be compared after a unilateral vs. a&#xD;
      bilateral arm training session in individuals with chronic stroke.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with Chronic Stroke (n=40):&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will include individuals at least 6 months post thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic&#xD;
        hemispheric or hemorrhagic hemispheric lesion. We will select individuals who initially had&#xD;
        severe hemiparesis but who recovered to the point of having moderate motor impairment.&#xD;
        Individuals with moderate motor impairment will be defined by a Fugl-Meyer score of at&#xD;
        least 30, and the inability to actively extend the paretic wrist and fingers at least 20&#xD;
        degrees. Assessment of severity of initial hemiparesis will be taken either from patient&#xD;
        report or medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We would also like to study a smaller group (n=10) of individuals with mild motor&#xD;
        impairment due to stroke. Individuals with mild motor impairment will be defined by an&#xD;
        Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer score of 50 or greater (maximum score = 66), and the ability to&#xD;
        actively extend the paretic wrist and fingers 20 degrees or more. We will also enroll 10&#xD;
        healthy volunteers.&#xD;
