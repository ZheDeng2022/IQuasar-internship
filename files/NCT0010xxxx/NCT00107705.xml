      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the residual allergenicity of Tree MATA (modified&#xD;
      pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate) by skin prick testing. This is done by a comparison of&#xD;
      the wheal response after skin prick testing with aqueous native and modified allergen,&#xD;
      modified tyrosine adsorbed allergen and Tree MATA MPL (modified tyrosine adsorbed + MPL&#xD;
      [Monophosphoryl Lipid A]).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tree MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients&#xD;
      with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross reacting tree pollens. MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid&#xD;
      A), a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of Salmonella minnesota, is&#xD;
      included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the&#xD;
      product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to a TH1-like profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tree pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an&#xD;
      allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus&#xD;
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important&#xD;
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities is not seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess residual allergenicity of the modified tree pollen in&#xD;
      Tree MATA MPL using skin prick testing.&#xD;
