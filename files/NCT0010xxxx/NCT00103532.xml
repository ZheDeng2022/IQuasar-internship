  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk behaviors and their associated adverse health outcomes are becoming increasingly&#xD;
      problematic among HIV-infected youth. This study is being conducted to test whether a brief&#xD;
      motivational enhancement (ME) intervention will help reduce health risk behaviors (drug and&#xD;
      alcohol use, sexual risk behavior, poor adherence to medications) among HIV+ youth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy Choices is a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of motivational&#xD;
      enhancement in reducing risk and promoting healthy behaviors. This study will use a sample of&#xD;
      225 youth (180 after attrition), ages 16-24, of whom 90 will receive the intervention,&#xD;
      referral, and standard care, and 90 will receive referral plus standard care. The sample will&#xD;
      be drawn from five study sites. Using parallel screening, recruitment will target 100 youth&#xD;
      with an adherence problem, 100 youth with a substance use problem, and 25 youth with a sexual&#xD;
      risk problem. A repeated measures design will be used for the proposed study. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are drug and alcohol use, condom use, and HIV medication adherence. Youth will&#xD;
      complete an initial data collection session (baseline) during which questionnaire and&#xD;
      interview measures will be administered. Blood specimens for viral load and CD4+ count will&#xD;
      also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedures will take place after completion of the baseline assessment.&#xD;
      Participants who are randomized to the intervention group will participate in four sessions&#xD;
      for approximately 3 months and will also receive standard care plus individualized referrals.&#xD;
      The control group will receive standard care and individualized referrals. All five sites&#xD;
      offer comprehensive, multidisciplinary care including social work and case management&#xD;
      services and access to mental health services. Participants will receive a three-month&#xD;
      post-test designed to coincide with ME completion. Subsequent post-tests will occur at 6, 9,&#xD;
      12, and 15 months after baseline data collection (3, 6, 9, and 12 months after ME&#xD;
      completion).&#xD;
