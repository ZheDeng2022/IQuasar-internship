    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether an experimental drug called GW572016 can delay tumor growth&#xD;
      in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GMB, a malignant brain tumor). GW572016 is believed&#xD;
      to affect cancer cell function by interfering with the internal signaling needed for the&#xD;
      cancer to grow. The study will also determine whether the presence of specific proteins in&#xD;
      the tumor can predict what effects GW572016 will have on the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with GMB whose brain tumor does not respond to standard&#xD;
      medical treatment and who can undergo surgery for their tumor may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a physical examination and neurocognitive examination, blood&#xD;
      tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ultrasound test of heart function) or MUGA&#xD;
      scan (nuclear medicine test of heart function), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head,&#xD;
      and computed tomography (CT) of the head. CT uses x-rays and MRI uses a magnetic field and&#xD;
      radio waves to show brain structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI and blood tests before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery to remove the brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up MRIs every 8 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up echocardiograms or MUGA scans every 8 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GW572016 treatment starting 7-10 days before surgery and continuing until the patient or&#xD;
           doctor decides it is in the patient's best interest to stop it or until the tumor&#xD;
           worsens. (The drug is stopped temporarily for surgery and a healing period after&#xD;
           surgery.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests every 2 weeks to evaluate the effects of GW572016 on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood test before the first GW572016 treatment and at the time of surgery to assess the&#xD;
           effect of the drug on the cells and to determine how much drug is present in the blood&#xD;
           at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are followed in clinic at least monthly while taking GW572016. While on&#xD;
      treatment they keep a diary documenting their daily treatments. The diary is collected at the&#xD;
      monthly follow-up exams. After the treatment ends, patients are contacted periodically by the&#xD;
      research staff for the rest of their lives to follow the long-term effects of the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - One of the most critical challenges facing glioblastoma translational research is&#xD;
      developing ways to predict, based on a patient's biopsy, which targeted inhibitor is most&#xD;
      likely to provide benefit. The studies outlined in this proposal are designed to determine&#xD;
      which glioblastoma patients are most likely to benefit from GW572106, and may provide a&#xD;
      blueprint for analyzing promising new pathway inhibitors in the future. We anticipate that&#xD;
      these studies will serve as the basis for biological endpoint based trials in the future.&#xD;
      Thus, the overall goal is to evaluate the efficacy of GW572016 in the treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      malignant gliomas in patients who are candidates for re-resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate for patients with recurrent or&#xD;
           progressive glioblastoma treated with GW572016.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether GW572016 inhibits the phosphorylation of its cellular targets EGFR and&#xD;
           HER2, and the downstream PI3K-AKT and RAS-ERK signaling pathways in glioblastoma&#xD;
           patients in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine tumor concentrations of GW572016.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess overall progression free survival and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically proven intracranial tumors to include only glioblastoma&#xD;
           multiforme (GBM) and Gliosarcoma (GS). Patients will be eligible if the original&#xD;
           histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a GBM is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be candidates for surgical re-resection (total, or sub-total) in order to&#xD;
           be eligible for this study. Following surgery, a scan should be done no later than 96&#xD;
           hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may be on a non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (Non-EIAED's). They may&#xD;
           not be on EIAED's. If previously on an EIAED, patient must be off of it for two weeks&#xD;
           prior to initiation of pre-operative drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Pre-Treatment blood sample (10ml) will be obtained in all patients for genotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre- Operative: GW572016 will be administered at a starting dose of 750 mg orally BID&#xD;
           daily on an outpatient basis for 7-10 days. (This range is to allow flexibility for&#xD;
           planning surgery). GW572016 will be continued up to and including the evening before&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of surgery 10ml of blood will be collected in EDTA containing tubes for&#xD;
           pharmacodynamic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment may be instituted postoperatively as soon as patients have recovered from&#xD;
           effects of surgery and demonstrated wound healing. Treatment with GW572016&#xD;
           post-operatively should start no later than 28 days after surgery. GW572016 will be&#xD;
           administered at a starting dose of 750 mg orally BID daily on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
           GW572016 will be administered continuously; however, for the purposes of protocol&#xD;
           evaluations, a cycle will be defined as 28 days.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA (General):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with histologically proven intracranial tumors to include only glioblastoma&#xD;
        multiforme (GBM) and Gliosarcoma (GS). Patients will be eligible if the original histology&#xD;
        was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a GBM is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unstained slides (at least 5, but prefer 10) or 1 tissue block must be available from at&#xD;
        least one prior surgery. If available, frozen tissue is also requested from earlier&#xD;
        surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be candidates for surgical re-resection (total, or sub-total) in order to be&#xD;
        eligible for this study. Following surgery, a scan should be done no later than 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be on a non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (Non-EIAED's). They may not&#xD;
        be on EIAED's. If previously on an EIAED, patient must be off of it for two weeks prior to&#xD;
        initiation of pre-operative drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal as measured by&#xD;
        echocardiogram or MUGA scan (within 42 days of registration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
        investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for the&#xD;
        release of their protected health information. Patients must be registered in the NABTC&#xD;
        database prior to treatment with study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old, and with a life expectancy greater&#xD;
        than 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy and at least 28 days&#xD;
        from any investigational agent, 28 days from prior cytotoxic therapy, 28 days from&#xD;
        radiation, 14 days from vincristine, 42 days from nitrosoureas, 21 days from procarbazine&#xD;
        administration, and 7 days from non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen,&#xD;
        thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions&#xD;
        related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC greater than or equal to&#xD;
        3,000/microl, ANC greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3), platelet count of greater than or&#xD;
        equal to 100,000/mm(3), and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 gm/dl), adequate liver&#xD;
        function (SGOT and bilirubin less than 2.5 times ULN), and adequate renal function&#xD;
        (creatinine less than 1.5 mg/dL before starting therapy. These tests must be performed&#xD;
        within 14 days prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by&#xD;
        transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan.&#xD;
        Stable dose of steroids is not mandated for this study. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or&#xD;
        CT must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic&#xD;
        radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation&#xD;
        necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium scanning, MR spectroscopy or surgical&#xD;
        documentation of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may have had treatment for no more than 2 prior relapses. Relapse is defined as&#xD;
        progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo [which includes gliadel&#xD;
        wafers] if that was used as initial therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no&#xD;
        more than 3 prior therapies (initial and treatment for 2 relapses). If the patient had a&#xD;
        surgical resection for relapsed disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to&#xD;
        12 weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as 1&#xD;
        relapse. For patients who had prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis&#xD;
        of a high-grade glioma will be considered the first relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility to restart drug post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must agree to practice adequate contraception. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
        must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented within 7 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (General):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be on any medications listed in section 3.2.1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that in the investigator's opinion&#xD;
        cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the patient's&#xD;
        ability to tolerate this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma&#xD;
        in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy for that&#xD;
        disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have active infection or serious intercurrent medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant/breast feeding. Patients must not be&#xD;
        pregnant because no studies with this drug have been performed to evaluate safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-Positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the&#xD;
        study due to possible retro-viral drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have any disease that will obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug&#xD;
        metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have received prior therapy with Signal transduction inhibitors (e.g.&#xD;
        ZD1839, OSI-774, R115777)&#xD;
