      Zinc deficiency has occasionally been reported in CF, but the need for additional zinc is&#xD;
      unclear. We will examine the effect of additional zinc supplements on zinc absorption, zinc&#xD;
      excretion, zinc balance and zinc kinetics in children with CF. Twelve children with CF will&#xD;
      receive additional zinc, and twelve will not. We will also compare the children with CF to 12&#xD;
      healthy children without CF. We hypothesize that children with CF will have poor zinc&#xD;
      absorption and high zinc excretion, leading to poor zinc balance and abnormal zinc kinetics.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that those children with CF who are given zinc supplements will have higher&#xD;
      zinc balance and more normal zinc kinetics than those without supplementation, and that zinc&#xD;
      balance and zinc kinetics will be similar to healthy children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overt zinc deficiency presents with features of acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) including&#xD;
      diarrhea, dermatitis, growth failure, and poor immune function. AE has been described as a&#xD;
      complication of cystic fibrosis, and can be the initial presenting feature. As AE has almost&#xD;
      never been described in otherwise healthy subjects consuming self-selected diets, this&#xD;
      suggests a profound disturbance in zinc metabolism, either in absorption or excretion, can&#xD;
      occur in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have measured zinc absorption in children with CF. Those that have had&#xD;
      demonstrated significant reductions in zinc absorption in CF subjects with pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency with a significant increase in zinc absorption with pancreatic enzyme&#xD;
      replacement. However, zinc metabolism is maintained by changes in fractional zinc absorption&#xD;
      and zinc losses in to the gastro-intestinal tract (endogenous fecal zinc excretion). Of these&#xD;
      two mechanisms, changes in endogenous fecal zinc excretion appear to be the more important.&#xD;
      To date, only one study has measured endogenous fecal zinc excretion in subjects with CF.&#xD;
      Krebs et al. studied 15 infants, less than 4 months of age, newly diagnosed with CF. They&#xD;
      found that all infants were in negative zinc balance, and that endogenous fecal zinc&#xD;
      excretion was significantly correlated with the degree of fat malabsorption. These results&#xD;
      are difficult to interpret as there was no control group studied, and there is little&#xD;
      published data on zinc absorption in healthy infants of this age, and no data on endogenous&#xD;
      fecal zinc excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearly, a better measure of zinc status is required to fully understand the importance of&#xD;
      zinc deficiency in CF, and the relationship between fat malabsorption and zinc balance. In&#xD;
      the past, we have used novel stable isotope-based multicompartmental models to study zinc&#xD;
      status in healthy and disease states. These have proved able to detect changes in zinc&#xD;
      metabolism in two experimental paradigms of zinc deficiency, even before the plasma zinc&#xD;
      becomes abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children with CF will have worse zinc status, lower fractional zinc absorption,&#xD;
           increased endogenous fecal zinc excretion, and poorer zinc balance, than age-matched&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In children with CF, endogenous fecal zinc excretion will be significantly positively&#xD;
           correlated, and zinc absorption and zinc balance significantly negatively correlated&#xD;
           with fecal fat excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After two months of zinc supplementation with 20 mg/d zinc as zinc acetate, children&#xD;
           with CF will have similar zinc status, fractional zinc absorption, endogenous fecal zinc&#xD;
           excretion, and zinc balance as age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Two months of zinc supplementation will not affect iron status (Hemoglobin, serum&#xD;
           ferritin, serum transferrin receptors) or copper status (serum copper, ceruloplasmin,&#xD;
           copper/ zinc superoxide dismutase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four children with CF aged 8-14 years old will be recruited from the Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      Clinic at Texas Children's Hospital. Children will be considered eligible if they have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of CF, weigh more than 25 kg, have a clinical diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency&#xD;
      requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement, and have a history of good compliance with medical&#xD;
      therapies. Subjects will be considered ineligible if they have had gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      tract surgery, have pancreatic endocrine dysfunction, or are taking more than 10 mg/d zinc&#xD;
      supplements. The study will be explained to the subjects and their parents. Informed written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the parents, and written consent or assent (as age appropriate)&#xD;
      from the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is obtained, a registered dietician will use a food frequency questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess the child's usual zinc intake. Advice will be given on how to eat a healthy balanced&#xD;
      diet that should meet the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for zinc and other essential&#xD;
      minerals. Except for this dietary advice, no other dietary intervention will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve healthy children aged 8-14 years old will be recruited by public advertisement, local&#xD;
      contacts and by word of mouth. They will be eligible for the study if they are of similar&#xD;
      age, gender and ethnicity to the CF subjects. Informed consent and assent will be obtained in&#xD;
      the same manner as for the CF children, and the same dietary advice and guidance given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children with CF will be randomized to receive a zinc supplement of 20 mg/d as zinc&#xD;
      acetate or an identical appearing placebo. Randomization will be stratified by gender and by&#xD;
      ethnicity. Randomization tables will be maintained by the Investigation Pharmacy Service at&#xD;
      Texas Children's Hospital. Once consent is obtained the Investigation Pharmacy Service will&#xD;
      be contacted and will randomize the children to receive one of two identical appearing&#xD;
      solutions - one containing 10 mg/mL elemental zinc as zinc acetate and one being the placebo.&#xD;
      The subjects, their parents and the investigators will be blinded as to which solution the&#xD;
      child has been randomized to receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be admitted to the General Clinical Research Center after an overnight fast. A&#xD;
      local anesthetic cream will be applied over veins in the antecubital fossa. Blood, 10-15 mL,&#xD;
      will be drawn for baseline laboratory investigations including a complete blood count, liver&#xD;
      function test, plasma zinc, serum ferritin, serum transferrin receptor concentration, serum&#xD;
      copper, serum ceruloplasmin and erythrocyte cU/Zn- superoxide dismutase. After the blood has&#xD;
      been taken, subjects will be provided with their first bottle of zinc solution, or placebo.&#xD;
      They will be instructed to take 1 mL of the solution twice daily for two months. New supplies&#xD;
      of the zinc or placebo solution will be provided as required during the study. All used or&#xD;
      partially used bottles will be returned to the Investigation Pharmacy Service and the amount&#xD;
      taken calculated from the change in weight of the bottle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consuming the placebo or zinc solution for two months, children with CF will be&#xD;
      admitted to the General Clinical Research Center following an overnight fast. Subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to empty their bladder. An intravenous heparin-lock catheter will be inserted into a&#xD;
      vein in the antecubital fossa or the dorsum of the hand and a baseline blood sample taken for&#xD;
      serum chemistries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a breakfast containing approximately 3 mg of zinc, including 120 mL of&#xD;
      orange juice to which 2 mg of zinc-67 had been added 18-24 hours earlier. Immediately after&#xD;
      breakfast, 0.5 mg zinc-70 will be infused by venipuncture of the other arm over 30-60&#xD;
      seconds, and the butterfly infusion set flushed with 5 mL of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn from the heparin lock catheter 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60,&#xD;
      120 and 180 minutes after the intravenous zinc isotope is given. Further blood samples will&#xD;
      be drawn by venipuncture 24, 72, and 120 hours after the intravenous isotope was given. These&#xD;
      blood samples will be anticoagulated in certified zinc-free ammonium heparin tubes (Monvette&#xD;
      9ml AH, Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC). Plasma will be separated by centrifugation and stored at&#xD;
      -80°C pending analysis. A complete urine and fecal collection will be made during the&#xD;
      metabolic study. Urine samples will be collected in 8-h aliquots and all stools passed&#xD;
      collected individually. Urine and fecal samples will be stored at -20°C pending analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control children will be studied in exactly the same manner, approximately 2 months after&#xD;
      baseline bloods were drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that children with CF will have lower fractional zinc absorption,&#xD;
      increased endogenous fecal zinc excretion, poorer zinc balance and worse zinc status, than&#xD;
      age-matched controls. This will be assessed using ANOVA. If this suggests a significant&#xD;
      &quot;group&quot; effect, post-hoc testing will be carried out using the Tukey-Kramer test. The kinetic&#xD;
      parameter used to assess zinc status will be k(2,1) as this showed the largest change in&#xD;
      response to zinc deficiency, in our previous studies. This analysis will test both hypotheses&#xD;
      1 and 3 (see above). Should any significant differences exist in age, weight, etc. between&#xD;
      the groups, this will be statistically corrected for using ANCOVA. Data will be analyzed for&#xD;
      the entire study population, and for the CF children with pancreatic insufficiency alone. The&#xD;
      study is designed to have an 80% power of detecting changes in k(2,1) between the two groups&#xD;
      of pancreatic insufficient CF children alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between fecal fat and endogenous fecal zinc excretion, and zinc balance&#xD;
      (hypothesis 2), will be assessed using simple and multiple regression analysis. The effect of&#xD;
      zinc supplementation on iron and copper status will be examined using a 2 sample t-test,&#xD;
      comparing CF children with zinc supplementation, to those who did not receive zinc&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
