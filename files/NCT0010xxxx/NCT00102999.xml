      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this proposal are (1) to characterize motor learning abnormalities in&#xD;
      patients with focal dystonia; (2) to show, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, that this&#xD;
      abnormal motor learning went together with an impaired modulation by somatosensory inputs of&#xD;
      short and long-interval paired-pulse inhibitions (sICI, lICI) and facilitations (sICF, ICF)&#xD;
      of MEPs (ICIs and ICFs are thought to reflect activity of inhibitory and excitatory&#xD;
      interneuron's in the primary motor cortex M1); (3) to show that abnormalities of long-term&#xD;
      potentiation and long-term depression (LTP/LTD)-like mechanisms (tested using a paired&#xD;
      associative stimulation (PAS) intervention), thought to play a crucial role in learning, are&#xD;
      associated in dystonia with an abnormal modulation of ICIs and ICFs by somatosensory inputs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients with a focal upper limb dystonia and 45 healthy volunteers will take part in the&#xD;
      main study. 7 patients with a focal upper limb dystonia and 12 healthy volunteers will take&#xD;
      part in the control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the main study: subjects will complete 5 different sessions: visit 1: clinical screening,&#xD;
      1 hour; visit PAS session, 3 hours; visit 3: a minimum of 7 days later, motor learning&#xD;
      session, 3 hours; visit 4: follow-up 24 hours later, 1 hour and a half; visit 5, follow-up 48&#xD;
      hours later, 1 hour and a half. During the PAS session they will receive 15 minutes of&#xD;
      repeated paired stimulations (transcranial magnetic stimulation -TMS- and peripheral&#xD;
      stimulation) thought to produce LTP/LTD like phenomena in M1. During the motor learning&#xD;
      sessions they will be asked to perform, as fast as possible, a metronome-paced (0.5 Hz) pinch&#xD;
      of their index finger and thumb. They will have 3 blocks of motor practice during the motor&#xD;
      learning session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between each block of motor practice and before and after PAS, while they rest, subjects will&#xD;
      receive paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) associated or not with&#xD;
      peripheral nerve stimulation in order to assess interactions at M1 cortical level between&#xD;
      somatosensory incoming volleys and intracortical inhibitory and excitatory interneuron's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control study: subjects will complete a unique session. They will receive a PAS&#xD;
      intervention. Before and after the PAS intervention, spinal excitability will be tested by&#xD;
      the means of H reflexes evoked in wrist flexor muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The behavioral effect of the motor training or of the PAS intervention will be assessed by&#xD;
      measuring the mean peak acceleration (MPA) of thumb movement during the blocks of motor&#xD;
      practice and the mean maximal peak force (MPF) between the index finger and thumb before and&#xD;
      after the blocks of motor practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity of different sets of intracortical interneurons (short and long interval GABA&#xD;
      related inhibitions: sICI, lICI, intracortical glutamate-related facilitation: ICF and short&#xD;
      interval facilitation: sICF) can be tested using paired-pulse TMS paradigms. The effect of&#xD;
      learning (or of PAS intervention) on the interaction between somatosensory afferent input and&#xD;
      intracortical processes will be assessed by comparing the amount of sICI, lICI, ICF and sICF&#xD;
      when associated or not with a peripheral nerve stimulation (median and ulnar nerve&#xD;
      stimulation) in a trained muscle (flexor pollicis brevis: FPB) and a non-trained muscle&#xD;
      (abductor digiti minimi: ADM) at different times during and after the motor learning or the&#xD;
      PAS intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of PAS on spinal cord excitability will be assessed by comparing the size of the H&#xD;
      reflex before and after PAS.&#xD;

&#xD;
      19 patients with a focal upper limb dystonia and 24 healthy volunteers will take part in the&#xD;

&#xD;
      In the control studies: subjects will complete a maximum of eight sessions. They will receive&#xD;
      a PAS intervention. Before and after the PAS intervention, spinal excitability will be tested&#xD;
      by the means of H reflexes evoked in wrist flexors muscles; H reflexes will be delivered&#xD;
      alone or will be conditioned by cubital or radial nerve stimulation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The behavioral effect of the motor training or of the PAS intervention will be assessed by&#xD;
      measuring the mean peak acceleration (MPA) of thumb movement during the blocks of motor&#xD;

      PAS intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of PAS on spinal cord excitability will be assessed by comparing the size of the H&#xD;
      reflex alone, the amounts of postactivation depression and those of presynaptic inhibition&#xD;
      before and after PAS.&#xD;
