      This study will examine how therapy changes the way the brain controls movements in children&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy. Normally, one side of the brain controls movements in the opposite side&#xD;
      of the body. In cerebral palsy, however, this pattern may be different, with one side of the&#xD;
      brain controlling movements on the same side of the body. This study will use magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study brain function&#xD;
      in children with cerebral palsy before and after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 9 and 17 years of age with spastic hemiplegia type cerebral palsy will be&#xD;
      recruited for this study from the National Rehabilitation Hospital and Georgetown University&#xD;
      Center Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and the Sparks Center at UAB in Alabama. In&#xD;
      addition, five healthy control children will be recruited from community groups, such as Cub&#xD;
      Scouts, Brownies, and schools. Candidates are screened with a review of medical records and&#xD;
      neurological and physical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls undergo MRI (described below) twice, 3 weeks apart. Children with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rehabilitation evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRI: For this test, the child lies on a table that slides in and out of the MRI&#xD;
           scanner-a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. He or she wears earplugs&#xD;
           to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur during scanning. Images are obtained while the&#xD;
           child performs simple finger tapping movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Movement Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Finger tapping: The child taps buttons on a box hooked up to a computer&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Muscle reflex measurements: One method uses a small motor that makes the child's&#xD;
                fingers move with sudden, small movements; a second method uses small shocks to the&#xD;
                finger or wrist. The shocks feel like a buzz; most are gentle, but some might feel&#xD;
                stronger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. TMS: This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief&#xD;
           electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates&#xD;
           the brain. During the stimulation, the child may be asked to perform simple movements..&#xD;
           The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the child&#xD;
           may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Therapy: After these tests, children are randomly selected to receive either standard&#xD;
           therapy (neurodevelopmental treatment) or constraint-induced therapy, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Neurodevelopmental therapy uses principles of movement science to enhance the&#xD;
                child's capacity to function. The child receives therapy a few times a week for 3&#xD;
                weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Constraint-induced therapy uses a combination of motor learning method and&#xD;
                constraint to teach the new motor skills in the child's affected hand. Children&#xD;
                treated with this therapy must live near a special treatment center in Alabama for&#xD;
                the 3 weeks of treatment. The child's good arm is constrained with a bivalve,&#xD;
                removable cast. The cast is placed before therapy starts and remains in place&#xD;
                except when the therapist removes it once a day to examine the good arm. With the&#xD;
                cast on, children are encouraged to use their affected hand in new ways. The&#xD;
                therapist then uses the motor learning method, building motor programs as a result&#xD;
                of practice, to teach them new skills. Motor learning therapy is 6 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Post-treatment testing: After treatment, children undergo repeat rehabilitation&#xD;
           assessment, MRI, TMS, and movement testing.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine the underlying brain reorganization that occurs in children with&#xD;
      hemiplegic cerebral palsy before and after pediatric Constraint-Induced therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: A promising new therapy for adults with hemiparesis consequent to stroke, known&#xD;
      as Constraint-Induced Movement (CI) therapy, has recently been modified for use in children&#xD;
      with cerebral palsy. Children with cerebral palsy treated with CI therapy show significant&#xD;
      gains in motor skills after receiving this intensive and extended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence to suggest that, after an acute stroke in adults, the undamaged motor&#xD;
      cortex exerts greater control over movements in the affected hand than is normally seen in&#xD;
      neurologically intact subjects. While this might seem to be an advantage, combined functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies&#xD;
      demonstrate that it is associated with poor motor recovery in adults after a stroke and&#xD;
      impaired hand function in patients with cerebral palsy. Thus, anomalous motor control of the&#xD;
      affected hand by the unaffected cortex may reflect a less efficient cortical reorganization&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is controversy about how CI therapy produces an improvement in motor function.&#xD;
      Conflicting evidence from fMRI and TMS studies in adult patients with stroke have shown that&#xD;
      patients may have either an increase in ipsilateral motor cortical activation or an increase&#xD;
      in activation in the damaged hemisphere. The answer to this controversy may be related to the&#xD;
      presence of ipsilateral projections. Since ipsilateral projections are associated with worse&#xD;
      functional outcome, determining the type of response to CI therapy may give insights into&#xD;
      those patients who need more intense therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Children with hemiplegic subtype of cerebral palsy; age-matched children&#xD;
      with no neurological abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: We will assess motor cortex activation before and after CI therapy using fMRI and&#xD;
      neurophysiologic tests including TMS and muscle reflex studies in children with hemiplegic&#xD;
      cerebral palsy with and without evidence for ipsilateral projections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Patients will be stratified by the presence of mirror movements. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be laterality index on cortical activation of the fMRI before and after&#xD;
      CI therapy. Secondary outcome measures will be standardized measures of sensory and motor&#xD;
      function. We will examine the relationship between the presence of anomalous ipsilateral&#xD;
      motor control and cortical reorganization following CI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Understanding this relationship is essential for planning large randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. Since anomalous ipsilateral cortical reorganization reflects an&#xD;
      inefficient cortical reorganization process, treatment outcome of CI therapy may also be&#xD;
      worse in this group. In this case, future studies may need to stratify children on study&#xD;
      entry according to types of brain reorganization.&#xD;
