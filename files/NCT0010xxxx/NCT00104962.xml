  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide in treating&#xD;
      young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;
      Lenalidomide may stop the growth of solid tumors or myelodysplastic syndromes by blocking&#xD;
      blood flow to the cancer. It may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop&#xD;
      cancer cells from growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of lenalidomide in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine, preliminarily, the feasibility of administering this drug to pediatric patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in both patient&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine immunologic changes in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      diagnosis (solid tumor vs myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients with solid tumors receive escalating doses of lenalidomide until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at&#xD;
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients with MDS receive a fixed&#xD;
      dose (do not undergo dose escalation) of lenalidomide. After completion of study treatment,&#xD;
      patients are followed annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
