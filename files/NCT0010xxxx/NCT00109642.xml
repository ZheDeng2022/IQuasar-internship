  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the role of a brain chemical called norepinephrine in thinking,&#xD;
      decision-making, and emotional processing. After norepinephrine is released from a brain&#xD;
      cell, it binds to another brain cell's receptor. Some of the receptors it binds to are called&#xD;
      alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. This study will use medicines called yohimbine and guanfacine&#xD;
      to look at the function of norepinephrine in the brain when it binds to the alpha-2&#xD;
      adrenergic receptors. Yohimbine increases norepinephrine's function and guanfacine decreases&#xD;
      its function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 20 and 50 years of age who do not have heart disease, high blood&#xD;
      pressure, psychiatric illness, or other serious medical conditions and who are not allergic&#xD;
      to lactose may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical and&#xD;
      psychiatric history, physical examination, neuropsychological testing, blood and urine tests&#xD;
      and electrocardiogram. Women are screened with a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are given a pill of yohimbine, guanfacine, or placebo and undergo the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and heart rate measurements: Blood pressure and heart rate are measured&#xD;
           before the medication is taken and several times after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws: Blood is drawn before the medicine is taken and 90 minutes after to measure&#xD;
           levels of norepinephrine and the hormone cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive testing: Participants do neurocognitive tasks on the computer for up to&#xD;
           90 minutes. The tasks involve looking at pictures or words on a screen and responding&#xD;
           according to instructions given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Patients may undergo neurocognitive testing MRIs. This&#xD;
           test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show changes in brain activity. The&#xD;
           subject lies on a table that slides into a narrow cylinder (the MRI scanner). Images of&#xD;
           the brain are obtained while the subject performs the computer tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An understanding of the role of specific neurotransmitters in the neurocognitive functions&#xD;
      mediating emotional processing is essential for the understanding and treatment of mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders. One such disorder, currently regarded as untreatable, is psychopathy.&#xD;
      Psychopathy has been linked with noradrenergic and amygdala disturbances. However, an&#xD;
      understanding of the functional significance of the noradrenergic system in humans remains in&#xD;
      its infancy. The goal of this protocol is to use targeted noradrenergic manipulations&#xD;
      (yohimbine and guanfacine) in conjunction with specific neurocognitive and neuroimaging&#xD;
      paradigms to consider the role of norepinephrine in reward and punishment processing. In&#xD;
      particular, we wish to evaluate the hypothesis that increased norepinephrine levels following&#xD;
      the administration of yohimbine will lead to enhanced formation and processing of&#xD;
      stimulus-reward and stimulus-punishment associations, while decreased norepinephrine levels&#xD;
      following the administration of guanfacine will reduce the formation and processing of&#xD;
      stimulus-reward and stimulus-punishment associations. In addition, we aim to examine the&#xD;
      hypothesis that increased norepinephrine levels will lead to increased neural response in the&#xD;
      amygdala during either the formation, or processing, of stimulus-reinforcement associations.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Participants will be males and females, 20-50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        IQ: IQ, as measured by 4 subscales from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised&#xD;
        (WAIS-R), must be greater than 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medication status: No current use of any psychotropic medication or benzodiazepine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because factors such as psychiatric disease, or CNS disease, can influence functional brain&#xD;
        activity, these factors are exclusionary:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric History: Participants will be assessed using DSM-IV criteria via&#xD;
             standardized psychiatric interviews conducted by trained examiners (SCID). All&#xD;
             participants will be free of any current or past major affective disorder, psychotic&#xD;
             disorder, substance dependence, anorexia, somatoform disorder, or anxiety disorders&#xD;
             with the exception of specific phobias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe acute and chronic medical illnesses (e.g. cardiac disease, diabetes, epilepsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNS disease: Known history of brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasms, subarachnoid&#xD;
             cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), other central&#xD;
             nervous system disease, or history of head trauma which resulted in a persistent&#xD;
             neurologic deficit or loss of consciousness greater than 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently on regular medication that would interfere with study results. This includes&#xD;
             alpha and beta adrenergic medications, other anti-hypertensive medications,&#xD;
             glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid medications, and medications causing sedation or&#xD;
             stimulation. For example, current use of tylenol or ibuprofen is permitted, while&#xD;
             current use of benadryl or methylphenidate is not. Use of oral contraceptive pills is&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently breast feeding or pregnant (as documented by pregnancy testing at screening&#xD;
             or at days of the challenge studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria for fMRI studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metal or electronic objects: Metal plates, certain types of dental braces, cardiac&#xD;
             pacemakers, etc., that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields contraindicate MRI&#xD;
             scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia: participants will be questioned about potential discomfort in being in&#xD;
             an enclosed space, such as an MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight - to reduce the likelihood of significant orthostasis from guanfacine,&#xD;
             participants must weigh 60kg or greater. Those weighing less than 60 kg will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
