      This research project seeks to implement an early intervention program that can be effective&#xD;
      in the prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) and infant abuse. Our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      Period of PURPLE Crying intervention program can reduce shaking and abuse of infants through&#xD;
      changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviors about early infant crying, especially&#xD;
      inconsolable crying. In this 3-year project, we will implement and evaluate an intervention&#xD;
      program in selected prenatal classes, hospitals, and primary care pediatric practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, controlled trial, we will enroll a total of 3000 women/families who are&#xD;
      about to give birth or have just given birth to a healthy infant. At each of the three sites&#xD;
      (newborn nursery, pediatrician offices and prenatal classes), we will enroll 1000 subjects.&#xD;
      Half of all subjects will receive intervention materials (a video, pamphlet and bib/burp&#xD;
      cloth) about infant crying. The other half, the control group, will receive comparable&#xD;
      materials on infant safety. All subjects will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire at&#xD;
      the time of enrollment (pre test), review the materials they receive, complete the Baby's Day&#xD;
      Diary for 4 days when the infant is 5 weeks of age and complete a telephone questionnaire&#xD;
      (post test) when the infant is 8 weeks of age.&#xD;

      The specific goals of the program are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To change the understanding (i.e., knowledge and attitudes) and reduce the frustration&#xD;
           of parents of new infants about the normality of the frustrating properties of crying;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To change the behavior of parents to increase caregiving contact in response to crying&#xD;
           but to 'walk away' if frustrated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To provide parents with the ability to communicate to other caregivers (relatives,&#xD;
           baby-sitters) the knowledge and behavior to reduce frustration induced by inconsolable&#xD;
           crying;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To provide effective knowledge, skills and teaching materials to health care providers&#xD;
           in direct contact with parents concerning crying, shaking and abuse;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To reduce the incidence of physical abuse and shaken baby syndrome under one year;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To have the Period of PURPLE Crying program adopted as a nationwide early intervention&#xD;
           project.&#xD;
