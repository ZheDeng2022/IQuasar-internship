      To understand the complex, longitudinal relations between physical fitness, physical&#xD;
      activity, body mass and composition and fat distribution, and genetic factors and their&#xD;
      independent or interactive effects on the development of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although an age-related decline in aerobic capacity is well documented, the impact of&#xD;
      physical activity, body fat, and genetic variation on the rate of change is not well&#xD;
      understood. In addition, little is known about how rate of change in aerobic capacity during&#xD;
      early and middle adulthood affects the development of cardiovascular disease risk factors or&#xD;
      the incidence of subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) related end-points.&#xD;
      The study addresses these issues by conducting an ancillary study in conjunction with the&#xD;
      Year 20 CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) examination, which is&#xD;
      scheduled to take place beginning in June, 2005. Approximately 3,650 (75%) of the surviving&#xD;
      members of the initial cohort of African American and white men and women will return for the&#xD;
      Year 20 exam, at which point they will be 38-50 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARDIA is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-supported longitudinal study which&#xD;
      measures changes in coronary heart disease risk factors in cohorts of Black and white males&#xD;
      and females who were 18 to 30 years of age at baseline. Also, the study identifies life&#xD;
      styles during this age span which influence these changes in risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the ancillary study is to understand the complex, longitudinal relations&#xD;
      between physical fitness, physical activity, body mass and composition and fat distribution,&#xD;
      and genetic factors and their independent or interactive effects on the development of&#xD;
      obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and sub-clinical CVD. To accomplish this goal, all Year 20&#xD;
      CARDIA participants will be measured for: 1. Aerobic capacity, by means of a symptom-limited&#xD;
      graded exercise treadmill test, using the same protocol as that used in CARDIA at the Year 0&#xD;
      and Year 7 exams; 2. Body composition and fat distribution, using a whole body dual energy&#xD;
      x-ray absorptiometery (DEXA) scan; 3. Physical activity, using 7 days of accelerometer&#xD;
      recordings; and 4. DNA sequence variants in selected candidate genes associated with&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, components of the metabolic syndrome, and response to regular&#xD;
      exercise, using stored DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this ancillary study will be combined with core CARDIA examination data to address&#xD;
      the following aims: a. Examination of the contribution of body mass and composition, fat&#xD;
      distribution, objectively measured physical activity and specific genetic polymorphisms to&#xD;
      the variance in Year 20 aerobic capacity and in age-related decline in aerobic capacity over&#xD;
      a 20-year time period from young adulthood to mid-life, stratifying by race and gender. b.&#xD;
      Longitudinal examination of the effect of aerobic capacity on changes in cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk factors and on the incidence of CVD-related endpoints (e.g. hypertension,&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, subclinical disease [e.g. coronary artery calcium]).&#xD;
