  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating&#xD;
      primary generalized dystonia. Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause&#xD;
      uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. Medical therapies are&#xD;
      available, but not all patients get adequate relief from the abnormal movements or the pain&#xD;
      associated with them. DBS is a surgical procedure that interrupts neuronal circuits in the&#xD;
      Gpi and STN, areas of the basal ganglia of the brain that do not work correctly in patients&#xD;
      with dystonia. The surgery results in decreased movement and therefore may lessen patients'&#xD;
      symptoms and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 7 years of age and older with generalized dystonia that does not respond to medical&#xD;
      treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      chest x-ray, and an electrocardiogram in patients 35 years of age or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images&#xD;
           of the brain. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow&#xD;
           cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur&#xD;
           during the scanning process. The procedure usually lasts about 45 to 90 minutes, during&#xD;
           which the patient is asked to lie still for up to 15 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation. This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is&#xD;
           held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a&#xD;
           magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the patient may be&#xD;
           asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation&#xD;
           may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the patient may hear a click&#xD;
           and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. During the stimulation,&#xD;
           electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer, using electrodes attached to&#xD;
           the skin with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurologic evaluation. Before and after DBS, the patient's dystonia, including voice&#xD;
           strength and difficulty swallowing, are measured with a standardized rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DBS treatment. Patients are randomly assigned to have electrodes implanted in either the&#xD;
           Gpi or STN area of the basal ganglia. The electrodes are what stimulate the brain in DBS&#xD;
           therapy. Before surgery, a frame is secured to the patient's head, and an MRI scan is&#xD;
           done. DBS involves making two small incisions and two small holes in the skull, opening&#xD;
           the lining around the brain, locating the Gpi or STN, securing the electrodes in place&#xD;
           and connecting them to the pulse generator that is placed under the skin below the&#xD;
           collar bone. Additionally, during the surgery, the patient is asked to move certain&#xD;
           muscles. The muscle activity is recorded to gain a better understanding of the&#xD;
           physiology of movement. After surgery, computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans are done&#xD;
           to confirm placement of the electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulation and evaluation. After surgery, patients' movements are evaluated during and&#xD;
           after stimulation. The changes in movement and function are videotaped and scored&#xD;
           according to a rating scale. The optimal stimulation settings are determined and the&#xD;
           stimulators are adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up. Patients are evaluated, with videotaping, at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months&#xD;
           after surgery, and the stimulators are adjusted as needed.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dystonic patients who have failed medical therapy, stereotactic deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (Gpi) or subthalamic nucleus (STN) can provide&#xD;
      significant symptom improvement, but it is not known which site provides maximum benefit or&#xD;
      the physiologic mechanisms by which these improvements may occur. The study goals are to&#xD;
      determine if DBS of Gpi or STN provides significant clinical improvement in patients with&#xD;
      primary generalized dystonia, whether the anatomic DBS site (if either) provides optimal&#xD;
      improvement, and to gain deeper insight into the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult and pediatric patients with medically refractory primary generalized dystonia will&#xD;
      make-up the study population. Patients with primary generalized dystonia suffer a wide range&#xD;
      of symptoms including physical deformity, speech difficulties, swallowing dysfunction, visual&#xD;
      problems, and intractable pain, which can result in an inability to care for themselves.&#xD;
      Moreover, pediatric primary generalized dystonia patients will often have abnormal skeletal&#xD;
      development (scoliosis) resulting from the abnormal forces placed on the skeleton by dystonic&#xD;
      muscle contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose placing DBS electrodes (using microelectrode guidance) bilaterally into either the&#xD;
      Gpi or STN of medically refractory dystonia patients. Physiological studies will be performed&#xD;
      and compared with clinical changes to understand the mechanism of action of DBS and&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology of dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical effectiveness of DBS of the Gpi or STN will be measured by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden&#xD;
      Scale (BFM) and monitored over time to determine the effectiveness of DBS and if there is an&#xD;
      ideal anatomic stimulation site. Electrophysiologic outcome measures will be obtained to&#xD;
      determine the underlying pathophysiology of dystonia, and the mechanism of action of DBS.&#xD;
