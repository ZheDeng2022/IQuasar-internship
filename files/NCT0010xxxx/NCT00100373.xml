      The purpose of this study is to measure the immune response (how the body fights infection)&#xD;
      to an experimental preparation of live Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). A better&#xD;
      understanding of this virus may be useful in development of vaccines and treatments.&#xD;
      Participants will include 20 healthy adults age 21-40. Study procedures will include drawing&#xD;
      blood, urine samples, respiratory exams, vital signs and temperature, diary cards, nasal&#xD;
      mucus weight and nasal washes and swabs. All participants will receive vaccine via nose&#xD;
      drops. Patients will participate in the study for about 2 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Recently,&#xD;
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been shown to account for a significant portion of&#xD;
      these illnesses. The causative factors associated with severe RSV disease in the elderly are&#xD;
      not well understood. The contribution of viral load, host inflammatory responses and the&#xD;
      cellular immune response to disease pathogenesis are unknown. A better understanding of these&#xD;
      processes may be useful in the development of vaccines and therapeutics for RSV disease.&#xD;
      Although the adult groups at highest risk for serious RSV disease are elderly and high-risk&#xD;
      adults, we propose to use the challenge model in young healthy adults to determine optimal&#xD;
      timing of specimen collection and the feasibility of performing certain tests before moving&#xD;
      ahead to the target groups with natural infection. The purpose of this study is to measure&#xD;
      the immune response (how the body fights infection) to an experimental preparation of live&#xD;
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV. Participants will include 20 healthy adults age 21-40.&#xD;
      Study procedures will include drawing blood, urine samples, respiratory exams, vital signs&#xD;
      and temperature, diary cards, nasal mucus weight and nasal washes and swabs. All participants&#xD;
      will receive vaccine via nose drops. Patients will participate in the study for about 2&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy adults ages 21 to 40 years. Able to and has given informed consent to participate.&#xD;
        Negative urine pregnancy test, if female. Pre-challenge serum neutralizing titer to RSV A2&#xD;
        by microneutalization (MNA) of &lt;/= 1:657 (9.36 log2) Non-smoker No significant health&#xD;
        abnormalities detected by evaluation of medical history, general physical examination,&#xD;
        vital signs and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to remain in isolation for 11 nights and comply with all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to remain in the Rochester area for the 28 days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers with any of the following conditions will not be eligible to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chronic medical conditions requiring medical followup within the last 6 months. Serologic&#xD;
        evidence of infection with HIV or hepatitis C virus, or presence of hepatitis B surface&#xD;
        antigen in serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of medically documented asthma requiring treatment (including over-the-counter&#xD;
        medications) at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any abnormal laboratory results which would render challenge with RSV unsafe or interfere&#xD;
        with the interpretation of the subject's response to challenge, e.g., AST, ALT, Bilirubin,&#xD;
        BUN, creatinine. ( see Appendix II) Individuals requiring concurrent therapy with&#xD;
        medications likely to interfere with evaluation of the response to infection, e.g.&#xD;
        antipyretics, anti-inflammatory medications Close contact with children aged less than 2&#xD;
        years, with any individuals with significant immunosuppression, or with individuals greater&#xD;
        than 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Health care workers with any patient contact during the two weeks following challenge&#xD;
        Pregnancy or uncertain status regarding pregnancy Acute respiratory infection or fever&#xD;
        within 1 week of challenge Previous enrollment in a study evaluating RSV challenge viruses&#xD;
        or RSV vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known glucose intolerance (history of abnormal glucose tolerance test or medical history of&#xD;
        diabetes mellitus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of chronic obstructive disease, emphysema or other serious or evolving pulmonary&#xD;
        disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any condition in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with study objectives or&#xD;
        pose excessive risks to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of previous hospitalization for a pulmonary condition (ie. Pneumonia, asthma,&#xD;
        spontaneous pneumothorax, or severe sinus disease requiring a surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of frequent serious bacterial infections associated with low white blood cell count&#xD;
        (below 4,000 per microgram)&#xD;
