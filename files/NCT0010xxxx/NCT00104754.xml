      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal SN-38, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well liposomal SN-38 works in treating patients&#xD;
      with small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the response rate in patients with small cell lung cancer treated with SN-38&#xD;
           liposome that is dosed according to a UGT1A1-specific genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine, preliminarily, overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with&#xD;
           this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate UGT1A1-specific haplotypes with toxicity of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate UGT1A1-specific haplotypes with outcomes of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to length of time&#xD;
      since prior treatment (previously untreated disease OR chemosensitive disease and ≥ 3 months&#xD;
      since prior treatment vs refractory disease OR chemoresistant disease and &lt; 3 months since&#xD;
      prior treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive SN-38 liposome IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      achieving a complete or partial response or patients with stable disease (SD) who were&#xD;
      previously treated before study enrollment receive up to 4 additional courses of treatment.&#xD;
      Patients with CNS-only disease progression receive whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). After&#xD;
      completion of WBRT, these patients also receive up to 4 additional courses of treatment.&#xD;
      Patients with disease progression to sites other than the CNS or patients with SD who were&#xD;
      previously untreated before study enrollment are removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each treatment course, and then annually for&#xD;
      3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 73 patients (40 for stratum I and 33 for stratum II) will be&#xD;
      accrued for this study within 16-19 months.&#xD;
