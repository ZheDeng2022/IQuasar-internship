      The purpose of this study is to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in racial and&#xD;
      ethnic minorities. Specifically, the study seeks to systematically characterize potential&#xD;
      ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of psychology,&#xD;
      physiology, biochemistry, nursing, and clinical medicine.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there has been great progress in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality in the U.S. over&#xD;
      the past 40 years, some minority groups have not shared fully in this progress and continue&#xD;
      to have lower life expectancy and higher CVD morbidity. On average, minorities have less&#xD;
      access to medical care, receive less aggressive care and fewer diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      cardiac procedures, and adhere poorly to prescribed medical regimens. Thus, research to&#xD;
      reduce health disparities by improving CVD outcomes in minorities offers potential for a&#xD;
      substantial positive public heath impact. Academic medical centers and institutions capable&#xD;
      of carrying out such research, however, often lack access to and the trust of minority&#xD;
      patients. Minority patients often receive fragmented care because they lack access to regular&#xD;
      medical care, present to emergency departments rather than primary care physicians for&#xD;
      complications of an advanced chronic CVD condition, and are less likely to follow medical&#xD;
      regimens. Minority communities often harbor distrust of clinical research. Minority patients&#xD;
      report greater satisfaction when receiving care from minority providers and are reluctant to&#xD;
      receive treatment outside their minority healthcare serving systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, minorities have high rates of hypertension, elevated cholesterol, cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, as well as other behavioral,&#xD;
      environmental, and occupational risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, such as sleep&#xD;
      problems - all elements that contribute to excess CVD morbidity and mortality. The causes of&#xD;
      minority health disparities are complex and incompletely understood. Although evidence of&#xD;
      genetic, biologic, and environmental factors is well documented, poor outcomes are also&#xD;
      attributed to under-treatment. Such under-treatment may be due to limited access to health&#xD;
      care or, in some cases, break-down of the medical system, or failure of the physician and/or&#xD;
      patient to allow for optimal health care, even when access is not impaired. The complex&#xD;
      interactions of behavior, socio-economic status (SES), culture, and ethnicity are important&#xD;
      predictors of health outcomes and sources of health disparities. Despite efforts to elucidate&#xD;
      genetic and environmental risk factors and to promote cardiovascular health in high-risk&#xD;
      populations, trends in CVD outcomes suggest that CVD health disparities continue to widen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Partnerships Program to Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involves collaboration&#xD;
      between research-intensive medical centers (RIMCs) that have a track record of NIH-supported&#xD;
      research and patient care and minority healthcare serving systems (MSSs) that lack a strong&#xD;
      research program. Each Partnership Program will: a) design and carry out multiple&#xD;
      interdisciplinary research projects that investigate complex biological, behavioral,and&#xD;
      societal factors that contribute to CVD health disparities and facilitate clinical research&#xD;
      within the MSS to improve CVD outcomes and reduce health disparities, and b) provide&#xD;
      reciprocal educational and skills development programs so that investigators will be able to&#xD;
      conduct research aimed at reducing cardiovascular disparities and thereby enhance research&#xD;
      opportunities, enrich cultural sensitivity, and improve cardiovascular research capabilities&#xD;
      at both institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Request for Applications for Partnership Programs to Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities&#xD;
      was released in September 2003. The awards were made in September 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, there has been an explosive increase in obesity among all age groups&#xD;
      within the U.S. population. This epidemic is particularly problematic among African Americans&#xD;
      in the Southeast. Although genetic factors play a contributory role, it is postulated that&#xD;
      ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related CVD are related to a dynamic interplay&#xD;
      between biological factors and the behavioral response to the unique environmental context&#xD;
      within ethnic communities. Obesity is often associated with perturbations in the metabolic&#xD;
      and physiologic milieu. A cluster of obesity-related abnormalities has been defined as the&#xD;
      &quot;Metabolic Syndrome&quot;. The CVD complications of obesity appears to be related to the capacity&#xD;
      for adipose tissue itself to generate &quot;adipokines&quot; that directly predispose to&#xD;
      insulin-resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use state-of-the-art approaches to define potential ethnic differences in the&#xD;
      profile of metabolic, physiologic, and biochemical features associated with obesity as well&#xD;
      as the salutary responses to lifestyle modification. The program uses a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      strategy to systematically characterize potential ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD&#xD;
      by drawing upon the fields of psychology, physiology, biochemistry, nursing, and clinical&#xD;
      medicine. In a thematic series of inter-related studies, the program's research plan ranges&#xD;
      from epidemiology studies within the ethnic communities, to patient-centered clinical trial&#xD;
      interventions within ethnic community practices, to the analysis of novel biomarkers of human&#xD;
      pathobiology. This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary&#xD;
      partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine and Emory University. This partnership&#xD;
      shares a joint commitment to address the striking ethnic disparities in the high-risk CVD&#xD;
      population. The specific aims are: 1) to define the relative influence of&#xD;
      psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities&#xD;
      in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort; 2) to define&#xD;
      the effectiveness of patient-targeted behavioral interventions to enhance the health of&#xD;
      African American patients with the Metabolic Syndrome in the context of community-based&#xD;
      clinical practices; 3) to assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies&#xD;
      on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African Americans; and 4) to&#xD;
      enhance the education/training of fellows/practitioners engaged in CVD disparities&#xD;
      research/practice and promote partnerships that enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
