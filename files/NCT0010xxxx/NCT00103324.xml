  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well lapatinib works in treating patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic stomach cancer. Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the confirmed response (complete and partial) probability in patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic gastric cancer treated with GW572016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the time to treatment failure and overall survival in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess, in a preliminary manner, the relationship of protein expression and gene&#xD;
      expression of EGFR, HER2 and markers of angiogenesis with clinical outcomes in patients&#xD;
      treated with GW572016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must either be able to swallow and/or receive enteral medications via&#xD;
             gastrostomy feeding tube; patients with intractable nausea or vomiting are not&#xD;
             eligible; patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral&#xD;
             medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical&#xD;
             procedures affecting absorption, or uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g.,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;

               -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is&#xD;
                  done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday&#xD;
                  four weeks later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient&#xD;
                  scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number&#xD;
             must be provided to the Statistical Center in order to ensure that the current (within&#xD;
             365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered&#xD;
             into the data base&#xD;
