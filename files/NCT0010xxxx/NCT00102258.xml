      This study will determine whether adding more calories to the diet helps boys with growth&#xD;
      problems grow better while being treated with Nutropin, a growth hormone that is used to help&#xD;
      children grow taller. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Nutropin for use in&#xD;
      children who are very short. This study will examine whether giving nutritional supplements&#xD;
      in addition to Nutropin can help children grow better than with Nutropin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boys between 7 and 10 years of age who are very short and below average in weight, but are&#xD;
      otherwise healthy may be eligible for this study. Candidates must qualify for Nutropin&#xD;
      treatments to boost their growth. Boys will be recruited for the study from the Nemours&#xD;
      Children's Clinic in Jacksonville, FL, and from the National Institutes of Health in&#xD;
      Bethesda, MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group is observed for&#xD;
      6 months and then receives a Nutropin injection every day for 12 months. The second group&#xD;
      drinks 8 ounces of a high-calorie beverage called Pediasure every day for 6 months and then&#xD;
      receives Nutropin plus Pediasure every day for 12 months. In addition to treatment,&#xD;
      participants undergo the following tests and procedures at the schedule indicated: Baseline,&#xD;
      3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition assessment: Skin-fold thickness calipers are used in four places on the&#xD;
           body to estimate body fat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioelectric impedance: A small amount of electrical current is used to calculate the&#xD;
           percentage of body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone age x-ray: x-ray of the left hand to measure growth potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) scan: x-ray scan to measure body fat, muscle,&#xD;
           and bone mineral content. The subject lies on a flat table during the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record of dietary intake: Parents are asked to write down everything the child eats and&#xD;
           drinks for 3 days. Using this record, a dietitian calculates the daily caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total energy expenditure: This test determines how much energy the child uses. For the&#xD;
           test, the child drinks water labeled with harmless isotopes (heavy oxygen and heavy&#xD;
           hydrogen). For the next 10 days he collects urine in plastic tubes at home. At the end&#xD;
           of the 10 days, the parents bring the urine to the clinic for analysis to determine how&#xD;
           fast the labeled water leaves the body. This information is used to calculate how much&#xD;
           energy the child expends each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' weight is measured at 2 and 4 weeks, and then monthly for the remainder of the&#xD;
      18-month study.&#xD;

      We propose a pilot study to examine the role of nutrition and its interaction with growth&#xD;
      hormone (GH) therapy in boys with very short stature who also have delayed bone age&#xD;
      characteristic of constitutional delay of growth and maturation (CDGM). Recent studies have&#xD;
      suggested that insufficient caloric intake may contribute to the pathophysiology of CDGM.&#xD;
      This prompted us to consider whether nutritional intervention may benefit children with&#xD;
      severe short stature who also have CDGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this further, we would like to enroll a total of 20 boys (10-15 boys in&#xD;
      Jacksonville, Florida and 5-10 boys at the NIH, Bethesda, Maryland), ages 7-10 years, who are&#xD;
      otherwise healthy, but have significant short stature (height SDS less than -2.25 = the&#xD;
      current FDA approved indication for the use of GH in idiopathic short stature), delayed bone&#xD;
      age (greater than 12 months below chronologic age), and low BMI and weight-for-height (less&#xD;
      than 25th percentile). Ten boys will be randomized to receive observation for 6 months,&#xD;
      followed by GH therapy for 12 months. Ten boys will be randomized to receive daily liquid&#xD;
      nutritional supplementation for 6 months, followed by combined GH therapy and nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation for 12 months. For all subjects, weight gain will be monitored at 2 weeks, 4&#xD;
      weeks, and then monthly. Height gain and body composition (using skin-fold thickness calipers&#xD;
      and bioelectric impedance analysis) will be assessed every 3 months. Total energy&#xD;
      expenditure, three-day dietary history, bone age, body composition/bone mineral density&#xD;
      (using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), and laboratory studies (IGF1, IGFBP3, pre-albumin,&#xD;
      transferrin, ghrelin, fasting insulin, glucose, and lipid profile) will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline and then every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that nutritional supplementation alone can lead to small improvements in&#xD;
      linear growth and lean body mass accrual, but when combined with GH therapy, can augment the&#xD;
      anabolic actions of GH, thereby resulting in even greater improvements in linear growth&#xD;
      velocity and lean body mass accrual than GH alone. If the data from this study confirm this&#xD;
      trend, we would then like to proceed with a larger study, appropriately powered based on the&#xD;
      results of this pilot.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 7-10 years, genital Tanner 1, significant short stature (current height less than&#xD;
        2.25SD below the mean for age), body mass index (BMI) less than 25th percentile for age,&#xD;
        weight-for-height less than 25th percentile, bone age less than 10 years and with delay&#xD;
        greater than 1 year below chronological age, minimum of 6 months of documented height&#xD;
        measurements performed in the pediatric endocrinology clinic using a stadiometer to permit&#xD;
        accurate calculation of baseline growth velocity at time of enrollment, otherwise normal&#xD;
        physical exam, expressed desire for medical intervention to promote growth, and assessment&#xD;
        by a pediatric endocrinologist that the boy qualifies for GH treatment according to current&#xD;
        FDA guidelines for the use of GH in children with idiopathic short stature (i.e., children&#xD;
        who are determined not to have growth hormone deficiency but have height less than -2.25SD&#xD;
        below the mean for age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of major/chronic illness, anosmia/hyposmia, any clinically significant&#xD;
        abnormalities on biochemical testing. GH deficiency would be excluded prior to enrollment&#xD;
        based on anthropometric and GH stimulation test data. Endocrinopathies (except stable&#xD;
        thyroid replacement), skeletal dysplasias, participation in highly competitive endurance&#xD;
        sports activities, diagnosis of ADHD with use of stimulant medication in the previous 3&#xD;
        months will also be exclusion criteria.&#xD;
