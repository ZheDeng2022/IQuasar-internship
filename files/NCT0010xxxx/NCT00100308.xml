      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low dose continuous infusion of&#xD;
      unfractioned heparin (500 units/hour), in addition to the standard treatment, is efficacious&#xD;
      as complementary therapy for sepsis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is considered a leading cause of death worldwide with approximately 18 million cases&#xD;
      annually and a mortality rate of almost 30%. The search for efficacious therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches has largely failed and only a few of the recent interventions, such as activated&#xD;
      protein C and low dose steroids, have shown some success in improving survival. However,&#xD;
      these interventions were tested only in patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock and&#xD;
      although these groups exhibit the highest mortality, they represent less than 50% of the&#xD;
      total affected population. Furthermore, these interventions necessitate special devices,&#xD;
      tests and/or drugs that might be unavailable or simply unaffordable in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal and human models have suggested that heparin, in addition to successfully inhibiting&#xD;
      the coagulation cascade, may also modulate the wide array of responses to infection.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the three clinical trials for recombinant anticoagulants allowed the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment for venous thrombosis with a dose of unfractioned heparin (UFH) of up&#xD;
      to 10,000 or 15,000 units subcutaneously per day. When those who did receive heparin were&#xD;
      compared to those who did not in the placebo arms of the clinical trials, all three studies&#xD;
      showed a higher mortality in the subgroups that did not receive heparin. Although this is not&#xD;
      a randomized comparison, a constant result in three different study populations with variable&#xD;
      entry criteria, along with the natural heterogeneity of the illness, strongly fosters the&#xD;
      hypothesis that heparin might reduce, beyond its known anticoagulant and antithrombotic&#xD;
      properties, the overall mortality for sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we propose a phase II/III, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      single-center clinical trial with a total sample size of 310 patients, for testing low dose&#xD;
      continuous infusions of UFH (500 units/hour) for 7 days, as complementary treatment for&#xD;
      septic patients. Our primary aims are to estimate the effects of UFH on length of stay and&#xD;
      change from baseline Multiple Organic Dysfunction (MOD) score. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      estimate the effects of UFH on 28-day all-cause mortality, and to estimate the possible&#xD;
      effect-modification on 28-day all-cause mortality, in subgroups defined by site of infection&#xD;
      and baseline values of APACHE II score, MOD score and D-dimer.&#xD;
