      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - National Institute on Aging researchers are looking at studies that require large numbers&#xD;
      of white blood cells for lab use. Standard blood samples do not provide enough white blood&#xD;
      cells for these studies. Researchers want to use cytapheresis to collect white blood cells&#xD;
      from volunteer donors. This procedure can collect larger amounts of white blood cells and&#xD;
      reduce the amount of fluid and other cells that are lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use cytapheresis to collect white blood cells for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy blood donors at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened according to the usual blood donation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide white blood cells through cytapheresis. The blood cells will&#xD;
           be collected in a machine that separates the white blood cells from the rest of the&#xD;
           blood. The rest of the blood will be returned to the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have this type of donation every 56 days (six times per year). They&#xD;
           will be asked to become a repeat donor. A donation schedule may be set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a year, participants will have blood tests to continue to be eligible as a donor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytapheresis is an automated method/process of cell removal and collection that involves a&#xD;
      continuous flow cell separation by centrifugation and the withdrawal of a particular blood&#xD;
      component. This allows blood components not collected to be continuously&#xD;
&#xD;
      returned to the donor. Guidance and recommendations for the performance of these procedures&#xD;
      are provided in detail in the Standards of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) and&#xD;
      in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to provide white blood cells obtained by cytapheresis to National&#xD;
      Institute on Aging (NIA) researchers for other in-vitro research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of healthy males and females 18 years and older. Study subjects&#xD;
      are anticipated to be non-patient community volunteers. Individuals will not be excluded&#xD;
      based on gender, race or ethnicity. The number of subjects to be enrolled will&#xD;
&#xD;
      be 10, 000. This will allow us to try and maintain 200 active participants in this protocol.&#xD;
      Volunteers are screened initially and annually by a health history questionnaire and&#xD;
      laboratory testing to screen for bleeding or immune disorders. Participants may undergo a&#xD;
      cytapheresis procedure every fifty-six days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect blood component cells for distribution to NIA research investigators for&#xD;
      their studies of the immune system. We will be performing cytapheresis for the collection of&#xD;
      3 7 blood component packs per week. We will need to maintain an active volunteer pool of&#xD;
      approximately 200 active volunteers.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal healthy males and females, age 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate venous access in bilateral upper extremities to accommodate at least a #18&#xD;
             gauge dialysis needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to come to the NIA Apheresis Unit at Harbor Hospital in&#xD;
             Baltimore for a blood collection procedure approximately every 56 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to verify identification of volunteer by state issued ID card, driver s&#xD;
             license, or military ID. Participants earning greater than $600.00/year areissued a&#xD;
             1099 form, therefore, positive identification is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight less than 110 pounds as mandated by AABB guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic Immunosuppressive medications such as Steroids, Cellcept or Sirolimus.&#xD;
             Steroids given for minor illness ok if taken more than 6 weeks before any cytapherisis&#xD;
             procedure. Immunosuppressive medications may not be used at the time of the&#xD;
             cytapheresis procedure as they decrease circulating white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Test results are positive for viral infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B or C and RPR.&#xD;
             Researchers are seeking healthy, pristine cells. Due to the ongoing nature of these&#xD;
             chronic viral and bacterial infections, the white cell populations in the peripheral&#xD;
             blood will change. Researchers want to study changing white cell populations as a&#xD;
             factor of aging only and not those altered by infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing risk factors for HIV or Hepatitis B or C such as: intravenous drug use,&#xD;
             non-monogamous unprotected intercourse, or chronic use of clotting factor concentrates&#xD;
             such as prothrombin complexes, Factor XIII or Factor VIIa. These viruses weaken the&#xD;
             immune system and cause changes in the white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Risk factors for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease such as: a relative with the disease,&#xD;
             received beef insulin or growth hormone from human pituitary glands, or&#xD;
             residency/travel to high risk countries (complete list of countries located in the&#xD;
             Cytapheresis Screening manual kept in the NIA apheresis unit). This is a transmittable&#xD;
             infectious disease with a very long incubation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major medical illnesses such as any type of liquid or solid tumor cancer, diabetes,&#xD;
             history of deep vein thrombosis, organ or bone marrow transplant, or liver, kidney,&#xD;
             heart or lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A medical finding that shows a participant could not safely go through this procedure.&#xD;
             (such as Parkinson s disease, dementia or any uncontrolled behavior that would place&#xD;
             the participant s safety at risk)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major infectious diseases such as Chagas disease, babesiosis, syphilis or malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding conditions such as hemophilia or von Willebrand s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant abnormalities are found in the results of blood tests such as elevated&#xD;
             liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function, positive viral titers, fasting blood glucose&#xD;
             greater than 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On any medication that can alter white blood cell function such as chronic steroid&#xD;
             use, histamine-2 blockers, antivirals or chemotherapy. (complete list located in the&#xD;
             Cytapheresis Screening manual stored in the NIA Apheresis unit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, eligible participants may not be able to participate in a specific&#xD;
        cytapheresis procedure but might be eligible at a later date for:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers - Females who are pregnant or who have had a pregnancy&#xD;
             in the last 6 weeks are temporarily deferred. They may resume apheresis participation&#xD;
             6 weeks after delivery or cessation of lactation and have been cleared by their&#xD;
             obstetrician or primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medications: Volunteers taking the following medications would be deferred:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antibiotics, antifungals, antimalarials: Deferred for 2 weeks after course has&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hepatitis B immune globulin: Volunteers are deferred 6 months if given after&#xD;
                  exposure to hepatitis B to insure the volunteer has not been infected. If&#xD;
                  administered for prophylaxis, no deferral is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Live Attenuated Virus Vaccinations: Defer for 4 weeks if symptom-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inactivated (Killed Virus) Vaccinations: Defer for 2 weeks if symptom-free.&#xD;

                  accept immediately if symptom-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Smallpox Vaccine: Deferred until the scab has separated from the skin&#xD;
                  spontaneously or 21 days from date of immunization, whichever is longer, if&#xD;
                  volunteer had no other symptoms or complications. Visual verification of absence&#xD;
                  of vaccine scab is required. If scab was otherwise removed (not spontaneously&#xD;
                  separated), defer for 2 months after vaccination date.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Blood thinners such as Plavix, Ticlid or Lovenox. Deferral for 5 days after last&#xD;
                  dose to decrease bleeding risk at needle puncture sites. Participants are not&#xD;
                  deferred for the use of aspirin or aspirin products.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Experimental Medication or Unlicensed (Experimental) Vaccine is usually&#xD;
                  associated with a research protocol and the effect on blood donation is unknown.&#xD;
                  Deferral is one year unless otherwise indicated by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Temporary health issues&#xD;

                  to normal activities by primary care physician or surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Close contact with someone else s blood, accidental needle-stick, treatment for&#xD;
                  syphilis or gonorrhea Volunteers are deferred for 6 months to insure they have&#xD;
                  not been infected. Viral/serology testing will be repeated and verified as&#xD;
                  negative prior to apheresis procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Factors that are high risk (but are non on-going) for HIV, Hepatitis B or C such&#xD;
                  as: (Volunteers will be deferred for 6 months after to insure they have not been&#xD;
                  infected with an infectious disease or virus. Viral testing and annual labs will&#xD;
