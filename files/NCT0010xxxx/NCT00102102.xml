    <textblock>
      This study will examine the role of substance P, a chemical messenger in the brain, in&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a chronic anxiety disorder. PTSD can develop after&#xD;
      exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal, such as a violent personal assault, natural or&#xD;
      human-caused disaster, accident, or military combat. Substance P is a peptide that may be&#xD;
      important in the response to certain psychiatric and neurological diseases and conditions,&#xD;
      including anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people with PTSD who are between 18 and 65 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant, and a neuropsychological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scanning. An optional lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is also requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET Scanning&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET uses small amounts of a radioactive chemical called a tracer that &quot;labels&quot; active areas&#xD;
      of the brain. The tracer used in this study is [18F]SPA-RQ. For the procedure, the subject&#xD;
      lies still on the scanner bed. A special mask is fitted to the head to help keep the&#xD;
      subject's head still during the scan so the images will be clear. A 20-minute &quot;transmission&quot;&#xD;
      scan is done before the radioactive tracer is injected to provide measures of the brain that&#xD;
      will help in the precise calculation of information from subsequent scans. After the tracer&#xD;
      is injected through a needle in the arm, pictures are taken continuously for about 2 hours.&#xD;
      Then, 20- to 40-minute images are taken every hour until about 5 hours after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Scanning&#xD;
&#xD;
      An MRI scan is scheduled at some time within 1 year of the PET scan. MRI uses a magnetic&#xD;
      field and radio waves to obtain images of body tissues and organs. The subject lies still on&#xD;
      a table inside the tunnel-like MRI scanner. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises that&#xD;
      occur during the scanning. The maximum duration of the scan is 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar Puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture is used to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds both the&#xD;
      brain and the spinal cord. For this procedure, a local anesthetic is given to numb the skin&#xD;
      in the lower back area. A small needle is then inserted into the space between the bones in&#xD;
      the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is&#xD;
      collected through the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Draw&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample is collected to generate cell lines that can be used to extract DNA (genetic&#xD;
      material) for gene studies and that can be frozen for future use.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, debilitating disorder that places a&#xD;
      significant burden on individuals and society. Abnormalities in the serotonergic and&#xD;
      noradrenergic systems and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis have&#xD;
      been proposed as neurobiological mechanisms in the development of the disorder, however the&#xD;
      exact underpinnings of the neurobiology of the disorder must be elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of substance P (SP) and its receptor, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, includes&#xD;
      regions implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD, namely the amygdala, hippocampus,&#xD;
      hypothalamus, and locus ceruleus. There is a considerable spatial (and therefore functional)&#xD;
      overlap between the SP-NK1 receptor system and other neurotransmitter (e.g., norepinephrine,&#xD;
      serotonin) pathways with well established roles in anxiety. Preclinical studies indicate that&#xD;
      stress regulates levels of SP in several brain regions. In addition, in several animal&#xD;
      models, NK1 receptor antagonists demonstrate anxiolytic-like property. These anxiolytic-like&#xD;
      effects seem to involve different mechanisms than those of currently available anxiolytics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we will use a PET ligand that acts as an NK1 receptor antagonist,&#xD;
      [18F]SPA-RQ ([18F]-labeled Substance P Antagonist Receptor Quantifier). Using this tracer, we&#xD;
      will look for regional differences in NK1 receptor binding in 20 patients with PTSD and 20&#xD;
      healthy controls. The goal of the present study is to demonstrate the involvement of SP in&#xD;
      PTSD, and thereby, further our understanding of its role in the psychopathology of this&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        PTSD Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Twenty subjects (age 18-65) with current PTSD, as defined by DSM-IV criteria, of any&#xD;
        ethnicity without other significant medical conditions will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Control Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Twenty healthy subjects (age 18-65) without a known personal or family history of&#xD;
        psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A control subject will be matched to each subject with PTSD for age, gender, and&#xD;
        handedness, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        They must not be actively using illicit drugs or engaged in heavy consumption of alcohol,&#xD;
        had no metallic implants that are ferromagnetic, and competent to sign consent forms to&#xD;
        participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have taken antidepressant or other medications likely to alter SP-NK1&#xD;
        receptor system. Effective medications will not be discontinued for the purpose of this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. DSM-IV Axis I diagnostic criteria other than PTSD and Major depression (All controls&#xD;
             must not meet any of the Axis I diagnoses);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. DSM-IV criteria for psychoactive substance abuse/dependence within six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. take psychotropic medication in last 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. abnormal MRI other than minor atrophy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. abnormal laboratory test, including HIV test;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. are currently pregnant or breast feeding (as documented by pregnancy testing at&#xD;
             screening or at days of the scanning);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. prior participation in other research protocols within the past year such that a&#xD;
             radiation exposure together with the present study would exceed the annual limits (A&#xD;
             total effective dose 5.0 rem in a year and a 5 rad per year to the lens of the eyes,&#xD;
             gonads and blood-forming organs; and 15 rad annually for all other organs);&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. are unable to lay on one's back for PET/MRI scans (PET and MRI scans take&#xD;
             approximately 5 and 1 hour, respectively);&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. any condition that increases risk for MRI (e.g., pacemaker, metallic foreign body in&#xD;
             the eye, etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. individuals who recently donated blood;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. serious suicidal ideation or behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Xylocaine allergy;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. positive HIV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For healthy subjects, exclusion criteria b) through m) are same to those for PTSD subjects.&#xD;
        As for item a), subjects will be excluded if they meet any current DSM-IV Axis I diagnostic&#xD;
        criteria.&#xD;
