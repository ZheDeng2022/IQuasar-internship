      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given&#xD;
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating women with&#xD;
      breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Tipifarnib is a drug that binds to&#xD;
      specific proteins on the tumor cells and then kills these cells. Gemcitabine hydrochloride is&#xD;
      a chemotherapy drug that may kill tumor cells by preventing cells from dividing. Giving&#xD;
      tipifarnib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the objective response rate of the combination of gemcitabine (gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride) and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib (R115777) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the duration of response, time to disease progression in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer treated with the combination of gemcitabine and tipifarnib&#xD;
      (R115777).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
