    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on how people sense leg position and movement. The&#xD;
      findings may help scientists develop better ways to evaluate and treat joint problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers between 21 and 40 years of age may be eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a brief questionnaire and examination to determine their&#xD;
      strength, flexibility, and sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants sit on a specially designed chair, with their foot and leg placed in a&#xD;
      custom-made apparatus that controls knee and ankle movements. The skin is marked to indicate&#xD;
      the area of interest for ultrasound assessment of muscle. Subjects respond to joint position&#xD;
      changes for several trials. The procedure takes a maximum of 2.5 hours to complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proprioception can be described as afferent information typically arising from peripheral&#xD;
      mechanoreceptors that contribute to postural control, joint stability and conscious sensation&#xD;
      of movement. Sensation of movement can be further divided into joint position sense (JPS) and&#xD;
      the detection of passive movement sense (DPMS). Collectively, these two sensory modalities&#xD;
      are commonly referred to as joint kinesthesia. Joint kinesthesia appears dependent on&#xD;
      specific joint anatomical structure, suggesting different levels of acuity among various&#xD;
      joints. However, whole limb accuracy appears to be greater than summed error across multiple&#xD;
      joints of an extremity. Some suggest that it is only JPS errors greater than 3 degrees that&#xD;
      have any functional significance on gait. However, the authors' calculations of position&#xD;
      error on gait neglect JPS errors from the ankle and hip, which could also severely influence&#xD;
      whole limb position sense, impacting gait. We believe that the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      links together afferent proprioceptive feedback from multiple joints of a limb segment to&#xD;
      reduce kinesthetic error across a whole limb. The redundancy of the afferent information can&#xD;
      be used as an &quot;error check&quot; to improve proprioceptive feedback in order to maintain function.&#xD;
      We have used the term Coupled Joint Proprioception (CJP) in order to describe this&#xD;
      phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the relationship between CJP and human function, we would have to&#xD;
      isolate movement at two adjacent joints, while controlling bi-articular muscle length, to&#xD;
      determine its influence on single joint kinesthesia. Bi-articular muscles provide a&#xD;
      mechanical linkage within a limb to transfer forces. Afferent information from bi-articular&#xD;
      muscles in particular could provide a context with which proprioceptive information from&#xD;
      other structures (single joint muscles, joint or cutaneous receptors) can maintain or enhance&#xD;
      proprioception within a limb. The redundant information, provided by the two-joint muscles,&#xD;
      is the basis on which we describe CJP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this non-invasive pilot study is to establish the methodology&#xD;
      necessary to test the influence of CJP on knee joint kinesthesia and proprioceptive&#xD;
      capabilities. The primary goal is to establish two experimental conditions in which similar&#xD;
      motions of simultaneous knee joint extension and ankle joint plantar flexion result in&#xD;
      shortening and lengthening of all gastrocnemius muscle fibers. Following establishment of&#xD;
      these conditions, the second goal is to develop and evaluate novel methods for studying the&#xD;
      influence of CJP on the detection of passive movement and joint position sense at the knee&#xD;
      joint. The information from this pilot data will also help determine the total number of&#xD;
      subjects required to undertake a larger clinical investigation of the CJP phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to study CJP, as proprioception is typically measured clinically at a single&#xD;
      joint in human subjects. Human function usually incorporates multiple joints, suggesting that&#xD;
      CJP, measured across two joints, could be more representative of human proprioceptive&#xD;
      function. Therefore, CJP would provide an avenue to better study the influence of&#xD;
      proprioceptive feedback on human function such as walking. This is especially important&#xD;
      because maintaining proprioceptive feedback while walking may minimize falls in patients who&#xD;
      are at risk due to lower extremity injuries or pathologies.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will include healthy males and females between 21 and 40 years of age. This age&#xD;
        range is scientifically justified as both the CNS and musculoskeletal system are not fully&#xD;
        matured until adulthood while lower extremity proprioception is reported to decrease with&#xD;
        older subjects. For this project the term healthy is defined as a lack of systemic disease&#xD;
        that alters ability of subjects to participate in activities of their choice. In addition,&#xD;
        healthy means no current pathology where there is any possibility of damage to muscle,&#xD;
        ligament or cartilage in the lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a history of lower extremity musculoskeletal injury, which can alter&#xD;
        peripheral feedback from cutaneous joint or muscle mechanoreceptors, will be excluded from&#xD;
        this study. This includes a recent history of chronic or severe lower extremity injuries&#xD;
        such as recent surgery, trauma, degenerative joint changes, which could influence&#xD;
        performance in this study. Examples of exclusions include ankle sprains and patella&#xD;
        dislocations and subjects will be excluded if they have experienced these injuries within&#xD;
        the last six months. Multiple (greater than 3) injuries, such as those described, would&#xD;
        warrant exclusion as this could be an indicator of impaired sensation or long term deficit.&#xD;
        The presence of local pain or the presence of an impaired sensation, indicating possible&#xD;
        CNS dysfunction will also exclude subjects from this study. Subjects with pain will be&#xD;
        identified the screening form while subjects with impaired sensation, indicating CNS&#xD;
        dysfunction, will be identified by Part 2, or the physical examination of the screening&#xD;
        form. This screening form will also evaluate general muscle strength, range of motion,&#xD;
        sensation and the joint integrity. This pilot study will use a total of thirty subjects.&#xD;
        Subjects will also be screened for excessive hamstring tightness, as the position described&#xD;
        above could produce some discomfort with prolonged subject positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This investigation is intended to develop methodology and obtain pilot data regarding the&#xD;
        existence of coupled proprioception in mature healthy adults. Therefore, subjects below the&#xD;
        age of 21 are excluded, as a developing musculoskeletal and central nervous system could&#xD;
        impact the outcome of this study.&#xD;
