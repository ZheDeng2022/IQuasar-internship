      The goal of this study is to find the safest dose of Pixantrone (BBR 2778) that can be given&#xD;
      to patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). After the safest dose is found, up to an&#xD;
      additional 86 patients will be enrolled. During this part of the study, the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness will be evaluated.&#xD;

      This is an open label, single center, phase I/II study of pixantrone in patients with&#xD;
      refractory AML. Pixantrone will be administered for three consecutive days on days 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
      of each 21-day cycle, for up to two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts; phase I and phase II. In the phase I part of the study, the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) for pixantrone as a single agent in patients with refractory AML will be&#xD;
      determined. In the phase II part of the study, up to an additional 86 patients will be&#xD;
      treated at the MTD to assess disease response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with morphologically confirmed diagnosis of relapsed AML with&#xD;
             French-American-British (FAB) classification other than M3. Relapse should be&#xD;
             demonstrated by the presence of greater than 5% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow or&#xD;
             reappearance of greater than 5% leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood within 14 days&#xD;
             of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible patients include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with secondary AML, including patients with prior myelodysplastic syndromes&#xD;
             (MDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who were initially unresponsive to induction therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in first or second relapse from prior therapy or hematopoietic stem-cell&#xD;
             transplant (HSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A period of at least 21 days must have elapsed from the completion of prior&#xD;
                  chemotherapy (with or without anthracyclines) and investigational agents to the&#xD;
                  first dose of treatment in this study, and all acute toxicities from prior&#xD;
                  therapy must have resolved (with the exception of alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age &gt;/= 18 years of age, and able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institution's upper limit of normal (ULN), AST and ALT &lt; 1.5 x&#xD;
                  institution's ULN, creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  LVEF &gt;/= 50% as measured by MUGA scan or 2-D ECHO within 14 days prior to&#xD;
                  registration. Either method is acceptable for measuring LVEF; however, the same&#xD;
                  method must be used throughout treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients (male or female) of reproductive potential must commit to use adequate&#xD;
                  contraception (as defined by the investigator) during study treatment and for 6&#xD;
                  months after the last day of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have signed an approved informed consent prior to beginning&#xD;
                  protocol specific procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with a cumulative dose of doxorubicin or equivalent exceeding 450&#xD;
             mg/m2 according to the following calculation index: X/450 + Y/160 &lt; 1 where X is the&#xD;
             doxorubicin dose in mg/m2 and Y is the mitoxantrone dose in mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or documented central nervous system (CNS) involvement with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any uncontrolled active infection that requires antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute hepatitis, or known chronic hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable cardiovascular conditions, including: cardiac arrhythmias, angina, or&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy except: curatively treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer,&#xD;
             in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the&#xD;
             patient is currently in remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been&#xD;
             disease-free for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would place the patient at&#xD;
             undue risk, interfere with the results of the study, or make the patient otherwise&#xD;
             unsuitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any circumstance at the time of study entry that would preclude completion of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
