      This study will test the safety and side effects of an experimental vaccine booster against&#xD;
      HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create immunity or resistance to a disease or&#xD;
      infection. The vaccine used in this study is called VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP. It is made from an&#xD;
      adenovirus (a common virus that causes upper respiratory infections) that contains DNA&#xD;
      (genetic material) of three HIV proteins. Injected into a human, the viral DNA instructs the&#xD;
      body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP will be given to people&#xD;
      who previously received a vaccine called VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP under NIH protocol 03-I-0022.&#xD;
      Important: Study participants cannot catch an adenovirus infection or HIV or AIDS from the&#xD;
      vaccine or any proteins made from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers who participated in NIH protocol 03-I-0022 may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. They must have completed three injections of 4 mg or 8 mg of VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP&#xD;
      without experiencing a serious side effect that was possibly related to the vaccine.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, clinical evaluation, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      and HIV and pregnancy counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive one injection of VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP the day they enroll in the study&#xD;
      (study day 0). They are observed for at least 30 minutes after immunization. At home, they&#xD;
      record their temperature and any symptoms they may experience, including any effects at the&#xD;
      injection site, for 5 days and call a study nurse 1 or 2 days after the injection. They&#xD;
      immediately report any symptoms to the clinic staff and, if necessary, come to the clinic for&#xD;
      an examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have five additional clinic visits during the study, at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12 and&#xD;
      24, each lasting about 2 hours. At each visit, they are checked for health changes or&#xD;
      problems and are asked about medications they are taking. Blood is drawn for immune function&#xD;
      testing, HLA typing (a genetic test of immune system markers), and other genetic factors. A&#xD;
      urine sample is collected at some visits. Additional laboratory tests may be requested&#xD;
      between visits. Some participants may undergo apheresis at the week 4 visit to collect a&#xD;
      large number of white blood cells for laboratory tests to see how the immune system responds&#xD;
      to the study vaccine. For this procedure, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein&#xD;
      and flows through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that separates it into its&#xD;
      components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are extracted and the rest of the&#xD;
      blood is returned through another needle in the other arm. The procedure takes about 1 to 3&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are tested three or more times for HIV and are questioned about their sexual&#xD;
      behavior and drug use. They complete a &quot;social impact&quot; questionnaire at week 24 that includes&#xD;
      questions about any problems they may have experienced from their participation in the study&#xD;
      regarding such things as insurance, health care, friends, family, employment, housing,&#xD;
      education, or government agencies.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a Phase I open-label study to examine safety, tolerability and immune&#xD;
      response of a multiclade HIV adenoviral vector vaccine as a booster vaccination in uninfected&#xD;
      adults. The hypothesis is that this vaccine will be safe as a booster vaccine and elicit&#xD;
      immune responses to HIV. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      a VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP booster vaccination in uninfected subjects who previously received 3&#xD;
      injections of VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP more than one year prior to the study vaccination. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives include immunogenicity evaluations and adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)&#xD;
      antibody titers, and social impacts. Exploratory evaluations include epitope mapping and&#xD;
      other immunogenicity evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP is a recombinant product composed of 4 adenoviral&#xD;
      vectors (Ad) (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and&#xD;
      HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers who previously received three injections of&#xD;
      VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP at a dosage of 4 mg or 8 mg in the VRC 004 study (03-I-0022): subjects in&#xD;
      these groups were between 20 and 39 years old at time of enrollment in VRC 004; those who&#xD;
      participate in VRC 009 will be approximately 1-3 years older at the time of enrollment into&#xD;
      VRC 009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Up to thirty-two volunteers will receive one 1 mL injection of the study agent at&#xD;
      a dosage of 1 x 10(10) PU IM in a deltoid muscle. Safety and immunogenicity will be evaluated&#xD;
      by follow-up visits over the subsequent 24 weeks. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell&#xD;
      (PBMC) sample for immunogenicity studies collected at Week 4 after vaccination will be&#xD;
      obtained by apheresis if the subject is willing and eligible for apheresis and an apheresis&#xD;
      appointment can be conveniently scheduled in the interval specified; otherwise PBMCs will be&#xD;
      obtained from 80 mL blood collected by phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Subjects will be evaluated at 6 or more clinical visits for 24 weeks after&#xD;
      the study injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the vaccine administered at a dose of 1 x&#xD;
      10(10) particle units (PU) by intramuscular injection. Secondary endpoints are immunogenicity&#xD;
      as indicated by HIV-specific antibody and cellular immune responses through Week 6, Ad5&#xD;
      antibody titer at Week 0 and Week 4 and social impact at Week 24. Exploratory analyses of&#xD;
      immunogenicity at Weeks 12 and 24, Ad5 antibody titer at Week 24 and epitope mapping of the&#xD;
      CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses at Week 4.&#xD;
