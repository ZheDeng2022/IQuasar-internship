  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During one year, 5-8% of the population will suffer from major depression. Some of the key&#xD;
      symptoms are loss of interest in daily activities, loss of energy and sleeping disturbances.&#xD;
      The financial consequences of this disease is estimated to be more than 30 million pounds per&#xD;
      year in Great Britain and USA alone. There is an increasing interest in the effect exercise&#xD;
      has on depression. Smaller studies indicate that exercise is a good treatment for depression.&#xD;
      This study will be a large scale randomized trial and will hopefully bring important&#xD;
      knowledge on the effects exercise has on depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the effect endurance training, weight-lifting exercise and a control group&#xD;
      has on depressive symptoms after 4 months training, twice a week.&#xD;

      Background The incidence of depression is estimated to 3-5%, with a lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      17% in western societies. The incidence in patient populations affected by chronic and&#xD;
      disabling physical illnesses can be as high as 20%. Depressive symptoms as prolonged feeling&#xD;
      of sadness, low self esteem and even suicidal tendencies have consequences to not only the&#xD;
      patients' social life, but also shows a correlation between the severity of depression and&#xD;
      number of work days lost.Depression is associated with increased risk for conditions such as&#xD;
      osteoporoses, cardiovascular diseases and dementia. The global burden of disease reported by&#xD;
      WHO and others stated that unipolar depressive disorders was the fourth leading cause of&#xD;
      disease burden in terms of lost years of healthy life, and that major depression accounted&#xD;
      for 12% of all total years lived with disability in 2000. The economic burden of depression&#xD;
      on the national economy in the US was in 2000 estimated to 83,1 billion dollars (31% were&#xD;
      direct medical costs, 7% were suicide-related mortality costs and 62% were workplace costs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2001 a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing exercise with other&#xD;
      established treatments for patients diagnosed with depression concluded:&quot; The effectiveness&#xD;
      of exercise in reducing symptoms of depression cannot be determined because of a lack of good&#xD;
      quality research on clinical populations with adequate follow up&quot;. The authors found that the&#xD;
      majority of studies did not have blinded outcome assessment, nor were they based on the&#xD;
      intent-to-treat principle and most had a short follow-up. In conclusion a summary of the&#xD;
      latest reviews on the subject, states that it is likely that exercise has an effect in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with depression, but many of the conducted studies have significant&#xD;
      methodological problems, which might have a substantial effect on trial results.Despite the&#xD;
      above criticism there have been published trials suggesting that exercise has a positive&#xD;
      effect in patients diagnosed with depression. A RCT (n=156, age &gt;50, Hamilton rating scale&#xD;
      for depression (HAMD)-17mean= 18,5) from 1999 compares an aerobic exercise program, standard&#xD;
      medical treatment (SSRI) and a group receiving both. No significant difference was observed&#xD;
      between the groups after 16 weeks of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study from 2004 showed an effect of aerobic exercise on depression in light to moderately&#xD;
      depressed patients (n=82) not receiving medication. The study compared an exercise program of&#xD;
      17,5 kcal/kg/week (jogging one mile approximately equals 100 kcal) with exercise program of&#xD;
      7,5 kcal/kg/week with a control group. After 12 weeks of intervention the group receiving the&#xD;
      most strenuous (17,5 kcal/kg/week) program showed a significant reduction in symptoms&#xD;
      compared to the group only doing aerobic exercise similar to 7,5 kcal/kg/week and the control&#xD;
      group. No significant difference was observed between the low energy expenditure program and&#xD;
      the control group. A recently published study in elderly doing progressive resistance&#xD;
      training supports these findings on intensity related effect of exercise on depression.The&#xD;
      effect of exercise on endorphin, monoamine levels and neutrophin have been proposed as&#xD;
      biological mediators of exercise on depression, as well as psychosocial mechanisms such as an&#xD;
      increase of physical self-worth and distraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one previous study have compared aerobic and non-aerobic exercise forms, which&#xD;
      theoretically could be working by different biological mechanisms, such as enhanced&#xD;
      serotonergic activity due to enhanced free tryptophan levels in aerobic exercise. This study&#xD;
      gives us an opportunity to compare the aerobic with non-aerobic exercise in comparable&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies like this rarely includes measures of biological parameters. Disturbances in the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary axis with high cortisol levels and the lacking ability to suppress&#xD;
      endogen cortisol in response to dexamethasone has long been known to accompany depression.&#xD;
      Increased fitness has in experimental models shown to decrease cortisol response to&#xD;
      psychological and physical stress. Furthermore, serum prolactin has been used as an indicator&#xD;
      of central serotonergic activity which has shown an abnormal response to physical activity in&#xD;
      depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New evidence for the biological effect of exercise includes the increase of BDNF, which is&#xD;
      thought to mediate the positive effect of exercise on cognition in response to physical&#xD;
      activity in rodents. The deficits in cognitive function in depressed patients is widely&#xD;
      recognized, and cognition has previously been shown to relate to fitness levels in older&#xD;
      adults in long term physical intervention. The effect of long term physical intervention on&#xD;
      cognitive skills, have to our knowledge never been examined in clinically depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this background we argue that a randomized study based on the intent-to-treat principle,&#xD;
      including clinical populations and with a long follow-up is needed to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of exercise in patients diagnosed with light to moderate depression, regarding depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and lost days from work.&#xD;
