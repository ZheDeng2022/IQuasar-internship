    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain initial safety and efficacy data on the experimental&#xD;
      agent REN-1654 in patients with pain that radiates down the leg(s), and is typical of&#xD;
      sciatica (lumbosacral radiculopathy). These patients will usually have a herniated disc that&#xD;
      is causing compression on the nerves coming out of the spinal column.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of REN-1654 in subjects with sciatica. After screening and baseline&#xD;
      clinical assessments, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive REN 1654 100 mg or&#xD;
      matching placebo, once daily for 3 weeks. Leg pain, back pain and other efficacy measures&#xD;
      will be assessed at 1 and 3 weeks after initiation of treatment. A subset of patients will&#xD;
      undergo analysis of blood levels of REN-1654 during the course of the study&#xD;
      (pharmacokinetics). Subjects will discontinue treatment after 3 weeks and return after a&#xD;
      further 3 weeks off therapy for a final clinical assessment 6 weeks after initiation of&#xD;
      treatment. If a subject does not return for follow-up, an effort will be made by telephone to&#xD;
      document their clinical status and whether other interventions have been made.&#xD;
