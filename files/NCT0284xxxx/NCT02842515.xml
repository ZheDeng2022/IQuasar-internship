  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current endodontic treatment are based essentially on the ouster of parenchyma in case of&#xD;
      trauma or irreversible pulp inflammation. These situations typically affect immature teeth in&#xD;
      subjects aged from 8 to 15 years. Consequently, loss of a functional pulp is leads to&#xD;
      discontinuation of root development and apical closure. The challenge for the clinician in&#xD;
      the management of such situations is then preserving a pulp vitality. But current practices&#xD;
      consist in a filling of the endo-canal system with an inert or semi-inert material. In this&#xD;
      case, no pulp vitality is present. New treatment methods are needed. The objective Pulp'R is&#xD;
      the study the feasibility of preparing an autologous combined advanced therapy medicinal&#xD;
      product (ATMP) for dental pulp regeneration in the patient with irreversible pulp&#xD;
      inflammation or dental trauma.&#xD;
