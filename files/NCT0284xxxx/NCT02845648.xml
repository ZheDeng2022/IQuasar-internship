      To evaluate the effect of controlling lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with&#xD;
      anticholinergics on improving the ability to awaken (AA) in children with nonmonosymptomatic&#xD;
      enuresis and evaluate the potential implication of improved AA for treatment response&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nocturnal enuresis is associated with three main etiologies, including nocturnal polyuria&#xD;
      secondary to abnormal anti-diuretic hormone levels, low bladder capacity related to lower&#xD;
      urinary tract dysfunction, and sleep disorders causing problems in arousal. Among them, the&#xD;
      association between enuresis and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) has gained importance.&#xD;
      If these two conditions coexist, the diagnosis is nonmonosymptomatic enuresis (NME). The&#xD;
      reported prevalence of LUTS among enuretic patients ranges widely from 21% to 99%. Moreover,&#xD;
      it was reported that spontaneous resolution can be prolonged, and some cases of NME are&#xD;
      likely to become refractory if treated like monosymptomatic enuresis (ME) cases. A possible&#xD;
      explanation for this may be the presence of bladder dysfunction that is not addressed&#xD;
      properly by the standard treatment of ME. However, this explanation is only speculative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By showing a paradoxical increase in light sleep and higher cortical arousal index in&#xD;
      enuretic children with reduced bladder capacity, one of the reason for impaired ability to&#xD;
      awaken (AA) in enuretic patients may lie in the chronic stimulation of the bladder. This kind&#xD;
      of bladder dysfunction leading to an abnormal bladder-brain dialogue has been further&#xD;
      elaborated by an experiment showing brain dysfunction in the ventrolateral periaqueductal&#xD;
      gray matter as a result of the experimental reduction of the bladder capacity. If this is&#xD;
      true for enuretic children, we may be able to improve arousal (improved AA) by increasing&#xD;
      their bladder capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this hypothesis, the present study aimed to evaluate to the effects of&#xD;
      anticholinergic therapy with standard urotherapy on improvement of AA and show the effect of&#xD;
      improved AA on treatment response in children with NME.&#xD;
