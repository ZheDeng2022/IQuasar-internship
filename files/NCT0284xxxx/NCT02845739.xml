      The main goal of project is to study the distribution of HPV genotypes in the anogenital area&#xD;
      and peripheral humoral immune responses HPV (total and neutralizing Ab) before and after&#xD;
      renal transplantation. Furthermore, the investigators wish (i) establish whether there is a&#xD;
      correlation between HPV infection and HPV immune response before and after transplantation,&#xD;
      and (ii) determine whether there is a link between HPV infection and immunosuppression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant patients, iatrogenic immunosuppression established, essential to limit the&#xD;
      transplant. Kidney transplant patients, iatrogenic immunosuppression established, essential&#xD;
      to limit the transplant rejection, exposes patients to an increased risk of infections,&#xD;
      including human papillomavirus (HPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients thus constitute a population at risk of developing cancers associated with&#xD;
      HPV. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis indicated that the standardized incidence ratio for&#xD;
      cancers associated with HPV increases dramatically in kidney transplant: SIR of 2.13 (95% CI&#xD;
      1.37 to 3.30) for the cervical, RIS 22.76 (95% CI 15.8 to 32.7) for the vulva and vagina, RIS&#xD;
      15.8 (95% CI 5.79 to 34.40) for the penis, RIS 4.85 (95% CI 1.36 to 17.3) and RIS to the anus&#xD;
      of 3.23 (95% CI 2.40 to 4.35) for the oral cavity and pharynx. In fact, transplant patients&#xD;
      are subject to increased surveillance to detect the onset and / or progression of lesions&#xD;
      (pre) cancerous, especially anogenital level. Data on HPV infection in the genital area of&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients are few and concern cohorts with a modest number of subjects.&#xD;
      Indeed, it is difficult to estimate the prevalence of infection and know precisely genotypes&#xD;
      of HPV present in anogenital level. Similarly, some studies report the presence of anti-HPV&#xD;
      antibodies in transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of project is to study the distribution of HPV genotypes in the anogenital area&#xD;
      and peripheral humoral immune responses HPV (total and neutralizing Ab) before and after&#xD;
      renal transplantation. Furthermore, the investigators wish (i) establish whether there is a&#xD;
      correlation between HPV infection and HPV immune response before and after transplantation,&#xD;
      and (ii) determine whether there is a link between HPV infection and immunosuppression.&#xD;

For men, dermatologist perform penis and anal samples with same device. The sample with perform when the patient are registered to waiting list for transplant and 3 months and one year after transplantation.&#xD;
The samples are genotyped using the kit INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra test (Innogenetics) which allows the detection of 28 HPV types.</description>
