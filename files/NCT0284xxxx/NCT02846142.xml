  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will consist of three parts: the first two parts will enroll healthy female&#xD;
      volunteers into a single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAD treatment group is comprised of at least 3 cohorts where subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      to a single dose of either PTI-428 or placebo and will be followed for 7 days post dose. A&#xD;
      total of 24 subjects are anticipated to participate in this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the conclusion of the respective SAD level dose groups and after sufficient review&#xD;
      of study data and approval by the SRC, a second set of healthy adult female subjects will&#xD;
      participate in an assigned MAD treatment group. The MAD treatment group is comprised of 3&#xD;
      cohorts where subjects will be randomized to either PTI-428 or placebo and will be followed&#xD;
      for a total of 14 days. The SRC will convene after the completion of each cohort to evaluate&#xD;
      safety, PK and other relevant data. The SRC will determine whether to proceed to the next&#xD;
      planned dose level, to reduce the dose, or to stop the study. The next cohort may commence&#xD;
      only after written SRC approval. A total of 24 subjects are anticipated to participate in&#xD;
      this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the SAD and MAD, 40 female healthy volunteers will participate in two&#xD;
      treatment periods of the DDI study component: Treatment period A will consist of once daily&#xD;
      oral contraceptive (OC) for 28-days (21-day hormonal active + 7 days off).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period B will randomize subjects to PTI-428 or placebo in combination with once&#xD;
      daily OC for 28 days (21-day hormonal active and PTI-428 or placebo + 7 days off). Following&#xD;
      completion of the subjects' second treatment period, they will be followed for 7-days after&#xD;
      their last dose.&#xD;
