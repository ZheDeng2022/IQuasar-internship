  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of&#xD;
      belumosudil (formerly known as KD025) in adult subjects with chronic Graft versus Host&#xD;
      Disease (cGVHD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 48 subjects will be enrolled to receive orally administered belumosudil 200 mg&#xD;
      QD (once daily), belumosudil 200 mg BID (twice daily), or belumosudil 400 mg QD. Once a&#xD;
      recommended dose is chosen, approximately 40 additional subjects will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will be administered in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Subjects may receive study drug in the inpatient or outpatient setting.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult male and female subjects at least 18 years of age who have had allogenic bone&#xD;
             marrow transplant (BMT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving glucocorticoid therapy and calcineurin therapy or glucocorticoid therapy&#xD;
             alone for cGVHD at study entry. Subjects on calcineurin therapy only, without&#xD;
             glucocorticoid therapy, are not eligible. Subjects also receiving other therapies&#xD;
             thought not to be immunosuppressive (such as extracorporeal photopheresis; ECP), will&#xD;
             be considered for enrollment in this study on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have persistent active cGVHD manifestations, as defined by 2014 NIH Consensus&#xD;
             Development Project on Criteria for Clinical trials in cGVHD, after at least 2 months&#xD;
             of steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than 3 prior lines of treatment for cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Scale of &gt; 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ and bone marrow functions evaluated during the 14 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L (without myeloid growth factors within 1&#xD;
                  week of study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L (without transfusion or thrombopoietin or&#xD;
                  thrombopoietin analogues within 2 weeks of study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate safety laboratory values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT and AST ≤ 3 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the MDRD-4 variable&#xD;
                  formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior&#xD;
             hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However,&#xD;
             women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of&#xD;
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, anti&#xD;
             estrogens, or ovarian suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test) documented&#xD;
             within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree to&#xD;
             use two forms of accepted methods of contraception during the course of the study and&#xD;
             for 3 months after their last dose of study drug. Effective birth control includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IUD plus one barrier method;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stable doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral,&#xD;
                  injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms,&#xD;
                  diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill&#xD;
                  sperm); or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal women:&#xD;
             agreement to use two forms of contraception as in criterion 10 above during the&#xD;
             treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide written informed consent prior to the performance of any&#xD;
             study-specific procedures.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History or other evidence of severe illness or any other conditions that would make&#xD;
             the subject, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study (such as&#xD;
             poorly controlled psychiatric disease or coronary artery disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular and excessive use of alcohol within the 6 months prior to study entry defined&#xD;
             as alcohol intake &gt; 14 drinks per week in a man or &gt; 7 drinks per week in a woman.&#xD;

             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, resected in situ cervical&#xD;
             malignancy, resected breast ductal carcinoma in situ, or low-risk prostate cancer&#xD;
             after curative resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapse of the underlying cancer or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease at the&#xD;
             time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had previous exposure to belumosudil or known allergy/sensitivity to belumosudil&#xD;
             or any other ROCK-2 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking other immunosuppressant drugs for GVHD, including mTor inhibitors (Note: Only&#xD;
             steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and ECP are acceptable).&#xD;
