    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was and observational prospective, non-interventional, open-label, multi-centre study to monitor the safety profile and efficacy of JARDIANCE® (empagliflozin, 10 milligram (mg), 25mg) in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a routine clinical practice setting.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group if any of the entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>JARDIANCE®</title>
          <description>JARDIANCE® was prescribed according to the local label and at the discretion of the treating physician. The recommended dose of JARDIANCE® was 10 milligram (mg) once daily. In patients tolerating JARDIANCE® 10 mg once daily and requiring additional glycemic control, the dose could be increased to 25 mg once daily. When JARDIANCE® was used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin was considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. JARDIANCE® could be taken with or without food and tablets and was swallowed whole. If a dose was missed, it was taken as soon as the patient remembered. A double dose was not taken on the same day.</description>

            <description>JARDIANCE® was prescribed according to the local label and at the discretion of the treating physician. The recommended dose of JARDIANCE® was 10 milligram (mg) once daily. In patients tolerating JARDIANCE® 10 mg once daily and requiring additional glycemic control, the dose could be increased to 25 mg once daily. When JARDIANCE® was used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin was considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. JARDIANCE® could be taken with or without food and tablets and was swallowed whole. If a dose was missed, it was taken as soon as the patient remembered. A double dose was not taken on the same day.</description>

            <description>JARDIANCE® was prescribed according to the local label and at the discretion of the treating physician. The recommended dose of JARDIANCE® was 10 milligram (mg) once daily. In patients tolerating JARDIANCE® 10 mg once daily and requiring additional glycemic control, the dose could be increased to 25 mg once daily. When JARDIANCE® was used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin was considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. JARDIANCE® could be taken with or without food and tablets and was swallowed whole. If a dose was missed, it was taken as soon as the patient remembered. A double dose was not taken on the same day.</description>

          <title>JARDIANCE®</title>
          <description>JARDIANCE® was prescribed according to the local label and at the discretion of the treating physician. The recommended dose of JARDIANCE® was 10 milligram (mg) once daily. In patients tolerating JARDIANCE® 10 mg once daily and requiring additional glycemic control, the dose could be increased to 25 mg once daily. When JARDIANCE® was used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin was considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. JARDIANCE® could be taken with or without food and tablets and was swallowed whole. If a dose was missed, it was taken as soon as the patient remembered. A double dose was not taken on the same day.</description>
