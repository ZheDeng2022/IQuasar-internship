    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) profoundly affects the quality of life. Mucosal&#xD;
      micro-inflammation, epithelial permeability disorder and proteases activity increase have&#xD;
      been demonstrated in the patients' gastrointestinal tract. Protease activity increase could&#xD;
      be subjected to a genetic determinism (decrease in proteases inhibitors genes expression).&#xD;
      Objectives: 1/ To study relations between proteases activity (in stool and colonic biopsies&#xD;
      supernatants), proteases inhibitors genes expression and mucosal cellular infiltrate (IBS&#xD;
      patients and healthy subjects). 2/ Establishing a correlation between proteases activity,&#xD;
      mucosal micro-inflammation and symptoms. 3/ To evaluate proteases inhibitors therapeutic&#xD;
      potential. Expected results: 1/ Decreased expression of proteases inhibitors genes in&#xD;
      subjects with IBS. 2/ Correlation of symptoms with proteases activity intensity. 3/&#xD;
      Demonstration of restorative potential of proteases inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the first reason for consultation in gastroenterology and&#xD;
      his prevalence reach 5% of the general population. IBS is characterized by abdominal&#xD;
      discomfort, diarrhea or constipation and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent facts on IBS pathophysiology show association between mucosal immunity activation&#xD;
      (mast cells and their proteases) and epithelial permeability disorder. Permeability disorder&#xD;
      can be reproduced by application of colonic biopsies cultures supernatants on in-vitro cell&#xD;
      cultures. In parallel, tight junctions proteins mRNA (ZO-1, Occludin) decrease is observed&#xD;
      ex-vivo in biopsies and in-vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut bacterial proteases (cystein and serin proteases) may also play a role. In human,&#xD;
      proteases activity is correlated with IBS symptoms severity. Proteases activity increase&#xD;
      (cystein and serin proteases) is poorly understood, and this increase could be subjected to a&#xD;
      genetic determinism (decrease in proteases inhibitors genes expression - Serpin A1/E1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1/ To study relations between proteases activity (in stool and colonic biopsies&#xD;
      supernatants), proteases inhibitors genes expression and mucosal cellular infiltrate (IBS&#xD;
      patients and healthy subjects). 2/ Establishing a correlation between proteases activity,&#xD;
      mucosal micro-inflammation and symptoms. 3/ To evaluate proteases inhibitors therapeutic&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Subjects will be recruited in gastroenterology consultation. IBS patients will answer&#xD;
      to Rome III criteria. Patients coming for screening colonoscopy will be defined as healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonic biopsies will be sent in real time to the research laboratory (EA 6302) for&#xD;
      supernatants collecting, mRNA expression studies (Serpins, ZO-1, occludin, cytokines),&#xD;
      proteases activity / permeability measurements and proteases inhibitors reversibility tests.&#xD;
      Histologic study will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: 1/ Decreased expression of proteases inhibitors genes in subjects with IBS.&#xD;
      2/ Correlation of symptoms with proteases activity intensity. 3/ Demonstration of restorative&#xD;
      potential of proteases inhibitors.&#xD;
