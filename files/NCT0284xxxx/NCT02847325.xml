  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AC0058TA is a small molecule compound that potently, selectively and irreversibly inhibits&#xD;
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) phosphorylation and downstream signals, resulting in&#xD;
      inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes and inhibition of lymphocyte&#xD;
      activation (predominantly B-cell activation) in the preclinical studies. The nonclinical&#xD;
      program has demonstrated that AC0058TA has the potential to interfere with signaling&#xD;
      functions mediated by tyrosine kinases and may be useful for controlling excessive or&#xD;
      aberrant T- and B-cell activation in autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an investigational targeted therapy for RA and SLE, AC0058TA is expected to address the&#xD;
      unmet need of this patient population, for whom there are currently no effected therapies and&#xD;
      there is a great unmet medical need, AC0058TA may inhibit the key pathway which involves the&#xD;
      disease process.&#xD;

      This is a 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose-escalation (Part&#xD;
      1) and multiple-dose-escalation (Part 2) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and&#xD;
      PD of AC0058TA administered orally to healthy subjects. Part 1 of the study will also to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of AC0058TA.&#xD;
