    <textblock>
      The study goal is to establish the correlation of hemoglobin values determined by the&#xD;
      noninvasive pulse oximetry-determined hemoglobin (SpHb) system with hemoglobin as measured by&#xD;
      other validated devices. The study will also evaluation oxygen reserve index (ORI) to&#xD;
      correlate with partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and to evaluate pleth variability index&#xD;
      (PVI) with stroke volume variation (SVV) or pulse pressure variation (PPV) values.&#xD;

    <measure>Noninvasive Pulse Oximetry-determined SpHb Bias</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of study participation is up to three days.</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy of SpHb will be determined by comparing it to the hemoglobin value obtained from a reference blood sample and calculating the accuracy root mean square (Arms) error value. In order to obtain the Arms value, the blood sample hemoglobin value is subtracted from SpHb value for a number of samples, the average of this difference is computed as the bias. The standard deviation of the differences is computed as the precision. The square root of the sum of the squares of bias and precision is computed as the Arms Error value.</description>

        <description>Concordance will be determined by comparing the trending ability of the Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) measurement of the sensor with that of Partial Pressure of Oxygen in Blood (PaO2).</description>
        <time_frame>Duration of study participation is up to three days.</time_frame>
        <population>Data from 8 subjects were obtained. At least two samples per subject are required to compare ORI trending ability; however, only 1 sample was obtained from each subject which precluded conduct of any data analysis.</population>
