      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human body uses antibodies as one way to help fight infection. VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS&#xD;
      are antibodies directed against the HIV virus. Researchers want to see if they are safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated. In Part A of the study, the researchers studied VRC01LS. Part A of the study&#xD;
      was completed in 2017. In Part B, the researchers studied VRC07-523LS. Depending on which&#xD;
      antibody received, researchers studied the amount of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in the body and&#xD;
      how it changes over time. They evaluated the effect of antibodies on CD4+ (Cluster of&#xD;
      Differentiation 4) lymphocyte count and HIV viral load, and checked to see if people who get&#xD;
      VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS develop an immune response to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS are safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-70 who are HIV infected but otherwise healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received the study drug one time by IV infusion. A needle guided a thin tube&#xD;
      into a vein. The study drug mixed with salt water was dripped into the vein over about 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were monitored for 30 minutes after the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were taken at the following times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once before the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 times in the 4 hours after the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 time 24 hours after infusion. Some participants may have had 3 optional blood draws in&#xD;
           the time period between 4 and 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 3 days after the infusion, participants recorded their temperature and reactogenicity&#xD;
      symptoms in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were a total of 23 study visits over 48 weeks. Ten visits were in the first 4 weeks. At&#xD;
      all visits, participants answered health questions and gave blood samples.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, single dose study to examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and virologic&#xD;
      impact of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in HIV-infected viremic adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in HIV-infected viremic adults. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that both VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS will be safe for intravenous administration&#xD;
      to HIV-1-infected adults. The secondary hypothesis is that VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS will be&#xD;
      detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) and VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS) are human monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (MAbs) targeted to the CD4+ binding site of HIV-1. Both MAbs are modifications of&#xD;
      the VRC01 MAb (which has been shown to be safe and to have antiviral activity in human&#xD;
      studies) with the addition of the &quot;LS&quot;, a 2-amino acid mutation designed to improve the&#xD;
      half-life of the antibody. These MAbs were developed and manufactured by VRC/NIAID/NIH under&#xD;
      current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operated under&#xD;
      contract by the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.,&#xD;
      Frederick, MD. Vials were provided at 100 mg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-1-infected viremic adults; 18-70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assessed VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS administered at 40 mg/kg IV in HIV-infected&#xD;
      viremic participants. Participants enrolled in one of two parts: Part A (VRC01LS) or Part B&#xD;
      (VRC07-523LS). A total of 7 participants were enrolled in Part A and received VRC01LS and a&#xD;
      total of 9 participants were enrolled in Part B and received VRC07-523LS. Safety lab samples,&#xD;
      HIV viral load, CD4+ lymphocyte count, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples, and blood samples for&#xD;
      detection of human anti-VRC01LS antibody (Part A) and human anti-VRC07-523LS antibody (Part&#xD;
      B) were drawn at baseline and intervals throughout the study. Participants recorded in a&#xD;
      daily diary reactogenicity symptoms for 3 days after study product administration and were&#xD;
      queried at each study visit for adverse events. Participants were strongly encouraged to&#xD;
      initiate 3-drug anti-retroviral therapy (ART), prescribed by their primary HIV clinician; not&#xD;
      study-provided, any time after completing the day 14 study evaluations.&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms for 3 Days After VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS Administration</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 3 days after the study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Participants were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of participants reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.0 [November 2014].</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms for 3 Days After VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS Administration</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the occurrence of solicited symptoms on a diary card for 3 days after the study product administration and reviewed the diary card with clinic staff at a follow up visit. Participants were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom more than one time at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of participants reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading (Mild, Moderate, Severe) was done using the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.0 [November 2014].</description>

Labs included hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets, white blood cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) counts, and neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil and basophil percents and counts) and chemistry (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and creatinine). Complete blood count (CBC) and platelet results were collected at screening, Day 0 prior to study product administration (baseline), and Days 2 and 7, Weeks 2-8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36 and 48 after product administration. Creatinine, ALT, AST and ALP results were collected at screening, baseline, and Days 2 and 7, Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 after product administration. Institutional laboratory normal ranges as well as the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.0 [November 2014] were used.</description>

Unsolicited AEs were recorded from receipt of the study product through the visit scheduled 56 days (or 8 weeks) after administration. At other time periods greater than 56 days after product administration, only serious AEs and new chronic medical conditions that required ongoing medical management were recorded through the last study visit.</time_frame>
      <desc>All AEs recorded on the study were reported. Solicited AEs collected through systematic assessment and unsolicited AEs collected through non-systematic assessment are reported for participants who received study product and had safety data collected following the product administration. Data represent the number and percentage of participants experiencing the event. A participant with multiple experiences of the same event is counted once using the event of worst severity.</desc>
