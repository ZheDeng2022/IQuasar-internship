    <textblock>
      Bile acid malabsorption (BAM), a common cause of diarrhoea, affects 1 million people in the&#xD;
      UK, but is often misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome or goes unrecognised in patients&#xD;
      with inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SeHCAT (seleno-tauro-homocholic acid) test is currently the only diagnostic test for BAM,&#xD;
      but it is not widely available and it is also time consuming, expensive and involves exposure&#xD;
      to radioactivity. Some clinicians give a course of blind or empirical treatment instead. The&#xD;
      National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) recognised these issues and highlighted the&#xD;
      need for cheaper and safer tests to identify BAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the accuracy of a simple, convenient and inexpensive laboratory test&#xD;
      for the rapid diagnosis of BAM which measures bile acids in stool. This test has the&#xD;
      potential to have a broad impact on clinical practice and patient care by enabling doctors to&#xD;
      identify and treat patients with BAM promptly. Results from the second phase of the study&#xD;
      will allow the assessment of the benefits of monitoring the stool test to determine whether&#xD;
      the bile acid changes can predict the response to treatment and dosage needed for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic diarrhoea is 5% of the population, a third of these cases have bile&#xD;
      acid malabsorption (BAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SeHCAT (seleno-tauro-homocholic acid) testing is the gold standard for BAM, and involves the&#xD;
      ingestion of seleno-tauro-homocholic acid, which is limited to a small number of UK centres.&#xD;
      NICE reported that although SeHCAT might benefits patients, there was a need to explore&#xD;
      alternative technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With limited access to and cost of SeHCAT, many centres use an empirical trial of bile acid&#xD;
      sequestrants, without a diagnosis. This may not be effective as many patients are&#xD;
      non-adherent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will evaluate a cheaper and simpler laboratory test, which quantitates&#xD;
      faecal bile acids. This assay is safer, easier to use, and potentially gives a rapid&#xD;
      diagnosis in BAM. The aim is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this new assay.&#xD;
      In the longitudinal phase of this study, further evaluate of faecal bile acids following bile&#xD;
      salt sequestrant therapy, will evaluate its role in dose titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following patients will be recruited (i) post-cholecystectomy; (ii) post-terminal ileal&#xD;
      resection; or (iii) primary BAM. Patients will have SeHCAT testing and the faecal bile acid&#xD;
      concentration will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The results of faecal bile acid measurement in these patients will be compared with&#xD;
      SeHCAT to determine its sensitivity and specificity. Longitudinal follow up will determine&#xD;
      the effect of bile salt sequestration on faecal bile acids. These results would inform the&#xD;
      design of larger studies, allowing the evaluation of this new test in the NHS.&#xD;
