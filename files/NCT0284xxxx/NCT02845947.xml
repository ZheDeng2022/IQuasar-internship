    <textblock>
      This study seeks to research the effects of music therapy during pediatric extubation&#xD;
      readiness trials. Amount of sedation, physiological measures, and parent/staff satisfaction&#xD;
      surveys will be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The music therapy intervention offered during the time of the patient's extubation readiness&#xD;
      trial (ERT) will consist of live music using a multitude of instruments and patient-preferred&#xD;
      and improvised music. The start time and duration of the session will be initiated by the&#xD;
      attending physician, and the length of music therapy intervention provided will not exceed&#xD;
      two and a half hours. The music therapy intervention will continue for 30 minutes post&#xD;
      extubation. This time frame was determined in accordance with the institution's weaning trial&#xD;
      protocol. Family members involved in the trial, as well as the nurse and physician, will&#xD;
      complete a post-procedural survey about the music therapy intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The music therapy interventions will always include the use of live music, including guitar,&#xD;
      keyboard, voice, ocean drum, reverie harp, and/or various percussive instruments. The music&#xD;
      therapist will use a tablet to understand how to play patient-preferred songs. To ensure&#xD;
      patient safety, the music therapist will adhere to the infection control policies set forth&#xD;
      by the institution. The following are the intended goals of the Music therapy intervention:&#xD;
      facilitating relaxation, alleviation of anxiety, and successful utilization of new coping&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the weaning trial, the music therapist will meet with the patient's family to obtain&#xD;
      the musical preferences of the patient. During the two hour ERT, the music therapist will&#xD;
      play patient-preferred songs on a variety of different instruments to bring about a sense of&#xD;
      interpersonal connectedness, normalization, and to enhance adaptive coping. In order to&#xD;
      maximize coping and minimize stress/anxiety, the music therapy intervention will be malleable&#xD;
      and patient/family centered, responding to the changing needs that present throughout the&#xD;
      procedure/weaning process. If the patient becomes more alert throughout the weaning process,&#xD;
      the music therapist will adapt the music making based on patient's preferences; at this time,&#xD;
      the patient may be able to answer yes/no questions when asked. The music therapist will&#xD;
      adjust the volume, timbre, and tempo of the music according to the patient's respiratory&#xD;
      rhythms throughout the weaning process and after extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the live music therapy intervention has completed, the music therapist will follow up&#xD;
      with the family members immediately. The investigator will administer and collect the survey&#xD;
      from the family, and the music therapist will administer and collect the survey from the&#xD;
      nurse and physician.&#xD;
