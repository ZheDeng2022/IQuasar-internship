  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of POF, FOLFOX, and FOLFOX plus&#xD;
      paclitaxel(ip) as first-line treatment in AGC a phase II clinical trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The biweekly 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (LV5FU2) regimen associated with oxaliplatin&#xD;
      (FOLFOX) is active in patients with AGC. Meanwhile, Paclitaxel monotherapy is also active in&#xD;
      patients with AGC. In previous studies, we found that POF(A combination of oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      fluorouracil and Paclitaxel) regimen appears to be of good efficacy and is well tolerated in&#xD;
      patients with advanced gastric cancer. This study is being done to find out if three drugs&#xD;
      combination maintain manageable side effects but have better benefit than two drugs&#xD;
      combination. Intraperitoneal paclitaxel showed high local concentration in abdominal cavity&#xD;
      and low systemic toxicity. This study is being done to find out if the combination with&#xD;
      Intraperitoneal paclitaxel and FOLFOX have higher local control rate and lower systemic&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
