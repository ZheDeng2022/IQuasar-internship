  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the impact on cognitive reserve of a pharmacist-physician&#xD;
      patient-centered medication therapy management intervention to address inappropriate&#xD;
      medication use as identified by the Beers 2015 list. By bolstering cognitive reserve, this&#xD;
      project will directly address the National Alzheimer's Project Act 2015 priorities serving to&#xD;
      delay onset of symptoms in preclinical dementia. The results of this study will provide&#xD;
      valuable insights on how to expand this intervention to reduce the prevalence and associated&#xD;
      healthcare costs of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, parallel arm, study to be conducted at the University of Kentucky. The&#xD;
      study will involve assessing medication use and identifying any medicines that may be&#xD;
      inappropriate for elderly adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, participants will be asked to undergo one amyloid-PET scan to&#xD;
      detect early amyloid plaques in their brain which could increase the risk of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease in the near future. In addition, at the beginning and end of the study, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to use a scopolamine patch. This patch is not being used to prevent motion&#xD;
      sickness (as approved by the FDA), but instead is being used to challenge the participant's&#xD;
      memory and thinking abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the study includes collecting information regarding participants memory and thinking&#xD;
      abilities. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires as well as memory and&#xD;
      thinking tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study doctor will review participants medical history and then perform routine medical&#xD;
      (physical and neurological) examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the study visits will be conducted by phone to check up on the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning, middle, and end of the study, participants will meet with a doctor and&#xD;
      pharmacist to review and make any changes deemed appropriate to their current medicines. This&#xD;
      will be done in order to try and eliminate medicines that are not recommended for the&#xD;
      elderly. These visits are referred to as the Medication Therapy Management (MTM).&#xD;
