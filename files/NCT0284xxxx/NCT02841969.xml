  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More patients with diabetes mellitus have led to increasing rates of chronic non-healing&#xD;
      wounds. These wounds are colonised with pathogens, including multi-drug resistant organisms.&#xD;
      Despite repeated courses of antibiotics subsequent management is difficult due to&#xD;
      devascularisation of surrounding tissues and healing failures. Ultimately, patients may&#xD;
      require amputation. Electrolysed water is a novel antiseptic produced by passing an electric&#xD;
      current through a mixture of tap water and salt. Microbiocidal activity is due to the&#xD;
      presence of hypochlorous acid at neutral Ph. Irrigation of chronic wounds with electrolysed&#xD;
      water reduces bacterial load and appears to encourage wound healing. Following an encouraging&#xD;
      pilot study, we propose to compare electrolysed water against conventional management for&#xD;
      diabetic patients with non-healing foot ulcers. Adult diabetics with chronic ulcers attending&#xD;
      podiatry at Hairmyres Hospital will be recruited to receive regular debridement and&#xD;
      irrigation of wounds using either in-use product (Prontosan™) or electrolysed water as part&#xD;
      of a prospective randomised controlled trial. Strict enrolment criteria will be applied, with&#xD;
      regular clinical assessment and microbiological screening. Lesions present for &gt;6 weeks and&#xD;
      &gt;2cm will be photographed at trial entry and graded using standardised criteria. Wounds will&#xD;
      be monitored for at least 12 weeks (max. 20), with primary composite end-point defined as&#xD;
      complete healing; &gt;50% healing of initial lesion; and/or avoidance of surgical intervention.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are surgical intervention, including debridement or amputation;&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy; and/or patient death. The main objective is to compare rapidity of wound&#xD;
      healing using either in-use product or electrolysed water. Improved healing could potentially&#xD;
      benefit patients who might otherwise progress to amputation. We will also monitor&#xD;
      antimicrobial consumption in study patients throughout the trial. A final objective is to&#xD;
      cost the use of electrolysed water vs cost of Prontosan in the routine management of diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcers.&#xD;

      Study design: The entrance criteria specify adult diabetic patients (18-65 years) with&#xD;
      chronic (&gt;6 weeks) non-healing wounds(&gt;2cm2) identified by study clinicians and counselled by&#xD;
      aid of a Participant Information sheet (PIS). Having considered the PIS for &gt;24hrs, patients&#xD;
      who wish to participate will provide signed formal consent and will be entered into the&#xD;
      trial. Relevant demographic and clinical data will be recorded with baseline microbiology,&#xD;
      blood tests and classification of wound and pain score. Wounds will be graded according to&#xD;
      the Texas classification and photographed. Pain score at entry will be measured by modified&#xD;
      McGill questionnaire and graded from 0(no pain) to 5(severe pain). Study patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either in-use product or electrolysed water according to&#xD;
      predetermined statistical protocol and will be given a code for continued identification. The&#xD;
      patient's notes will be tagged with study and code information, with copies sent to the&#xD;
      patient's GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wound will be inspected, debrided, cleaned and irrigated twice a week using electrolysed&#xD;
      water or in-use product (Prontosan™). In-patients may receive more frequent application (e.g.&#xD;
      daily) depending upon wound status. This will be performed by ward nurses for in-patients and&#xD;
      for outpatients by podiatrists in the Diabetic clinic. Patients will be assessed by&#xD;
      podiatrists weekly (&lt;=20wks) or until an agreed end-point is reached; research assessments&#xD;
      will coincide with routine outpatient clinic attendance or in-patient review to minimise&#xD;
      patient inconvenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Release of electrolysed water will be coordinated by the research scientist. Supplies will be&#xD;
      decanted into identical containers in order to blind staff as to product identity. The&#xD;
      bottles will be labelled 'A' or 'B. Patients randomised to receive study or in-use irrigant&#xD;
      will continue with the same product, to which they were initially assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient develops an infection, then they will receive clinical review and&#xD;
      microbiological screening. These patients will continue with trial irrigants but will be&#xD;
      offered appropriate antibiotics according to laboratory data. They will be encouraged to&#xD;
      complete the trial but their data will be analysed separately on final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with underlying terminal disease will be excluded from this trial along with&#xD;
      patients with severe co-morbidities, e.g. morbidly obese; uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 97&#xD;
      mmol/mol); gangrene; chronic leg oedema/venous disease; end-stage renal disease; untreatable&#xD;
      ischaemic heart disease; HIV; etc. Patients with ongoing infection at trial entry will be&#xD;
      treated and then reassessed. Any previous documented allergy to either Prontosan™ or&#xD;
      electrolysed water will also necessitate exclusion. Any adverse effects thought to be due to&#xD;
      either irrigant will prompt study withdrawal and investigation. If there is doubt over the&#xD;
      continuation of the correctly assigned irrigant for a specific patient, then that patient's&#xD;
      data will be labelled as such and noted for the final analysis. This will also be the case&#xD;
      and/or if there are lapses of more than 4 treatment sessions during therapy. All data will be&#xD;
      retained for the final project report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary composite end-points are: complete healing; &gt;50% healing of initial lesion;&#xD;
      and/or avoidance of surgical intervention including amputation. Secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
      surgical debridement including amputation; antibiotic consumption; and patient death. Each&#xD;
      patient lesion will be photographed at the agreed end-point.&#xD;
