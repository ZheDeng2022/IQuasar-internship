  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study aims to characterise a possible pluripotent cell population in the abdomen&#xD;
      responsible for peritoneal adhesions. We therefore want to take samples from women undergoing&#xD;
      planned laparoscopic surgery with and without adhesions, isolate the cells and characterise&#xD;
      them for markers of pluripotency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal adhesions are connective tissue bands between two normally separate anatomical&#xD;
      structures within the abdominal or pelvic cavity. Those adhesions can occur after&#xD;
      gynaecological or other surgeries involving the pelvis or abdomen. Adhesions have severe&#xD;
      clinical as well as economical Consequences. There is substantial morbidity (from chronical&#xD;
      pain to obstructions and infertility) and a higher surgical risk if additional surgery is&#xD;
      needed, due to a higher intraoperative blood loss and a higher incidence of lacerations when&#xD;
      peritoneal adhesions are present. In combination with a prolonged surgery duration, the&#xD;
      economical impact is tremendous. A 2011 study estimated the cost of adhesion - related&#xD;
      surgeries to be 2,3 billion US dollar exclusively in the USA. 46.3% of those surgeries had&#xD;
      their origin or localisation in the gynaecological area. The genesis of adhesiolysis -&#xD;
      obligatory peritoneal adhesions remains unclear to this date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all surgeries cytokine induced fibrotic bands appear within 72 hours. Usually those&#xD;
      bands are eliminated by a fibrinolytic sequence within 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Adhesions that persist afterwards the generally accepted assumption is, that there is a&#xD;
      failure of the fibrinolytic sequence with unknown origin. Adhesions which persist for more&#xD;
      than 10-14 days become thicker and vascularised. In those &quot;adult&quot; adhesions not only fibrin&#xD;
      is found but also fat tissue, smooth muscles and myelinised and un - myelinised axons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developmental biology those tissues differentiate from different germ layers, namely&#xD;
      mesoderm and ectoderm. Finding cells from multiple germ layers points towards a pluri -,&#xD;
      multi-, or stem cell like precursor cell from which those adhesions develop. Such a&#xD;
      cellpopulation has not been characterised in the abdomen to the date of writing, though&#xD;
      Studies have shown evidence (ranging from mesothelial - to - mesenchymal shift to Clusters of&#xD;
      differentiation from multiple germ layers) which made multiple researchers postulate a&#xD;
      pluripotent precursor cell located in the submesothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our research we will therefore take peritoneal samples from adhesions, peritoneal wall&#xD;
      lining and omentum in subjects with and without peritoneal adhesions in subjects undergoing&#xD;
      indicated laparoscopic surgery at the gynaecological ward at the Pius hospital in Oldenburg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples are routinely taken as part of the procedure and usually discarded. At least 24&#xD;
      hours prior to surgery, the subjects will have a chance to give their informed consent to&#xD;
      donate those samples for our study. The study is thus designed in a way that subjects won't&#xD;
      undergo additional risk by participating in the study. Taking part or the refusal hereof&#xD;
      won't have any effect on the treatment or surgical outcome for the subjects. Also, taking&#xD;
      part in our study won't have any benefits or additional risks for the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will then be taken to the university of Leipzig, where we will culture, isolate&#xD;
      and characterise the cells. Characterisation will mostly be the application of pluripotency&#xD;
      markers, cell sorting and immunoassays. Expression profiles will be used to further&#xD;
      understand the mesothelial - to - mesenchymal shift. Depending on our findings the protocol&#xD;
      for analysis will be adjusted in consultation with Prof. dr. dr. De Wilde and Prof. dr.&#xD;
      Bader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will approximately take 6 months, with an additional 6 months for writing and&#xD;
      publication. The study is funded by the research funding pool of the university of Oldenburg.&#xD;
