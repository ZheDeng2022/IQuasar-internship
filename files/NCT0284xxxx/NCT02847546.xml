      The primary objective of this study is to collect data to confirm the performance and safety&#xD;
      of the True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter during dilatation of the aortic valve in&#xD;
      the preparation for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).&#xD;

      The BARD® True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter Study is a prospective, single-center,&#xD;
      non-randomized, single-arm observational study intended to collect data to confirm the&#xD;
      performance and safety of the BARD® True™ Flow Valvuloplasty Perfusion Catheter (True™ Flow&#xD;
      catheter) when used for dilatation of the aortic valve in preparation for Transcatheter&#xD;
      Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). This study will be conducted in conformance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, applicable national privacy laws, and European, national regulations&#xD;
      and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) requirements (ISO 14155:2011 (E)).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject voluntarily provides written informed consent prior to the collection of&#xD;
             study-specific data or performance of study-specific procedures using an Informed&#xD;
             Consent Form (ICF) that is reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee (EC) for the&#xD;
             site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a male or non-pregnant female ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is undergoing TAVI for treatment of aortic stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has an annulus diameter that can be treated with the available size&#xD;
             device, in accordance with the Instructions For Use (IFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a known allergy or sensitivity to contrast media that cannot be&#xD;
             adequately pre-medicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had previous aortic valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a known congenital aortic valve abnormality (e.g., bicuspid aortic&#xD;
             valve).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, or thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has vascular conditions that make insertion and endovascular access to the&#xD;
             aortic valve impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may cause him/her to confound the data interpretation, or is associated with a life&#xD;
             expectancy insufficient to allow for the completion of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug, biologic, or&#xD;
             another device study that has not completed the study treatment or that clinically&#xD;
             interferes with the objectives of the study.&#xD;
