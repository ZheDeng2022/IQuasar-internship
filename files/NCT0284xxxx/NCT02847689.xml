  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether playing recordings of a mother's voice to her&#xD;
      infant while in the hospital nursery is an effective treatment for promoting healthy brain&#xD;
      and language development in infants born preterm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children born preterm are at-risk for developmental language delays. Language problems in&#xD;
      preterm children are thought to be related to neurobiological factors, including injuries to&#xD;
      white matter structures of the brain and environmental factors, including decreased exposure&#xD;
      to maternal speech in the hospital nursery. There is evidence to suggest that maternal speech&#xD;
      input may be important for promoting healthy brain and language development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. Each infant has a 50%&#xD;
      chance of being assigned to the group that will listen to a recording of his/her mother's&#xD;
      voice and a 50% chance of being assigned to the group that will not be played a voice&#xD;
      recording. Mother's of participating infants will have her voice recorded as she reads a&#xD;
      common children's storybook. Recordings will be played to infants each day until s/he is&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. Participation in this study requires that all infants receive&#xD;
      up to an additional 10 minutes of brain scans as part of his/her routine clinical magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
