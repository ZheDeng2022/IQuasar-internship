      This is a sub-study of the ARTESiA study registered as NCT01938248. This study is designed to&#xD;
      validate biomarkers in subclinical atrial fibrillation and to determine if the prospective&#xD;
      biomarker will be informative of the potential efficacy of treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder worldwide, and is gaining&#xD;
      in prevalence. Currently, the treatment for atrial fibrillation is concentrated on patients&#xD;
      with existing atrial fibrillation, and the reduction in risks of complications of stroke with&#xD;
      anticoagulation. Furthermore, mechanical interventions such as atrial ablation procedures are&#xD;
      fraught with inconsistent results. The availability of serum based biomarkers that can&#xD;
      predict the early onset of atrial fibrillation, and also the ability to prognosticate risk,&#xD;
      may help in the identification of patients at risk for AF complications early. This would&#xD;
      also allow the identification of the patient population most suitable for the evaluation of&#xD;
      possible future intervention strategies to prevent the onset of atrial fibrillation, and&#xD;
      alter its natural history and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the best biomarkers in predicting atrial fibrillation risk are in fact markers for&#xD;
      heart failure - NTproBNP and high sensitivity troponin. These markers are independent from&#xD;
      CHA2DS2-VASc score. While this is very helpful, these markers will not be able to distinguish&#xD;
      these 2 conditions because heart failure and atrial fibrillation often co-exist. The&#xD;
      investigator's Cardiovascular Biomarker Discovery and Translation team has been using deep&#xD;
      proteomic analysis of both human tissues and reprogrammed human stem cells to identify novel&#xD;
      candidate biomarkers. This has been very successfully applied to diastolic heart failure, and&#xD;
      there are now several new markers for this condition that have been validated across 3&#xD;
      populations. The investigators have several potential candidates for atrial fibrillation, but&#xD;
      validation in the appropriate cohort, particularly those at the earliest risks of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, will be most important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ARTESiA study is an ideal study setting to perform the biomarker validation, as the&#xD;
      parent trial will recruit patients with silent atrial fibrillation detected only by&#xD;
      dual-chamber pacemakers, defibrillators or insertable cardiac monitors. This would constitute&#xD;
      a potentially earlier stage atrial fibrillation patient cohort, with known subsequent risks&#xD;
      in a prospective fashion. The prospective evaluation of approved medications of aspirin and&#xD;
      apixaban will also be helpful to determine if the prospective biomarker will be informative&#xD;
      of the potential efficacy of treatment, or be unchanged by the treatment modalities.&#xD;

             episode &gt; 24 hours in duration at any time prior to enrollment. Any atrial high rate&#xD;
             episode with average &gt; 175 beats/min will be considered as SCAF. No distinction will&#xD;
             be made between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. SCAF requires electrogram&#xD;
             confirmation (at least one episode) unless ≥ 6 hours in duration&#xD;
