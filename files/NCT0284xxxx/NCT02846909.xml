  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy loss in the second trimester is not uncommon. About 2-3% of pregnancies will be&#xD;
      lost in the second trimester, which is much lower than in the first trimester. Once a&#xD;
      pregnancy reaches 20 weeks gestation, less than 0.5% will end in a fetal demise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital fetal abnormalities and maternal anatomic factors as immunologic factors,&#xD;
      infection, and thrombophilia should be considered; however, a reason and its result&#xD;
      connection may be difficult to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical incompetence means that the cervix is weak and unable to remain closed during the&#xD;
      pregnancy. While cerclage may provide a degree of support to a 'weak' cervix, its role in&#xD;
      maintaining the cervical length and the endocervical mucus plug as a mechanical barrier to&#xD;
      ascending infection may be more important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical cerclage is performed usually in women with a history of mid-trimester abortion or&#xD;
      spontaneous preterm birth due to cervical 'incompetence', with the aim of preventing&#xD;
      recurrent loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerclage is a commonly performed as a prophylactic intervention used by most obstetricians&#xD;
      despite the absence of a well-defined population for whom there is clear evidence of benefit.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is little consensus on the optimal cerclage technique and timing and type&#xD;
      of suture placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Progesterone is known to have an inhibitory action on uterine contractility and is&#xD;
      thought to play a main role in the maintenance of pregnancy until term. Progesterone is also&#xD;
      able to modify the ultrastructural organisation of the myometrium by inhibiting the gap&#xD;
      junctions, and preventing muscular contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different routes of administration of progesterone have been described in the literature.&#xD;
      These include weekly intramuscular injections from 16 to 20 weeks through to 36 weeks and&#xD;
      daily vaginal progesterone suppositories from 24 weeks to 34 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently published Cochrane review further confirmed the beneficial effects of progesterone&#xD;
      in infant health following administration in women considered to be at increased risk of&#xD;
      preterm birth due either to past history of preterm birth or when a short cervix was&#xD;
      identified on ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However; most of these published studies have been conducted to test the effect of&#xD;
      progestational agents for the prevention of preterm labor not miscarriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasonography is use to evaluate blood flow. In the field of perinatology, Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography has been used to assess fetal well-being, especially in intra-uterine growth&#xD;
      retardation and fetal anemia, and it plays an important role in managing of these conditions&#xD;
