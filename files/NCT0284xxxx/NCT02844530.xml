  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized phase 2 study evaluating 90Y-epratuzumab tetraxetan&#xD;
      for relapsed/refractory CD22+ B-ALL adult patients using the recommended activity of 370&#xD;
      MBq/m² x 2. in order to confirm the investigators' previous results. The cut-off of 70% for&#xD;
      the expression of CD22 has been chosen in order to propose this protocol to all adults with&#xD;
      CD22+ B ALL in relapse or with refractory disease. Indeed, median expression of CD22 is&#xD;
      almost 100% in this setting but some patients are documented between 70 and 100%. RIT will be&#xD;
      assessed in comparison with standard of care salvage chemotherapy regimens. Only three&#xD;
      standard salvage chemotherapy regimens will be permitted in order to avoid too much bias for&#xD;
      the comparative analysis of clinical efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental treatment will consist on 2 injections of 370 MBq/m2 of 90Y-epratuzumab&#xD;
      tetraxetan fractionated RIT at day 1 and day 8. The first infusion of 90Y-epratuzumab&#xD;
      tetraxetan will be co-injected for the six first patients in Nantes with 111In-epratuzumab&#xD;
      tetraxetan for dosimetry purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to receive standard of care salvage chemotherapy/ immunotherapy regimen&#xD;
      will be assigned per investigator's choice to one of the following chemotherapy/&#xD;
      immunotherapy regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FLAG +- anthracycline based regimen (such as Idarubicin 10 mg/m2 days 1, 3; fludarabine&#xD;
           30 mg/m2 days 1-5, cytarabine 2 g/m2 days 1-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For subject's &gt;60 years : idarubicin 5 mg/m2 day 1,3, fludarabine 20 mg/m2 days 1-5,&#xD;
           cytarabine 1 g/m2 days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clofarabine or clofarabine based regimens. Clofarabine use as a single agent should&#xD;
           follow the recommended prescribing information. Clofarabine combination based regimens&#xD;
           should use &gt;=20mg/m2/day for up to 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hyper-C-VAd regimen: hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 intravenously(i.v.)&#xD;
           every 12 hours for 6 doses Days 1 to 3 + vincristine 2 mg i.v.Days 4 and 11; doxorubicin&#xD;
           50 mg/m2 i.v. over 24 hours via central venous catheter Day 4; and dexa-methasone 40 mg&#xD;
           daily Days 1 to 4 and 11 to 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blinatumomab (Blincyto®) is administered as a 28-day continuous infusion (9µg/d for days&#xD;
           1-7; 28µg/d thereafter, followed by 2 weeks of rest for up to 2 cycles. Patients should&#xD;
           be hospitalized the first 9 days during the first cycle and at least the first 2 days&#xD;
           during the second cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second RIT cycle (consolidation) will be allowed in the experimental group in case of&#xD;
      response (CR or CRp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an ethical point of view, it will be also permitted to propose the RIT experimental&#xD;
      treatment in the control group in case of treatment failure or relapse during the 6 months&#xD;
      following inclusion. Follow-up will be also 12 months from the RIT for these patients.&#xD;
