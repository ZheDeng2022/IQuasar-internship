      A risk stratification in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE)&#xD;
      is deemed necessary to guide patient management. With the aim to improve the positive&#xD;
      predictive value (PPV) for PE-related adverse events in in normotensive patients, a number of&#xD;
      scores combining multiple risk-factors have been published. In addition, an algorithm for the&#xD;
      risk-stratification of patients with PE has been proposed by the European society of&#xD;
      cardiology. None but one of these scores underwent external and prospective validation. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to externally and prospectively validate the PPV for PE-related adverse&#xD;
      events of the Bova score and modified FAST score in a large multicenter cohort.&#xD;

      A risk stratification in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE)&#xD;
      is deemed necessary to guide patient management. Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD),&#xD;
      identified by echocardiography or computed tomographic angiography (CT), and cardiac&#xD;
      biomarkers are well recognized risk factors for adverse events in normotensive patients with&#xD;
      PE. However, neither of them, as a single prognostic criterion, have a sufficient positive&#xD;
      predictive value (PPV) for PE-related adverse events to guide therapeutic decisions. The&#xD;
      PEITHO trial showed that, in normotensive patients with RVD and abnormal cardiac troponin,&#xD;
      death or hemodynamic decompensation occurred significantly less in those treated with&#xD;
      tenecteplase plus heparin than in those who received heparin plus placebo. However the risk&#xD;
      of major hemorrhage and stroke was significantly increased in the tecneplase group. These&#xD;
      results were obtained in a group of patients with an absolute rate of PE-related adverse&#xD;
      events of about 6%. If the same relative reduction in the risk of PE-related outcomes&#xD;
      observed in the PEITHO trial could be achieved in a group of patients with a higher absolute&#xD;
      risk of PE-related events, this might change the risk to benefit ratio of primary reperfusion&#xD;
      therapy in PE. With the aim to improve the PPV for PE-related adverse events in in&#xD;
      normotensive patients, a number of scores combining multiple risk-factors have been&#xD;
      published. In addition, an algorithm for the risk-stratification of patients with PE has been&#xD;
      proposed by the European society of cardiology. None but one of these scores underwent&#xD;
      external and prospective validation. Aim of the study The aim of this study is to externally&#xD;
      and prospectively validate the PPV for PE-related adverse events of the Bova score, modified&#xD;
      FAST score and ESC algorithm in a large multicenter cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This will be a multicenter, prospective, observational study. Consecutive patients&#xD;
      aged 18 years or older with PE and hemodynamic stability (that is, SBP 90 mm Hg or more) will&#xD;
      be evaluated as a part of usual clinical practice. This study does not dictate diagnostic&#xD;
      interventions nor affects clinical or therapeutic decisions of the participant centers. For&#xD;
      each patient, anonymous information will be collected on simplified Pulmonary Embolism&#xD;
      Severity Index (sPESI), RVD on echocardiography and CT, Troponin I, levels of lactates in the&#xD;
      arterial blood, and presence of syncope at presentation. RVD will be diagnosed with the&#xD;
      echocardiography in the presence of one of the following: Right ventricular end-diastolic&#xD;
      diameter (RVEDD) &gt; 30 mm (parasternal long-axis or short-axis view), Right/left ventricular&#xD;
      end-diastolic diameter (RVEDD/LVEDD) &gt;0.9 (apical or subcostal 4-chamber view), Right&#xD;
      ventricular free wall hypokinesis from any view, Tricuspid systolic velocity &gt; 2.6 m/s from&#xD;
      the apical or subcostal 4-CH view, parasternal short-axis view. RVD diagnosis with the CT&#xD;
      will require a RV/LV diameter ratio greater than 1.0 on axial CT images. Cardiac troponin&#xD;
      test will be considered positive in case of levels of troponin higher than higher than the&#xD;
      cut-off of the manufacturer. Plasma lactate will be assessed in arterial blood samples.&#xD;
      Values â‰¥ 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) will be considered abnormal. This evaluation should be ideally&#xD;
      completed within 6 hours from the hospital admission. The primary outcome of the study will&#xD;
      be adverse events PE-related within 30 days from the hospital admission. In a sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis we will explore the same outcome at 7 days. PE-relate adverse events will be defined&#xD;
      as: PE-related death or haemodynamic collapse. PE will be considered the cause of death if&#xD;
      there will be objective documentation or in case of unexplained death and PE not confidently&#xD;
      ruled out. Haemodynamic collapse will be defined as one of the following conditions: SBP &lt; 90&#xD;
      mmHg necessitating catecholamine administration; mechanical ventilation; cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of interest will be all-cause mortality at 30 days; PE-related death at 30&#xD;
      days; confirmed symptomatic PE recurrence; duration of hospitalization in patients with low&#xD;
      and intermediate-low risk compared with patients with intermediate-high risk. Recurrent PE&#xD;
      will be confirmed either by the presence of a new intraluminal filling defect, or by a new&#xD;
      perfusion scan defect involving &gt; 75% of a lung segment. PE-related adverse events, recurrent&#xD;
      PE and all-cause mortality should be evaluated, for each participant center, by a physician&#xD;
      not involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The three-level of Bova score will be dichotomized (low- and&#xD;
      intermediate-low-risk versus intermediate-high-risk). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)&#xD;
      curve analysis will be performed to determine the area under the curve (AUC) of the scores&#xD;
      (absolute points) with regard to study outcomes. Prognostic performance of the scores will be&#xD;
      evaluated by calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and&#xD;
      negative predictive value (NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Based on previous studies a sample size of about 500 patients should be adequate&#xD;
      for the purpose of the study. After the first 300 patients an interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to more precisely establish the number of patients needed.&#xD;
