  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without atezolizumab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with non-HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread from its original site&#xD;
      of growth to nearby tissues or lymph nodes and is not amenable to surgical resection (locally&#xD;
      advanced unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Olaparib is an&#xD;
      inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes&#xD;
      damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing&#xD;
      them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not known whether giving&#xD;
      olaparib with or without atezolizumab will work better in patients with non-HER2-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) between two study arms, i.e., olaparib&#xD;
      monotherapy (arm 1) and olaparib + atezolizumab in combination (arm 2) based on normal&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic non-HER2-positive breast cancer harboring homologous deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) repair (HDR) through BRCA 1/2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) between the two study arms based on immune&#xD;
      response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the time to treatment failure (TTF) between the two study arms based on immune&#xD;
      response criteria and normal RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the overall response rate (ORR) between the two study arms based on immune&#xD;
      response criteria and normal RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the duration of response (DoR) between the two study arms based on immune&#xD;
      response criteria and normal RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the changes in extent of mutational burden in BRCA 1/2 mutated tumors at&#xD;
      baseline and at progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Evaluate and characterize changes in the extent of PD-L1 expression and tumor immune&#xD;
      infiltrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Retrospectively evaluate tumors with limited immune infiltrate (e.g. &quot;non-inflamed&quot;) to&#xD;
      determine if PARPi increased immune infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Determine the immune-related best overall response (irBOR) of olaparib in combination&#xD;
      with atezolizumab in locally advanced or metastatic non-HER2+ breast cancer harboring HDR&#xD;
      through BRCA 1/2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate changes in candidate neoantigen profiles and immune/inflammation signatures using&#xD;
      DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing in serial tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate and characterize circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and immune parameters in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Test the hypothesis that DNA repair status affects the tumor-immune interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Characterize mechanism of action of the PARP inhibitor olaparib. V. To explore the&#xD;
      inclusion of patient reported symptomatic adverse events. VI. To use anti-Kynurenine&#xD;
      antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well as unbiased metabolome studies on plasma to&#xD;
      understand the metabolic consequences of PARP-inhibition and their effects on immune&#xD;
      infiltrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore pharmacodynamic transcriptional changes induced by treatment in different&#xD;
      immune cell populations and with high resolution in single cell RNA sequencing of peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with&#xD;
      disease progression may cross-over to Arm II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib as Arm I and atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly.&#xD;
