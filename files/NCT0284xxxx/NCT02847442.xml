  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in subject's condition according to the&#xD;
      Investigator's Global Assessment of Change after three months of treatment with 50 mg&#xD;
      opicapone once daily in a heterogeneous patient population reflecting daily clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, single-group, multi-centre trial in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with wearing-off motor fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening/baseline (Visit 1, Day 1) all subjects will start treatment with 50 mg opicapone&#xD;
      (OPC) once daily for a 3-month period in addition to their current treatment with&#xD;
      levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (L-dopa/DDCI). Subjects treated with&#xD;
      L-dopa/DDCI/entacapone before trial entry will discontinue entacapone treatment at this&#xD;
      visit. Subjects treated with L-dopa/DDCI/tolcapone before trial entry will not be eligible,&#xD;
      as well as those previously treated with OPC. Subjects treated with dopamine agonists will be&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPC enhances the effects of L-dopa. Hence, it may be necessary to reduce the subject's&#xD;
      L-dopa/DDCI dose within the first days or weeks of OPC treatment by extending the dosing&#xD;
      intervals and/or reducing the amount of L-dopa/DDCI per dose. Therefore, on Day 15 ±3 (Visit&#xD;
      2) the investigator will call the subject to ask for adverse events (AE, e.g. dopaminergic&#xD;
      AEs) and if required, to reduce the L-dopa/DDCI dose. The investigator may increase or&#xD;
      decrease the total daily L-dopa/DDCI dose according to the subject's condition throughout the&#xD;
      trial, except at Visit 1. At the Visit 1 the L-dopa dose should not be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further visits will be performed on Day 30 ±4 (Visit 3) and on Day 90 ±4 (Visit 4). Subjects&#xD;
      who discontinue trial participation prematurely will be asked to come to the site for an&#xD;
      early discontinuation visit (EDV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the scheduled visits, subjects may be asked to call or to return to the trial&#xD;
      site, or subjects may be called by the investigator for assessment of safety data or&#xD;
      adjustment of L-dopa/DDCI dose (unscheduled visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4 (or EDV, if applicable) the investigator will arrange for the subject's subsequent&#xD;
      PD treatment, i.e. either prescribe further OPC or switch to another treatment.&#xD;
