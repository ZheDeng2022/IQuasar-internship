  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improvements in cancer treatment have led to an increasing number of patients being cured or&#xD;
      in remission, but they are followed up to detect recurrence, manage persistent symptoms and&#xD;
      late treatment effects. With growing survivors, traditional hospital follow-up is not&#xD;
      sustainable. New models of follow-up care are needed. This research project aims to develop&#xD;
      and establish the feasibility of introducing a new electronic care pathway/system for remote&#xD;
      monitoring ovarian cancer patients in remission. The project includes a development phase,&#xD;
      followed by an audit &amp; pilot intervention phase to explore the feasibility of a new&#xD;
      pathway/system for remote monitoring.&#xD;

      Background Improvements in cancer treatment have led to an increasing number of patients&#xD;
      being cured or in remission, but they are followed up to detect recurrence, manage persistent&#xD;
      symptoms and late treatment effects. With growing survivors, traditional hospital follow-up&#xD;
      is not sustainable. New models of follow-up care are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To develop and establish the feasibility of introducing a new electronic care&#xD;
      pathway/system for remote monitoring ovarian cancer patients in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods An existing online patient symptom reporting system will be extended for use in&#xD;
      remote follow-up. A tracking program will be developed and IT systems integrated in the local&#xD;
      hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Scoping literature review of existing validated symptom measures. b) Consultation with&#xD;
      expert groups to establish choice of questions, relevant symptoms, timing/frequency for&#xD;
      monitoring. c) Interviews with patients and clinicians to explore current pathway and&#xD;
      redesign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit of usual care phase In this phase consecutive eligible ovarian, fallopian tube, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, endometrial or female genital (not otherwise specified) cancer patients (on&#xD;
      completion of their first/second line of treatment) will be approached and data on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes collected at the routine 3 monthly outpatient appointments for 12 months and PROMs&#xD;
      collected 6 monthly. We aim to recruit around 60 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Intervention phase In the intervention group the feasibility of the re-designed care&#xD;
      pathway (intervention) will be piloted in a separate group of eligible ovarian, fallopian&#xD;
      tube, primary peritoneal, endometrial or female genital (not otherwise specified) cancer&#xD;
      patients. The patients approached will be a mixture of those who are entering follow-up after&#xD;
      recently completing their first/second line treatment, and those who have already been&#xD;
      attending for some time (months/years) for routine follow-up after their first/second line&#xD;
      treatment. We aim to recruit around 60 patients. Consenting patients will be reminded to use&#xD;
      the online system every 3 months and have a mandatory blood test by their GP/local hospital.&#xD;
      Information will be available for the clinical teams to access electronically. Patients will&#xD;
      always have the option to choose to speak or see their 'key clinician'. Virtual clinics will&#xD;
      be held for key clinicians to review and respond to remote monitoring data. Clinical and&#xD;
      patient outcomes will be collected for a 6-12 month period (this timeframe is dependent on&#xD;
      the date of study entry and the funding period remaining). Following the pilot intervention&#xD;
      period, 10 patients (or more if deemed necessary) and 6 clinicians will also be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a new electronic care pathway/system for remote monitoring patients in remission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain initial data on clinical and patient feasibility.&#xD;

    <description>In the pilot-phase, a group of 59 patients will be recruited and followed over a 6-12 month period. Patients in this group will be assigned to the new remote monitoring follow-up pathway (ePRIME), whereby instead of attending routine outpatient appointments they are monitored remoted via a online symptom monitoring questionnaire and related clinical tests undertaken remotely. All information is collated in the patient's electronic patient record, and clinicians will review/respond to the data as necessary.</description>

    <intervention_name>ePRIME</intervention_name>
    <description>ePRIME is an remote monitoring pathway that includes an online system for patients to self-report symptoms and AE following cancer treatments. ePRIME allows AE reporting from home and enables patient reported data to be integrated into existing EPR to allow for the reports to be used in routine care. In addition the system is capable of generating alerts for serious symptoms to the relevant clinical team and providing patient advice on managing mild and moderate symptoms.</description>
