      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that studying monogenic variants with strong&#xD;
      effect associated with severe insulin deficiency of Wolfram syndrome will provide important&#xD;
      insights into the more complex type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Establish and maintain a registry of patients with Wolfram syndrome. An Internet based&#xD;
      registry will be employed to enroll participants with the clinical diagnosis of Wolfram&#xD;
      syndrome (insulin dependent DM and bilateral OA). Clinical information regarding age of&#xD;
      diagnosis and progression of the disease will be collated and analyzed to better define its&#xD;
      natural history, along with potential metabolic phenotypes such as glucose intolerance of&#xD;
      heterozygous parents and unaffected sibs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If not already completed, blood for WFS1 sequence analysis will be obtained on the&#xD;
      participants (parents and sibs also for control purposes) and sent to a CLIA certified lab to&#xD;
      define the mutation. This information will benefit patient families and referring physicians&#xD;
      by providing a genetic diagnosis and where indicated. The Wolfram Syndrome Registry will&#xD;
      foster international collaborations to more efficiently and systematically collect Wolfram&#xD;
      syndrome patients and their clinical and experimental data.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common Manifestations and Natural History Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder&#xD;
      characterized by juvenile onset diabetes, optic nerve atrophy, and neurodegeneration. The&#xD;
      common manifestations of Wolfram syndrome include: diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy,&#xD;
      central diabetes insipidus, sensorineural deafness, neurogenic bladder, and progressive&#xD;
      neurologic difficulties. Diabetes mellitus is typically the first manifestation, usually&#xD;
      diagnosed around age 6. Optic nerve atrophy, marked by loss of color vision and peripheral&#xD;
      vision, follows around age 11. Central diabetes insipidus is another common manifestation,&#xD;
      affecting approximately 70 percent of Wolfram. Around 65 percent of patients develop&#xD;
      sensorineural deafness that can range in severity from deafness beginning at birth to mild&#xD;
      hearing loss beginning in adolescence that worsens over time. Urinary tract problems are&#xD;
      another major clinical challenge for Wolfram syndrome patients affecting 60 to 90 percent of&#xD;
      this population. These problems include obstruction of the ducts between the kidneys and&#xD;
      bladder, high-capacity atonal bladder, disrupted urination, bladder sphincter dyssynergia,&#xD;
      and difficulty controlling urine flow. About 60 percent of patients with Wolfram syndrome&#xD;
      develop neurological manifestations, most commonly presenting as problems with balance and&#xD;
      coordination (ataxia) beginning in early adulthood. Brain stem atrophy is also a prominent&#xD;
      feature that often results in death secondary to central apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification According to the draft International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11),&#xD;
      Wolfram Syndrome is categorized as rare specified diabetes mellitus (subcategory 5A16.1,&#xD;
      Wolfram Syndrome). There are no classifications or staging systems employed after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology It has now been established that Wolfram syndrome is a prototype of endoplasmic&#xD;
      reticulum (ER) disease. The ER is a membrane network within our cells that is involved in&#xD;
      protein synthesis, calcium storage, redox regulation, steroid synthesis, cell signaling, and&#xD;
      cell death. Given the many vital and complex functions of the ER, there is little wonder that&#xD;
      its failure can trigger a range of diseases. Previous studies have shown that pancreatic beta&#xD;
      cells and neurons are particularly sensitive to ER dysfunction, likely due to their high&#xD;
      rates of protein synthesis. In Wolfram syndrome, pancreatic beta cells and neuronal cells are&#xD;
      selectively destroyed as a consequence of mutations in the WFS1 gene. This gene encodes a&#xD;
      transmembrane protein localized to the ER and ER dysfunction is a major pathogenic component&#xD;
      of Wolfram syndrome. In Wolfram syndrome, WFS1 mutations lead to elevated ER stress levels,&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, and the initiation of ER stress-associated cell death. A&#xD;
      small portion of patients has mutations in the WFS2 (CISD2) gene. WFS2 also encodes a&#xD;
      transmembrane protein localized to the ER. In patients with WFS2 mutations, diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      and hearing impairment are reported. Their clinical phenotype differs from patients carrying&#xD;
      WFS1 mutations for the absence of diabetes insipidus and for the presence of upper intestinal&#xD;
      ulcers and defective platelet aggregation, suggesting that there are different and&#xD;
      overlapping functions of WFS1 and WFS2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Wolfram syndrome is a neurodegenerative disorder mediated by ER stress, and&#xD;
      characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy, and motor, sensory&#xD;
      and autonomic nervous system disruption. The progressive loss of neuronal function is due to&#xD;
      the neuronal cell death. The prognosis of this syndrome is poor as most patients die&#xD;
      prematurely with severe neurological disabilities such as bulbar dysfunction and organic&#xD;
      brain syndrome, with the median age at death being 30 years (range, 25-49 years), usually&#xD;
      from respiratory failure as a result of brain stem atrophy. Imaging and post mortem studies&#xD;
      have shown diffuse neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The only available treatments&#xD;
      ameliorate the symptoms of the individual components of the disease, but do not target the&#xD;
      underlying cause and are therefore unable to prevent progression of the condition, hence both&#xD;
      its debilitating and fatal outcome. There are no effective treatments for Wolfram Syndrome,&#xD;
      either in terms of authorized medicinal products in this indication or in terms of commonly&#xD;
      used treatments not subject to marketing authorization. The use of careful clinical&#xD;
      monitoring and supportive care do not treat the condition itself and act only to lessen the&#xD;
      debilitating consequences. Further, although agents are approved for the individual&#xD;
      components of Wolfram Syndrome, none of these therapies are able to prevent the continued&#xD;
      deterioration in the patient's conditions as they do not address the underlying cause. Thus,&#xD;
      there is an urgent need to understand the cause of the disease, identify biomarkers, and&#xD;
      develop treatments targeting the underlying cause to stop its progression. To fulfill these&#xD;
      unmet medical needs, we will maintain a registry of patients with Wolfram syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Maintain a registry of patients with Wolfram syndrome. An Internet-based registry will&#xD;
      be employed to enroll patients with Wolfram syndrome based on the following diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes mellitus &lt;16 yrs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optic atrophy &lt;16 yrs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes insipidus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes mellitus &gt;16yrs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optic atrophy &gt;16 yrs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensorineural deafness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological signs (ataxia, epilepsy, cognitive impairment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal tract abnormalities (structural or functional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 loss of function mutation in WFS1/CISD2 AND/OR family history of Wolfram syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum Required&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 major OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 major plus 2 minor criteria OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 pathological WFS1 or CISD2 mutations are identified&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other variable suggestive evidence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypogonadism (males)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of type 1 diabetes auto-antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bilateral cataracts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information regarding age of diagnosis and progression of the disease will be&#xD;
      collated and analyzed to better define its natural history, along with potential metabolic&#xD;
      phenotypes such as glucose intolerance of heterozygous parents and unaffected sibs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If not already completed, blood for WFS1 sequence analysis will be obtained on the patient&#xD;
      (parents and sibs also for control purposes) and sent to a CLIA certified lab to define the&#xD;
      mutation. This information will benefit patient families and referring physicians by&#xD;
      providing a genetic diagnosis and where indicated. The Wolfram Syndrome Registry will foster&#xD;
      international collaborations to more efficiently and systematically collect Wolfram syndrome&#xD;
      patients and their clinical and experimental data. We will continue to enroll patients and&#xD;
      analyze their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry participants may also be eligible to enroll in the Wolfram Syndrome Research Clinic&#xD;
      study at Washington University and other studies (TRACK IRB# 201104010). If they are&#xD;
      eligible, a study coordinator for the research clinic will contact them to explain the study&#xD;
      and to see if they are interested. Their contact information will not be released to the&#xD;
      research clinic Principal Investigator unless you have given permission. Their parents and&#xD;
      unaffected sibs may also be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry participants may also be eligible to enroll in the Wolfram Dantrolene Safety Trial&#xD;
      (IRB #201607006) and other upcoming clinical trials. If they are possibly eligible, the PI or&#xD;
      a clinical coordinator for that study will contact them to explain the study to see if they&#xD;
      are interested. Their participation in this safety trial and other future clinical trials&#xD;
      will have no effect on your Registry participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Contribution: How will this project contribute to the literature and/or the field?&#xD;
      We believe in the strong power of rare diseases, especially Wolfram syndrome, to understand&#xD;
      the pathogenesis and develop novel therapeutic modalities for more prevalent diseases,&#xD;
      including type 1 diabetes and neurodegeneration. Our study on Wolfram may lead to a&#xD;
      breakthrough for treatments of common diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration, in which endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction is involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Collect blood and urine samples from registrants to monitor levels of biomarkers,&#xD;
      identify disease-modifying genes, and understand the mechanisms of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect blood samples up to three times a year and urine samples up to three times a&#xD;
      year from Wolfram syndrome patients participating in the registry study. The blood sample is&#xD;
      for sequencing of the Wolfram syndrome causative genes if not already done, monitoring levels&#xD;
      of biomarkers, including calcium, C-peptide, circulating beta cell DNA, and mesencephalic&#xD;
      astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor, calpain-2 activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress&#xD;
      marker levels, and next-generation sequencing for identifying disease-modifying genes.&#xD;
      Similarly, the urine will be used for monitoring levels of biomarkers, including calcium,&#xD;
      C-peptide, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor, calpain-2 activation and&#xD;
      endoplasmic reticulum stress marker levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect blood sample from parents for sequencing of the Wolfram syndrome causative&#xD;
      genes if not already done, monitoring levels of biomarkers, including calcium, C-peptide,&#xD;
      circulating beta cell DNA, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor, calpain-2&#xD;
      activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress marker levels, and next-generation sequencing for&#xD;
      identifying disease-modifying genes. Similarly, the urine will be used for monitoring levels&#xD;
      of biomarkers, including calcium, C-peptide, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic&#xD;
      factor, calpain-2 activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress marker levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect blood samples from unaffected siblings. of a patient with Wolfram syndrome&#xD;
      for sequencing of the Wolfram syndrome causative genes if not already done, monitoring levels&#xD;
      of biomarkers, including calcium, C-peptide, circulating beta cell DNA, mesencephalic&#xD;
      astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor, calpain-2 activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress&#xD;
      marker levels, and next-generation sequencing for identifying disease-modifying genes.&#xD;
      Similarly, the urine will be used for monitoring levels of biomarkers, including calcium,&#xD;
      C-peptide, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor, calpain-2 activation and&#xD;
      endoplasmic reticulum stress marker levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Administer an electronic activity assessment questionnaire one-time to all&#xD;
      registrants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will electronically administer a questionnaire to all individuals on the registry&#xD;
      (self-report or parent proxy). The revised questionnaire will be sent to all Registry&#xD;
      participants to have a large sample size as well as more representation from individuals who&#xD;
      are older or have more severe symptoms compared to those at the clinic. The data will be&#xD;
      collected in REDCap and analyzed in Excel and SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ultimately aims to increase participation in life activities and quality of life for&#xD;
      those with Wolfram syndrome. The questionnaire will serve as a needs assessment. The&#xD;
      identified needs will guide the development of a list of comprehensive resources for families&#xD;
      with Wolfram syndrome and guidelines for OT clinicians, working with Wolfram syndrome, which&#xD;
      can be accessed online. A long term goal is to offer OT services through Washington&#xD;
      University for local individuals with Wolfram syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (optional):&#xD;
&#xD;
      We may isolate and culture cells from their skin biopsies, blood or urine samples, bank them&#xD;
      and reprogram them into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) at a later date. Additionally,&#xD;
      we may genetically engineer the reprogrammed iPSCs to introduce or repair mutations. The&#xD;
      reprogrammed and/or genetically engineered iPSCs may be differentiated into various tissue&#xD;
      types for future studies. The banked cells from their samples as well as their derivatives&#xD;
      may also be shared with researchers at Washington University, at other research centers and&#xD;
      institutions, or industry sponsors of research.&#xD;
