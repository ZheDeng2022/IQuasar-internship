    <textblock>
      Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN), a major cause of late allograft failure, is&#xD;
      characterized by a progressive decline in graft function correlating with tissue destruction.&#xD;
      Recent data suggest that it may be possible to delay graft destruction if adequate management&#xD;
      is initiated early (ie, at the stage of subclinical CAN). It is therefore essential to design&#xD;
      new tests allowing physicians to predict transplant recipients prone to develop CAN&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Superantibodies are multifunctional antibodies combining the classical antigen-binding&#xD;
      function with nonclassical biological activities, such as protease-like activity. In the past&#xD;
      few years the role of proteolytic SuperAntibody (pSAb) has been evidenced in many biological&#xD;
      processes in which their role may be either deleterious (autoimmune disease, alloimmune&#xD;
      response against) or beneficial (sepsis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nothing is known so far regarding the role of pSAb in the setting of solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator has obtained preliminary results from a retrospective case control study&#xD;
      indicating that an elevated serine protease activity of circulating IgG (measured by the&#xD;
      hydrolysis of a synthetic fluorescent substrate:&#xD;
      Proline-Phenylalanine-Arginine-Methylcoumarinamide (PFR-MCA)), correlates with the absence of&#xD;
      CAN on protocol biopsy performed 2 years post-transplantation. Interestingly, low level of&#xD;
      proteolysis IgG, measured 3 months post-transplantation, were also predictive of CAN at 2&#xD;
      years down the lane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Research project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to validate in a prospective study, the potential of pSAb as predictive marker for&#xD;
      CAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 recipients of a renal graft have to be enrolled and followed for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of PFR-MCA hydrolysis by circulating Immunoglobulin G (IgG) will be measured before&#xD;
      the transplantation and every 3 months up to one year and every 6 months thereafter until 2&#xD;
      year post-transplantation. The development of CAN will be assessed by estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (Modification of the Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula), the proteinuria&#xD;
      and the histological examination of the graft (screening biopsy at 3 months and 1 year will&#xD;
      be analysed using a computerized color image analysis to quantify interstitial fibrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capacity of the pSAb test to predict CAN will be validated and the sensibility and&#xD;
      specificity of this test will be calculated. The optimal cut-off value will be determined&#xD;
      from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The accuracy of the test will be&#xD;
      evaluated in subgroups displaying various risk factors for CAN.&#xD;
