  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of pressure injuries has been considered a quality indicator of health care&#xD;
      services and efforts has been made to develop guidelines to prevent this issue. Intensive&#xD;
      care unit admissions (ICU) are recognized as risk factors to develop pressure injuries due to&#xD;
      reduced mobility of critically ill patients and large number of devices and hard technologies&#xD;
      that jeopardize preventive measures, such as, decubitus changes. There are not current&#xD;
      definitive evidence about the superiority of any support surface to treat or prevent pressure&#xD;
      injuries. The objective of the present study is to analyze if the use of viscoelastic support&#xD;
      surface in vulnerable critically ill patients decreases the incidence of pressure injury&#xD;
      compared with pyramidal foam support surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized clinical trial performed in an intensive care unit for adult patients in a&#xD;
      philanthropic hospital. Inclusion criteria are patients admitted to ICU with Braden scale ≤&#xD;
      14. Exclusion criteria are age under 18 years, less than 24 hours of ICU length of stay,&#xD;
      contraindication of performing complete institutional preventive measures for support&#xD;
      injuries, presence of support injuries at ICU admission or absence of informed consent.&#xD;
      Randomization will be made by computerized generated numbers and patients will be allocated&#xD;
      in two groups in a ratio of 1:1. All study patients will be cared for according to standard&#xD;
      institutional preventive measures. The interventional group will be placed in an ICU bed with&#xD;
      viscoelastic support surface and the control group in an ICU bed with pyramidal foam support&#xD;
      surface. The main outcome evaluated will be the occurrence of type II pressure injury.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are the time to the occurrence of pressure injury, length of ICU and&#xD;
      hospital stay and 28 days mortality rate. Significance level will be 5%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial with intent-to-treat analysis will be performed involving&#xD;
      critical patients at high risk for development of pressure ulcers, that is; those presenting&#xD;
      a Braden ≤ 14 scale at ICU admission in a one year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Braden scale, six subscales or risk factors are validated: 1 - sensory&#xD;
      perception, 2 - humidity, 3 - activity, 4 - mobility, 5 - nutrition and friction, and 6 -&#xD;
      shearing. The total score varies from 6 to 23 points and patients are classified as: very&#xD;
      high risk (scores less than or equal to nine), high risk (10 to 12 points), moderate risk (13&#xD;
      to 14 points), low risk (15 to 18 points), and without risk (19 to 23 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria is aged less than 18 years, length of stay in the ICU less than 24&#xD;
      hours, contraindication for the performance of the standard PU prevention measures of the&#xD;
      institution, presence of PU at ICU admission, and absence of the Informed Consent Term (ICT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using a computerized table and patients will be allocated&#xD;
      into two groups. Patients in the intervention group will be cared for according to the&#xD;
      standard PU prevention measures of the institution and use a viscoelastic mattress as a&#xD;
      bedding surface with the following characteristics: conventional density foam, density 40,&#xD;
      and viscoelastic, density 60, polyurethane coated reinforced with 100% polyester mesh.&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will be cared for according to standard PU prevention measures&#xD;
      of the institution and use a pyramidal foam mattress as a support surface with a density of&#xD;
      33.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The institution's PU prevention measures are: apply body moisturizer after bathing without&#xD;
      massaging bony prominences or areas with hyperemia; inspect the skin in the cephalo-caudal&#xD;
      direction, especially the areas of bony prominences every 24 hours to observe hyperemias,&#xD;
      dryness, heat, hardness, and maceration; rigorously evaluate whether the entire oral or&#xD;
      enteral diet was ingested, taking into account the gastric residue and change in decubitus&#xD;
      position every 2 hours; evaluate the need for application of dressings to protect bony&#xD;
      protrusions from friction; always use the traction to mobilize the patient in the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a non-pharmacological intervention, the blinding of the health team is not&#xD;
      possible, however the statisticians responsible for the analyzes will be blind regarding the&#xD;
      identity of the treatments. After the randomization, identification data will be collected,&#xD;
      date of birth, gender, weight will be measured by the patient lift (Jack 250®), height&#xD;
      measured by a tape measure, severity score (SAPS 3) on ICU admission, score of organ&#xD;
      dysfunctions (SOFA), diagnosis of ICU admission, and the Braden scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the patient follow-up, the following data will be collected daily until discharge from&#xD;
      the ICU; physical examination for the detection and classification of pressure ulcers,&#xD;
      maximum vasopressor dose, and the Braden scale. After the first day, the accumulated fluid&#xD;
      balance will be collected and in the course of the follow-up the date of discharge from the&#xD;
      ICU and from the hospital. The main outcome of the study is considered as the occurrence of a&#xD;
      stage 2 PU. Secondary outcomes are time spent in the ICU and hospital. The research was&#xD;
      approved by the National Commission for Ethics in Research (CONEP), through the Certificate&#xD;
      of Presentation for Ethical Appreciation (CAAE) no. 51644915.0.0000.5231, and the Committee&#xD;
      for Ethics in Research Involving Humans of the Evangelical Beneficent Association of Londrina&#xD;
      - AEBEL, according to Opinion no. 3/2015, of October 30, 2015. 4.3.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed in the MedCalc program for Windows, version 9.3.2.0 (MedCalc&#xD;
      Software, Mariakerke, Belgium), establishing analyzes pertinent to this research. The level&#xD;
      of significance adopted is 5% and the confidence interval is 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the difference between the study groups, considering the outcome variable the&#xD;
      occurrence of stage 2 PUs, a significance level of 95%, power of 80%, ratio between exposed&#xD;
      and unexposed of 1:1, frequency of outcome in the unexposed group of 80%, and frequency of&#xD;
      outcome in the exposed of 30%, a sample size of 60 participants was calculated, 30 in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the comparison of two groups of continuous variables with independent samples, the&#xD;
      Student t test will be used for the variables with normal distribution. For cases where&#xD;
      distribution is not normal, the Mann - Whitney test will be applied. Kaplan Meier curves will&#xD;
      be constructed and the Log-rank test applied to compare the main outcome (PU stage 2) between&#xD;
      the two study groups.&#xD;
