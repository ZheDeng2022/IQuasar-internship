    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this trial is to explore the dose-tolerance (safety) and&#xD;
      dose-response (efficacy) of single 3-minute intra-bursal perfusions of a physiological saline&#xD;
      solution at increasing temperatures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, exploratory, 6-months dose-tolerance and dose-response study of a single&#xD;
      thermal ablation (Ablaflex) procedure in subjects suffering from chronic symptomatic&#xD;
      bursitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible study participants will be screened for eligibility based on defined inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be administered with a single 3-minute perfusion of a physiological&#xD;
      saline solution at a specific temperature between 50° Celsius and 55° Celsius. If the volume&#xD;
      of the bursa estimated by ultrasound examination is ≤ 10 cc, the perfusion will be performed&#xD;
      at a rate of 3mL/second. If the volume of the bursa is &gt; 10 cc and ≤ 25 cc, the perfusion&#xD;
      will be performed at a rate of 4mL/second. If the volume of the bursa is &gt; 25 cc, the subject&#xD;
      is considered as screen failure (exclusion criterion # 10). Immediately prior to and&#xD;
      immediately after the thermal ablation phase of 3 minutes, perfusion with a physiological&#xD;
      saline solution at room temperature (22°C) will be performed during 2 minutes. In total the&#xD;
      bursa will be rinsed during 7 minutes. An elastic bandage (Elastoplast) will be applied&#xD;
      immediately after the procedure to compress the bursa cavity. It should be worn for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first patient with bursitis of olecranon will be administered physiological saline&#xD;
      solution at a temperature of 50° Celsius, and subsequent patients will receive perfusions&#xD;
      with increments of 0.5 to 1° Celsius as long as no AR (of any intensity) is reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As long as no AR is reported, but when a first CR or PR is reported for a specific&#xD;
      temperature, the patient in whom CR or PR was reported will be considered as the first in a&#xD;
      cohort of 3 patients treated at the same temperature during the course of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as a first AR is reported, the patient in whom the AR was reported will be considered&#xD;
      as the first in a cohort of 3 patients treated at the same temperature and the remainder of&#xD;
      the study will be conducted with cohorts of 3 patients treated in the same conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at 6 different study visits: at baseline (Day 1), 1 day (24/72h)&#xD;
      after treatment, 1 week after treatment (+/- 1 day), 3 weeks after treatment (+/- 2 days), 6&#xD;
      weeks (+/- 1 week) after treatment, and 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) after treatment. At any time&#xD;
      during the 6-months study period an unscheduled visit may be performed. Patients will be&#xD;
      requested to score weekly patient reported outcome assessments (PRO) until Week 6 and at&#xD;
      Month 6, and to record any possible ARs and bursitis related treatments. At Week 2, Week 4&#xD;
      and Week 5 the patient will complete the PRO at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments to be performed at every study visit include: physical examination (with focus on&#xD;
      the bursitis), vital signs (including HR and temperature), PRO, adverse events (AE),&#xD;
      concomitant medication(s) and treatment(s). An ultrasound exam of the bursa (according to&#xD;
      standard ultrasound protocol) is to be performed at baseline and at week 6 (week 1 assessment&#xD;
      is optional).&#xD;
