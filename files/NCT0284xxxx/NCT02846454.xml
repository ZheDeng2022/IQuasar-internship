    <textblock>
      This proposed randomized, double blinded 12 week crossover human feeding study aims to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of consuming a composite drink of inulin and arabinoxylan on satiety&#xD;
      by measuring appetite biomarkers such as subjective satiety, energy/food intake and changes&#xD;
      in the human gut microbiota in healthy weight males (22 to 24.9kg/m2)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research that focuses on the mechanisms involved in appetite regulation is topical given the&#xD;
      emergence of the worldwide obesity epidemic. Understanding the physiological processes&#xD;
      associated with the onset of obesity is essential for the development of effective&#xD;
      anti-obesity strategies. There is evidence that people who consume a diet high in non-starch&#xD;
      polysaccharides (NSPs) have a lower body mass index (BMI) than those that do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2009 review of fibre and satiety by Bridget Benelam, 2009 focused on different types of&#xD;
      fibre and the significant impact they may have on satiety and/or energy intake, through&#xD;
      fermentation of fibre such as non starch polysaccharides in the colon by gut bacterial groups&#xD;
      such as Bifidobacterium. non starch polysaccharides and other fibre sources are poorly&#xD;
      digested by human enzymes in the small intestine but are degraded by large groups of bacteria&#xD;
      in the large bowel. One of the beneficial outcomes of this fermentation of fibre that gut&#xD;
      bacteria produce of metabolites called short chain fatty acids (SCFA) thought to affect&#xD;
      appetite regulation by stimulating production of satiety hormones that can help you feel&#xD;
      full. Acetate and propionate are two of these metabolites highlighted as potential mediator&#xD;
      of satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some fibres are called prebiotics as they act as selective sources for beneficial gut&#xD;
      bacteria. However Western populations do not consume natural prebiotics in high quantities in&#xD;
      their diet and the overall intake of fibre is also low. Therefore, in this study, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to utilise a mixture of prebiotics in order to increase the growth and/or&#xD;
      activity of commensal gut bacteria and SCFA production in human volunteers and to assess the&#xD;
      effects of consumption on satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing the impact of a composite mix of inulin and arabinoxylan in a human study will help&#xD;
      determine the effect it has on appetite regulation, ad libitum food intake, SCFA production,&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, cognitive state (e.g. mood) and composition of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a 12 week randomized, human feeding study, with a crossover design&#xD;
      testing a composite mix of inulin and arabinoxylan against an equivalent energy matched&#xD;
      (kcal) maltodextrin control drink in 33 healthy weight (22 to 24.9kg/m2) males aged between&#xD;
      21-55. Volunteers will be enrolled to treatment or placebo for four weeks, with a four week&#xD;
      wash out before the crossover. the primary endpoint, satiety following a test meal challenge&#xD;
      will be measured on four occasions throughout the study. Anthropometry measures, dietary&#xD;
      intake, body weight and blood pressure will be monitored throughout the study. Faecal and&#xD;
      urine will be collected at baseline and at the end of each treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>The volunteers will randomized to receive either control or treatment drink and asked to consume this twice daily for 28 days, followed by a 28 day washout, the alternate drink will then be consumed for a further 28 days. Visual analogue scale will be used to measure subjective satiety scores during 4 half day study days lasting 6hrs at the beginning and end of each treatment period at a designated nutrition unit (Hugh Sinclair Nutrition unit, Reading University).</description>
