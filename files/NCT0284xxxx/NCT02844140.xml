      Dose distribution calculations for proton therapy are more accurate when based on DE-CT than&#xD;
      on SE-CT. It is however unclear what the quantitative benefit of repeated DE-CT calculations&#xD;
      is for lung cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to calculate the dose distribution of protons adequately, accurate estimations of&#xD;
      the stopping power ratio (SPR) medium to water, are required. Using a conversion from single&#xD;
      energy CT (SE-CT) images results in an uncertainty in the SPR of at least 3-4%. This&#xD;
      uncertainty results in in the use of larger margins around the clinical target volume (CTV)&#xD;
      and hence more dose to the organs at risk (OAR). It also effects in the conservative use of&#xD;
      beam directions, which are often sub-optimal, to avoid irradiating normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual energy CT (DE-CT) improves the accuracy of the SPR and therefore the proton range&#xD;
      estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of the proton range for several tissues using SE-CT and DE-CT as input to Monte&#xD;
      Carlo (MC) simulations showed on average improvements in range prediction from 0.1% to 2.1%&#xD;
      when using DECT instead of SECT, but in several phantoms and also versus proton-CT, the&#xD;
      errors on SE-CT based proton stopping power ratios are reported to be more than 7 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limitation of these studies is that most of them were performed in phantoms. In the first&#xD;
      clinical data set on five patients with base of skull tumours, it was reported that although&#xD;
      the SPR estimation was indeed better for DE-CT than for SE-CT, its clinical relevance was&#xD;
      unclear. However, in the same study, phantom measurements showed a large uncertainty of the&#xD;
      SPR in the lung. This is due to the large heterogeneity of the lungs and the huge difference&#xD;
      in the density of the lungs compared to the mediastinum, the tumour and the chest cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore important to study the SPR differences of SE-CT compared to DE-CT in lung&#xD;
      cancer patients and the impact on the dose distribution especially in the context of adaptive&#xD;
      radiotherapy. As during the course of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which is the&#xD;
      standard treatment in the majority of stage III lung cancer patients, important anatomical&#xD;
      changes may occur, it is also of clinical relevance to determine the influence of repeated&#xD;
      dose calculations on DE-CT.&#xD;
