  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing a bacterial infection is isolation of the pathogenic germ,&#xD;
      which is not easy in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional markers do not have sufficient diagnostic value for making a rapid diagnosis on&#xD;
      admission. A 2004 literature calculated the diagnostic values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and&#xD;
      procalcitonin (PCT) levels for the diagnosis of bacterial infections, relative to other&#xD;
      causes of inflammation. For CRP, the sensitivity was 75% (95% CI: 62%-84%) and the&#xD;
      specificity was 67% (95% CI: 56%-77%). For PCT, the sensitivity was 88% (95% CI: 62%-84%) and&#xD;
      the specificity was 81% (95% CI: 67%-90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cellular immune response to infection consists of the mobilization of polynuclear&#xD;
      neutrophils from the bone marrow to the infection site under the effect of pre-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, as well as the apoptosis of lymphocytes and their sequestration at the infection&#xD;
      site. This results in lymphopenia and the elevated polynuclear neutrophil count (PNN)&#xD;
      observed in bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, it is legitimate to hypothesize that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be&#xD;
      used in the diagnosis of bacterial infection. This ratio's value in the diagnosis of sepsis&#xD;
      in the emergency department was studied and the researchers found higher diagnostic values&#xD;
      than for CRP and PCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NLR's potential value in the diagnosis of a bacterial infection in a context of fever or&#xD;
      hyperthermia (regardless of the presence or absence of bacteraemia) has not been studied&#xD;
      before. This ratio could also be compared with standard biomarkers (CRP and PCT levels, the&#xD;
      white blood cell count and the PNN).&#xD;
