      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drug called&#xD;
      Abemaciclib. Abemaciclib could shrink your cancer but it could also cause side effects.&#xD;
      Researchers hope to learn if the study drug will delay the growth of the cancer or shrink the&#xD;
      cancer by at least one quarter compared to its present size. Abemaciclib is not FDA approved&#xD;
      and has not been tested in liposarcoma, but it has shrunk tumors in patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer, lymphoma, and lung cancer.&#xD;

             initiation of therapy. Patients receiving BCNU or mitomycin C must have received their&#xD;
             last dose of such therapy at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 x institutional ULN&#xD;
