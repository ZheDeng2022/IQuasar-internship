    <textblock>
      Despite an overall reduction in US smoking rates from &gt;50% in the 1960s to about 20% by 2000,&#xD;
      the rate of smoking among persons with a serious mental illness (SMI) remains 2-3 times&#xD;
      greater than in the general population. Further, even the recent small decline in smoking&#xD;
      rates that has been reported in the general population in the past decade has not occurred&#xD;
      among smokers with an SMI. In fact, 44% of all the cigarettes consumed in the US are by&#xD;
      individuals with a psychiatric disorder and the primary cause of death among Americans with&#xD;
      an SMI is a tobacco-related disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cluster randomized trial will be conducted in 14 Philadelphia community mental health&#xD;
      clinics (CMHCs). Clinics will be randomized to either Addressing Tobacco Through&#xD;
      Organizational Change model (ATTOC) or Usual Care (UC) treatment groups. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that 1) at the end of the intervention and at a 3-month follow-up, rates of&#xD;
      adherence to guidelines for treating TUD will be greater among clinic personnel that receive&#xD;
      the ATTOC intervention vs. clinic personnel in usual care; 2) at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      and at a 3-month follow-up, rates of client smoking cessation will be significantly greater&#xD;
      in clinics that receive the ATTOC intervention than among clients treated with usual care;&#xD;
      and 3) using non-inferiority testing, at the end of the intervention and at a 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up, there will be no significant degradation in mental health functioning or QOL among&#xD;
      clients who receive care at clinics that received the ATTOC intervention than among clients&#xD;
      treated with usual care.&#xD;

      Despite an overall reduction in US smoking rates from &gt;50% in the 1960s to about 20% by 2000,&#xD;
      the rate of smoking among persons with a serious mental illness (SMI) remains 2-3 times&#xD;
      greater than in the general population. Transforming the mental healthcare system to&#xD;
      integrate and adhere to evidence-based guidelines for the provision of tobacco use disorder&#xD;
      (TUD) treatment is a priority of the National Institute of Mental Health and is a critical&#xD;
      component of a national effort to meet Healthy People 2020 target goals for tobacco use&#xD;
      (www.healthypeople.gov).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Addressing Tobacco Through Organizational Change (ATTOC) model is a systems-level&#xD;
      intervention to address systemic and cultural barriers that undermine assessment and&#xD;
      treatment of TUD. In this innovative way, ATTOC assumes that effective organizational change&#xD;
      requires more than clinic personnel training; it also requires the application of&#xD;
      organizational theory to address attitudinal and system barriers and promote a culture in&#xD;
      which tobacco use is not accepted or supported and that TUD treatment is integrated into&#xD;
      standard practice. Consistent with organizational theory, ATTOC is implemented in 3 phases:&#xD;
      preparing for, implementing, and sustaining change. By addressing cultural barriers and&#xD;
      strengthening the care system (e.g., integrated treatment), ATTOC intends to have sustained&#xD;
      benefits beyond the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cluster-randomized trial will be conducted with 14 Philadelphia CMHCs, 7 randomized to&#xD;
      ATTOC and 7 to usual care (UC). Following randomization, study staff will visit sites to&#xD;
      recruit clinic personnel and clients over a 4 to 6 week period. Those eligible will complete&#xD;
      informed consent and HIPAA forms and a baseline assessment to establish pre-intervention&#xD;
      levels on all measures (baseline). After 4-6 weeks, the ATTOC intervention will be&#xD;
      implemented over 9 months, from Week 1 to Week 36 (with UC at the control sites). Two&#xD;
      mid-intervention assessments (Weeks 12 and 24) will allow for performance feedback and&#xD;
      mediational analyses. Week 36 (end-of-treatment; EOT) and 52 (3-months post-EOT) assessments&#xD;
      will allow for evaluation of changes on outcomes between groups over time. All measures will&#xD;
      be conducted at the respective CMHC (or over the phone if necessary) and 7-day point&#xD;
      prevalence smoking cessation will be verified using a breath carbon monoxide (CO) monitor&#xD;
      (abstinence = &lt; 8ppm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first controlled, randomized trial to evaluate the effects of the ATTOC&#xD;
      model on clinician adherence to treatment guidelines, client smoking, and client mental&#xD;
      health and QOL. If this approach is shown to be effective and safe, it can serve as a model&#xD;
      for the nation's community mental healthcare infrastructure, representing a powerful&#xD;
      initiative to address tobacco use in an under-served sub-group of smokers, and support&#xD;
      efforts to attain the Healthy People 2020 goals regarding tobacco use.&#xD;
