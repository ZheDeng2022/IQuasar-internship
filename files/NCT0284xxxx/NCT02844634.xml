    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men remain at high risk for HIV infection. Targeting prevention&#xD;
      interventions to MSM at highest risk of seroconversion is an important goal of combination&#xD;
      prevention interventions. Antecedent diagnosis of another sexually transmitted infection&#xD;
      (STI), particularly syphilis, may serve as an entry point for biomedical prevention as these&#xD;
      individuals are at highest risk for incident HIV. The use of the antiretroviral combination&#xD;
      of tenofovir/emtricitabine has been shown to be associated with an overall 44% reduction in&#xD;
      HIV acquisition in high-risk MSM when taken daily as PrEP. In those individuals with&#xD;
      detectable drug levels, the benefit was as high as 90% risk reduction. In real-world&#xD;
      evaluations of PrEP, high-risk sexual behaviour may continue as evidenced by high rates of&#xD;
      intercurrent sexually transmitted infections. As such, biomedical interventions that may&#xD;
      offer additional reduction in acquisition of common sexually transmitted infections should&#xD;
      also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a small pilot study has demonstrated potential benefit from a similar strategy for&#xD;
      syphilis prevention. In this study 30 MSM were randomized to receive either 100mg doxycycline&#xD;
      once daily or contingency management strategies linked to remaining free of sexually&#xD;
      transmitted diseases at progressive study visits. Overall, those receiving doxycycline were&#xD;
      significantly less likely to be diagnosed with any STI during followup than those in the&#xD;
      comparator arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose to undertake a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      using both tenofovir/emtricitabine and doxycycline (immediate or deferred use) for&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis amongst HIV-negative MSM with recent history of syphilis infection&#xD;
      in Vancouver, Canada.&#xD;

      1. Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Men who have sex with men with antecedent diagnosis of another sexually transmitted&#xD;
           infection, particularly syphilis, are at high risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to experience high rates of HIV incident&#xD;
           infections in Canada and a disproportionately high burden of disease relative to the&#xD;
           general population. In 2011, approximately 48% of new diagnoses occurred in MSM across&#xD;
           Canada, a figure that has been relatively stable for the last decade. Within British&#xD;
           Columbia (BC), although HIV new diagnosis rates overall have been declining over the&#xD;
           last decade (dropping from a rate of 10.6 cases/100,000 in 2004 to 5.9 cases/100,000 in&#xD;
           2013), MSM made up an increasing majority of new diagnoses (59%) within BC in 2013.&#xD;
           Within Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCH), approximately 70% of all new HIV&#xD;
           diagnoses annually from 2012-15 were amongst MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Targeting prevention interventions to MSM at highest risk is important when determining&#xD;
           potential publicly funded biomedical interventions, particularly the use of HIV&#xD;
           pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Antecedent diagnosis of another sexually transmitted&#xD;
           infection (STI) may serve as an entry point for biomedical prevention as these&#xD;
           individuals are at highest risk for incident HIV. In an evaluation of HIV incidence&#xD;
           following diagnosis of syphilis infection in New York City, the annual HIV incidence was&#xD;
           3.6% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.27% - 3.97%), with overall HIV incidence amongst&#xD;
           MSM of 5.56% (1). In those males with syphilis and a subsequent additional STI the HIV&#xD;
           incidence was even greater at 7.89% (95% CI: 6.62% - 9.24%). A similar analysis of&#xD;
           clients attending STI clinics in BC has revealed that antecedent STI is predictive of an&#xD;
           elevated risk for subsequent HIV seroconversion with clients who ever had a diagnosis of&#xD;
           syphilis having an HIV incidence of 3.6% person-years (95%CI: 2.5-4.9), gonorrhea (2.0%;&#xD;
           95%CI: 1.6-2.5), rectal gonorrhea (4.5% person-years; 95%CI: 3.4-5.8), while individuals&#xD;
           with rectal gonorrhea and syphilis had an incidence rate of 12.6 % person-years (95%CI:&#xD;
           8.4-21.8).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluating the use of PrEP in MSM with antecedent STI is an important component to&#xD;
           inform HIV prevention programs in BC and nationally. The STI clinics operated by the BC&#xD;
           Centre for Disease Control are well-positioned for this evaluation as about 15 and 25%&#xD;
           of all HIV diagnoses in BC and VCH, respectively are diagnosed at these clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. STI prevention strategies may also benefit from biomedical prevention interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
           Novel biomedical strategies have been shown to be effective in preventing acquisition of&#xD;
           STI such as HIV, and are now considered to be standard of care for at-risk MSM in the&#xD;
           United States. The use of the antiretroviral combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine has&#xD;
           been shown to be associated with an overall 44% reduction in HIV acquisition in&#xD;
           high-risk MSM when taken daily as PrEP. In those individuals with detectable drug&#xD;
           levels, the benefit was as high as 90% risk reduction. In real-world evaluations of&#xD;
           PrEP, high-risk sexual behaviour may continue as evidenced by high rates of intercurrent&#xD;
           STI (50% of PrEP users after 12 months in a study of 657 PrEP initiators in San&#xD;
           Francisco). As such, biomedical interventions that may offer additional reduction in&#xD;
           acquisition of common sexually transmitted infections should be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recently a small pilot study has demonstrated potential benefit from a similar strategy&#xD;
           for syphilis prevention (2). In this study 30 MSM were randomized to receive either&#xD;
           100mg doxycycline once daily or contingency management strategies linked to remaining&#xD;
           free of sexually transmitted diseases at progressive study visits. Doxycycline 100mg&#xD;
           daily was chosen based on prior studies indicating that doses as low as once weekly&#xD;
           doxycycyline could serve as prophylaxis for leptospirosis, another spirochete infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Overall, those receiving doxycycline were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with&#xD;
           any STI during follow-up than those in the comparator arm (odds ratio [OR] 0.27; 95% CI&#xD;
           0.09 - 0.83). Specific protection against syphilis infection was not seen during the&#xD;
           on-treatment phase (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.04 - 1.73), possibly reflecting the small sample&#xD;
           size. During the study period, no change in sexual behaviours between arms was noted,&#xD;
           supporting the potential role of doxycycline prophylaxis. A larger pilot evaluation of&#xD;
           this strategy, in combination with HIV PrEP, would be a novel syndemic approach to&#xD;
           addressing both the HIV and syphilis burden amongst the highest risk MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators therefore propose to undertake a randomized trial of immediate vs.&#xD;
           deferred doxycycline in conjunction with daily tenofovir/emtricitabine to determine the&#xD;
           feasibility of combined HIV and syphilis pre-exposure prophylaxis amongst HIV-negative&#xD;
           MSM with recent history of syphilis infection in Vancouver, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to undertake a pilot trial of immediate vs. deferred doxycycline in conjunction&#xD;
      with daily tenofovir/emtricitabine to determine the feasibility of combined HIV and syphilis&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis amongst HIV-negative MSM with recent history of syphilis infection&#xD;
      in Vancouver, Canada. We will meet this aim through the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess feasibility of using dual daily HIV and syphilis PrEP, as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Evaluation of feasibility of recruitment for a larger study i. Proportion of&#xD;
           participants approached for study who are eligible and agree to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Adherence to 6 or 12 months of tenofovir/emtricitabine and doxycycline i. Determine&#xD;
           proportion of individuals with &gt;95% adherence to dual therapy over 6 and 12 months ii.&#xD;
           Proportion of individuals with detectable doxycycline plasma level at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additional measures of feasibility will include the assessment of:&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Tolerability of dual PrEP i. Comparison of grade 3 or 4 adverse events in those&#xD;
           receiving immediate vs. deferred PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate antimicrobial resistance over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Change in proportion of participants with evidence of tetracycline class resistance&#xD;
           in common flora, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus&#xD;
           pneumoniae from baseline to 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate changes in sexual activity reported by study participants over the study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare syphilis incidence between those in the immediate vs. deferred doxycycline&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To describe frequency of other STI's diagnosed in study participants over the study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory objectives will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate doxycycline resistance in individuals with documented T.pallidum infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate HIV incidence and syphilis re-infection rates over a 12 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Characterize changes in the rectal microbiome from baseline to 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
           initiation of doxycycline&#xD;
