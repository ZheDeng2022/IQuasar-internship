  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high dose per fraction (&gt;10Gy/fraction) used in Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SABR) has been shown to be more effective at local tumor control than treatments employing&#xD;
      more conventional dose fractions. The mechanisms for this are currently under debate. One&#xD;
      possible mechanism for this increased effectiveness is that high dose/fraction causes&#xD;
      significant vascular damage to the tumor. This study hopes to measure vascular integrity pre&#xD;
      and post SABR treatment using kinetic models obtained from dynamic contrast enhanced CT.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if high dose per fraction SABR has an impact on the&#xD;
      vasculature of both the tumor and of healthy liver tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High dose / fraction in HCC patients with tumours &lt; 5 cm will result in detectable changes to&#xD;
      kinetic model parameters derived from dynamic contrast enhanced images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantify changes in tumor vascular support for patients receiving SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the correlation between PK derived model liver perfusion parameters and QoL&#xD;
      metrics as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-Hep QoL assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population are patients receiving liver SABR for no more than 2 discrete liver tumors&#xD;
      with a maximum dimension &lt;5cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perfusion CT Image Data Post Processing and Analysis. Patient motion will be corrected using&#xD;
      deformable registration, fiducial tracking, and RPM breathing traces. Organ ROIs will be&#xD;
      added to the perfusion image series by manually translating anatomical planning CT ROIs to&#xD;
      the motion-corrected perfusion image series, or by algorithmically deforming planning ROIs.&#xD;
      Portal vein and abdominal aorta ROIs will be demarcated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will proceed via custom software we have built during related projects. Contrast&#xD;
      enhancement time courses will be generated for key structures (i.e., abdominal aorta, portal&#xD;
      vein, and gross liver tissues) and used to derive a variety of perfusion map images, such as&#xD;
      liver perfusion, mean transit time, arterial fraction, and distribution volume. A distributed&#xD;
      parameter model will be preferred for kinetic modeling. Supplementary non-parametric&#xD;
      techniques will be used for other parameters of interest (e.g., IAUC, maximum slope).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images acquired before and after treatment will be registered so that parameter maps can be&#xD;
      compared on a per-patient basis. Changes in perfusion parameters will be characterized with&#xD;
      special emphasis placed on regional structure and clustering effects. Pre and post parameter&#xD;
      maps will be computed near individual-voxel level. Regions of interest (1) within or near&#xD;
      tumour and (2) at a low-dose portion of liver will be defined. A distribution of parameters&#xD;
      within each ROI will be used to generate estimates of the mean parameters and uncertainty.&#xD;
      Estimates of mean parameters and whole distributions will be compared using standard&#xD;
      statistical comparisons (t-test and Whitney respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life We will evaluate quality of life (QOL) in HCC patients treated with SBRT&#xD;
      using EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-Hep QOL assessments at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
      Correlation between perfusion parameter changes and patient outcomes or QOL (second-order&#xD;
      analysis) will be applied if statistically significant first-order parameter changes can be&#xD;
      detected. Standard correlative measures such as the Pearson product-moment correlation&#xD;
      measure will be used to assess statistical significance. As there is currently no data&#xD;
      relating liver perfusion to toxicity or quality of life, this study will examine whether a&#xD;
      change in liver perfusion is correlated with enhanced or reduced QOL.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All the following criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &gt; 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Multi-phase CT scan and/or MRI of the liver within 8 weeks of radiation planning&#xD;
             demonstrating:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Liver tumours &lt; 5 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No more than 2 discrete liver tumours&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Normal liver &gt; 700 cc&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have HCC diagnosed by either: i) pathological confirmation, or ii)&#xD;
             intrahepatic vascular enhancement of the lesion demonstrated by at least two imaging&#xD;
             modalities, or iii) intrahepatic vascular enhancement of the lesion demonstrated by&#xD;
             one imaging modality if AFP &gt; 200 in the setting of liver cirrhosis or chronic&#xD;
             hepatitis B without cirrhosis (EASL consensus guidelines [2])&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Liver HCC must be deemed unresectable as determined by an experienced hepatobiliary&#xD;
             surgeon, or the patient must be medically inoperable or refuse surgery,&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting, with representatives from&#xD;
             Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, Surgery, Interventional Radiology, and&#xD;
             Hepatology. Patients must be considered ineligible for standard local treatments,&#xD;
             including surgery, liver transplantation, radiofrequency ablation, and targeted&#xD;
             biologics. Some subjects could be potential candidates for sorafenib but normally this&#xD;
             treatment is not considered before all local treatment options have been considered,&#xD;
             as the response rate to sorafenib is low (2% in the SHARP study). Patients might be&#xD;
             candidates for sorafenib after progression on the study treatment or if they do not&#xD;
             want to participate and in both cases they will be referred to a medical oncologist.&#xD;
             Patients may have received prior TACE and had an incomplete response. Ineffective or&#xD;
             incomplete TACE is defined as incomplete filling by lipiodol-doxorubicin mixture used&#xD;
             by either angiography or CT ≥1 month after TACE or by increasing alpha-fetoprotein&#xD;
             level. Patients must have recovered from the effects of previous therapies before SBRT&#xD;
             with a minimum 4-week period between TACE and SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0, 1, or 2 (Appendix III), or a&#xD;
             Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 60 (Appendix IV)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Albumin above 28 g/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  INR &lt; 1.7 and/or correctable with vitamin K (unless on anticoagulation therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No ascites or encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-Turcotte-Pugh score must be ≤ 7&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. BCLC Stage B or C (portal venous invasion or liver hilum nodal disease only; (Appendix&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. No chemotherapy or systemic therapy concurrent with radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Previous treatment(s) with radiofrequency ablation, surgery, TACE, Y90, percutaneous&#xD;
             ethanol injection, or chemotherapy are not exclusion criteria provided that recurrence&#xD;
             or lack of tumour response has been documented. Patients who decline, or not eligible&#xD;
             for, these treatments will also be considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient signs a study-specific informed consent form. If the patient's mental status&#xD;
             precludes this, written informed consent may be given by the patient's legal&#xD;
             representative. A translator will be provided if the patient has a language barrier.&#xD;
