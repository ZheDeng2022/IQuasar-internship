  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      tolerance of the combination of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in the induction,&#xD;
      consolidation, and maintenance treatment of transplant eligible, newly diagnosed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the combination of&#xD;
      elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (ERd) as induction therapy and the ability of the&#xD;
      combination to facilitate the start of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in&#xD;
      transplant-eligible patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. In addition to induction,&#xD;
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ERd as consolidation and maintenance therapy in&#xD;
      these patients will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will undergo four 28-day cycles of an induction regimen of elotuzumab,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. Following completion of 4 cycles of induction therapy, all&#xD;
      patients will undergo standard mobilization, collection of stem cells, and then ASCT using a&#xD;
      melphalan conditioning regimen as per institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity evaluation will be interrupted during the stem cell procedure and will resume with&#xD;
      the onset of consolidation. Adverse events will be collected, however, from the end of&#xD;
      induction up to mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation therapy will begin 70 to 120 days following ASCT and will consist of four&#xD;
      28-day cycles of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. All patients that do not&#xD;
      experience progressive disease will begin maintenance therapy of elotuzumab, lenalidomide,&#xD;
      and dexamethasone. The duration of maintenance will be 24 months.&#xD;
