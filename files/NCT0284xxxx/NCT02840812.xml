      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, 1:1 parallel control and single dose&#xD;
      administration study design. Healthy subjects will be matched to severe renal function&#xD;
      impaired (eGFR≤30mL/min/1.73m2，CKD-EPI estimated) subjects in age, gender and weight as&#xD;
      parallel control, which matches healthy with normal renal function according to the of&#xD;
      subjects with impaired renal function as, after enrollment of subjects with severe impaired&#xD;
      renal function (eGFR≤30mL/min/1.73m2，CKD-EPI estimated). Renal function impaired group and&#xD;
      control group both receive orally single-dose of nemonoxacin malate capsule (0.5g). Collect&#xD;
      the blood and urine samples before and after the administration to perform pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis and safety observation.&#xD;
