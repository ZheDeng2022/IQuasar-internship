  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid and accurate detection of influenza virus in respiratory specimens is required for&#xD;
      optimal management of patients with acute respiratory infections. Because of the variability&#xD;
      of the symptoms and the numerous other causes of influenza-like illness, the diagnosis of&#xD;
      influenza cannot be made on the basis of clinical criteria alone. Thus, rapid influenza&#xD;
      diagnostic tests have been developed such as the Alere i Influenza A&amp;B isothermal nucleic&#xD;
      acid assay. Investigators prospectively evaluated the performance of the Alere i Influenza&#xD;
      A&amp;B assay in comparison with the routine Xpert Flu/RSV assay.&#xD;

      Main objective / secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears that so far the weight of the influenza disease, the limits of clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      and validity of rapid diagnostic methods to emergencies are well studied and validated.&#xD;
      However the potential organizational and economic benefit in emergency care services remains&#xD;
      little known and rarely evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significant improvement in diagnostic response time he has a real beneficial impact for&#xD;
      the patient? For the organization of the emergency? Investigators propose to study the impact&#xD;
      of the implementation of rapid diagnostic solution by molecular biology of influenza directly&#xD;
      available in an adult emergency department, from a cohort of patients consulting in&#xD;
      connection a flu-like illness. Investigators wish in particular to highlight the&#xD;
      organizational and economic impact.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study single-center, prospective, descriptive, observational, type &quot;before / after&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unable to reasonably perform a prospective randomized study due to the constraints for&#xD;
      patients and for the service and means that it would be necessary to deploy in this case (CRA&#xD;
      ... PHRC), we are moving more towards a comparison study before / after between February and&#xD;
      April.&#xD;

      Acquisition of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Observing Notebook (CRF or &quot;Case Report Form&quot;) are disclosed in the notes accompanying&#xD;
      this document and will be collected aur an Excel spreadsheet Statistical analysis ( For each&#xD;
      subject will be awarded an identifier (original name and surname - year of birth) and the&#xD;
      data will be entered on a computer file which will be sent to the statistician in charge of&#xD;
      analyzing the GHPSJ site. There will be no exchange of personal data for this study is single&#xD;
      center on the site GHPSJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient presents to the Emergency Home Service for a &quot;flu syndrome&quot;. During the first&#xD;
      phase ( &quot;before&quot;), the assumption will be that usually achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second phase ( &quot;after&quot;), a flu test is routinely performed within the home&#xD;
      emergency department by the doctor who supports the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cases, the doctor continues to support according to information it has and according&#xD;
      to good practice and service protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case report form (CRF or Case Report Form) is completed for each patient included in the&#xD;
      study. This report forms includes a questionnaire that collects anonymous demographic&#xD;
      information (patient age and sex) and clinical data. The CRF also includes the results of the&#xD;
      rapid test for influenza. These notebooks anonymous comments are seized by the Home Emergency&#xD;
      Service on a type of database &quot;Access&quot; (which will then be completed by the results of the&#xD;
      rapid test. If positive, strain characterization will be clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients recruited (justification) and duration of participation for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not applicable as observational study are moving more towards a comparison study before /&#xD;
      after between February and April.&#xD;
