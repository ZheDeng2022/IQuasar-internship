  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to classify volunteers as endotoxin-responders or&#xD;
      non-responders following inhalation of 20,000 EU Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (CCRE).&#xD;
      Endotoxin is a commonly encountered bioaerosol and component of indoor and outdoor air&#xD;
      pollution. For reasons that remain unclear, some individuals appear to be more susceptible to&#xD;
      the inflammatory effects of inhaled endotoxin than are others, possibly owing to single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene that influence TLR4&#xD;
      signaling and function. These susceptible individuals represent a population of particular&#xD;
      interest for further mechanistic studies of the effects of endotoxin and for therapeutic&#xD;
      trials. Susceptibility to inhaled endotoxin will be determined by measuring change in&#xD;
      peripheral blood neutrophil counts, a biomarker of systemic inflammation, following inhaled&#xD;
      CCRE. In our previous work, the investigators have found that inhalation of 20,000 EU CCRE is&#xD;
      well tolerated and induces measurable increase in neutrophil content of peripheral blood in&#xD;
      susceptible individuals. Our hope is that this CCRE inhalation protocol can be employed to&#xD;
      screen large populations for susceptibility to the inflammatory effect of inhaled endotoxin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, screening study involving recruitment of 18 normal volunteers (NV).&#xD;
      The protocol is powered to compare absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in the blood 6 hours after&#xD;
      inhalational challenge with CCRE compared baseline. In addition, as secondary endpoints, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate inflammatory cytokine levels in systemic circulation and access&#xD;
      for the presence of genes thought to be related to endotoxin response. Visits will be&#xD;
      conducted by a study coordinator or other study staff, physical exams will be performed by&#xD;
      the PI or other study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighteen subjects will be recruited. There will be no gender or ethnic restrictions, and&#xD;
      subjects will be healthy volunteers. Prior to enrollment in this study, subjects will have&#xD;
      participated in our protocol 98-0799 (screening and database study for the CEMALB). Data such&#xD;
      as medical history and allergy skin testing collected during the screening protocol will be&#xD;
      included with data in this study. Subjects with positive allergy skin testing will not be&#xD;
      excluded. Spirometry will be performed to determine the current level of lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify those individuals who appear more susceptible to the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory effects of endotoxin exposure, subjects will undergo inhaled endotoxin challenge&#xD;
      at the baseline visit followed 6 hours later by blood draw for complete blood count with&#xD;
      differential to allow for calculation of absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Subjects will be&#xD;
      considered &quot;responders&quot; if their peripheral ANC increases by at least 20% following inhaled&#xD;
      endotoxin challenge.&#xD;

    <description>The objective of this study is to identify endotoxin responders, characterized by an increase in post-CCRE peripheral blood polymorphonuclear (PMN)s compared to that day's baseline values of &gt; 20%. Thus, there will be two data points for this cohort, blood PMNs at baseline and PMNs 6 hours following 20,000 endotoxin units (EU) of CCRE.</description>
