      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Biomarker evaluation/screening phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in adult Gaucher disease Type 3 (GD3)&#xD;
           patients that distinguish GD3 from adult Gaucher disease Type 1 (GD1) patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screen adult GD3 patients who qualify for treatment with venglustat in Parts 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts 2 and 3: Treatment phases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate short-term (Part 2) and long-term (Part 3) safety and tolerability of&#xD;
           venglustat in combination with Cerezyme in adult GD3 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the change in CSF central nervous system (CNS) biomarkers (glucosylceramide&#xD;
           [GL-1] and lyso-glucosylceramide [lyso-GL-1]) from adult GD3 patients receiving&#xD;
           venglustat in combination with Cerezyme (Part 2 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of venglustat in adult GD3 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the efficacy of venglustat in combination with Cerezyme in infiltrative lung&#xD;
           disease (ILD) in adult GD3 patients (Part 2 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the efficacy of venglustat in combination with Cerezyme in systemic disease in&#xD;
           adult GD3 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the efficacy of venglustat in combination with Cerezyme on neurological function&#xD;
           and on exploratory CSF biomarkers other than lyso-GL-1 and GL-1 in adult GD3 patients&#xD;
