  <brief_summary>

      Several studies during the last years reported the involvement of anti-retinal autoantibodies&#xD;
      in ocular disorders, such as AMD. These studies support the growing evidence of an&#xD;
      immunological involvement in the pathogenesis of AMD. In the planned trial it is planned to&#xD;
      enroll 70 subjects, i.e. 50 subjects with neovascular AMD and 20 healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the change from Baseline (Visit 1) in BCVA score at Week 12&#xD;
      (visit 4) in the study eye of nAMD patients treated with Ranibizumab. Neovascular AMD&#xD;
      patients (group 1) will be accompanied for 6 months and blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline and monthly until Visit 7 for analysis of antibody profiles. Healthy volunteers&#xD;
      (group 2) will be enrolled and a blood sample will be collected once for analysis of antibody&#xD;
      profiles. Antibody profiles of all study participants will be analysed to address questions&#xD;
      as defined in the outcome measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Several studies during the last years reported the involvement of anti-retinal autoantibodies&#xD;
      in ocular disorders, such as retinal vasculitis, retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa and also&#xD;
      AMD. These studies support the growing evidence of an immunological involvement in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of AMD. In the planned trial it is planned to enroll 70 subjects, i.e. 50&#xD;
      subjects with neovascular AMD and 20 healthy volunteers. The investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      change from Baseline (Visit 1) in BCVA score at Week 12 (visit 4) in the study eye of nAMD&#xD;
      patients treated with Ranibizumab. AMD patients and healthy volunteers will be recruited at&#xD;
      the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Medical Center, Johannes&#xD;
      Gutenberg-University Mainz and included based on defined criteria. Neovascular AMD patients&#xD;
      (group 1) will be accompanied for 6 months and blood samples will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      and monthly until Visit 7 for analysis of antibody profiles. Ranibizumab is applied according&#xD;
      to the manufacturer's recommendations and the &quot;Stellungnahme der DOG, RG und BVA zu aktuellen&#xD;
      therapeutischen Möglichkeiten bei der neovaskulären AMD&quot; (December 2012). A loading dose of&#xD;
      three injections within the first three months is followed by an individual therapy interval&#xD;
      based on the clinical progress (PRN). Re-treatment after the upload of the three initial&#xD;
      doses every 4 weeks will be performed in case of progression (PRN) based on the&#xD;
      recommendations of the &quot;Stellungnahme der DOG, RG und BVA zu aktuellen therapeutischen&#xD;
      Möglichkeiten bei der neovasculären AMD&quot; (December 2012). Healthy volunteers (group 2) will&#xD;
      be enrolled and a blood sample will be collected once for analysis of antibody profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside the analysis of primary endpoint, the investigators propose to analyze in detail the&#xD;
      following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the ranibizumab treatment have any effects on antibody profiles found in sera and do&#xD;
      these changes correlate with the clinical course of the disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the patient group can be divided into two subgroups: AMD patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed neovascular AMD, who have not received anti-VEGF-treatment so far (naïve subjects)&#xD;
      and AMD patients with neovascular AMD, who have not received any anti-VEGF treatment 3 months&#xD;
      prior to inclusion in the study. This separation may help to answer the question if it is&#xD;
      possible to differentiate between ranibizumab responder and non-responder with the help of&#xD;
      antibody profiles.&#xD;
