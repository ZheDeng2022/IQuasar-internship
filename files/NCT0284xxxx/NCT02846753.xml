    <textblock>
      A prospective, non-randomized multi-center clinical investigation of the Venus P-Valve™ for&#xD;
      the treatment of pulmonary regurgitation with or without stenosis in patient with native&#xD;
      outflow tracts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the implantation of the Venus P-Valve™ for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with an incompetent pulmonic valve, which causes blood to flow back from the pulmonary artery&#xD;
      into the right heart ventricle during pumping of the heart (pulmonary regurgitation).&#xD;
      Patients with and without narrowing (stenosis) of the right ventricular outflow tract will be&#xD;
      included. The purpose of this protocol is to assess the safety and performance of Venus&#xD;
      P-Valve™ implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedure, a clinical visit will be scheduled at 30 days, 6 month, 12 months, and&#xD;
      annually thereafter to 3 years. Population: Patients≥12 years with a body weight of ≥30kg,&#xD;
      with significant pulmonary regurgitation (≥3+) with or without right ventricular outflow&#xD;
      tract (RVOT) stenosis (mean Doppler gradient ≥35mmHg) with native right ventricular outflow&#xD;
      tracts.&#xD;
