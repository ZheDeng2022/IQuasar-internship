  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to explore the sequential therapeutic effect and evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of anti-CD19 or anti-CD20 CAR-T cells briging HSCT in the treatment of&#xD;
      relapse/refractory B cell malignancies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown exellent therapeutic efficiency in B cell&#xD;
      malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Recently the anti-CD20 CAR T cells has&#xD;
      been used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL and exhibited good clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, patients treated with CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 or CD20 mutation. Therefore we&#xD;
      attempt to maintain and relieve patients by sequential therapy of the HSCT and hope to&#xD;
      combine their advantages.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. CD19-expressing or CD20-expressing relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies after at&#xD;
             least one standard chemotherapy and one salvage regimen.According to current&#xD;
             traditional therapies, there must be no available alternative curative therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Expected survival time of patients enrolled is over 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Gender is not limited, age from 14 years to 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which&#xD;
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by&#xD;
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell&#xD;
             dose based on dosage cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic&#xD;
             symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy: CNS 1, defined as&#xD;
             absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin preparation, regardless&#xD;
             of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL WBCs in CSF and cytospin&#xD;
