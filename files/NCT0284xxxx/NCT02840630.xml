  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit non-diabetic volunteers (n=30) and diabetic volunteers&#xD;
      controlled by diet and lifestyle (n=300). The non-diabetic volunteers will be in the&#xD;
      non-diabetic group while the diabetic volunteers will be randomised to a diabetic control&#xD;
      intervention group or a diabetic fish intervention group. Baseline data will be collected&#xD;
      from all three groups but only diabetic control intervention group and diabetic fish&#xD;
      intervention group will go through the 16-week study. This will allow the investigators to&#xD;
      compare the metabolic health across South Asian population in people with and without&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended intake of EPA and DHA daily is ~450 mg per day for cardiovascular health, or&#xD;
      approximately 3 g per week. Over the course of 16 weeks, subjects in the diabetic control&#xD;
      intervention group will continue with their habitual diet, while subjects in the diabetic&#xD;
      fish intervention group will receive two 125 g portion of tinned mackerel (containing 7.8 g&#xD;
      n-3 LCPUFA26) every week, to replace a portion of red meat or poultry. Previous n-3 LCPUFA&#xD;
      intervention study among South Asian people in the United Kingdom was able to reverse lipid&#xD;
      abnormalities with supplementation of 2.5 g of EPA and DHA per day for 12 weeks. However, the&#xD;
      same study also shows that their daily consumption of EPA and DHA is only 68±99 and 112±171&#xD;
      mg respectively. Therefore, only 1.1 g n-3 LCPUFA per day is given in this study to increase&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipe recommendations using mackerel will be provided. Non-diabetic volunteers will be&#xD;
      recruited only to obtain baseline data in order to compare their metabolic profile with that&#xD;
      of the diabetic volunteers. This will allow us to investigate the link between omega 3 status&#xD;
      and glycaemic control in a South Asian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fish is chosen as an intervention as opposed to EPA and DHA supplements in order to capture&#xD;
      the benefits of eating fish as an important source of not only n-3 LCPUFA, but also other key&#xD;
      nutrients such as vitamin D, selenium and iodine.&#xD;

      During the study period, participants will be asked to maintain their routine dietary and&#xD;
      social habits to avoid changes in body weight. In addition volunteers will be asked to record&#xD;
      their weights first thing in the morning on the same set of scales every week. Any changes&#xD;
      can be documented in a food frequency questionnaire. Volunteers without diabetes will be&#xD;
      recruited for baseline data and will not be involved in the 16-week intervention study.&#xD;
      Diabetic volunteers will be randomized by BioSS in batches of ~20 people into the diabetic&#xD;
      control or the diabetic fish intervention group that will be matched for gender, age and BMI.&#xD;
      The diabetic control group will be asked to continue with their routine dietary habits while&#xD;
      the diabetic fish intervention group will be asked to substitute poultry or red meat with 2&#xD;
      tins of mackerels each week. Study kits will be posted two weeks before the study initiates&#xD;
      to consenting volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will be asked to provide finger prick blood spots on filter paper at week 0,&#xD;
      while subjects allocated to diabetic control and diabetic fish intervention groups will be&#xD;
      asked to provide blood spots again at week 8 and 16. A dried blood spot (DBS) sampling kit&#xD;
      containing two Whatman 903 filter papers, two lancets, alcohol pads, bandaids, guidelines on&#xD;
      spotting blood on filter paper, prepaid envelope, FFQ, tinned mackerel and a fish recipe&#xD;
      book. Every volunteer will be asked to prick the inside tip of a non-dominant finger and&#xD;
      gently spot a total of ten circles in the filter papers. A volunteer might experience slight&#xD;
      discomfort when the lancet goes into the finger. The volunteers will then allow the filter&#xD;
      paper to dry for about an hour before closing the flap over the filter paper. All information&#xD;
      and tools to help with obtaining the dried blood spots, as well as guidelines on how to spot&#xD;
      blood on filter paper will be included with the DBS kit. Volunteers are required to spot 2&#xD;
      filter papers at one collection point and post them in a pre-paid envelope complete with a&#xD;
      return address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DBS samples will be analyzed for omega 3 index, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c),&#xD;
      triglycerides, Vitamin D status, genetic (TCF7L2 7903146) and epigenetic marker (FADS 174546)&#xD;
      of lipid and glucose control.&#xD;
