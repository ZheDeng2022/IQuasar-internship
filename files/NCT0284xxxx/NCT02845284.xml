      pregnancies. The study population is pregnant adolescents who are attending antenatal care in&#xD;
      Kampala, Uganda The acceptability and effectiveness of two enhanced peer lead, reproductive&#xD;

      The overall goal of this research to test the acceptability and effectiveness of two enhanced&#xD;
      adolescent friendly reproductive health prevention interventions versus current routine care.&#xD;
      In each intervention group, 152 adolescent mothers will be randomized to either the enhanced&#xD;
      group peer support education and counseling intervention or to the enhanced one-to-one&#xD;
      (individual) peer support education and counseling group with a young, model, peer educator&#xD;
      trained to deliver Reproductive Health Education and counseling messages, beginning during&#xD;
      pregnancy (≥ 28 weeks) and followed up to 9 months postpartum or study end at or after 6&#xD;
      months (whichever comes first). The control group will consist of 215 adolescent mothers&#xD;
      randomized to routine care as provided at Mulago hospital (or the designated health facility)&#xD;
      where midwives deliver group sessions during antenatal and postpartum care visits as well as&#xD;
      standard PMTCT services including routine opt-out HIV C&amp;T and availability of partner C&amp;T.&#xD;
      Syphilis testing should also be routinely provided and treatment provided for infected&#xD;
      pregnant mothers and their partners as per local standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 groups will be enrolled with study visits at 3, 6 and 9 months post partum however the&#xD;
      intervention groups (Arms 2 and 3) will have additional visits at 36 weeks Antepartum,&#xD;
      delivery, 6 and 10 weeks postpartum, Quantitative baseline data will be collected on routine&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, reproductive history, pregnancy intentions and sexual&#xD;
      risk/perceptions and HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection status.&#xD;
