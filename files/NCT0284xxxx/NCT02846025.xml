      ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers may therefore contribute to the cardiovascular risk profile, as well as environmental&#xD;
      factors have a significant impact on the epigenetic program of gene expression. Methyl groups&#xD;
      are usually added or removed as needed and can be influenced by diet soon, dietary factors&#xD;
      have been linked to the change of DNA methylation, resulting in changes in gene expression.&#xD;
      Research on the prevalence of gene methylation levels on the impact of nutrient intake, as&#xD;
      well as the inflammatory condition and the results of dietary interventions for the genes, it&#xD;
      is a sparse area in studies and, therefore, expanding of the knowledge. Thus, understanding&#xD;
      the effects of a diet rich in antioxidants and hazelnut oil, in inflammation and DNA&#xD;
      methylation profile is important because chronic diseases with cardiovascular disease can&#xD;
      begin with the consumption of modified lipids and can research this stage provide important&#xD;
      dietary allowances for the development of this disease prevention strategies even in&#xD;
      adulthood. This PhD project is linked to a larger project entitled &quot;II Diagnosis Cycle and&#xD;
      Intervention Food Situation, Nutrition and Noncommunicable Diseases Prevalent over the City&#xD;
      Population of João Pessoa / PB&quot; (II DISANDNT / PB) and have two methodological designs: the&#xD;
      first one is the composition of a representative sample of adults in the city of João Pessoa,&#xD;
      from II DISANDNT / JP, population-based study and cross-sectional. The second methodological&#xD;
      design was developed with a subsample of the above population, selected from criteria being&#xD;
      the type and interventional clinical trial. This model will have to evaluate the effect of a&#xD;
      diet rich in antioxidant and hazelnut oil, in inflammation and gene expression.&#xD;

      This thesis is linked to a population-based survey entitled &quot;Diagnosis II Cycle and&#xD;
      Intervention Food Situation, Nutrition and Noncommunicable Diseases Prevalent over the city&#xD;
      of João Pessoa Population / PB&quot; (II DISANDNT / PB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For realization of this thesis, a first population-based study, representative of adults in&#xD;
      the east areas and west of the city of João Pessoa, there was the calculation of a&#xD;
      representative sample for the age group of adults, using information provided by the city, as&#xD;
      map the municipality, the number of blocks per district and the Brazilian Institute of&#xD;
      Geography and Statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home visits and implementation of the survey questionnaires were carried out by teams of&#xD;
      undergraduate researchers from the Nutrition courses, masters and doctoral students of the&#xD;
      Post Graduate Program in Nutrition Sciences (PPGCN) UFPB duly previously trained at the&#xD;
      beginning of data collection after the pilot study and following.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trained teams, after recognizing the drawn court, were instructed to select all&#xD;
      households in the court. The blocks that did not have homes, the homes in which those&#xD;
      responsible have not accepted to participate and the amount of individuals who refused to&#xD;
      participate in randomly selected households were computed and resorteadas randomly thereafter&#xD;
      to minimize losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each residence drawn all individuals, adults aged between 20-59 years were invited to&#xD;
      participate in the research through application of socioeconomic and demographic&#xD;
      characteristics questionnaires, epidemiological characterization, nutritional assessment and&#xD;
      food intake, biochemical evaluation and brands epigenetic.&#xD;
