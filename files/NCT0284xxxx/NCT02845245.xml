  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comminuted intra-articular distal tibia fractures (OTA 43-C) typically are the result of&#xD;
      high-energy trauma such as motor vehicle collisions or fall from a height. They are complex&#xD;
      injuries often associated with significant fragment displacement and severe soft tissue&#xD;
      injury, a combination that has long challenged orthopedic surgeons. Traditionally, surgeons&#xD;
      use plain film (X-ray) and CT scans (2 or 3 dimensional) to determine fracture pattern and&#xD;
      displacement. Yet, in some cases, it is still difficult to identify the relationship among&#xD;
      bone fragments, which often makes articular restoration challenging. As a result, patients&#xD;
      with non-anatomic joint reconstructions have a higher rate of poor outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to compare patient outcomes in two groups, one&#xD;
      group who will receive enhanced pre-operative planning (3D printed plastic prototype +&#xD;
      standard of care [SOC] imaging with 3D CT scan + plain film radiographs) and a second group&#xD;
      who will receive pre-operative planning using SOC imaging alone (3D CT scan + plain film&#xD;
      radiographs only). Patient outcomes collected throughout the 12 month post-operative period&#xD;
      will include an assessment of radiographic fracture healing (union, non-union, malunion),&#xD;
      pain using a Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Olerud and Molander Score based on patient's&#xD;
      self-report, and development of complications (infection, wound healing, re-operation, and&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations). The secondary objective of this study will be to evaluate whether&#xD;
      utilizing an enhanced pre-operative plan with a 3D printed plastic prototype altered the&#xD;
      original pre-operative plan based on SOC imaging alone (3D CT scan + plain film radiographs&#xD;
      only).&#xD;

      1. Recruitment Patients with a comminuted distal tibia fracture (OTA 43-C type) who present&#xD;
           for care at Inova Fairfax Medical Campus (IFMC) or at the Inova Medical Group (IMG)&#xD;
           Orthopaedic outpatient clinic will be eligible for consent and possible enrollment in&#xD;
           this study. Patients will not be compensated for participating in this study. Given that&#xD;
           this is a convenience sample of patients who present with an acute traumatic injury,&#xD;
           there are no plans to advertise or recruit patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject Randomization and Blinding Procedures Eligible patients will be randomized in&#xD;
           equal proportions to one of two groups (enhanced pre-operative planning vs. SOC&#xD;
           pre-operative planning) using an electronic randomization system with a simple&#xD;
           randomization table. After consent and inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed,&#xD;
           subjects will be randomized by a research coordinator/associate. All surgeons will be&#xD;
           temporarily blinded to the randomization assignment, in order to complete an unbiased&#xD;
           pre-operative plan (pre-randomization survey) using the SOC imaging alone (plain film&#xD;
           radiographs and 3D CT scan). After the pre-operative plan (pre-randomization survey) is&#xD;
           completed by the attending surgeon (using the SOC imaging alone) and submitted to the&#xD;
           research coordinator/ associate, the surgeon will be informed of the randomization&#xD;
           assignment. For subjects randomized to the enhanced pre-operative planning group, the&#xD;
           surgeon will then be provided the 3D prototype and be asked to complete a&#xD;
           post-randomization survey capturing their pre-operative plan. The biomechanics lab with&#xD;
           arrange with the research coordinator/associate for delivery of the 3D prototype,&#xD;
           ensuring that the temporary blinding of treatment assignment is not broken. A&#xD;
           post-randomization survey will not be administered to surgeons with subjects randomized&#xD;
           to the SOC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will not be blinded to the assigned group. However, in order to ensure the&#xD;
           temporary blind is maintained with the attending surgeon who will be performing the&#xD;
           definitive surgery, the subject won't be informed of their randomization assignment&#xD;
           until the time of definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standard of Care Procedures Prior to Definitive Surgery: All Groups The following&#xD;
           pre-operative care described is the standard of practice and is a general summary of the&#xD;
           care that will be given to all study patients prior to their definitive surgery,&#xD;
           regardless of treatment group assignment. There are two scenarios with which patients&#xD;
           will be eligible and approached for participation in this study: 1). stable fracture&#xD;
           treated with a splint, and 2). unstable (open or closed) fracture requiring&#xD;
           external-fixator surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be initially evaluated in the emergency department (ED) by a member of&#xD;
           the orthopaedic trauma team. Patients with an axially stable injury will undergo manual&#xD;
           realignment and application of a well-padded posterior with U-shaped plaster splint. A&#xD;
           computed tomography (CT) scanning with sagittal, coronal reconstructions and 3D&#xD;
           reformations will be obtained in the ED; and then sent home after learning to crutch&#xD;
           ambulate, with instructions for continued strict elevation, non-weight bearing, and&#xD;
           follow-up in the clinic. Once these patients are seen in the clinic, it is determined&#xD;
           that surgery is required and the patient is subsequently scheduled for definitive&#xD;
           surgery, to occur after resolution of swelling and normalization of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who present in the ED with axially unstable-closed fractures on initial plain&#xD;
           radiographs will undergo closed reduction and be admitted to the hospital for surgical&#xD;
           placement of a temporizing, spanning external-fixator (Depuy Synthes Inc. West Chester,&#xD;
           PA). Patients with axially unstable-open fractures will be administered intravenous&#xD;
           antibiotics and tetanus update on presentation to the ED, and will go to the operating&#xD;
           room for urgent initial debridement and placement of a temporizing, spanning&#xD;
           external-fixator. Patients with unstable fractures (open or closed) will have computed&#xD;
           tomography (CT) scanning with sagittal, coronal reconstructions and 3D reformations&#xD;
           after placement of an external-fixator. Patients will be discharged with appropriate&#xD;
           placement (home vs. acute rehab vs. SNF) after evaluation by physical therapy and have&#xD;
           their definitive surgery scheduled. All patients will be non-weight bearing to the study&#xD;
           injury limb. Definitive operative fixation will occur after resolution of swelling and&#xD;
           normalization of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Procedures: Pre-operative Surgery Planning and open treatment and internal&#xD;
           fixation (ORIF) Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Standard of Care In the control group, 20 patients will have standard of care&#xD;
           treatment, which includes pre-operative evaluation and surgical planning based on plain&#xD;
           films (3 views: anterior, lateral and oblique) and CT scans with sagittal, coronal and&#xD;
           3D reformations. Operative fixation of the fractures using distal tibia fracture&#xD;
           fixation implants (Depuy Synthes Inc. West Chester, PA) will be performed through&#xD;
           standard approaches as judged by the operating surgeon. The implants can include, but is&#xD;
           not limited to: 3.5 mm LCP Low Bend Medial Distal Tibia Plates, 3.5 mm LCP&#xD;
           Antero-lateral Distal Tibia Plates, 3.5 mm LCP Posterior Distal Tibia Plates, or 2.7 mm&#xD;
           / 3.5 mm LCP Distal Fibula Plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Treatment Group: Enhanced Pre-Operative Planning In the treatment group, 20 patients&#xD;
           randomized to enhanced pre-operative planning will include a 3D prototype of the distal&#xD;
           tibia, fibula and talus-in addition to standard of care imaging (plain films 3 view, CT&#xD;
           scans with sagittal, coronal and 3D reformations). On the injured extremity, discrete&#xD;
           bone fragments are segmented and models of the study injury will then be imported into a&#xD;
           computer aided design (CAD) software Unigraphics NX8 (Siemens PLM, Plano, TX). CAD&#xD;
           models of the injured ankle will be converted into plastic prototypes using a Ultimaker&#xD;
           3D printer (Ultimaker B.V., Geldermalsen, Netherlands). Surgeons will use the 3D plastic&#xD;
           prototype model to understand the geometry, displacement, and ideal reduced location of&#xD;
           the fragments. Based on the addition of the 3D plastic prototype model, a second&#xD;
           pre-operative plan will be documented. This will be compared to the initial pre-op plan&#xD;
           to determine if the addition of the 3D prototype changed the surgeon's plan. The 3D&#xD;
           plastic prototypes may be brought to the operating room (in the unsterile field) for&#xD;
           reference during surgery as the surgeons execute the surgical plan. ORIF is then&#xD;
           conducted to fix the fractures as per surgeon's standard of practice. The implants can&#xD;
           include, but are not limited to: 3.5 mm LCP Low Bend Medial Distal Tibia Plates, 3.5 mm&#xD;
           LCP Antero-lateral Distal Tibia Plates, 3.5 mm LCP Posterior Distal Tibia Plates, or 2.7&#xD;
           mm / 3.5 mm LCP Distal Fibula Plates (Depuy Synthes Inc. West Chester, PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Baseline and Follow-Up Assessments Demographics, mechanism of injury, and fracture&#xD;
           classification will be collected at baseline. Patients will be followed over a 12-month&#xD;
           period at 6 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks postoperatively. The outcome parameters being&#xD;
           collected during the follow-up visits include re-operation, malunion and nonunion, other&#xD;
           complications, Olerud and Molander Score, Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for pain, and&#xD;
           General Health Status. Radiographs as part of standard of care will be obtained of the&#xD;
           anterior, lateral and oblique planes (3 views) to assess healing. The Schedule of Events&#xD;
           details the requirements and procedures for each visit. Paper Case Report Forms (CRFs)&#xD;
           will be used to document each follow-up assessment (as source documentation) and will&#xD;
           then be entered electronically (eCRF) into an electronic data capture system. In cases&#xD;
           when patients are not able to come in person for a follow-up assessment and all efforts&#xD;
           to bring the patient in for an appointment have been exhausted, the option to complete&#xD;
           the follow-up via telephone interview may be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Outcome Surveys Three outcome surveys will be obtained at each follow-up visit: 1)&#xD;
           Olerud and Molander Scoring of Symptoms after Ankle Fracture, 2) Numeric Pain Rating&#xD;
           Scale, and 3) General Health. The estimated total time to complete these three outcome&#xD;
           surveys is 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Olerud and Molander Scoring of Symptoms after Ankle Fracture is a 9-question&#xD;
           self-assessment of pain, stiffness, swelling, ability to climb stairs, run, jump, squat,&#xD;
           use of supports, and work/activities of daily life. A total score out of 100 is&#xD;
           calculated, with 100 equaling best or completely unimpaired. The Olerud and Molander&#xD;
           Scoring of Symptoms after Ankle Fracture has been supported as a valid instrument,&#xD;
           significantly correlating to a linear analog scale used to subjectively assess ankle&#xD;
           function, range of motion in loaded dorsal extension, presence of osteoarthritis and&#xD;
           presence of dislocation on radiographs. The Olerud and Molander Score also can capture&#xD;
           minor subjective differences in disability and has a high correlation in test-retest&#xD;
           reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) (11-point numeric scale), a numeric version of the&#xD;
           Visual Analog Scale for pain, will be used to assess the subject's current pain level.&#xD;
           The NPRS is a 10 cm horizontal line, separated by 1cm integer increments, anchored with&#xD;
           0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Possible Pain. The Numeric Rating Scale has been demonstrated&#xD;
           to be valid in terms of construct validity, when compared to 5 other pain intensity&#xD;
           measures such as Visual Analog Scale and Verbal Rating Scales. Subjects will be given&#xD;
           this rating scale, self-administered, to record the number that best reflects their&#xD;
           current pain. The NPRS takes less than 1 minute to complete. The NPRS can also be&#xD;
           administered verbally by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subject's general health state will be measured using the Centers for Disease&#xD;
           Control and Prevention's Health-Related Quality of Life, Healthy Days Core Module&#xD;
           Question 1. This general health question is part of 4 items in the Healthy Days Core&#xD;
           Module, which can be found in several national surveys, including the Behavioral Risk&#xD;
           Factor Surveillance System and Medicare Health Outcome Survey. The validity of the CDC's&#xD;
           HRQOL has been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS (IBM, version&#xD;
           18.0) and statistical significance set at p &lt; α= .05 (two-tailed). Descriptive&#xD;
           statistics will include frequency and percentages, as well as Chi-square analysis or&#xD;
           Fisher's exact test (for cell sizes less than 5), to compare any differences at baseline&#xD;
           between the two treatment groups. Any differences found at baseline, will be controlled&#xD;
           for in the analysis as a covariate/confounding. The percentage of complications, such as&#xD;
           infection, re-operation, malunion, and nonunion, within the two treatment groups will&#xD;
           also be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When comparing differences between the SOC versus enhanced pre-operative planning group&#xD;
      (independent variable) and the Olerud and Molander Score and NPRS (ratio scales), both&#xD;
      outcome/dependent variables capture pain. Therefore, a preliminary analysis of the&#xD;
      correlation between these two dependent variables will be first assessed to determine&#xD;
      appropriateness to use a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), vs. two separate&#xD;
      independent t-tests (Bonferroni correction α= .05/2). When comparing differences between the&#xD;
      SOC versus enhanced pre-operative planning group with the categorical variable of general&#xD;
      health, a Chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact test will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of agreement between the pre and post-randomization pre-operative plan will be&#xD;
      calculated and presented as a descriptive statistic. The number of items in agreement will be&#xD;
      divided by the total number of items answered.&#xD;
