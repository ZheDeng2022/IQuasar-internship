  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe mortality of newborns who received basic,&#xD;
      advanced or no neonatal resuscitation immediately after birth at Shoklo Malaria Research&#xD;
      Unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, descriptive study of hospital records will be conducted. The&#xD;
      existing dataset of newborns of ≥28 weeks gestation delivered at Shoklo Malaria Research Unit&#xD;
      clinics from January 2008 to December 2015 will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dataset, 15224 newborns fulfill the inclusion criteria and therefore they will all be&#xD;
      analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to define: a) the proportion of newborns alive at 24&#xD;
      hours, 7 days, 28 days, and at 1 year, following resuscitation at SMRU birthing rooms and b)&#xD;
      the number of newborns requiring basic and advanced resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of correlation coefficient will be used to compare Shoklo Developmental test&#xD;
      scores and developmental milestones attained at 1 year in resuscitated and non-resuscitated&#xD;
      infants. The Pearson correlation coefficient will be used if the relationship between two&#xD;
      variables is found to be linear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antenatal, perinatal and postnatal characteristics associated with neonatal resuscitation&#xD;
      will be defined by logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
