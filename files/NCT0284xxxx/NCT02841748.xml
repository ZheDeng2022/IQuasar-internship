        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed head and neck cancer (Squamous cell&#xD;
             histology as well as HPV+ and/or EBV+ head and neck tumors), Stages IVA, IVB, and&#xD;
             select cases of Stage III.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HPV status required prior to randomization for oropharyngeal primary tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  EBV status is required prior to randomization for nasopharyngeal primary tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed curative intent therapy, without additional standard of care curative intent&#xD;
             therapy feasible within 20 weeks prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After prior curative intent treatment for HNC have estimated risk of recurrence ≥&#xD;
             40-50% and fall into one of the below categories (A, OR B, OR C, OR D, OR E). While&#xD;
             exact estimation of the risk of recurrence can be difficult the following categories&#xD;
             will be included reflecting patients at substantial risk for tumor recurrence or&#xD;
             already with early evidence of recurrence:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A: Any of the below HNC patients are eligible for adjuvant treatment on this&#xD;
                  protocol AFTER completion of curative intent therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV(-) HNC: N2C, N3, bulky N2B disease (≥ 5cm LN/tumor conglomerate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV(+) HNC: N2C, N3, AND ≥ 10 pack years of tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV(+) HNC with multilevel nodal involvement, AND bulky N2B disease (≥ 5cm LN/tumor&#xD;
             conglomerate), AND ≥ 10 pack years of tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EBV(+) NPC may be eligible if other criteria under A, or alternative criteria B, or C,&#xD;
             or D, or E are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HNC with supraclavicular or mediastinal nodal involvement (any HPV or EPV status ) at&#xD;
             time of curative intent treatment and were treated as part of curative intent therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residual mass in area of prior tumor that on biopsy does not show residual tumor, is&#xD;
             equivocal/not highly-suspicious on imaging but remains of concern, requires close&#xD;
             follow-up AND is not resected/amenable to resection OR immediate palliative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-responders to induction chemotherapy (PD on induction, or lack of tumor shrinkage&#xD;
             (&lt; 15% per RECIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Interrupted treatment course or lower than intended radiation dose - i.e. interruption&#xD;
             of radiation by ≥ 3 weeks (cumulative), or delivery of ≤ 50 Gy as part of a radiation&#xD;
             based treatment (that was NOT a de-escalation approach).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  B: Patient treated with salvage treatment (i.e. salvage surgery or&#xD;
                  re-irradiation) for residual or recurrent tumor after prior radiation based&#xD;
                  therapy (either HPV+ or HPV- or EBV+) AND not a candidate for additional curative&#xD;
                  intent therapy (for various reasons including poor performance status,&#xD;
                  comorbidities, refusal of patient, prior radiation or re-irradiation, etc).&#xD;
                  Positive margins or residual tumor may still be acceptable (see D)). Patients&#xD;
                  should also not be appropriate for systemic palliative therapy (e.g. in the case&#xD;
                  of overt disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  C: Metastases or indeterminate distant lesions that are not appropriate for&#xD;
                  either local radiation/SBRT treatment and also not appropriate for initiation of&#xD;
                  palliative system therapy (e.g. in the setting of overt metastatic disease). Such&#xD;
                  lesions should be negative/equivocal by PET imaging and if amenable negative by&#xD;
                  biopsy, but remain of concern and require close follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  D: Oligometastatic disease treated with SBRT or other curative-intent therapy&#xD;
                  (e.g. surgery or RFA, etc) for oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  E: Microscopic or very low volume residual tumor after surgery or radiation based&#xD;
                  treatment (including salvage treatment or SBRT for oligometastatic disease), AND&#xD;
                  not a candidate for either additional curative intent therapy (for various&#xD;
                  reasons including feasibility, poor performance status, comorbidities, refusal of&#xD;
                  patient, prior radiation or re-irradiation, etc) AND also not a candidate for&#xD;
                  systemic palliative therapy (for various reasons including&#xD;
                  microscopic/non-(RECIST) measurable low volume disease). Very low volume disease&#xD;
                  is defined as non-RECIST measurable).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  F: Patients with multiple recurrences or multiple primaries: specifically&#xD;
                  patients who had malignant or pre-malignant tumors/changes (with severe dysplasia&#xD;
                  present), who have undergone surgery ≥ 2 times, and currently do not have an&#xD;
                  indication for additional (adjuvant) treatment such as radiation, or surgery, or&#xD;
                  other treatment. This may include multiple recurrences/incidences of early stage&#xD;
                  tumors or premalignant lesions, however at least one lesion needs to show&#xD;
                  squamous cell carcinoma on pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: There may be additional scenarios for patients that are considered very high risk for&#xD;
        disease recurrence and not appropriate for either curative or standard of care palliative&#xD;
        therapy. Such patients can be considered for enrollment after discussion and approval by&#xD;
        the PI and/or co-PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of tumor tissue (≥ 10 slides) for PD-L1, gene expression profiling (GEP),&#xD;
             and additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale. An ECOG performance&#xD;
             status of 2 is acceptable if the patient was ECOG 0/1 prior to curative intent therapy&#xD;
             and is in the midst of recovery from curative intent therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate reasonable organ function, all screening labs should be performed within&#xD;
             10 days of treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of&#xD;
             birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the&#xD;
             course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects&#xD;
             of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have&#xD;
             not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting&#xD;
             with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
