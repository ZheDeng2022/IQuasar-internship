    <textblock>
      The appropriate pressure and duration needed for sustained lung inflation in preterm infants&#xD;
      at risk of respiratory distress syndrome have not been well evaluated. We aim for evaluating&#xD;
      two different pressures, 20 and 15 cm H2O, for two different duration, 10 and 20 seconds,&#xD;
      during the application of sustained lung inflation in the resuscitation of preterm infants&#xD;
      with respiratory distress in the delivery room.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomized prospective pilot study in Mansoura University Hospital then&#xD;
      the cases were followed at Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Mansoura University Children&#xD;
      Hospital, Mansoura, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants born equal to or less than 32 weeks gestation with respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to study the proper pressure and duration of sustained lung inflation in the delivery&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants will be divided into 5 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1 (Control group). In this group preterm infants will not be treated with&#xD;
           sustained lung inflation and in stead will receive regular respiratory care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2 (High pressure for long duration group). Preterm infants in this group will be&#xD;
           treated with sustained lung inflation at pressure of 20 cm H2O for 20 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group 3 (High pressure for short duration group). Preterm infants in this group will be&#xD;
           treated with sustained lung inflation at pressure of 20 cm H2O for 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group 4 (Low pressure for long duration group). Preterm infants in this group will be&#xD;
           treated with sustained lung inflation at pressure of 15 cm H2O for 20 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Group 5 (Low pressure for short duration group). Preterm infants in this group will be&#xD;
           treated with sustained lung inflation at pressure of 15 cm H2O for 10 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustained lung inflation will be delivered using the T - piece ventilator (Neopuff infant&#xD;
      resuscitator; Fisher &amp; Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All preterm infants with respiratory distress will follow the following steps for neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All infants will receive initial care including providing warmth, clearing the airway,&#xD;
           and drying and stimulating the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After the initial steps, pulse oximetry will be initiated to determine oxygen saturation&#xD;
           and to guide the required FIO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infants in the intervention groups will receive a single single maneuver of sustained&#xD;
           lung inflation with the first breath according to the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Continuous positive airway pressure at a pressure of 5 cm H2O and FIO2 of 30% will be&#xD;
           delivered to infants in the control group immediately after initial steps of&#xD;
           resuscitation and to all infants in the intervention groups after the single maneuver of&#xD;
           sustained lung inflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Positive pressure ventilation will be provided uring the T-piece resuscitator if the&#xD;
           infant has an inadequate respiratory effort or a heart rate &lt;100 beats per minute at a&#xD;
           rate of 40 to 60 times per minute for 30 seconds, after which the heart rate is&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Oxygen therapy will be titrated to keep a pre-ductal saturation between 90-95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Endotracheal intubation will be provided if positive pressure ventilation is&#xD;
           ineffective, prolonged apnea, or chest compression is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Chest compression will be required if the infant's heart rate remains &lt;60 bpm despite&#xD;
           adequate ventilation for 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Surfactant will be administered to preterm infants requiring a fraction of inspired&#xD;
           oxygen of 40 percent or higher to maintain oxygen saturation above 90 percent or remain&#xD;
           apneic.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Mechanical ventilation will be initiated for preterm infants with respiratory acidosis&#xD;
           documented by an arterial pH &lt;7.2 and PaCO2 &gt;60 to 65 mmHg, hypoxia documented by an&#xD;
           arterial PaO2 &lt;50 mmHg despite FiO2 exceeds 40 percent on nasal continuous positive&#xD;
           airway pressure, or severe apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be the need for endotracheal intubation in the delivery&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include the need for surfactant therapy, the need for endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation and mechanical ventilation within 72 hours of birth, the duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and oxygen support, development of air leak syndromes, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage,&#xD;
      retinopathy of prematurity, and neonatal mortality before hospital discharge,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broncho alveolar lavage will be performed to endotracheally intubated infants enrolled in&#xD;
      this study to measure the level of IL-10 as a lung inflammatory marker immediately after&#xD;
      birth (basal) then 12 hours after birth (follow up).&#xD;
