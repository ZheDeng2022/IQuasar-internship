  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two center, open label, non-randomized Phase II study of lenvatinib in adult&#xD;
      subjects with recurrent or refractory advanced cancers with aberration(s) in FGF/FGFR&#xD;
      signaling. Treatment will consist of daily oral administration of Lenvatinib in 28-day&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory, histology-independent study will enroll up to 39 subjects regardless of&#xD;
      FGF/FGFR aberration or cancer type in order to test the hypothesis that subjects with&#xD;
      advanced cancers harboring changes in FGF/FGFR-related genes will respond to the multikinase&#xD;
      inhibitor lenvatinib at a higher rate than unselected cancer patients, regardless of the&#xD;
      tumor histological subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits FGFR1-4 as well as VEGFR1-3, RET, KIT and&#xD;
      PDGFR-beta. It inhibits FGFR1 with an IC50 of 46 nmol/L, which is highly potent at a&#xD;
      clinically relevant concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and FGF receptor (FGFR) pathway aberrations are common in&#xD;
      malignancy, making this pathway a potentially appealing target for anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
      Clinical trial data suggest that targeting FGFR is indeed effective in cancer. However, the&#xD;
      majority of such data come from trials in patient populations unselected for FGF/FGFR pathway&#xD;
      abnormalities. The true response rates or clinical benefits for those whose cancers harbor&#xD;
      FGF/FGFR abnormalities may be higher than observed in unselected patient populations.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically confirmed advanced or metastatic malignancy characterized by one or&#xD;
             more of the following: Subject is intolerant of standard therapy. Malignancy is&#xD;
             refractory to standard therapy. Malignancy relapsed after standard therapy. Malignancy&#xD;
             for which there is no standard therapy that improves survival by at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evaluable tumor(s) with documented alteration(s) in FGF/FGFR-related gene(s). The&#xD;
             FGF/FGFR aberration(s) can be identified at any point in the subject's cancer course.&#xD;
             FGF/FGFR testing must have been performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory.&#xD;
             Amplification(s) and/or mutation frequenc(ies) will be defined according to the&#xD;
             standard of the test used. One example, Foundation OneTM, defines amplifications as ≥&#xD;
             6 copies and base substitution mutations as present if there is ≥ 5% mutant allele&#xD;
             frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;

             birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study and for at least 30 days after&#xD;
             discontinuation of study drug (the half life of lenvatinib is about 28 hours in&#xD;
             patients with cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be off other anti-tumor agents for at least 5 half lives of the agent or&#xD;
             4 weeks from the last day of treatment, whichever is shorter. Endocrine therapies (for&#xD;
             example for breast or prostate cancer) and anti-Her2 therapies (for example,&#xD;
             trastuzumab or lapatinib) are allowed to continue while on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other experimental agents or agents that are not FDA&#xD;
             approved.&#xD;
