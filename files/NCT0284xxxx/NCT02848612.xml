      To prevent thromboembolic complications, the embolization procedure is performed under&#xD;
      prophylactic unfractionated heparin, the efficacy of which is monitored by point-of- care&#xD;
      testing according to international guidelines. However, these guidelines are based on limited&#xD;
      scientific evidence and the ideal level of anticoagulation required has not been precisely&#xD;
      defined. Furthermore, the correlation between the point-of- care tests used at Amiens&#xD;
      University Hospital and the reference methods used in the laboratory varies considerably&#xD;
      according to the available literature.&#xD;

      Since the beginning of the 2000s, the reference treatment for the management of aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid haemorrhage consists of interventional neuroradiology with coil embolization of&#xD;
      the aneurysm. Although ensuring a better neurological prognosis than neurosurgical clipping,&#xD;
      interventional neuroradiology exposes the patient to various risks: thromboembolic&#xD;
      complications during or after embolization and re-rupture of the aneurysm during&#xD;
      embolization. To prevent thromboembolic complications, the embolization procedure is&#xD;
      performed under prophylactic unfractionated heparin, the efficacy of which is monitored by&#xD;
      point-of- care testing according to international guidelines. However, these guidelines are&#xD;
      based on limited scientific evidence and the ideal level of anticoagulation required has not&#xD;
      been precisely defined. Furthermore, the correlation between the point-of- care tests used at&#xD;
      Amiens University Hospital and the reference methods used in the laboratory varies&#xD;
      considerably according to the available literature.&#xD;
