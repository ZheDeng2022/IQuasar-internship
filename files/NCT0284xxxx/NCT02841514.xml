      Study title: The Efficacy and Safety of tooth bleaching procedure using Y10 Whitening&#xD;
      toothpaste and RF current&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Device: The Brighttonix Y10 Tooth Whitening system is indicated for use in painless&#xD;
      non-invasive tooth whitening treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single center, randomized, controlled, double blind, two-arm, prospective clinical&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits at 7 days (phone visit), 12 weeks and 26 weeks.&#xD;

      Purpose: To assess the efficacy and the safety of tooth bleaching procedure using Y10&#xD;
      Whitening toothpaste and RF current (Y10 Device), versus placebo (no RF current and off- the&#xD;
      -shelf non bleaching toothpaste) in healthy patients seeking tooth bleaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No. of Subjects/Sites: A total of 60 patients at Hadassah Medical Center will be randomized,&#xD;
      30 patients for the test arm, and 30 patients for the placebo arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 40% to 60% male (or female) ratio will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target teeth: At least 4 teeth between teeth 13-23 (Upper front teeth) according to the&#xD;
      international teeth numbering system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper and lower teeth will be treated with the same treatment arm as described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ At the end of the treatment (V3), compared to prior of treatment, the mean shade change&#xD;
      will be at least two shades (Vita Bleachguide 3D Master, Vita P/N: B361) as measured at the&#xD;
      middle one-third area of the labial surface of the selected target teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compared to prior of treatment, the mean shade change at 3 and 6 months will be at least&#xD;
           one shade (Vita Bleachguide 3D Master, Vita P/N: B361) as measured at the middle&#xD;
           one-third area of the labial surface of the selected target teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compared to prior of treatment, color change evaluates with a spectrophotometer (VITA&#xD;
           Easyshade Advance 4; VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany), before and after&#xD;
           treatment, at 3 and 6 months will be at least one shade. (Device with a high&#xD;
           reliability, over 96%, Kim-Pusateri Et al. Reliability and accuracy of four dental&#xD;
           shade-matching devices. Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry United States 2009;101(March&#xD;
           (3)):193-9.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compared to prior of treatment, the mean shade change for the lower teeth numbers 43-33&#xD;
           after treatment, 3 and 6 months will be at least one shade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesion in the gingiva of the upper and lower teeth (+/- in each of the teeth numbers&#xD;
           33-43, 13-23 after treatment and 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compared to prior of treatment - teeth sensitivity to cold and touch stimulation -&#xD;
           target teeth - VAS scale after treatment, 3 and 6 months. For the VAS, the participants&#xD;
           will place a line perpendicular to a 10-mm-long line with zero at one end indicating&#xD;
           ''no TS'' and the other end indicating ''unbearable TS.''&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient oral questionnaire - post treatment, 7 days, 3 months, 6 months (See below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Reported Outcomes: (Scale 0-4). OHIP14-aesthetics questions for patients that&#xD;
           received dental bleaching - (see below) - before treatment and in 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontal parameters at baseline, 3 and 6 months: plaque index, sulcular bleeding&#xD;
           index, pocket depth - all at the target teeth. (See below details).&#xD;
