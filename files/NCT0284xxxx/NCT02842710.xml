      The main objective of this study and to know the incidence of healthy carriers of&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus resistant méti- patients supported for fracture of the proximal femur .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assessment will be made preoperatively by a nasal sampling and analysis through it by&#xD;
      rapid Polymerase Chain Reaction method GeneXpert® .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are 85,000 fractures of the upper extremity in France each year. This is a frequent&#xD;
      pathology in fragile patients. The characteristics in terms of comorbidities, age, sex and&#xD;
      survival are well known from the literature. While secondary mechanical complications to&#xD;
      surgery, hovering around 6 to 8%, mortality at one year is very high (around 25%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative infection after a fracture of the upper end of the femur ranges from 2 to 8%&#xD;
      depending on the series. This complication is responsible for morbidity and excess mortality&#xD;
      linked to the need for revision surgery, prolongation of hospitalization and antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In elective surgery, detection of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin is&#xD;
      systematic and recommended in many countries, preoperative level of the nasal cavity. Parvizi&#xD;
      then Goya believe that this port increased from four to nine times the occurrence of&#xD;
      infection at the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various epidemiological studies have shown the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in over 30%&#xD;
      of patients. This prevalence is lower in the French population. An estimated 70% the&#xD;
      proportion of Staphylococcus aureus in the periprosthetic infections, and 30% related&#xD;
      specifically to the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today there is no consensus on what to have vis-à-vis the detection of a hand and the other&#xD;
      hand treatment of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy carrier in the population overtake admitted to the trauma unit is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary to know these effects among patients with multiple pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For methods of detection, the usual system and directed by swabbing and cultured with 90%&#xD;
      sensitivity specificity of 100%. The demoyens existence of early detection as GeneXpert®&#xD;
      Cepheid® lets get this result is in an hour with a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of&#xD;
      100%.&#xD;
