  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious shocks are associated with high mortality rates (20-40%). Anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      strategies based on the postulate that mortality related to sepsis is mainly due to an&#xD;
      overwhelming pro-inflammatory immune response have failed. Some patients surviving this&#xD;
      initial phase can develop immune dysfunctions because the compensatory mechanisms become&#xD;
      deleterious when they persist over time. The persistence of immunosuppression at day 3 or 5&#xD;
      is independently associated with more nosocomial infections and higher mortality rate. The&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory evidence for sepsis induced immunosuppression have been recently&#xD;
      reviewed by Hotchkiss et al. Apoptosis-induced depletion of immune effector and blood studies&#xD;
      from septic patients showed decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased&#xD;
      HLA-DR expression, increased percentage of regulatory T cells, and increased production of&#xD;
      programmed cell death (PD)-1. Some small positive phase 2 trials of biomarker guided immune&#xD;
      enhancing agents granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interferon γ&#xD;
      (IFN γ) have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are insufficient data showing that such an immunosuppression exists in children. Only&#xD;
      one study performed in children with organ dysfunctions admitted to pediatric intensive care&#xD;
      unit (PICU), showed that 34% of them developed immunosuppression. This study was performed on&#xD;
      a heterogeneous population and immunological analyses were limited. Therefore, there is a&#xD;
      crucial need of studies on septic patients with matched controls to provide more evidence&#xD;
      that the same paradigm exists in children. The collaboration of laboratories with a high&#xD;
      level of experience in this domain, and a clinical unit with a high potential of recruitment&#xD;
      of children with severe infectious shock should allow us to perform the first prospective&#xD;
      study specifically done in children with infectious shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that children with severe infectious shock developed sepsis-induced&#xD;
      immunosuppression as shown in adults. This will be assessed by the expression of HLA-DR on&#xD;
      monocytes' surface. We make the hypothesis that children who become immunosuppressed are more&#xD;
      prone to develop secondary nosocomial infectious and stayed longer in PICU and in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged from 1 month to 17 years, admitted to PICU at HFME Lyon-Bron are eligible if&#xD;
      they have the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock, defined by the &quot;Surviving Sepsis&#xD;
      Campaign 2012&quot; or those of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) (definitions of CDC - Center for&#xD;
      Disease Control). An information leaflet will be issued to parents and children / adolescents&#xD;
      and they will be informed of their right to object to the search. Are provided as part of&#xD;
      this research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunological measures (mHLA -DR) in three stages: in the first 48 hours, between D3/5&#xD;
           and D7/9. The volume of collected blood will not exceed 2.4 ml / kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The collection of nosocomial infections and status at D30 A control group of patients&#xD;
           hospitalized for surgery without sepsis or toxic shock criteria will be recruited in the&#xD;
           same hospital by ICU investigators and matched for age. Similarly controls will be given&#xD;
           oral and written information and they will have the opportunity to deny inclusion. They&#xD;
           will have the same exams as the first group of patients.&#xD;
