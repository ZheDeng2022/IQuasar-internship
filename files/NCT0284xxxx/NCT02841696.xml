  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor. Heart failure is one of its main&#xD;
      complications but the factors that influence its development are still insufficiently known.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine associated factors to the occurrence of left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction assessed by an alteration of the Global Longitudinal&#xD;
      Strain (GLS) after more than the years of hypertension. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      estimate the prevalence of LV systolic dysfunction in a cohort of hypertensive people&#xD;
      followed for over 10 years and formulate pathophysiological hypotheses on the development of&#xD;
      this heart disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some of the hypertensive patients will develop a post hypertensive heart disease. This&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is now essentially defined by the association of LV hypertrophy&#xD;
      and diastolic dysfunction. Investigators believe this hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is also&#xD;
      characterized by early impairment of systolic function but mainly in its longitudinal&#xD;
      component (assessed by measuring the GLS) and therefore exposed to cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work is based on an existing cohort of hypertensive patients included more than 10 years&#xD;
      ago before any initiation of antihypertensive therapy in the hypertension unit of the&#xD;
      Bordeaux University Hospital, France. Patients will be contacted for further consultation&#xD;
      with a cardiologist to identify patients with a LV systolic dysfunction. The primary&#xD;
      end-point is a decrease of the longitudinal systolic function with a GLS&lt;-17% for men and&#xD;
      &lt;-19% for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sufficient number of patients will be contacted in order to collect data of at least 400&#xD;
      patients after more than 10-year of follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The exam is in the left lateral decubitus position. 4 electrodes are applied to the patient's chest for a synchronization with the Electrocardiogram (ECG). The examination is conducted as standard with acquisition loops of records in parasternal long axis parasternal short axis, apical 4-cavities, 2-cavities and aorta 2 cavities.</description>
