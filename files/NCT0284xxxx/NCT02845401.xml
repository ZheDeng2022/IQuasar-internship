  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' research is aimed at developing more effective, finite approaches for&#xD;
      managing individual patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This prospective clinical and&#xD;
      basic scientific study exclusively focuses on patients with the early antigen negative form&#xD;
      of disease, which in developed countries is treated indefinitely with antiviral drugs. The&#xD;
      investigators' study &quot;BeNEG-DO,&quot; directly offers patients who are already taking standard&#xD;
      oral Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) antiviral therapy for at least 192 weeks the option to stop or&#xD;
      continue treatment. Drawing on data from pilot studies, including the investigators' own&#xD;
      University of California, San Francisco and Sutter Institutional Review Board-approved study,&#xD;
      the investigators will examine a finite HBV treatment strategy on clinical outcome and&#xD;
      safety. In conjunction, the investigators will study immunologic mechanisms and gene&#xD;
      expression profiles that correlate with and predict the post-treatment clinical course. The&#xD;
      BeNEG-DO study could seriously question, and potentially change, the current treatment&#xD;
      paradigm for millions of patients with CHB and also lead to new disease-terminating antiviral&#xD;
      therapeutics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective case-control study of safety and clinical outcomes, and of innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immune responses and their genetic predictors, in adult human subjects with HBeAg-CHB who&#xD;
      either continue or stop nucleoside or nucleotide analog (NA) antiviral therapy. Immune&#xD;
      responses will be studied using liver tissue and serial peripheral blood samples. The&#xD;
      immunological factors selected have been chosen based on preliminary and inferential&#xD;
      evidence. Immunologic findings will be correlated with different serologic, virologic and&#xD;
      biochemical outcomes. Genetic predictors of the type of response and respective clinical&#xD;
      outcomes will also be sought.&#xD;
