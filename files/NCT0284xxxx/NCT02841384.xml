      Introduction: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is related to the previous sore knee,&#xD;
      change functionality and postural control deficits. One of the possibilities for pain control&#xD;
      and better positioning of the patella is the rigid bandage patellar widely used by clinicians&#xD;
      and researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the effect of rigid patellar bandage on postural control, pain and&#xD;
      function in sedentary women with PFPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The sample will be composed of 30 volunteers, sedentary, between 18 and 55 years;&#xD;
      randomized group Bandage Functional Rigid (n = 15) and Banding Placebo (n = 15). All fill the&#xD;
      Personal Data Sheet, Visual analog scale Pain Questionnaire Previous Knee Pain Scale; and&#xD;
      will be submitted to analysis of postural control (static and dynamic) and carry out the test&#xD;
      and sit up in pre conditions and post application of the bandage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Expected to observe the effect of rigid patellar bandage in pain, function and&#xD;
      postural control in sedentary women with PFPS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial and blind in the exercise area, postural control and&#xD;
      biomechanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PFPS will be allocated in two groups: PFPS group&#xD;
      with rigid bandage patella (n = 15) and PFPS group with placebo (n = 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: The subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PFPS, will be forwarded to the&#xD;
      evaluation protocols. The data collections will be held at University Hospital Physiotherapy&#xD;
      Division of the State University of Londrina. Individuals respond to a questionnaire to&#xD;
      characterize the sample, EVA and fill the patellofemoral disorders Scale (AKPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Protocol: will be held to familiarize themselves with the equipment and tests&#xD;
      to be used on the force platform and test sitting and standing, voluntary is inserted in one&#xD;
      of the groups (PPS + B or PPS + P) through randomisation previously established by&#xD;
      www.random.org and stored in opaque and sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the participants carry out, random and drawn at the time way, the static and&#xD;
      dynamic tests on the force platform:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Static: The volunteers will stay 30 seconds in one-leg position of the lower limb with pain&#xD;
      with the knee flexed and contralateral suspended to about 90; the test will be performed&#xD;
      three times, with one minute of sitting home. Participants will be instructed to keep aligned&#xD;
      and torso upright during the test and stay as long as possible with most of the plantar&#xD;
      region touching the ground. Will be targeted to fix the look upon in a pre-established and&#xD;
      pasted on the wall point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic Squat: The volunteers will perform three consecutive repetitions of squat exercise,&#xD;
      controlled between about 0 ° to 45 ° of knee flexion in the lower limb with pain. The&#xD;
      contralateral leg should be suspended and flexed to 90 °, the activity will be performed&#xD;
      three times, with one minute rest in the sitting position between each repetition.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to keep aligned and torso upright during the test and stay as&#xD;
      long as possible with most of the plantar region touching the ground. Will be targeted to fix&#xD;
      the look upon in a pre-established and pasted on the wall point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic Up and Down Stairs: The force platform will be positioned at 20 cm from the ground on&#xD;
      a wooden structure. The front is combined with a second step, also with 20 cm high from the&#xD;
      first step, simulating a staircase with two steps of 20 cm each. Voluntary perform the&#xD;
      functional activity of climbing the two steps, starting the first step with the leg with pain&#xD;
      to support the platform. The activity will be carried out three consecutive times, with rest&#xD;
      of a seated minute, and then the voluntary hold the decline in two steps, with lower limb&#xD;
      support with pain on the platform, also performed by three consecutive times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average of the three repetitions of each activity (static and dynamic) will be used for&#xD;
      postural control analysis (COP parameters) for each variable to be analyzed.&#xD;
