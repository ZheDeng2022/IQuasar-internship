  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study for children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) who are eligible based&#xD;
      on their CF gene type. One group will be called the treatment group because they have the&#xD;
      gene type (homozygous F508del) that makes them clinically eligible through their CF care&#xD;
      provider to begin treatment with the new FDA approved CF drug called orkambi. For the control&#xD;
      group, children will be enrolled who have a similar CF gene type (heterozygous F508del) but&#xD;
      are not eligible to be prescribed orkambi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be followed for four visits over about 3 to 4 years to observe changes in&#xD;
      the lungs. Methods to measure the changes in lung disease will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI with non-FDA approved inhaled xenon gas to take detailed images of the lungs, Pulmonary&#xD;
      Function Tests (PFT), Lung Clearance Index (LCI), Baseline CT image of the lungs if not&#xD;
      ordered as part of usual clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first two visits will be done before starting clinical treatment with orkambi and will be&#xD;
      a minimum of 28 days apart and up to 18 months. The third visit will be scheduled about 3&#xD;
      months after starting orkambi and the fourth visit about 18 months later. For the control&#xD;
      group, the timing of visits will be similar to treatment group and visits may be scheduled&#xD;
      around annual CF care visits.&#xD;

      This is a controlled observational longitudinal study designed to capture Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy naive Cystic Fibrosis (CF)&#xD;
      subjects with F508del(+/+) mutations before they age into the FDA approved treatment window&#xD;
      for the CFTR modulator orkambi (ivacaftor/lumacaftor). These subjects will be compared to&#xD;
      disease controls. The treatment group will be observed twice (at least 28 days apart and up&#xD;
      to 18 months) before clinically starting orkambi and observed twice (at about 3 months and&#xD;
      about 18 months) after clinically starting orkambi .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study takes advantage of the timely development of Ultrashort Echo Time Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (UTE MRI), Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) MRI, Lung Clearance Index (LCI),&#xD;
      and the approval of F508del CFTR-directed CF therapy in children. The proposal will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) validate the emerging biomarker (UTE MRI) within CF children independent of genotype, ii)&#xD;
      define the trajectory of UTE MRI and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) changes&#xD;
      before and after initiating orkambi therapy compared with age-matched CF controls, and iii)&#xD;
      determine the relationships between regional structural abnormalities (UTE MRI) and regional&#xD;
      (129Xe MRI) and global (LCI) functional measures of ventilation. Results will establish MRI&#xD;
      as a sensitive lung imaging tool that is translatable to all CF centers and can be applied&#xD;
      throughout the lifespan of CF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CF patients with one or two copies of the F508del CFTR mutation who are 6-12 years old will&#xD;
      undergo UTE MRI soon after a clinical computerized tomography (CT) scan, with disease&#xD;
      quantification using an established scoring system for both modalities. Quantitative imaging&#xD;
      data and LCI will be compared with spirometry (gold standard for CF lung disease) and&#xD;
      clinical predictors of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The F508del(+/+) patient cohort will differ genotypically from the control cohort&#xD;
      (F508del[+/-]). All patients in the F508del(+/-) cohort will be pancreatic insufficient and&#xD;
      also have a nonfunctional second allele (Class I or II mutation, not candidates for modulator&#xD;
      therapy). These two cohorts are phenotypically indistinguishable without modulator treatment,&#xD;
      and therefore the untreated cohort will serve as an ideal age and time-matched control group&#xD;
      for the F508del(+/+) subjects who clinically initiate orkambi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease trajectories in the two groups, as quantified by changes in pulmonary UTE MRI, will&#xD;
      be compared with FEV1. MRI analysis will include quantitative and reader-based &quot;Brody&quot;&#xD;
      scoring for the whole lung, lung lobes, and for subcategories of the Brody scoring system (in&#xD;
      particular bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, and mucus plugging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal study will capture both cohorts at their scheduled annual CF visits when&#xD;
      possible over about 4 years with modifications to the timeline for the treatment group based&#xD;
      on when they are clinically scheduled to begin orkambi treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As FDA approved indications for orkambi change, subjects in the F508del(+/+) cohort will&#xD;
      become candidates for modulators prior to their 12th birthday. The FDA is currently reviewing&#xD;
      for approval in Fall 2016 to lower the prescribing age to 6 years and the investigators will&#xD;
      be enrolling to meet the changes at that time.&#xD;
