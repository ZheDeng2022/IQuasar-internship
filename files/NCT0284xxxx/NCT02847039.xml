  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project aims to try to answer the many questions raised by the identification of&#xD;
      new early repolarization syndrome. The questions are varied with both taking optimal clinical&#xD;
      management of patients, the frequency and significance of this anomaly in the population on&#xD;
      the electrophysiological and molecular basis responsible for this electrocardiographic&#xD;
      abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To try to answer these many questions, the approach will be twofold: clinical and genetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of a clinical database containing information of patients who have been&#xD;
           identified as carriers of the anomaly based on the initial clinical presentation in&#xD;
           order to determine their prognoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiological approach will be based on a molecular approach to identify genetic&#xD;
           abnormalities may be involved in this syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 asymptomatic patients and an unlimited number of patients who presented syncope or&#xD;
           aborted sudden death will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample (15 ml) will be performed at inclusion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of early repolarization aspect, determined by the J point elevation of at&#xD;
             least 0.1 mV above the isoelectric line, with or without extra-ST segment elevation in&#xD;
             at least two leads and / or lateral.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parameters ECG D2 level of the bypass measurable for the presence of long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Late potentials ventricular analyzable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with ventricular fibrillation, negative search for other causes of&#xD;
             ventricular fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with syncope, clinical assessment should included at a minimum,&#xD;
             performing a cardiac ultrasound and a stress test.&#xD;
