    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using e-cigarettes (ECIG) rather than regular&#xD;
      tobacco cigarettes alters lung inflammation in people with and without HIV. The study is also&#xD;
      interested in asking subjects their opinion on the use of ECIG and how they make them feel.&#xD;
      This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat asthma or HIV or to&#xD;
      modify tobacco use.&#xD;

      Title: Effects of e-cigarettes (ECIGs) on pulmonary inflammation and behavior in HIV infected&#xD;
      smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the Study: Even though smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and&#xD;
      deaths in the U.S., millions of Americans continue to smoke cigarettes, including 16% of&#xD;
      persons in the general population and 40-70% of all HIV-infected patients. In contrast to the&#xD;
      relatively known adverse effects of combustible cigarettes, the rapid emergence of&#xD;
      e-cigarettes have raised numerous questions regarding their health effects which may be&#xD;
      amplified in vulnerable populations and those already immunocompromised such as HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients. The goal of the proposed research is to gain an understanding of the cellular and&#xD;
      inflammatory mechanisms that occur in the lung of HIV-infected smokers who transition from&#xD;
      conventional tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes and to characterize their behavioral and&#xD;
      neurocognitive effects. These efforts will provide first in kind data on the effects of ECIGs&#xD;
      in this study population and provide valuable data to develop needed regulatory policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background &amp; Significance: While rates of cigarette smoking are gradually decreasing in the&#xD;
      US, the burden of tobacco abuse among people living with HIV remains undisputedly high with&#xD;
      prevalence estimates two to three times higher than the general population (42.4% vs. 16%).&#xD;
      Although ECIGs likely contain significantly fewer numbers of toxicants compared to&#xD;
      combustible cigarettes, it is not yet clear whether ECIG are less harmful than their&#xD;
      traditional tobacco counterparts and what, if any, effects they have on behavior and&#xD;
      neurocognitive functioning. The biological effects of ECIG on lung health have not yet been&#xD;
      sufficiently characterized due the relatively nascent nature of the field. While combustible&#xD;
      tobacco use induces oxidant stress in the airways of healthy smokers, little work to date has&#xD;
      established the effect of ECIG use on oxidant stress in human airways. Transitioning the&#xD;
      smoker from combustible tobacco to ECIG may decrease lung oxidative stress, improve lung&#xD;
      function and decrease withdrawal symptoms and deficits in neurocognition commonly seen with&#xD;
      tobacco withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Procedures: 15 HIV-infected adults will be recruited from the Duke Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Clinic. In addition, 5 HIV-negative adults will be recruited from the community&#xD;
      through flyers. For this pilot study, 15 willing subjects will receive ECIGs and 5 control&#xD;
      subjects will continue to smoke their chosen usual brand of combustible cigarettes (UB). Each&#xD;
      group will receive either ECIG or UB for a total of 4 weeks and undergo pulmonary and&#xD;
      behavioral assessments during this period. In order to examine pulmonary and behavioral&#xD;
      effects of ECIG in the absence of combustible cigarette use, a mobile contingency management&#xD;
      (mCM) procedure will be used to provide monetary reinforcement for biochemically verified&#xD;
      discontinuation of the use of combustible cigarettes. Participants in the UB group will also&#xD;
      undergo mCM procedures, but contingencies will differ. After 4 weeks, the ECIG group will be&#xD;
      allowed to transition back to their chosen combustible cigarette product for an additional 2&#xD;
      weeks with additional pulmonary and behavioral assessments. All subjects will undergo three&#xD;
      respiratory assessments in the Duke Clinical Research Unit (DCRU). The first respiratory&#xD;
      assessment will occur at study arm assignment (V1) to establish baseline measures of lung&#xD;
      function, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation. Pulmonary assessments will be repeated&#xD;
      again 4 weeks after transition to ECIG or continued UB use (V4). A final respiratory&#xD;
      assessment (V5) will occur 2 weeks after stopping ECIG or after 6 weeks of continued UB use&#xD;
      to measure changes relative to baseline lung function, oxidative stress, and inflammation.&#xD;
      Neuro-cognitive and behavioral visits will take place in Duke South or at the Center for&#xD;
      Addiction Science and Technology (CfAST) and occur at Visit 2 (mCM transition), and&#xD;
      respiratory visits (V4 &amp; V5) as well as 2 weeks after ECIG transition/ continued UB use (V3)&#xD;

    <description>mCM procedures are a novel smoking cessation tool previously used in the field by our colleagues in the Beckham research group. This equipment is part of a procedure called &quot;mobile contingency management&quot; or &quot;mCM&quot;. The participant will use a study smartphone to record his/her CO levels and moods at random times of the day and to verify his/her cigarette usage. The mCM program will reward the participant for each CO level and data transmitted to the study team. The study team will provide detailed information and training to allow them to participate in this part of the study.</description>
