  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax work in&#xD;
      treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma or Richter&#xD;
      syndrome that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab and obinutuzumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving atezolizumab, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax may&#xD;
      work better in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic&#xD;
      lymphoma, or Richter syndrome.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with obinutuzumab and venetoclax&#xD;
      in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/Richter&#xD;
      transformation (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of atezolizumab combined with obinutuzumab and venetoclax in&#xD;
      patients with CLL/SLL/RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR), duration of&#xD;
      response (DOR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negative remission rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To determine the overall survival&#xD;
      (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine immunological and molecular features, at baseline and/or that change with&#xD;
      treatment, that correlate with outcomes in patients treated with atezolizumab combined with&#xD;
      obinutuzumab and venetoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days 1, 2, 8,&#xD;
      and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-9 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days&#xD;
      3-4 of cycle 1 and on days 1-2 of cycles 2-9. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 9 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 3, patients also&#xD;
      receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 14 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously IV over 4-6 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and&#xD;
      15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-9 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 3-4&#xD;
      of cycle 1 and on days 1-2 of cycles 2-9. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 9 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 2, patients receive&#xD;
      venetoclax PO on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 25 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.&#xD;
