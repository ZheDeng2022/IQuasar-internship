      This is a post-authorization, retrospective multicentre observational nationwide study&#xD;
      (PAS-OD). It will be conducted by reviewing medical records and database of patients who&#xD;
      participated in the validation of the psychometric properties of the GAH study&#xD;
      (CEL-GAH-2011-01). In all cases, only data prior to the start date of the study will be&#xD;
      collected to ensure its retrospective nature, thereby reflecting routine clinical practice&#xD;
      and non-interference in the physician's clinical practice&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients over 65 are the most prevalent population in oncological clinical practice. It is&#xD;
      also expected that this group of patients will increase significantly in the coming decades&#xD;
      as a result of increased life expectancy and the aging population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the population is aging and this aging is accompanied by an increase in the&#xD;
      prevalence and incidence of age-related diseases, such as cancer. So much so that&#xD;
      approximately 60% of new cancer cases and 70% of the overall cancer mortality occurs in&#xD;
      patients aged 65 and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the high incidence of cancer in the elderly and its peculiarities as opposed to young&#xD;
      patients, from the point of view of health, the management of elderly patients is especially&#xD;
      complex because there are few data on the evaluation and treatment thereof. Often, older&#xD;
      patients are underrepresented in clinical trials and treatment guidelines, resulting in a&#xD;
      population that is undertreated or at greater risk of suffering treatment-related toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this respect, both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the International&#xD;
      Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG, its acronym in Spanish) agree that age should not be an&#xD;
      impediment to treat these diseases. Optimal management requires strategies specifically&#xD;
      directed to the clinical and biological characteristics of this type of patient and they&#xD;
      recommend an appropriate assessment of the patient as part of a safe and effective approach&#xD;
      to haematological malignancies in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is scientific basis supporting the need for the elderly patient with cancer who will&#xD;
      receive a particular treatment to be specifically assessed by means of a comprehensive&#xD;
      geriatric assessment (CGA). Geriatric assessment is essential since it is a tool that&#xD;
      integrates all aspects of the patient's life that could affect the course of the disease and&#xD;
      response to treatment, such as functional status, comorbidities, cognitive, emotional or&#xD;
      nutritional status and social environment. In addition, the CGA is a tool to identify the&#xD;
      possible presence of fragility, characterized by a decrease in physiological reserves that&#xD;
      conditions a lower response to stress and is associated with a lower risk of disability and&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although currently it is assumed that chronological age is not synonymous with biological&#xD;
      age, the decision on cancer treatment often falls on the subjective assessment of the&#xD;
      physician, as few healthcare centres are performing comprehensive geriatric assessment in the&#xD;
      oncology setting. Although various tools have been developed for this purpose, they have not&#xD;
      been incorporated into routine clinical practice due to the time required, their length and&#xD;
      the resources needed to gather information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there remains a need to find a scale for comprehensive assessment of the health&#xD;
      status of elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with haematologic malignancies that incorporates the&#xD;
      essential dimensions of the geriatric assessment, with the same precision of valid tools&#xD;
      currently available, and that is simple, straightforward and easy to apply, so that it can be&#xD;
      used in daily practice and assist to make clinical decisions objectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was hypothesized that a simplified geriatric assessment could be a better tool for&#xD;
      assessing elderly patients, instead of considering only age or subjective clinical&#xD;
      impression, when deciding whether or not to prescribe active treatment. Such a tool would&#xD;
      represent the real and multidimensional nature of aging, which is associated with an&#xD;
      increased incidence of chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes with consequences on&#xD;
      vulnerability and patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above, Bonanad et al. designed and developed a new comprehensive assessment&#xD;
      scale aimed at elderly patients (≥ 65 years) diagnosed with haematological diseases&#xD;
      [myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) and&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (LLC)], the Geriatric Assessment in Haematology (GAH). The&#xD;
      purpose of this scale is to help doctors identify objectively and reliably those elderly&#xD;
      patients with haematological diseases who are eligible for intensive treatment versus those&#xD;
      who are most vulnerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GAH scale is a tool of 30 items grouped into eight relevant dimensions of geriatric&#xD;
      assessment, which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of drugs: Polypharmacy has been associated with adverse effects related to&#xD;
           frailty, disability, mortality and falls in the elderly, and it may be more frequent in&#xD;
           elderly patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gait velocity: Determining the time taken to walk four meters at a normal pace is a&#xD;
           method of assessing gait velocity that is widely used in the literature due to its&#xD;
           simplicity, speed and reliability. There is sufficient evidence to consider walking&#xD;
           speed as a strong and consistent predictor of adverse outcomes in older patients, and&#xD;
           its use as a single item has proven to be at least as sensitive as compound instruments&#xD;
           in predicting most of these results long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mood: We propose as a screening test for depression a single item extracted from the&#xD;
           Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), widely used for its validity&#xD;
           and reliability. This unique and simple measure of depression was shown to be strongly&#xD;
           correlated with a clinical diagnosis of depression; it detects patients rarely or&#xD;
           sometimes depressed and patients depressed occasionally or much of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Activities of daily living: The assessment of functional status in older people should&#xD;
           include assessment of so-called basic activities of daily living (ADLs), including the&#xD;
           skills necessary for life such as dressing, grooming, bathing and feeding. ADL is a tool&#xD;
           that has been used as a predictor of hospitalization and mortality in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To develop the activities of daily living (ADL) of the GAH scale, items were selected&#xD;
           from the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) with two additional questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjective health status: The patient rating his or her own health is another worthwhile&#xD;
           parameter. This is why a self-rated health item was also selected, also included in the&#xD;
           Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13). Recently it has been determined that this is a&#xD;
           predictive parameter of functional impairment or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Nutrition: Nutritional deficit is a common serious problem in elderly patients,&#xD;
           contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality associated with this group of&#xD;
           people. To determine this dimension, some items were selected from the short version of&#xD;
           the full questionnaire, Mini-Nutritional Assessment. This tool was developed and&#xD;
           validated in representative samples of older patients worldwide and it identifies&#xD;
           subjects at nutritional risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Mental State: To evaluate mental state, all the items were selected that make up the&#xD;
           Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). It is designed and validated to&#xD;
           assess four aspects of intellectual functioning: short and long-term memory,&#xD;
           orientation, information on daily events and computing ability. It has been observed&#xD;
           that cognitive impairment is also an independent predictor of mortality and the end of&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Comorbidity: Six variables of comorbidity and habits were considered (diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
           cancer, lung disease, heart failure, smoking), drawn from the Prognostic Index for&#xD;
           4-year Mortality in Older Adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final score of the GAH scale has not yet been defined. At present, for purely exploratory&#xD;
      purposes, each of the dimensions was assigned a dichotomous score (0 or 1), generating a&#xD;
      provisional score ranging from 0 (best possible health status) to 8 (worst health status).&#xD;
      The recently published study showed that the GAH scale is a measuring instrument that meets&#xD;
      the expected psychometric properties (feasibility, ceiling-floor effect, reliability and&#xD;
      validity) for a tool to determine health status in elderly patients with haematological&#xD;
      diseases. Also, it has been determined that this scale is sensitive to change &lt;pending&#xD;
      (reference short report)&gt;, since it is able to detect changes in the health status of&#xD;
      patients after a certain time and is able to predict survival in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the weights of each of the dimensions of the GAH scale, as well&#xD;
      as cut-off points for the final score of the scale that will be used to predict treatment&#xD;
      tolerability in elderly patients diagnosed with MDS/ AML, MM or CLL (chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia).&#xD;
