  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ActionHealthNYC program is a year-long demonstration program to improve access to high&#xD;
      quality health care for NYC resident immigrants who do not qualify for public insurance with&#xD;
      incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether improved access and care coordination services provided through the&#xD;
      ActionHealth NYC program allows participants to have easier access to healthcare&#xD;
      (particularly primary care and preventive services) than non-participants.&#xD;

      The ActionHealthNYC program is a year-long demonstration program to improve access to high&#xD;
      quality health care for NYC resident immigrants who do not qualify for public insurance with&#xD;
      incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Our goal in piloting the program&#xD;
      and conducting the research study is to understand the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For clients participating in the ActionHealthNYC program, do they report having easier&#xD;
           access to health care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the differences in health care utilization for participants in the&#xD;
           ActionHealthNYC program and those not in the program?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do the participants in the ActionHealthNYC program report fewer barriers to needed care&#xD;
           when compared to those not in the program?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the participants in the ActionHealthNYC program more likely to have received&#xD;
           preventive services according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force&#xD;
           (USPTF) or recommended services for those with a qualifying condition through their&#xD;
           medical home?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How does the likelihood of receiving a new diagnosis compare between the ActionHealthNYC&#xD;
           member group and the study group?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How does emergency department and hospital use compare between the ActionHealthNYC&#xD;
           member group and the study group?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where we will be enrolling 2,400&#xD;
      people that meet the eligibility criteria and randomizing half into the ActionHealth NYC&#xD;
      program. We will be employing a mixed methods approach to address differences between&#xD;
      participants randomized to receive enhanced services through ActionHealthNYC (AHNYC) and&#xD;
      those receiving usual care, utilizing surveys, secondary data analysis, key informant&#xD;
      interviews and participant focus groups.&#xD;
