  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only a small proportion of patients with biliary obstruction caused by hepatopancreatobiliary&#xD;
      malignancies are suitable for surgical resection. Therefore, most patients with malignant&#xD;
      biliary obstruction will need palliation of their obstructive jaundice to relieve the&#xD;
      symptoms and prevent life threatening complications such as biliary sepsis. The endoscopic or&#xD;
      percutaneous/transhepatic routes, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography&#xD;
      (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and stents are accepted&#xD;
      approaches for the relief of jaundice in malignant biliary obstruction. Improvement in the&#xD;
      bilirubin level is also essential before palliative chemotherapy is considered in these&#xD;
      patients. However, tumor ingrowth still remains a major cause of obstruction. In this trial,&#xD;
      the investigators will use HabibTM EndoHPB (EMcision Ltd., UK) catheter which was used for&#xD;
      the endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment as a form of neoadjuvant therapy in&#xD;
      hepatopancreatobiliary adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HabibTM EndoHPB (EMcision Ltd., UK) catheter which was used for the endobiliary&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment is an endoscopic bipolar catheter designed to ablate&#xD;
      tissue in malignant tumors within luminal structures. HabibTM EndoHPB has Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) and European Conformity approval for such indications. It has also&#xD;
      approved by Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2016. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      perform intra-luminal RFA for 20 inoperable patients with malignant biliary stenosis. HabibTM&#xD;
      EndoHPB will be deployed via an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) route.&#xD;
      By using radiofrequency energy to heat the tissue in the duct prior to insertion of the&#xD;
      stent, the surrounding tissue becomes coagulated and this may delay tumor growth and the time&#xD;
      before the stent lumen becomes occluded. If stent occlusion occurs in a participant during&#xD;
      the follow up period, the participant will be reassessed and investigations will be used to&#xD;
      determine cause of stent occlusion and whether it is appropriate to repeat RFA treatment. The&#xD;
      aim will be to detect an improvement in survival and safety in the treated patients compared&#xD;
      to patient receiving palliative treatment recorded in literatures.&#xD;
