      The study entitled 'Effect of maternal hemoglobin on neurobehavioral development of late&#xD;
      preterm neonates' was done with an objective to determine whether low maternal hemoglobin&#xD;
      (&lt;11gm/dl), in late preterm neonates(&gt;34weeks but less than 37weeks gestational age)&#xD;
      correlates with poor neurobehavioral outcome using the Neurobehavioral Assessment of Preterm&#xD;
      Infants(NAPI) tool, thereby allowing for earlier rehabilitative intervention to be undertaken&#xD;
      to improve their long term outcomes and to generate useful data on a previously well&#xD;
      recognised but under researched entity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prevalence of anemia in India is among the highest in the world. A high proportion of women&#xD;
      in both industrialized and developing countries become anemic during pregnancy. The major&#xD;
      concern about the adverse effects of anemia on pregnant women and their offsprings is the&#xD;
      belief that this population is at a greater risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Apart&#xD;
      from this, it is well known that anemia per se is associated with higher incidence of&#xD;
      premature births and low birth weight babies. Infants with iron deficiency anemia have&#xD;
      significantly lower motor and mental scores and decreased language capabilities and body&#xD;
      balance-coordination skills. Such infants also have a decreased learning ability. Iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia during the developmental stage can lead to reduced myelination of the&#xD;
      spinal cord, as well as a change in myelin composition; abnormalities in neurotransmitters'&#xD;
      metabolism and alteration in brain energy metabolism. The Neurobehavioral Assessments of&#xD;
      Preterm Infants (NAPI) is a research tool to monitor the developmental progress and&#xD;
      differential maturity of preterm infants ranging between 32weeks and 37weeks (full term).&#xD;
      This test is used to identify persistent lags in development, as a research tool to assess&#xD;
      effects of interventions and to study individual differences and basic developmental&#xD;
      questions. The reliability and clinical validity of this test has been thoroughly&#xD;
      investigated and normative data has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective - To evaluate the neurobehavioral development at 37weeks of post conceptional age&#xD;
      in late preterm infants born to mothers with hemoglobin &lt;11gm/dl; by a standardised scale -&#xD;
      Neurobehavioral Assessment of Preterm Infants (NAPI).&#xD;
