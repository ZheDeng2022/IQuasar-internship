      Despite being effective in weight reduction in severely obese patients, bariatric surgery&#xD;
      (BS) negatively influences bone metabolism and increases the risk of falls thereby&#xD;
      potentially increasing the risk of fracture. The mechanisms of BS induced bone loss are&#xD;
      unknown but may be related to calcium and vitamin D malabsorption, changes in the energy&#xD;
      regulation metabolism and gastrointestinal hormonal physiology. Since the etiology of BS&#xD;
      induced bone loss is largely unknown, treatment relies mostly on calcium and vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation, which provide little benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is an effective strategy to prevent bone mass losses in several health conditions.&#xD;
      However, no study so far has examined the effects of an exercise-training program in the&#xD;
      prevention of BS induced bone loss. The investigators main goal is to investigate the effects&#xD;
      on bone metabolism and fracture risk of an exercise-training program specifically tailored to&#xD;
      improve bone health and balance of patients that underwent BS. The investigators will perform&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial on obese patients (n=80; BMI&gt;40 Kg.m-2) elected to BS. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned into 2 groups i) a group receiving standard follow-up and medical&#xD;
      care, or ii) a group that will undergo a 11 months' Exercise Training program designed to&#xD;
      improve bone health and reduce fall risk plus the standard follow-up and medical care. All&#xD;
      patients will be assessed i) before the surgery, ii) one month, iii) 6 months, and iv) 12&#xD;
      months after the surgery. Assessments include: biochemical markers of bone turnover (BTM),&#xD;
      BMD, bone tissue biomechanical properties, hormones involved in the regulation of energy,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and bone metabolism, body composition, BMI, nutritional intake, balance,&#xD;
      muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness and daily physical activity. These evaluations&#xD;
      will allow the investigators to understand the effects of an exercise-training program on&#xD;
      bone metabolism of BS patients, contributing also to further elucidate the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying BS induced bone loss and fracture risk increase. The investigators will use&#xD;
      established methods in the literature as well as novel procedures, which will enable them to&#xD;
      overcome some of the limitations of previous studies. At the end of the study the&#xD;
      investigators expect to have collected consistent data about whether an exercise-training&#xD;
      program is or is not able to effectively prevent BS induced bone losses and fracture risk&#xD;
      increases.&#xD;

      The investigators main goal is to determine if an Exercise-Training Intervention program&#xD;
      (ETI) tailored to improve bone health, strength and balance, is effective in preventing&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) induced fracture risk. To achieve this the investigators will&#xD;
      perform a randomized clinical trial (RCT) on volunteer obese patients (BMI&gt;35 Kg.m-2)&#xD;
      undergoing RYGB that will be followed for 13-months (Figure 1). The patients will be&#xD;
      recruited, operated and will receive follow-up medical care in the Department of General&#xD;
      Surgery from the Centro Hospitalar de São João E.P.E (DSHSJ). After being elected for RYGB&#xD;
      and if inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, patients who decide to join the study will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either i) participate in a 11 months duration ETI tailored to improve&#xD;
      bone health and reduce fall risk in addition to the standard follow-up medical care (MFU)&#xD;
      (ETI+MFU group), or ii) will receive only MFU (control group). Recruiting patients from only&#xD;
      one institution will increase the likelihood of all patients receiving the same surgical and&#xD;
      MFU care, reducing the bias related to the use of different clinical protocols. The option to&#xD;
      include only RYGB is also to reduce the bias associated with the surgical technique.&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the ETI+MFU group will undergo an exercise-training program of 11&#xD;
      months duration, 3 sessions/week, and 60 minutes/session, starting one month after the&#xD;
      surgery. Each exercise session will be supervised and will include 5 major components: i)&#xD;
      warm-up, ii) multidirectional jumps, iii) balance, iv) strength and, v) cool down. This&#xD;
      structure is planned to meet two main objectives: i) enhance bone formation and, ii) reduce&#xD;
      fall risk by improving muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness and balance. The ETI will&#xD;
      last almost 1 year because the effects of BS on bone metabolism have been shown to be&#xD;
      greatest during the first postoperative year (1). As the investigators main objective is to&#xD;
      understand, in a broad perspective, the possible therapeutic benefits that an ETI has on the&#xD;
      BS patient bone health and fracture risk, the plan is to investigate several variables in&#xD;
      this study (bone turnover markers, bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), body&#xD;
      composition, body mass index (BMI), nutritional intake, static balance, dynamic balance,&#xD;
      muscle strength of the lower limbs and trunk, daily physical activity, cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness, bone derived hormones, hormones involved in phosphate and calcium metabolism,&#xD;
      adipokines, gastrointestinal and energy-metabolism hormones and gonadal hormones). These will&#xD;
      enable the investigators to comprehensively understand the metabolic changes following BS&#xD;
      that might affect bone health, and how can exercise influence those changes potentially&#xD;
      preventing fracture risk increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be assessed 4 times during the study (Figure 1). Each assay will match the&#xD;
      monitoring protocols already scheduled by the DSHSJ for all patients undergoing BS. The 1st&#xD;
      evaluation will occur prior to BS, to gather pre-surgical state. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th&#xD;
      evaluations will occur in the 1st (before the beginning of the exercise-training program for&#xD;
      the patients allocated to the exercise intervention group), 6th and 12th months after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, respectively. The variables analyzed at each time point fit into four&#xD;
      major categories: i) bone quality surrogates (BTM, BMD, bone biomechanical properties); ii)&#xD;
      anthropometry (weight, height, body composition, nutritional intake; iii) fall risk (static&#xD;
      and dynamic balance, muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, daily physical activity),&#xD;
      iv) hormones involved in calcium, bone and gastro-intestinal metabolism. Biochemical analysis&#xD;
      will be performed in blood samples collected during follow up hospital visits. Biochemical&#xD;
      markers of bone turnover (BTM) reflect the degree of bone remodeling and the balance between&#xD;
      formation and resorption and are therefore surrogates of fracture risk. As BS profoundly&#xD;
      affects body composition, gastrointestinal and energy-regulation physiology, and because&#xD;
      adipose tissue and gut-associated hormones also influence bone metabolism, the investigators&#xD;
      will determine how these hormones are affected by RYGB and exercise. By monitoring these&#xD;
      variables the investigators will gain insight on the etiological mechanisms associated with&#xD;
      BS induced bone loss and the therapeutic effects of exercise. BS also leads to a reduction in&#xD;
      calcium and vitamin D absorption, which may result in increased bone resorption. The&#xD;
      investigators will therefore also monitor Vitamin D, Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), calcium and&#xD;
      phosphorous concentrations to determine how they are influenced by the ETI. Despite&#xD;
      mechanical unloading due to the weight loss may contribute to bone loss following BS, there&#xD;
      is no data supporting this mechanism. To investigate this relation, the investigators will&#xD;
      also monitor serum sclerostin, a protein released by osteocytes in response to mechanical&#xD;
      unloading that negatively regulates bone formation. To determine the effects of BS and&#xD;
      exercise on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue mass, the investigators will measure body&#xD;
      composition and BMI in all patients. As one of the investigators main goal is to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of the ETI on fall risk, they also plan to determine the cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness and muscle strength in these patients since these variables have been previously&#xD;
      shown to influence fall risk. Daily physical activity and nutritional intake will also be&#xD;
      determined by accelerometer and food diary, respectively, in order to control for confounding&#xD;
      variables. Despite the several caveats associated with the determination of BMD by DXA, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to analyze this variable, as it will provide data that will enable them to&#xD;
      compare their results with the results from previous studies. Nevertheless, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to complement this information with the direct assessment of bone biomechanical&#xD;
      properties, which until recently was only available in in vitro studies due to the invasive&#xD;
      nature of the procedure. Bone micro-indentation is a newer technique that allows measuring&#xD;
      bone tissue mechanical properties in the clinical setting, which reflects with higher&#xD;
      accuracy the bone resistance to fracture (6). One of the main outcomes in this research is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of BS on fall risk, as there is almost no data on this issue. This&#xD;
      will be accomplished by direct determination of static and dynamic balance by means of using&#xD;
      a forces platform. By analyzing this broad set of parameters the investigators plan to&#xD;
      contribute with a more thorough understanding of the effects of BS on bone metabolism and,&#xD;
      most importantly, how can an exercise training program, specifically tailored to improve bone&#xD;
      health and balance, can reduce the risk of bone fractures in these patients. Only by&#xD;
      analyzing this broad number of parameters will the investigators be able to control the&#xD;
      several confounding variables and gain deeper insight into the effects of BS and exercise on&#xD;
      the bone metabolism of these patients, thereby contributing with a potently useful strategy&#xD;
      for the management of skeletal health in BS patients.&#xD;
