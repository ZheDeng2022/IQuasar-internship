  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the current 6-month study is to determine the effect of an integrated,&#xD;
      comprehensive, individualized, intervention program including dietary, exercise, pharmacy,&#xD;
      and behavioral counseling on patient performance of the short physical performance battery&#xD;
      (SPPB) which gives an indication of an individual's ability to perform activities of daily&#xD;
      living dependent upon lower extremity function. Additional objectives include the impact of&#xD;
      the intervention on cardiovascular risk factors, and the impact of the intervention on other&#xD;
      indices of physical function in stage 3-4 CKD patients. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients who participate in this integrated, intensive, individualized lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      will have higher SPPB scores compared to individuals in the usual care group. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that this approach will lead to higher adherence rates to the&#xD;
      lifestyle recommendations and that those who adhere will also show better improvements in the&#xD;
      measured variables over time compared to patients who are randomly assigned to the usual care&#xD;
      group or who comply poorly with the various study components.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be advertised at Renal and Transplant Associates of New England (RTANE) and&#xD;
      interested patients will be screened and cleared by nephrologists from RTANE to make sure&#xD;
      that they do not have any contraindications to exercise as described by the American College&#xD;
      of Sports Medicine. Those patients who are eligible (stage 3-4, eGFRs 15-59 ml/min/1.73m2) to&#xD;
      participate, and who want to be involved , will be asked to read and sign a consent form,&#xD;
      which had been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Springfield&#xD;
      College. This signing will take place at RTANE prior to coming to the College.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be randomly assigned to either the lifestyle intervention group or the usual&#xD;
      care group. During the course of the study, serum potassium levels will be monitored on a&#xD;
      monthly basis in all patients. For individuals randomized to the intervention group, if their&#xD;
      levels are greater than 5.2 mEq/L, these patients will be prescribed Veltassa according to&#xD;
      the recommended dosing scheme. Individuals randomized to the usual care group will be under&#xD;
      the care of their physicians and will receive the current standard of care. They will be able&#xD;
      to take Veltassa, if prescribed by their physician, but this will not be required by the&#xD;
      study protocol. At baseline, and at month 6, when the blood samples are taken for potassium&#xD;
      assessment, some of the sample will also be used for the assessment of other biomarkers that&#xD;
      will be tracked in this study (e.g., phosphorus, inflammatory markers, etc) After 6 months of&#xD;
      participation in the study, individuals will be retested with the same protocols used at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretest instructions: Following the signing of the consent form, patients will be given&#xD;
      instructions as to how to complete a 3-day diet log. Patients will be asked to complete the&#xD;
      Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale (EBBS) and they will be expected to send these completed&#xD;
      forms to the faculty at Springfield College prior to arriving at the College for their&#xD;
      day-long program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program Day: Patients will be expected to come to Springfield College on a Saturday and&#xD;
      participate in the program from 8:45 am to approximately 4 PM depending upon their group&#xD;
      assignment. Upon arrival at the College, participants will be asked to have all the&#xD;
      medications and over-the-counter drugs documented by clinical Pharm D researchers. Any&#xD;
      participants who had not previously submitted their dietary information prior to coming will&#xD;
      be asked to submit their logs at that time and a member of the research team will take their&#xD;
      records and analyze them during the time while they are undergoing the other assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the morning period all patients are assessed for the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometrics: Anthropometric measurements including height and weight will be taken. Waist&#xD;
      girth will be assessed using a tension tape measure (Gulick) while body composition will be&#xD;
      assessed using bioelectric impedance analysis (Tanita, model BC-418).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular assessments: Prior to performing any activity assessment for the day, patients&#xD;
      will have their resting blood pressure determined, in their dominant arm, using a calibrated&#xD;
      automated sphygmomanometer (Tango, Sun Tech Medical, Morrisville, NC). They will also have&#xD;
      pulse wave analysis (PWA) performed on them using a Sphymocor machine (EXCEL). This will give&#xD;
      information about their augmentation index (a measure of arterial stiffness), along with a&#xD;
      measure of their central blood pressure and pulse pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Movement Screen (FMS): Each participant will be assessed on their ability to&#xD;
      perform each of the following movements without restriction: deep squat, active straight leg&#xD;
      raise, shoulder mobility, trunk stability push up. A score is assigned based upon how well&#xD;
      these movements are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional tests: Following the anthropometric assessments, a series of functional tests will&#xD;
      be administered. The six minute walk test will be performed with each participant according&#xD;
      to American Thoracic Society guidelines. A 20-meter, flat hallway will be used as the course&#xD;
      with cones set at each end as a marker. Every 3 feet will be marked along the course. Chairs&#xD;
      will be available to the participants at both ends of the course, as well as the middle&#xD;
      distance mark. Participants will be instructed to complete the most distance in the time&#xD;
      allotted, only walking. At each minute, the participants will be told &quot;You are doing well,&#xD;
      you have 5 (4, 3, 2, 1) minutes to go.&quot; When 15 seconds are left, the participants will be&#xD;
      told to wait for a &quot;Stop&quot; command and instructed to stop wherever they are on the course. The&#xD;
      partial lap distance will then be recorded and added to the total lap distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sit-to-stand-to-sit test will also be used for all participants. A sturdy, armless chair&#xD;
      with a height of 43.7 cm will be used. Each participant will be instructed to fold their&#xD;
      hands over their chest and complete one practice sit-to-stand-to-sit. It will be made clear&#xD;
      that no hands are allowed to be used. Then, each participant will be instructed to sit up and&#xD;
      down ten times as fast as they can and the time to complete this will be recorded in seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score will be created by summation of the scores&#xD;
      for tests of standing balance, gait speed, and rising from a chair 5 times. The SPPB has been&#xD;
      shown to have excellent reliability and predictive validity for a number of outcomes&#xD;
      including mortality, onset of disability, and institutionalization, and has been used in&#xD;
      large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials and observational studies as a primary&#xD;
      outcome and for screening purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grip Strength: Grip strength will be assessed using a Jamar hand held dynamometer.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to sit in a chair while flexing their dominant arm to a 90° angle.&#xD;
      The dynamometer will be fitted to each individual's hand and then each participant will be&#xD;
      asked to exert maximal effort three times. The highest recorded score (in kg) will be used in&#xD;
      statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength/Power Assessments: Baseline strength and power will also be assessed with the&#xD;
      dominant leg (quadriceps and hamstrings) using isokinetic dynamometry (Biodex). The purpose&#xD;
      of the test will be explained to the participants. Each participant will then be strapped&#xD;
      into the seat securely using chest straps, a lap strap and leg strap. The straps are to&#xD;
      ensure no accessory muscles are used during the test. The participant will then be adjusted&#xD;
      into the machine so that the fulcrum of the lateral aspect of the dominant knee is exactly&#xD;
      aligned with axis or rotation on the machine. All baseline adjustments will be recorded for&#xD;
      each participant at this point. Once the participant is ready to engage, their information&#xD;
      regarding ROM and weight of the limb will be adjusted according to computer program&#xD;
      procedures. Each participant will be given a trial round of 4 repetitions and will be&#xD;
      instructed to push and pull with their leg as hard as they could. Then, 3 rounds of testing&#xD;
      will be completed at 5 repetitions for each speed of 90/120/150 degrees per seconds. Each&#xD;
      participant will be reminded to breathe, and not hold their breath during the time they are&#xD;
      being assessed. Strength and power measurements will then be recorded for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these testing sessions are completed, individuals assigned to the usual care group will&#xD;
      receive dietary advice and then be allowed to go home while individuals randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention groups will be given instructions as to how to prepare a plant-based meal by a&#xD;
      professional chef at the College's dining services. Following lunch, each participant will&#xD;
      rotate through each of the following stations to receive one-on-one counseling from experts&#xD;
      in the specific areas based upon their own specific scores from their earlier assessments.&#xD;
      The following section contains information regarding the specific information that will be&#xD;
      covered in each of those areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Methods Instruments: Kidney Disease and Quality of Life (KDQOL) - Short Form (12).&#xD;
      The KDQOL-36™ is a short form that includes the SF-12 as generic core supplemented with&#xD;
      multi-item scales targeted at particular concerns of individuals with kidney disease (i.e.&#xD;
      the burden of kidney disease, symptoms/problems of kidney disease, and effects of kidney&#xD;
      disease scales on daily life). The KDQOL-SF is derived from the KDQOL(13), the long-form of&#xD;
      the questionnaire, whose use is limited by its length (134 items). The questionnaire is one&#xD;
      of the most complete instruments currently available to assess the health related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQOL) of patients because it includes general and specific aspects of health, allowing&#xD;
      a more complete evaluation of HRQOL dimensions that are relevant for the patients . The&#xD;
      authors of the KDQOL developed a standalone Excel scoring tool which was used to score the&#xD;
      instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Self-Efficacy to Regulate Exercise Habits Questionnaire. Self-efficacy to regulate&#xD;
      exercise habits relates to the belief that one can perform exercise activities in the face of&#xD;
      impediments (e.g.., fatigue, time constraints, unfavorable environmental conditions, and&#xD;
      competing demands). Subjects will rate themselves on scales that range from 0 (&quot;cannot do&quot;);&#xD;
      through intermediate degrees of assurance, 50 (&quot;moderately certain can do&quot;); to complete&#xD;
      assurance, 100 (&quot;highly certain can do&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Self-Efficacy to Regulate Eating Habits Questionnaire (Cronbach alpha = 0.93) Subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to rate their confidence in being able to &quot;stick to healthy eating habits&quot; when&#xD;
      faced with different tempting situations (e.g. when very hungry, when eating out with others,&#xD;
      during holiday times, when feeling upset). Subjects rate themselves on scales that range from&#xD;
      0 (&quot;cannot do&quot;); through intermediate degrees of assurance, 50 (&quot;moderately certain can do&quot;);&#xD;
      to complete assurance, 100 (&quot;highly certain can do&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention conditions will be given brief individualized counselling to&#xD;
      achieve their lifestyle goals. Participants will meet one-on-one with a behavioral health&#xD;
      counselor to develop their personalized self-management program. A program will be formulated&#xD;
      for each patient in which manageable goals for lifestyle change are negotiated, and specific&#xD;
      individually tailored intervention strategies to increase self-efficacy and decrease barriers&#xD;
      to change will be developed. The key features of the intervention will be a) assessment of&#xD;
      current physical activity and dietary habits, b) investigating the perceived benefits,&#xD;
      barriers and costs of behavior change, c) patient participation in goal setting and selecting&#xD;
      personalized strategies to overcome barriers and prevent relapse, and d) establishing&#xD;
      follow-up contacts. Regular self-assessment will be used to empower participants to take&#xD;
      responsibility for their own decisions and to make informed choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up contact will be made via email by the same counselor who met with the patient at&#xD;
      the assessment visit, at one week post-assessment and monthly thereafter. These emails will&#xD;
      focus on the extent to which patients have achieved their goals since last contact, and&#xD;
      patients will be reinforced or assisted in problem-solving additional strategies as&#xD;
      appropriate. Patients will also receive additional written materials tailored to their&#xD;
      current concerns (e.g. focusing on lapse and relapse, discussion of time management&#xD;
      strategies, and cues to get back into an activity plan after holidays).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacy Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical PharmD researcher will conduct patient interviews. Preparation for the interviews&#xD;
      include contacting the participants requesting that they bring all prescription and&#xD;
      over-the-counter medications to the &quot;Move to Health Study.&quot; Patients will be specifically&#xD;
      informed to bring all prescription (including those only taken as needed), over the counter&#xD;
      medications (such as medicine for sleep, allergies, etc.), vitamins, herbals, creams and&#xD;
      inhalers used within the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the Move to Health Study, participants will provide their bag of&#xD;
      medications to the pharmacist. While the patients are completing the initial phases of the&#xD;
      study, the pharmacist will document each medication including dosage, sig, day's supply and&#xD;
      last refill date, and will evaluate each medication for nephrotoxic effects, interactions,&#xD;
      contraindications and medication appropriateness in CKD. This will be done for each patient&#xD;
      without the pharmacist's knowledge of patient randomization group. Any medication that is&#xD;
      identified as potentially harmful or nephrotoxic for any patient will be addressed with the&#xD;
      lead physician of the study group for further discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients are randomized, those assigned to the intervention groups will meet&#xD;
      individually with the pharmacist. Patients in the usual care group are excused without&#xD;
      pharmacy associated changes as long as there are no medications identified as potentially&#xD;
      harmful or nephrotoxic. A detailed patient medication history will be obtained, including the&#xD;
      current dose; schedule and patient reported side effects. Adherence and associated barriers&#xD;
      will be assessed using the Morisky 8-point adherence tool (MMSA-8). Patients will also be&#xD;
      asked specifically, &quot;Within the past week, how many doses of medication have you missed?&quot;&#xD;
      Based upon the information gathered, the pharmacist will make evidence-based interventions.&#xD;
      Interventions include providing each patient with a recommended dosing schedule, appropriate&#xD;
      timing in relation to food and other medications, and tools to improve adherence. These tools&#xD;
      include recommending pill organizers, timers and decreasing medication dosing frequency.&#xD;
      Medication schedule will be based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics considerations as&#xD;
      well as therapeutic guideline recommendations. The administration of the drug will comply&#xD;
      with the standard operating procedures followed at RTANE (see attached SOP). The medications&#xD;
      will be stored at RTANE in a research refrigerator that is maintained at 2-8 °C temperature&#xD;
      and when dispensed to subjects they will be told to do the same. This research refrigerator&#xD;
      is monitored to make sure that it is keeping the stored medications at the correct&#xD;
      temperature. Patients will be educated about medication indication, OTC and herbal&#xD;
      medications to eliminate and to avoid (e.g., NSAIDs). Patients will be provided an&#xD;
      opportunity to ask medication related questions that will be addressed individually by the&#xD;
      pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, the pharmacist will follow the following algorithm which is based&#xD;
      on the most recent KDIGO guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the subject is on a RAS blocker, the pharmacist will titrate the dose up to maximal&#xD;
           dose in order to achieve a BP &lt;130/80.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the patient has an elevated urinary albumin excretion, the RAS inhibitor dose will&#xD;
           also be titrated to the maximal dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the potassium is &gt;5.2, Veltassa will be provided and dosed according to the PI&#xD;
           Nutrition Methods Participants will be required to keep a 3-day food log prior to the&#xD;
           day-long program. The information from the food logs will be analyzed with a Food&#xD;
           Processor Diet Analysis Software program (ESHA, Salem, OR) for nutritional content. The&#xD;
           ESHA Food Processor Nutrition Analysis software is widely used to assess the nutrient&#xD;
           content of food in both research and clinical practice. The software provides analyses&#xD;
           for more than 55,000 foods and food items, providing analysis for more than 163&#xD;
           nutritional components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the dietary consultation, the diet analysis will be reviewed with the participant,&#xD;
      regarding their individual dietary macronutrient and micronutrient content. Specific&#xD;
      attention will be paid to the amount and quality of protein, as well as the amount of sodium,&#xD;
      phosphorous, and potassium contained in the diet. Recommendations for dietary modifications&#xD;
      will be based on a vegan approach. Participants in the intervention group will be encouraged&#xD;
      to decrease the amount of animal protein in their diet and choose more plant-based meals. The&#xD;
      quality of animal protein will be addressed; with red meat and dairy products most highly&#xD;
      discouraged, followed by poultry, and fish. Education will be provided on the significance of&#xD;
      reducing sodium, phosphorous, and potassium on kidney health. Strategies to reduce the intake&#xD;
      of these micronutrients will be presented, specifically what types of foods to avoid and what&#xD;
      types to include more of in the diet. Individual barriers to success in achieving the&#xD;
      suggested dietary modifications will be addressed, and strategies to implement the changes&#xD;
      will be discussed based on the participant's individual circumstances. Participants will also&#xD;
      attend lunch with a cooking education session, in which a professional chef will demonstrate&#xD;
      how to prepare a vegan meal. During this session, strategies to enhance the flavor and appeal&#xD;
      of plant-based meals will be presented to aid participants in being able to practically&#xD;
      include plant-based meals in their daily diet. The treatment group will have an unrestricted&#xD;
      potassium diet. Individuals randomized to the control group will be counseled on a standard 1&#xD;
      gram/kg protein diet with 2 gram potassium and sodium restriction. Dietary adherence will be&#xD;
      assessed in the control and intervention group using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). A&#xD;
      standard portion size and six possible frequency of consumption responses, ranging from&#xD;
      &quot;never&quot; to &quot;two or more times per day&quot; will be given for each food group based on food and&#xD;
      nutrients emphasized or minimized in the prescribed diet (i.e., animal protein, sodium, and&#xD;
      potassium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical fitness methods: Based upon the performance of the FMS, individuals will be&#xD;
      counseled with regard to the types of exercises they should perform. The prescribed exercises&#xD;
      will be demonstrated and taught to the subjects so that when they leave to go home they know&#xD;
      how to perform the exercises in correct form. Examples of exercises that could be&#xD;
      demonstrated are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wall hip hinge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chair squat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dumbbell bent over row&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seated horizontal band row&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seated vertical band row&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elevated push up and wall push up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seated one arm dumbbell press,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Band curl,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Band triceps push down&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be also given a set of stretches to perform and will be taught how to&#xD;
      perform these stretches by the research staff members responsible for fitness. Examples of&#xD;
      stretches that could be used are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wall calf stretch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seated and standing hamstring stretch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chair quadriceps stretch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wall chest stretch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wall latissimus dorsi stretch. Subjects will also be instructed to aim to walk for at&#xD;
           least 30 minutes, 5 times per week at a moderate intensity to comply with standard&#xD;
           physical activity recommendations of accumulating at least 150 minutes per week of&#xD;
           moderate intensity physical activity. They will be instructed to avoid prolonged periods&#xD;
           of time engaging in sedentary behavior by aiming to reduce sitting time. Examples of&#xD;
           ways to reduce this sedentary behavior will be discussed with each participant and they&#xD;
           will be encouraged to implement strategies that could work for them. Some that could be&#xD;
           used include standing during commercial breaks while watching television and consciously&#xD;
           taking movement breaks during each hour by setting a timer for 15-20 intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously stated, participants in the intervention group will be issued with a packet of&#xD;
      exercises to do at home. This packet will contain simple step by step instructions and&#xD;
      illustrations of how to perform these movements with correct form. Prior to leaving the&#xD;
      College for the day, each of these exercises will be demonstrated to each participant and&#xD;
      they will be taught how to perform these exercises in correct form. A member of the research&#xD;
      group will contact them (either by phone or email) at the beginning of each week during the&#xD;
      intervention period to review with them the exercise program for the week to come and to&#xD;
      discuss any challenges that they might have encountered in the previous week. The means of&#xD;
      communication used will be decided upon depending upon the preference of the participant.&#xD;
      During these weekly communications, the member from the research team will review the&#xD;
      strategies the participant has been using to reduce sedentary behavior and provide&#xD;
      encouragement in these endeavors. Participants will also be required to keep a log of their&#xD;
      activities and return this log to the research team when they return for their retest dates.&#xD;
      The activity log serves as a motivational tool and as an aid for the research team to&#xD;
      supervise (and adapt if necessary) the exercise program. Participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
      contact the research coordinator at any time if they have any questions or need clarification&#xD;
      while performing their home-based exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity Monitoring: By the end of the testing day, each participant will be given a&#xD;
      GT3XPB Actigraph monitor (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL) with instructions to wear the monitor for&#xD;
      the following 7 days. They will then be asked to return this monitor to the research&#xD;
      coordinator who will download the data for storage and later analysis. This process will be&#xD;
      repeated each time participants come to the College for testing. Objective data captured by&#xD;
      the ActiGraph system (i.e., mean times spent in sedentary behavior, light, and moderate to&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity) will be used to compare physical activity and sedentary behavior&#xD;
      in the intervention and control group as a measure of exercise adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Follow up All participants in the Move to Health Study will be expected to return to&#xD;
      the College approximately one, three and 6 months to be reassessed with the identical&#xD;
      procedures as performed at the initial visit. Standard CKD labs (CBC, electrolytes, BUN,&#xD;
      creatinine, PTH. magnesium, uric acid and urinary albumin excretion) will be measured at each&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage All study data will be collected and managed using Research Electronic Data&#xD;
      Capture) REDCap electronic data capture tools. REDCap is a secure (password protected),&#xD;
      web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an&#xD;
      intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation&#xD;
      and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common&#xD;
      statistical packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources. The&#xD;
      computers on which the electronic data will be stored will be password protected and the PI&#xD;
      other members of the research team will know the code. Apart from the PI, graduate students&#xD;
      who will help with data entry, under the PI's supervision and the statistician, will be the&#xD;
      only individuals who will have access to the data. To maintain subject confidentiality, upon&#xD;
      entry into the study subjects will be assigned a number and that number will be linked to&#xD;
      their data in the spreadsheet of the statistical program. No names will be directly linked to&#xD;
      the data entered into the statistical program. Random checks of the accuracy of the data&#xD;
      entered into the statistical package will be done by the study coordinator and the&#xD;
      statistician.&#xD;
