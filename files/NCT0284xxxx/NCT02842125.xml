    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of the combination of Ad-p53 administered intra-arterially in&#xD;
      combination with oral metronomic capecitabine or pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable,&#xD;
      refractory liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and other solid tumors, including&#xD;
      primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A third arm will study the intra-tumoral injection of&#xD;
      Ad-p53 combined with nivolumab infusions in recurrent head and neck squamous cell cancer&#xD;
      (HNSCC). This safety study has a standard 3+3 design for arms A and B; .HNSCC will be placed&#xD;
      in a single dosing cohort. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined as well for&#xD;
      intra-arterial infusions, and the entire study will determine the general efficacy using&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 and Immune-Related Response Criteria. Safety will be followed using the CTCAE&#xD;
      listings for adverse events.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1/2 study split into 3 arms. Arm A will follow the combination of Ad-p53&#xD;
      administered intra-arterially in combination with oral metronomic capecitabine while Arm B&#xD;
      follows the intra-arterial administration of Ad-p53 combined with pembrolizumab, both in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable, refractory liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and&#xD;
      other solid tumors, including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Arm C will follow the&#xD;
      combination of intra-tumoral injections of Ad-p53 and nivolumab infusions. Arms A and B have&#xD;
      a standard 3+3 design, with dosing following the initial cohort determined by MTD and DLT&#xD;
      criteria as well as safety and tolerance. Arm C will be a single dosing cohort followed for&#xD;
      safety and efficacy. All patients will be followed for adverse events and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy. In Arms A and B, the Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined. All patients&#xD;
      will be followed for general safety and preliminary efficacy using RECIST 1.1 and&#xD;
      Immune-Related Response Criteria. CEA levels will also be followed for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colo-rectal cancer. Biomarker testing of archival or fresh tissue is performed&#xD;
      during the study. In Arms A and B, patients will undergo a maximum of 2 8-week cycles, with&#xD;
      scans every 8 weeks. For Arm B, patients will undergo a maximum of 3 28-day Cycles. All&#xD;
      patients will continue on the background therapy for any additional cycles. No additional&#xD;
      biopsies are planned following Screening. Enrollment will be up to 24 patients.&#xD;
