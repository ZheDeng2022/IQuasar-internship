  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is to determine the safety and explore the effectiveness of allogeneic (not&#xD;
      cells of the participant but those of another human) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in&#xD;
      decreasing inflammation and possible enlargement of the participants' abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm. Participants will be selected as a possible subject because of an abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm discovered on the ultrasound or computed tomographic (&quot;CT&quot;) scan requested by the&#xD;
      participants' doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to collect information that will be used to determine if MSCs&#xD;
      can be used to decrease inflammation and possibly slow down enlargement of the participants'&#xD;
      aneurysm. The investigators will also be collecting blood samples to study special&#xD;
      inflammatory cells that cause aneurysms as well as asking participants to have a &quot;PET&quot;&#xD;
      (positron emission tomography) scan that can measure inflammation directly in the&#xD;
      participants' aneurysm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, double blinded trial that will enroll 50 patients with Abdominal Aortic&#xD;
      Aneurysms (AAA) measuring 3-5 cm in maximal transverse diameter (MTD). This study will assess&#xD;
      the safety of MSCs in doses of 1 million MSCs/kg. or 3 million MSCs/kg. delivered&#xD;
      intra-venously. This trial test the hypothesis that MSCs, in a dose dependent fashion,&#xD;
      promote the frequency and immune suppressor function of CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells&#xD;
      and decrease AAA inflammation as measured by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The primary safety endpoints will be incidence of&#xD;
      treatment related adverse events accrued over 24 months. Efficacy measures are changes in&#xD;
      frequency and immune suppressor function of Tregs, number and cytotoxic activity of CD4+/CD8+&#xD;
      CD28- T-cells, activated monocytes, and changes in aortic inflammation as measured by uptake&#xD;
      of 18-FDG PET/CT compared to baseline. Incidence of surgical intervention, aneurysm related&#xD;
      death, quality of life, and major adverse cardiac events will be recorded.&#xD;

    <description>The safety of systemic administration of allogeneic MSCs will be measured by treatment-related adverse events. The categories of systems are cardiovascular, respiratory, or infectious. Two categories of severity will be serious adverse (SAE) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Within each of these categories adverse events will be listed in descending order of frequency for the treatment-group. In addition for each category, the sum and difference between the two routes of delivery of the proportions will be reported as percent incidence. Confidence Intervals at the 95% confidence level and P-values for these four groups will be calculated. Since four previous trials have not reported adverse events with MSC treatment, confidence intervals will be generated by the method of the Wilson Score Interval.</description>

The thawed MSCs with be administered within 4 hours to subjects in a monitored setting with telemetry and pulse oximetry. Patients will be premedicated with hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine. All subjects will be monitored throughout the infusion procedure with vital signs and pulse oximetry at 15 minutes prior to infusion and ending 2 hours post procedure. They will also be evaluated for clinical signs of pulmonary distress. All patients will be admitted overnight for continued observation. The patient will be examined the following day and discharged home.</description>
