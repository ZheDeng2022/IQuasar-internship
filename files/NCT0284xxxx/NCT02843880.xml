  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus is a herpesviridae whose prevalence in general population is between 50 to&#xD;
      80%. In immunocompetent individuals, CMV remains latent in a number of cells, without any&#xD;
      pathological consequence. Immunosuppression may reactivate the virus causing either a&#xD;
      CMV-active infection or a CMV disease with attributable symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 6 to 30 % of critically ill patients without classical&#xD;
      immunosuppression, as those suffering from septic shock, present CMV reactivation. Our aim is&#xD;
      to study the risk factors for developing viremia or CMV disease in ICU patients in septic&#xD;
      shock without previous immunodepression and determine the relationship between viral&#xD;
      reactivation and this acquired immunity alteration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppression statuses causing both CMV active infection or disease are mainly&#xD;
      consecutive to HIV infection, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. However, in&#xD;
      severely ill patients, as in septic shock, it has been proved that after a hyper-inflammatory&#xD;
      phase occurred a negative control of the immunity, resulting in a paralysed or impaired&#xD;
      immune system. The length and extent of this immunodeficiency is correlated with the duration&#xD;
      of ICU stay, the occurrence of nosocomial infection and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of CMV's natural history reactivation in the critically ill patient&#xD;
      would better define the benefits from a specific therapy.&#xD;
