      the study consists of an observational study aimed at quantifying the economic burden of the&#xD;
      nursing activities on the overall cost of hospitalizations funded through DRG tariffs for&#xD;
      Major complexity oncology patients.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodological approach used to achieve the objective of this research is quantitative. A&#xD;
      mixed study design is being adopted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retrospective study to determine the nature and volume of activity provided at nursing&#xD;
           classes of patients whose admission is attributed to a specific DRG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Longitudinal prospective study to determine the variability of costs of nurses with&#xD;
           regard to DRG refund, comparatively to distribution of patients for every single section&#xD;
           (high, medium, low complexity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The sample has been chosen considering the prevalence of hospitalizations&#xD;
      per year in medical oncology U.O.C. related to certain DRG and characterized by greater&#xD;
      complexity of care, so as to provide a useful information base for study. For the&#xD;
      retrospective study the survey will be conducted on a sample of 150 patients. Patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled at high, medium and low complexity of care, hospitalized for chemotherapy and for&#xD;
      biliary obstructive urinary tract and in the first half of 2016. It is estimated that the&#xD;
      sample represents 30% of the total number of admissions made in 2016. A prospective&#xD;
      longitudinal study will take into consideration a sample of 150 patients with the same&#xD;
      characteristics considered for enrollment in the retrospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients who under go: CHT with a duration of hospital stay of 2-3&#xD;
      days (microcitomi and NHL), CHT with a length of hospital stay of 4-5 days (sarcomas), CHT&#xD;
      with a length of hospital stay &gt; 5 days or at high doses (testicle cancer, Ewing's sarcoma&#xD;
      and bone sarcoma) and patients with higher complexity care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of 18 years of age or less will be excluded, as well as patients that were&#xD;
      transferred to other units while inpatient, patients transferred in U.O.C. of Oncology after&#xD;
      major surgery procedures in other departments, and admissions that are outliers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration for the monitoring phase on the allocation and the distribution of patients&#xD;
      among the different sections of hospital care intensity (Intensità di cure, IC) and care&#xD;
      complexity (Complessità Assistenziale, CA), based on the results obtained by the Triage of&#xD;
      corridor (TriCO), is estimated for 3 months up to a maximum of six months starting from March&#xD;
      2016. For the collection of data relating to the amount and types of activities provided in&#xD;
      the first half of 2016 is estimated to have a maximum of 30 days and others 30 days for the&#xD;
      detection the relative DRG reimbursed for hospitalizations considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Professional Assessment Instrument (PAI). It is a tool that documents nursing processes&#xD;
           implemented in a computerized way using nursing language according to the North American&#xD;
           Nursing Diagnosis Association International (NANDA-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital discharge card (Scheda di dimissione ospedaliera, SDO). It is a tool that&#xD;
           contains information about each patient discharged, that are necessary for the&#xD;
           attribution to DRG and for finding the rate payable for each episode of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scheda di mobilità interna dei pazienti. It is a card that contains data of Tri-CO at&#xD;
           the entrance of the patient and any variations of that index during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions The study will be presented to the manager and coordinator of the U.O.C.&#xD;
      Medical Oncology through a moment of training/information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to collect data on the variation of Tri-CO during hospitalization, and consequently&#xD;
      the different allocation to U.O.C. of Oncology of patients in sections of low, medium and&#xD;
      high complexity of care, a point of contact (nurse) will be identified who will deal with the&#xD;
      collection and retention of such information in the manner set out in the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome expected by the survey is the quantification of the volume of nursing&#xD;
      activities provided to patients and its cost. In addition, we expect to realize economic&#xD;
      indicators which make it possible to ascertain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost weight of the nursing staff on the DRG rate reimbursed in relation to the&#xD;
           complexity care of the patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost weight of the nursing staff on the reimbursement for hospitalization in connection&#xD;
           with the DRG of patient discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gap between theoretical and actual cost of nurses in relation to the care delivered for&#xD;
           a specific patient; Knowledge of actual costs for each distinct and specific episode of&#xD;
           hospitalization would enhance its &quot;uniqueness&quot;. An economic analysis of labor nursing&#xD;
           costs for individual patient could provide input for the determination of the costs of&#xD;
           all the professionals of the Foundation, contributing to the improvement of corporate&#xD;
           strategic management for resource allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using methods of descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and inferential statistics appropriate to the sample size and study variables.&#xD;
      Prospective longitudinal study will be used to determine the frequency distribution and the&#xD;
      variance on the stay of the patients in each individual section of hospital in-patient&#xD;
      treatment which is attributed to a specific DRG. Then a factorial analysis and regression&#xD;
      techniques will be used to measure the type of bond that exists between the dependent&#xD;
      variable Y (nursing) and independent variables X1, X2, X3 ... (DRG, age, days of&#xD;
      hospitalization, complications, etc). Then the analysis will continue by studying which&#xD;
      variables will affect the distribution of patients for IC and CA level and how it can change&#xD;
      this assignment during a single in-patient episode, creating a variability in costs of&#xD;
      services paid.&#xD;
