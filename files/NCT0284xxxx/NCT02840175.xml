    <textblock>
      As biologic treatments are expensive and associated with some concerns regarding long-term&#xD;
      safety, investigator hypothesize that early tapering and then withdrawal of biological agent,&#xD;
      in an homogenous group of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis achieving inactive&#xD;
      disease, is safe and not inferior to the maintenance of stable treatment intensity over 24&#xD;
      weeks. In addition, investigator also hypothesize that an earlier tapering of treatment is&#xD;
      associated with a better quality-of-life and a general cost saving effect. MRP8/14 will be&#xD;
      studied as a potential biomarker for the risk of relapse. A study for biologic agent,&#xD;
      anti-biologic agent antibodies and a pharmacogenomic approach will complete the research, as&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study during withdrawal of biologic treatment are rare in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is characterized by chronic arthritis of unknown etiology&#xD;
      starting before the age of 16. There are four to five thousand paediatric patients with JIA&#xD;
      in France. Most of these patients are diagnosed with oligoarticular or rheumatoid factor&#xD;
      negative polyarticular JIA. The prognosis of the disease has dramatically improved thanks to&#xD;
      the introduction of biologic agents in patients with an extended oligoarticular or rheumatoid&#xD;
      factor negative polyarticular JIA and inadequate response to methotrexate. Inactive disease&#xD;
      and long-lasting clinical remission are achieved in most cases. &quot;Treat to target&quot; approaches&#xD;
      are increasingly recommended, with earlier introduction of biologics, however the way to&#xD;
      taper or withdraw treatment in patients achieving inactive disease is not codified. As&#xD;
      biologic treatments are expensive and associated with some concerns regarding long-term&#xD;
      safety, this study aim to test, in a randomized fashion, the hypothesis that early tapering&#xD;
      of biologic agents (i.e. increasing the intervals between injections as soon as inactive&#xD;
      disease is documented) is safe and non-inferior to the maintenance of stable treatment&#xD;
      intensity over 24 weeks, and therefore test the possibility of early biologic agent&#xD;
      withdrawal. It will also study concentrations of different biological agent, the occurrence&#xD;
      of anti-drugs antibodies while tapering and then withdrawing biologics, and their possible&#xD;
      association with a higher risk of relapse. In addition, investigators will test if the serum&#xD;
      level of proteins 100 (MRP8/14) could be predictive of flares. Finally, pharmaco-economic&#xD;
      analyses and quality of life studies will be conducted.&#xD;

No joints with active arthritis,&#xD;
No active uveitis as defined by the SUN Working Group2 (The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group defines inactive anterior uveitis as &quot;grade zero cells,&quot; indicating &lt;1 cell in field sizes of 1 mm by a 1-mm slit beam),&#xD;
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≤ 20 mm or C-reactive protein (CRP) level ≤ 10 mg/L (or ≤ 1 mg/dl or ≤ 100 µg/dl) or, if elevated, not attributable to JIA (if both ESR and CRP are available, both of them should be in the normal range)&#xD;
Physician's global assessment of disease activity score (&lt; 10/100 visual analogue scale),&#xD;
and duration of morning stiffness &lt; or egal to 15 minutes (within 7 days before the visit).&#xD;
For all the visits, joint counts and physician global assessment of disease activity will be performed by an investigator blinded from patient study group.</description>
