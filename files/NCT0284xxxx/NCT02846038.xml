  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Honest, clear, and empathetic communication between pediatric oncologists (POs) and parents&#xD;
      of children with cancer (POCCs) is imperative to facilitating therapeutic alliance and&#xD;
      ensuring that medical management aligns with the families' goals of care. Communication is&#xD;
      particularly important during conversations about disease reevaluation, which often&#xD;
      necessitate parental decision-making in the context of emotional distress. POs employ a&#xD;
      spectrum of communication styles and strategies during challenging conversations, and there&#xD;
      is no consensus regarding linguistic or thematic metrics for high quality communication of&#xD;
      upsetting information. In order to better understand how POs communicate difficult&#xD;
      information to POCCs, the investigators propose a pilot study designed to accomplish the&#xD;
      following primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify recurrent verbal and nonverbal (e.g. the use of pauses/silence)&#xD;
           communication techniques employed by POs in the delivery of difficult prognostic&#xD;
           information to POCCs through content analysis of audio-recorded conversations between&#xD;
           POs and parents of children with high risk cancer at the time of disease reevaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study expects to enroll up to: 80 patient participants, 80 parents, and 15 primary&#xD;
      pediatric oncologists (total = 175).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-primary oncologist members of the clinical care team, extended family members, or friends&#xD;
      of the family may also participate, if they choose to do so.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data collection will occur at each disease reevaluation, during which time the conversation&#xD;
      will be audio-recorded and data will be abstracted from the medical record. Additionally, 2&#xD;
      surveys will be completed at specific time points by both the oncologist and the parent.&#xD;
      Lastly, interviews will be offered to both the oncologist and the parent/patient following&#xD;
      any audio-recorded conversation in which difficult news was discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease reevaluation will be defined as any of the following interventions performed for the&#xD;
      purposes of assessing disease status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical biopsy or resection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first time point for data collection with be at the time of the patient's first meeting&#xD;
      with their oncologist to discuss the results of disease reevaluation. This discussion will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded. The parent will be asked to complete a survey within 7 days. Those receiving&#xD;
      difficult news will have the opportunity to participate in a brief interview with a study&#xD;
      team member regarding their experience. Patients who are at least 12 years old will also have&#xD;
      this opportunity, separate from their parents, if desired by the patient and approved by the&#xD;
      parent. Interviews may be in person or by phone and have no set length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next time point for data collection will coincide with any time the patient/parents meet&#xD;
      with their oncologist to discuss results of a disease reevaluation. Each conversation will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded. If difficult news is delivered during the discussion, the parent and&#xD;
      oncologist will be asked to complete a second survey for first bad news conversation,&#xD;
      following the baseline recording. Parent, patient, and oncologist will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in an interview for all bad news conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-parent dyads will be followed for a total of 24 months from the time of enrollment on&#xD;
      study (defined as the date of first audio recording rather than date of actual consent), in&#xD;
      the context of patients who do not experience disease relapse, progression, or refractory&#xD;
      disease. Dyads in which patients experience disease relapse, progression, or refractory&#xD;
      disease will be followed for a total of 24 months from the time of first disease relapse or&#xD;
      progression while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data analyzed from audio-recordings will be permanently erased from recorders following&#xD;
      completion of data analysis. Participants may request to discontinue to the study at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For previously enrolled patients, (enrolled prior to revision 3.1), a retrospective chart&#xD;
      review will be done to collect additional clinical data.&#xD;
