  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In traditional step-up approach, the patients with poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes are&#xD;
      instructed to take up to 4 insulin injections daily or multiple daily injections (MDI) as the&#xD;
      most advanced therapy. However, a significant number of these patients continue to have poor&#xD;
      diabetes control. The most common reason is the noncompliance with multiple injections and&#xD;
      the patient's reluctance to accept insulin-induced weight gain. More recently, the algorithm&#xD;
      in diabetes management has significantly changed to accommodate the newer generation of&#xD;
      medications. Addition of the diabetes medications, that can induce weight loss such as oral&#xD;
      Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors and once-weekly glucagon-like peptide&#xD;
      (GLP)-1 receptor agonists (GLP1 RA) injection, to a basal insulin is now recommended before&#xD;
      the patient is advanced to MDI. This approach works very well in most patients since weight&#xD;
      loss gives the patients an extra motivation to take medication regularly. Similarly, the&#xD;
      patient does not require to take an insulin injection before each meal throughout the day in&#xD;
      this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there are still a large number of patients with poor glycemic control who are&#xD;
      still on MDI. Some of them were initiated on MDI before the availability of newer generations&#xD;
      of medications. Some were started simply because the physician was not aware of or not the&#xD;
      familiar with the new recommendations. Regardless of the reason, these patients are likely to&#xD;
      remain on MDI despite chronic poor glycemic control since the physicians are understandably&#xD;
      reluctant to step down the most advanced insulin therapy. In addition, there has been no data&#xD;
      on the benefits and safety of the stepping-down approach from the most advanced insulin&#xD;
      therapy to the more patient-friendly approach that is the combined use of oral SGLT2i and&#xD;
      once-weekly GLP1 RA injection.&#xD;

      A prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel-group trial is planned. This&#xD;
      study is an interdepartmental collaborative study among the Department of Internal Medicine,&#xD;
      Department of Family &amp; Community Medicine (UCSF Fresno), Sierra Vista Family Medicine&#xD;
      Residency Program and Division of Endocrinology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the following multiple locations in order to maximize the&#xD;
      patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Internal medicine clinic at Derian Koligian ambulatory care center (ACC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Family practice medicine clinic at ACC&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diabetes clinic at ACC&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Internal medicine clinic at University Medicine Associates in East medical Plaza&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Endocrine clinic at University Medicine Associates in East medical Plaza&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sierra Vista clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited during the first 12 months of the study or until the&#xD;
      predetermined sample size is reached, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's primary care provider will be informed of the enrollment in the study if the&#xD;
      participant gives the permission to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in both group will need to make all 3 visits to UCSF Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center over 16- week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) First visit: Once the site co-investigators identify the suitable and interested study&#xD;
      patient, a trained research coordinator will contact the patient for the first visit. The&#xD;
      patient will be seen at the UCSF Clinical Research Center by the research coordinator and a&#xD;
      physician co-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, all patients in both group will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be given the information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be randomly assigned to either treatment (i.e. Step Down) or control (MDI) group by&#xD;
           using A Randomization Plan from http://www.randomization.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have the blood test for A1c, CMP, CBC, fasting lipid and measurements of body weight,&#xD;
           height, blood pressure, and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete both the Diabetes Medications Satisfaction (DM-SAT) Questionnaire form and the&#xD;
           Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication changes at first visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment group,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All prandial insulin injections (Humalog, Novolog, Apidra, Novolin R or Humulin R),&#xD;
           usually 3 times daily before meals, will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Basal insulin (NPH, Lantus, Levimir, Toujeo or Tresiba), usually once daily at bed time,&#xD;
           will be continued at 80 % of the home dose. The dose will be gradually increased until&#xD;
           the patient is back on the home dose (the dose that the patient has been taking at home&#xD;
           prior to the enrollment) or fasting BG of 80-130mg/dl is achieved by using the&#xD;
           self-titration regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the patient is on pre-mixed basal+prandial insulin 2-3 times daily, it will be&#xD;
           discontinued and a basal insulin alone, (NPH, Lantus, Levemir, Toujeo or Tresiba), will&#xD;
           be given at 40% of total daily dose of pre-mixed insulin. The dose will be gradually&#xD;
           increased until fasting BG of 80-130mg/dl is achieved by using the self-titration&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Metformin, that most patients are expected to be on, will be continued, but other&#xD;
           non-insulin oral medications for diabetes will be discontinued. If the patient is not on&#xD;
           metformin, then Metformin ER will be started at 500mg with a meal for 2 weeks as a&#xD;
           routine care and then 1000mg daily as a maintenance dose if tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Both SGLT2i and GLP1 RA will be added to metformin and a basal insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be trained on the injection technique of the once-weekly GLP1 RA, potential&#xD;
      side effects, risk and benefits of all new medications in detail, hypoglycemia management and&#xD;
      the self-titration regimen for the basal insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, there will not be any change in MDI therapy, and the participants will&#xD;
      continue to have the usual and standard care through the primary care provider. The&#xD;
      participants should not receive SGLT2i and GLP1 RA during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Second visit: At 4 weeks after the patient starts taking new medications, the patients&#xD;
      will make the 2nd visit to the UCSF Clinical Research Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 2nd visit, the patient in the treatment group will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be enquired about any side effect of the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be reviewed on insulin dose and the use of self-titration regimen for the basal insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have the blood test for A1c, CMP, CBC, fasting lipid and measurements of body weight,&#xD;
           height, blood pressure, and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete both the Diabetes Medications Satisfaction (DM-SAT) Questionnaire form and the&#xD;
           Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, there will not be any change in MDI therapy, and the participants will&#xD;
      continue to have the usual and standard care through the primary care provider. The&#xD;
      participants should not receive SGLT2i and GLP1 RA during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 2nd visit, the patient in the control group will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have the blood test for A1c, CMP, CBC, fasting lipid and measurements of body weight,&#xD;
           height, blood pressure, and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete both the Diabetes Medications Satisfaction (DM-SAT) Questionnaire form and the&#xD;
           Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
           (3) Third visit: The patients will make the 3rd or final visit to the UCSF Clinical&#xD;
           Research Center at 12 weeks after 2nd visit or 16 weeks from the date of the start of&#xD;
           both SGLT2i and a GLP1 RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 3rd visit, the patients in both groups will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have the blood test for A1c, CMP, CBC, fasting lipid and measurements of body weight,&#xD;
           height, blood pressure, and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete both the Diabetes Medications Satisfaction (DM-SAT) Questionnaire form and the&#xD;
           Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will try to make a clinic appointment with primary care provider one month&#xD;
      prior to the last visit to the research center for those who are in the treatment group if&#xD;
      the patient gives the permission to do so. Therefore the primary care provider will be able&#xD;
      to order the medications through the patient's health insurance plan if the patient wishes to&#xD;
      remain on the study medications beyond the study period. Alternatively, the patients can go&#xD;
      back on insulin therapy that was given prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the treatment group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in both groups will monitor FPGs daily at minimum. The research coordinator will&#xD;
      call all participants in both groups at weeks 1, 2, 8, and 12 to review fasting glucose&#xD;
      measurements, ask for possible adverse events, incidents of hypoglycemia, and any change in&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in both groups in both groups will be reviewed again at the UCSF Clinical&#xD;
      Research Center at weeks #4 and #16 for both blood tests and physical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the change in A1c at the end of 16 weeks of study period and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are the changes in fasting blood glucose, weight, blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      fasting lipids, serum sodium and potassium, serum creatinine, liver enzymes, CBC, medication&#xD;
      adherence scores and treatment satisfaction scores . These changes will be compared between&#xD;
      the two independent groups, namely the treatment group and the control group, and also within&#xD;
      the same group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood test and questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following blood work will be drawn and analyzed at the community regional medical center&#xD;
      at baseline (first visit), at 4 weeks and at the end of the study at 16 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete metabolic panel (CMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fasting lipid profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction with treatment in both groups will be measured by the validated the&#xD;
      Diabetes Medications Satisfaction (DM-SAT) Questionnaire form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient adherence will be determined by using the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE AND ANALYSIS PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will attempt to recruit and consent 20 patients in each arm that was&#xD;
      calculated to provide an 80% statistical power at a 0.05 alpha in this continuous endpoint,&#xD;
      two independent sample study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation was based on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mean Hemoglobin A1c of 8.5±1% at the initiation of the study period. In the treatment group&#xD;
      we anticipate a decline in Hemoglobin A1c of 12-15% by the end of the study period. The&#xD;
      standard deviation for the mean A1c was derived from the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed by using SPSS software. Significance testing will be conducted at&#xD;
      the two-sided 5% level. Continuous variables will be examined for normality and if assumption&#xD;
      is met, differences in mean values will be tested using Student's t test an analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA). If not normally distributed, non-parametric procedures will be used,&#xD;
      including Wilcoxan rank Sum test. Categorical data will be analyzed using Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      and Chi square analysis. Since before/after comparisons will also be performed on the same&#xD;
      study patients we will utilize paired t tests and McNemar's chi-square test.&#xD;
