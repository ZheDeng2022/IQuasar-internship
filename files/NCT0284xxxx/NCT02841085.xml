      Identify new genetic mutations predisposing to an increased risk of VTE by locating and / or&#xD;
      identifying genes involved in subjects at high risk for thrombotic and in whom screening for&#xD;
      detectable hereditary thrombophilia was negative.&#xD;

      Venous thromboembolism desease is a public health problem justifying major primary and&#xD;
      secondary prevention policy. When VTE occurs in the absence of risk factor clinically&#xD;
      identifiable ( &quot;idiopathic&quot;), an inherited biological risk factor ( &quot;inherited&#xD;
      thrombophilia&quot;) is found in 30% of cases. However, in patients with idiopathic VTE, the risk&#xD;
      of recurrent venous thromboembolism is very high, whether detectable inherited thrombophilia&#xD;
      was found or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first observation suggests that patients with idiopathic VTE and no detectable&#xD;
      thrombophilia are likely to have an underlying unknown thrombophilia that are yet to be&#xD;
      discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis is further supported by the results of the study &quot;FIT&quot; (Regional PHRC 2001,&#xD;
      promoter CHU Brest, Investigator Main: Francis Couturaud, EA3878 Brest, France, and&#xD;
      investigator Associate: Clive Kearon, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), a&#xD;
      cross international study evaluating the risk of VTE among the family members first degree of&#xD;
      patients a first idiopathic VTE episode. In this large study cross-1950 family members first&#xD;
      degree (topics study) of 372 patients with a first episode of VTE Idiopathic (propositi) were&#xD;
      included (50% included in Brest and 50% inclusive in Canada). The main result is that the&#xD;
      risk of VTE among family members first degree is high and similar, the proband either bearer&#xD;
      or without a detectable hereditary thrombophilia. In other words, even in the absence of&#xD;
      detectable hereditary thrombophilia, the risk of VTE among family members first degree is&#xD;
      high. This study has identified the subjects in that it is likely they have an inherited&#xD;
      thrombophilia which has not yet been discovered.&#xD;
