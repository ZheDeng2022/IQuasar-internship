    <textblock>
      The Mediterranean diet (MD), a healthy dietary pattern based on some common dietary&#xD;
      characteristics in Mediterranean countries, is associated with high antioxidant capacity&#xD;
      linked to the low saturated fat intake that might contribute to reduce free fatty acid (FFA)&#xD;
      availability and oxidation in mitochondria, thus reducing the production of the reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) superoxide, and promoting cellular health. To assess the adherence to&#xD;
      the MD, a simple 14-item questionnaire had been tested in different settings by the PREDIMED&#xD;
      (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) multicenter, randomized, primary prevention trial. On the&#xD;
      other hand, to allow a more an accurate measurement of the actual macro and micronutrient&#xD;
      intakes, including dietary anti-oxidant micronutrients, the 7-day food records is considered&#xD;
      as the &quot;gold standard&quot; of self-administered food frequency questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating levels of Sirtuin 4 (Sirt4), part of a complex of proteins that control diverse&#xD;
      biological processes, including lipid metabolism, are low in obese patients, as a possible&#xD;
      attempt to decrease fat oxidative capacity and mitochondrial ROS production, however&#xD;
      promoting ectopic liver fat storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase angle (PA), a measure determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and the&#xD;
      visceral adiposity index (VAI), a gender-specific mathematical index based on simple&#xD;
      anthropometric and metabolic parameters, represent well-validated, reliable and widely used&#xD;
      markers of cellular health and ectopic adipose distribution and function, respectively. The&#xD;
      fatty liver index (FLI) is a surrogate measure for fatty liver recently proposed as an&#xD;
      independent predictor for diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study was to investigate in adult obese individuals the levels of Sirt4&#xD;
      according to the adherence to the MD evaluated by PREDIMED questionnaire, focusing on the&#xD;
      possible association with single dietary components evaluated by 7-day food records, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the association between circulating levels of Sirt4 and PA, as marker of cellular&#xD;
      health, VAI, as index of adipocyte dysfunction, and FLI, as a predictor of fatty liver.&#xD;
