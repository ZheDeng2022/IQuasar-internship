      AIM2: The purpose of Aim-2 of this study is to determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on&#xD;
      the beta-cell response to insulin resistance. Healthy subjects will have fasting GLP-1 action&#xD;
      determined with GLP-1r blockade before and after induction of experimental insulin&#xD;
      resistance. The investigators hypothesize that fasting GLP-1 action will increase to&#xD;
      compensate for experimental insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM3: The purpose of Aim-3 of this study is to determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on&#xD;
      fasting glucose regulation in lean, obese, pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects.&#xD;
      A cross sectional study of age-matched subjects across the spectrum of glucose tolerance will&#xD;
      be used to test the hypothesis that fasting GLP-1 action increases as beta-cell function&#xD;
      declines.&#xD;

      AIM2: The purpose of this study is to determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on the&#xD;
      beta-cell response to insulin resistance. Healthy subjects will have fasting GLP-1 action&#xD;
      determined with GLP-1r blockade before and after induction of experimental insulin&#xD;
      resistance. The investigators hypothesize that fasting GLP-1 action will increase to&#xD;
      compensate for experimental insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 20-25 healthy participants and while it is anticipated that the&#xD;
      screening blood draw will yield a number of screen failures, it is estimated that 10-15&#xD;
      subjects will complete the entire study protocol. Enrolled participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete three study visits including the consent visit and two infusion study visits that&#xD;
      will include hyperglycemic clamp procedures with the addition of the GLP-1 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist Exendin (9-39) to determine the fasting GLP-1 effect. Each infusion procedure will&#xD;
      last 2 hours. Subjects will be asked to take dexamethasone daily for approximately one week&#xD;
      between Visit-2 and Visit-3 to induce insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 6-10 additional subjects as controls for effects of time and&#xD;
      repeat testing. These individuals will have identical clamps with no dexamethasone at&#xD;
      approximately 1 week intervals and will be determined at random by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for visits 2-3 will be to measure the effects of Ex-9 on fasting&#xD;
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion before and after experimentally induced insulin&#xD;
      resistance. The primary experimental variable for analysis will be C-peptide during the&#xD;
      clamp. Mean values will be compared between the period of glucose only stimulation and&#xD;
      glucose with Ex-9. For each subject in the active treatment arm data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      2-way ANOVA for repeated measures using time (0-60 vs 60-120 min) and treatment (Dex vs no&#xD;
      Dex) as the two factors. Based on the investigators' previous studies the investigators&#xD;
      expect a significant time effect due to Ex-9. If there is an interaction with treatment the&#xD;
      investigators would conclude that experimental insulin resistance influences the fasting&#xD;
      GLP-1 effect. Data from control subjects will be analyzed identically; here the investigators&#xD;
      expect no interaction, indicating that the fasting GLP-1 is a stable measure. In the&#xD;
      investigators' previous study using Ex-9 during a glucose clamp, the average coefficient of&#xD;
      variation in insulin concentrations at the conclusion of each step in the ramp was 30%. Using&#xD;
      this estimate of between subject variation, detecting a 20% difference between subsequent&#xD;
      steps in the GLP-1 ramp with a power of 80% and significance level of 0.05 will require 8&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM3: The purpose of Aim-3 of this study is to determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on&#xD;
      fasting glucose regulation in lean, obese, pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects.&#xD;
      Approximately 15-20 subjects will complete this cross sectional study of age-matched subjects&#xD;
      across the spectrum of glucose tolerance will be used to test the hypothesis that fasting&#xD;
      GLP-1 action increases as beta-cell function declines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants for Aim-3 will be asked to complete two study visits including the&#xD;
      consent visit and one infusion visit that will include a hyperglycemic clamp and an infusion&#xD;
      of the antagonist Exendin (9-39). The infusion procedure will last approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for Aim-3 will be the fasting GLP-1 effect. This will be defined&#xD;
      as the difference in steady state glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with and without Ex-9.&#xD;
      The difference will be expressed as a percentage of glucose stimulated insulin secretion&#xD;
      without Ex-9, and serve as the primary variable for comparison among the lean, obese and&#xD;
      diabetic cohorts.&#xD;
