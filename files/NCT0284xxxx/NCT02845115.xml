  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the population, and greater exposure to noise, are responsible for an increased&#xD;
      incidence of hearing loss (presbycusis). This hearing loss is sensorineural disability that&#xD;
      has become a real public health problem. The main means of rehabilitation of this disability&#xD;
      is represented by the apparatus of patients with conventional hearing aids. However, these&#xD;
      hearing aids have several drawbacks that limit their profits, often abandoning the prosthesis&#xD;
      by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Middle ear implants were developed to answer these problems. They are intended to amplify the&#xD;
      sound signal by transmitting directly to the middle ear to compensate for the hearing loss&#xD;
      and are indicated in case of failure or contraindication of conventional equipment. However,&#xD;
      these middle ear implants currently have limitations as performance failure. Recent data show&#xD;
      that the performance of the ossicles repair techniques are dependent on the coupling of the&#xD;
      ossicular prosthesis to the ossicles. Furthermore, advances in the understanding of the&#xD;
      biomechanics of the ossicles confirm the importance of the placement and linkage of surgical&#xD;
      restoration processes. This data can be applied to middle ear implants to improve&#xD;
      performance. Indeed, a preliminary experimental study on anatomical parts, using analysis of&#xD;
      the vibration of the middle ear structures by laser velocimetry, allowed the investigators to&#xD;
      define the transducer placement method and coupling method to ossicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators wish to validate in vivo results in a pilot study on a small number of patients&#xD;
      by comparing two surgical techniques guided by velocimetric measures.&#xD;

    <description>Usual implantation technique of a middle ear implant. The principle of the ossicular stimulator middle ear transducer MET 7000 (Middle Ear Transducer, METTM) is to directly transmit sounds on the ossicles bypassing the outer ear. Their constraint is the surgical placement of the implant.&#xD;
MET 7000 system (OTOLOGICS LLC, USA) is the implant that the investigators will use for their patients. The stimulator is usually placed against the body of the anvil by simple contact in the case of sensorineural hearing loss. In the case of mixed hearing loss, the stimulator will come in contact with the bracket using a titanium clip (ossicular prosthesis used in otologic surgery for ossiculoplasties). The optimized version corresponds to the use of the conventionally used in mixed deafness and applied to neurosensory deafness art. It is screwed onto the mastoid bone, the motor is suspended in the mastoid cavity and transmits vibrations to the body of the anvil by simple contact of the transducer.</description>
