  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance leading to right ventricular failure and eventually to death. The&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy has become complex and needs to perform recurring follow up evaluations&#xD;
      including right heart catheterizations (RHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) has the advantage to accurately assess right&#xD;
      ventricular volumes and important prognostic predictors such as cardiac index, stroke volume&#xD;
      and right ventricular ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of EVITA is to assess the hemodynamic diagnosis performances at baseline&#xD;
      and at follow up visits of cMRI in comparison with the results of the RHC (current&#xD;
      guidelines) to detect an unfavorable hemodynamic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is sensitivity and specificity of cMRI for the diagnosis of an&#xD;
      unfavorable status defined by the current RHC criteria (with 95% confidence interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are 1) to identify clinical and hemodynamic variables independently&#xD;
      contributing to prognosis, 2) to describe complications due to cMRI and to RHC, 3) to compare&#xD;
      acceptability and tolerability of cMRI over RHC for the patient and 4) to constitute&#xD;
      biological collection of blood samples to determine diagnostic and prognostic PAH biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH patients will be recruited in centers of the French network of severe pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension in a prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      180 subjects will be enrolled in the study: that size will give the study 90% power to find&#xD;
      significant at the 5%-level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the primary endpoint were achieved, since first, strategies and procedures planed in this&#xD;
      project are consistent with those currently used in routine and second, inclusion criteria&#xD;
      are not limited to a sub-population of PAH patients, positive results could allow to broadly&#xD;
      extend our findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it will be possible to decrease the number of RHC, an invasive and cumbersome&#xD;
      procedure without altering the prognosis. Moreover, all clinical procedures would be&#xD;
      performed in outpatient clinics and thereby would reduce the cost to assess the severity of&#xD;
      the disease. Current recommendations for evaluation of severity and follow-up being mainly&#xD;
      derived from consensus of opinion of the experts, positive results will also improve the&#xD;
      level evidence of severity assessment of PAH patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to secondary objectives we expect to better predict morbimortality events with cMRI&#xD;
      compared to RHC.&#xD;

      EValuation of cardiac magnetic resonance Imaging in follow up assessmenT of patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary Arterial hypertension (EVITA) is a prospective cohort study of cMRI in PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVITA is a multicenter biomedical research study. All the investigation centers belong to the&#xD;
      French network of severe pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance leading to right ventricular (RV) failure and eventually to death. The&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy has become complex and needs to perform recurring follow up evaluations&#xD;
      including right heart catheterizations (RHC). Although, RHC performed in experience centers&#xD;
      has low mortality and low morbidity, repeated invasive pulmonary hemodynamic measurements are&#xD;
      burdensome and still presents some risk of complications. Once the diagnosis of PAH is&#xD;
      established, follow up evaluation devoted to modifying specific therapy relies mainly on RV&#xD;
      function parameters. Thus, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI)&#xD;
      meet many of the criteria of ideal monitoring tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography is safe, inexpensive and widely available. However, this test has several&#xD;
      limitations. Firstly, due to the complexity of the right ventricle chamber, the measurement&#xD;
      of RV volumes is difficult. Secondly, criteria are numerous and for quantitative measurements&#xD;
      different thresholds are applied without accepted definition. Thirdly, operator dependency&#xD;
      could make it difficult to obtain reproducible images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI has the advantage to accurately assess RV volumes and important prognostic&#xD;
      predictors such as cardiac index, stroke volume (SV) and right ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      (RVEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that inter-observer and intra-observer variability for cMRI right&#xD;
      ventricle measures in PAH patients were low. In addition, MRI-derived cardiac index, SV and&#xD;
      RVEF significantly improved after few months of PAH specific therapy and had prognostic&#xD;
      values regardless of changes of pulmonary vascular resistance in few trials of small size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study performed in the CHRU-Nancy the investigators found in 21 subjects&#xD;
      with PAH a significant correlation between cardiac output measured with cMRI and RHC (0.85,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the agreement between the 2 methods was correct according to&#xD;
      Bland-Altman plot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate a strategy for assessing PAH severity. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to replace a currently recommended method, i.e. RHC, by cMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers plan to use validated cardiac MRI measurements of RV volumes and cardiac&#xD;
      output to demonstrate that cMRI can accurately assess the severity of the disease in a&#xD;
      follow-up strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this project are to show that an assessment of the severity of the disease&#xD;
      by a non-invasive pulmonary hemodynamic measurement using the cMRI is as effective as the&#xD;
      RHC, and that it is reliable and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the performance of the cMRI (sensitivity and specificity)&#xD;
      at baseline and during follow-up visits to detect an unfavorable hemodynamic state compared&#xD;
      to the results of the RHC (current guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the predictive value of the first morbi-mortality event in 2 different&#xD;
           analyses derived, firstly from RHC criteria (cardiac index (CI)&lt; 2.5 l/min/m² or a right&#xD;
           atrial pressure &gt; or = 8 mm Hg) and secondly from cMRI criteria (CI &lt; 2.5 l/min/m² or&#xD;
           RVEF &lt; 35% or an absolute decrease of 10% of RVEF at a follow-up evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the link between the first morbi-mortality event and New York Heart&#xD;
           Association (NYHA) functional class, 6-minute walk distance, plasma level of B-type&#xD;
           natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal(NT)-proBNP, and continuous hemodynamic variables&#xD;
           from cMRI, RHC and echocardiography, data collected at baseline and after 3-6 months of&#xD;
           follow-up in univariate analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the link between the first morbi-mortality event and the above factors,&#xD;
           identifying clinical and hemodynamic variables independently contributing to prognosis&#xD;
           in multivariate anlyses. Using the results of this analysis the investigators plan to&#xD;
           build a multiparameter prognostic score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To quantify complications due to cMRI and to RHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare acceptability and tolerability of cMRI over RHC for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To create a biobank for diagnosis and prognosis purposes This study is a prospective&#xD;
           cohort study. PAH patients will be recruited in 20 centers of the French network of&#xD;
           severe pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A routine search for conditions known to cause pulmonary hypertension will be performed&#xD;
      according to current guidelines. Therefore, all patients will undergo at baseline an&#xD;
      echocardiography, an RHC and other routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A determination of NYHA functional class, BNP or NT-proBNP, 6-minute walk test and ECG 12&#xD;
      derivation should be performed at the earliest 2 days before the RHC during the screening&#xD;
      period. As a reminder, RHC and cardiac MRI should be performed within 5 working days. Other&#xD;
      examinations should be performed 12 months prior to the initial visit if the patient is&#xD;
      prevalent, or 3 months prior to the initial visit if the patient is an incident patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any specific PAH treatment is already in place (less than one year prior to the date of&#xD;
      inclusion), it should be in stable dose for at least 1 month prior to the initial baseline&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the screening period. Then all patients selected will sign the written informed&#xD;
      consent of the main study, then the consent for the biobank if they accept them. The consent&#xD;
      for the genetic study may be obtained at these visits or at a follow-up visit (no later than&#xD;
      24 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of blood samples on one vein of the forearms for the biobank (and possibly for&#xD;
      genetic analysis) will take place during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, in the context of the study, a cMRI will be performed at the baseline visit&#xD;
      (V1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the current guidelines shortly after the baseline visit (V1) PAH-specific drug&#xD;
      therapy will be initiated or associated to the treatment already in progress in incident&#xD;
      cases or prevalent cases, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period will be 24 months. A comprehensive severity evaluation will be performed&#xD;
      after 3-6 months (V2 or V3) of the inclusion visit, after 24 months after the inclusion visit&#xD;
      (V9) and in case of clinical worsening. According to current guidelines, these follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will include NYHA functional class, 6-minute walk distance, plasma level of&#xD;
      BNP/NT-proBNP and RHC. As part of one of the secondary objectives, 22 ml of venous blood will&#xD;
      be collected during all RHC. During the visit 3-6 months (V2 or V3), 5 ml of blood from the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery will be taken. Throughout the 24-month follow-up, patients will be seen on&#xD;
      an outpatient basis every 3 or 6 months, depending on the pratices of each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up an echocardiography could be carried out at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator at any visit in accordance with the current recommendations. According to the&#xD;
      purpose of the present study, at all these visits a cMRI will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical procedures except cMRI and blood sample for the biobank, are those of standard&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality will be collected prospectively up to 48 months (maximum delay) or&#xD;
      until the last patient has completed his 24-month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RHC will be performed according to currently recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI data interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI protocol and post-processing guidelines will be sent prior to site initiation in order to&#xD;
      apply the same method of cMRI in all centers. This will avoid important measurement error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RV contouring and indexed aortic flow measurement will be performed locally with the&#xD;
      dedicated software used in clinical practice by the physicians of each center. Cardiac index&#xD;
      and RVEF will be derived from these measures. All cMRI images will be sent and stored at the&#xD;
      CHRU Nancy. MRI interpretation will be performed blindly with respect of clinical and RHC&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be collected during the follow up. The questionnaire assessing&#xD;
      physical and psychological distress will be presented a few minutes after all RHC and all&#xD;
      cMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      180 subjects will be enrolled in the study: that size will give the study 90% power to find&#xD;
      significant at the 5%-level a sensitivity or specificity of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  90% with a lower 95% confidence limit of 75%,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60% with a lower 95% confidence limit of 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will be performed in the intention-to-treat and&#xD;
      confirmatory analyses in the per-protocol populations. The 2-tailed significance level will&#xD;
      set to p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses to respond to the main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to assess the sensitivity and specificity cMRI regarding the&#xD;
      diagnosis of unfavorable hemodynamic status determined from RCH measurements. Exact 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals of sensitivity and specificity will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses to respond to secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaplan Meier life tables and curves will be produced as well as estimates of survival&#xD;
      (morbi-mortality event) according to cMRI and RHC criteria given in the primary end point&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Association between baseline factors and time to the first event of morbi-mortality will be&#xD;
      assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Candidate factors will be identified among&#xD;
      cMRI, RHC and echocardiography measurements along with NYHA functional class, 6-minute walk&#xD;
      distance, plasma level of BNP/NT-proBNP and other potential baseline characteristics using&#xD;
      univariable analysis. Factors found significant at the p&lt;0.20 level will then be entered in a&#xD;
      multivariable analysis with stepwise forward-backward selection. Only factors significant at&#xD;
      the p&lt;0.05 level will be kept in final multivariable model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same analyses will be repeated on data collected after 3-6 months of PAH specific&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of cMRI and RHC will be collected. The frequency of adverse events reported&#xD;
      during the follow-up will be compared between groups using the Chi-Square test (or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test where requested).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative tolerability of cMRI and RHC will also be collected. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test to determine if the overall physical and psychological distress scores&#xD;
      are different across the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the primary endpoint were reached, positive results could allow to broadly extend our&#xD;
      findings. Therefore, it will be possible to decrease the number of RHC, an invasive and&#xD;
      cumbersome procedure without altering the prognosis. Positive results will also improve the&#xD;
      level evidence of severity assessment of PAH patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the secondary objectives the investigators expect to better predict&#xD;
      morbi-mortality events with cMRI compared to RHC. Thus, a composite score will be constructed&#xD;
      including cMRI parameter and will be internally validated. Such a score can then be easily&#xD;
      externally validated and widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ancillary study will be carried out in a few centers. This ancillary study is entitled&#xD;
      &quot;BI4P: BIomecanical Property of Pulmonary artery and Prognosis assessment in Pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of BI4P is to assess the hemodynamic diagnosis performance of&#xD;
      biomechanical parameters of the pulmonary artery at baseline and at follow up visits of 4D&#xD;
      MRI to detect an unfavorable status in comparison with the results of the RHC.&#xD;
