      The objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and efficacy of FCH-PET/CT and to&#xD;
      establish our ability to reproduce results from the literature using FCH-PET/CT as a&#xD;
      diagnostic and decision making tool in the management in two predefined groups of prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients, specifically, biochemical recurrence and high risk staging. The primary&#xD;
      endpoints of the study are the incidence of adverse events (AE) in the study population up to&#xD;
      24 hours following the scan, and the sensitivity and specificity of FCH-PET/CT vs CT on a&#xD;
      per-patient and per-lesion basis.&#xD;

      Background Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in North American men&#xD;
      older than 50 years. Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear&#xD;
      medicine procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabeled tracer&#xD;
      molecules. A common radiotracer in use today is 18F-fluoromethylcholine (aka fluorocholine or&#xD;
      FCH) which is a radiolabeled choline derivative. Imaging with FCH-PET/CT can be used to&#xD;
      characterize and localize prostate cancer in vivo. There is extensive data in the literature&#xD;
      showing the value of FCH-PET/CT imaging in accurately staging and restaging prostate cancer.&#xD;
      FCH-PET/CT is standard of care in many European countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives The objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      FCH-PET/CT and to establish our ability to reproduce results from the literature using&#xD;
      FCH-PET/CT as a diagnostic and decision making tool in the management in two predefined&#xD;
      groups of prostate cancer patients, specifically, biochemical recurrence and high risk&#xD;
      staging. The primary endpoints of the study are the incidence of adverse events (AE) in the&#xD;
      study population up to 24 hours following the scan, and the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      FCH-PET/CT vs CT on a per-patient and per-lesion basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This will be a multi-center open label study in which one (1) FCH-PET/CT will be&#xD;
      performed on study participants. A PET/CT scan takes 2-3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety FCH-PET/CT exhibits favorable dosimetry, delivering organ doses that are comparable to&#xD;
      or lower than those delivered by 18F-FDG. The safety of FCH is not disputed and we expect the&#xD;
      number of adverse events in our study to be zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Recruitment Target enrollment is 1500 patients. This will be sufficient to&#xD;
      detect AE with a prevalence of 0.3% with 99% confidence. For efficacy endpoints,&#xD;
      approximately 500 subjects would provide 90% power at the alpha=0.05 one-sided level of&#xD;
      significance that the specificity and sensitivity will be superior to the specificity and&#xD;
      sensitivity under the null hypothesis. Patients will be recruited by urologists in the&#xD;
      clinical setting. Initial contact and consent will be by the department of urology.&#xD;
