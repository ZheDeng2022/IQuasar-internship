      Research investigating beneficial effects of regular pistachio feedings on body composition&#xD;
      (BC) and blood lipids are limited, and there are no studies that have investigated the&#xD;
      effects of feeding pistachios on bone density or membrane incorporation of fats. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the effects of pistachio consumption on body composition, bone&#xD;
      density, markers of bone turnover, erythrocyte membrane incorporation of fatty acids, lipid&#xD;
      status, inflammatory markers, dietary quality/micronutrients and satiety using a cross-over&#xD;
      study with two 12-week treatment periods (pistachio added (20 percent of kcals) and a&#xD;
      no-pistachio control diet), separated by 15-week washout period. The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit 30 female students from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo (CP-SLO) and female 30 students&#xD;
      from Cal Poly, Pomona (CP-P) facilitating a collaborative project and using the expertise of&#xD;
      both Dr. Laura Hall (CP-SLO) and Dr. Bonny Burns-Whitmore (CP-P). The investigators hope to&#xD;
      show the health benefits of pistachios as part of an overall healthy lifestyle.&#xD;

      Primary Research Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the effects of a diet rich in pistachios on body composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine incorporation of healthy fats into red blood cell (RBC) membranes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine changes in blood lipids, inflammatory markers and markers of bone turnover&#xD;
           with pistachio consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess diet quality/micronutrient quality and satiety with pistachio consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Investigators will employ a crossover design with two 12-week treatment periods&#xD;
      (pistachio added and a no-pistachio control diet), separated by 15-week washout period, with&#xD;
      30 healthy students at each campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Female students enrolled at CP-SLO and CP-P will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The first 30 qualified females will be enrolled in the study at each site. A screening&#xD;
      questionnaire will determine eligibility. The interview will take ~5 minutes. This sample&#xD;
      size provides more than adequate power (80%) to detect individual changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Female students enrolled at CP-SLO and CP-P will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Potential subjects will be notified by flyers, emails, adds on marquees, and peer&#xD;
      recruitment in summer school classes. The information on the flyer and emails will be&#xD;
      approved by the Institutional Review Boards and contain information regarding&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, length of study, and the risks and benefits. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to contact either Dr. Laura Hall (CP-SLO) or Dr. Bonny Burns-Whitmore (CP-P) and&#xD;
      then potential participants will be asked to fill out a screening questionnaire to determine&#xD;
      eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Methods We will employ a randomized crossover design with two 12-week&#xD;
      treatment periods: pistachio added (20% of kcals) and a no-pistachio control diet), separated&#xD;
      by 15-week washout period, with 30 healthy female students at each campus. The first&#xD;
      treatment period will be in Fall 2012 and the second treatment period will be in Spring 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to treatment (pistachios) or habitual (control) diet and 24-hour recalls&#xD;
      Randomization will be done utilizing a www.randomization.com list of random appointments to&#xD;
      either the treatment group first or the control group first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits: Participants will come to the CP-SLO (n=30) or CP-P (n=30) site once a week&#xD;
      during Fall quarter for 12 weeks and again during Spring quarter for 12 weeks to pick up&#xD;
      their pre-measured pistachios for a total of 24 total study visits. At the initial visit,&#xD;
      half the participants will be given pistachios to include in their diet as snacks or in meals&#xD;
      (20 percent of kcals; intervention group) while half will continue their normal diets&#xD;
      (control group). During, Spring, the other half of the participants will switch and consume&#xD;
      the pistachios while the first half will not. Diet counseling will also be given at these&#xD;
      visits and compliance to study protocols will be evaluated by counting the number of&#xD;
      pistachio packages and looking at the participant's Unusual Diet Diary. At baseline and end&#xD;
      of each treatment period, participants will have their height, weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      hip circumference, body composition measured and blood drawn at both sites. At CP-SLO they&#xD;
      will also have their bone density measured (DXA). At the CP-P site they will have a fatty&#xD;
      acid analysis performed to examine monounsaturated fatty acid incorporation into red blood&#xD;
      cells (RBCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation/Distribution of Pistachios and Initial/Weekly Study Visits During the lead-in&#xD;
      period participants will meet initially and will be trained on keeping their food records by&#xD;
      a Registered Dietitian (RD). During this week they will each keep a 3-day food record and&#xD;
      turn it in immediately. The researchers will calculate how many pistachios each participant&#xD;
      needs based off of the initial 3-day food record. This amount will be substituted as 20&#xD;
      percent of their usual caloric need and it will be pre-measured into daily&#xD;
      individually-wrapped servings. The researches will meet with the participants weekly to give&#xD;
      them a week's supply of their pre-measured packet of pistachios (one for each day). They will&#xD;
      be asked to bring in their used wrappers to the weekly counseling meetings. At the weekly&#xD;
      counseling meetings, participants will be shown how to incorporate the pistachios into their&#xD;
      diet (either as snacks or in recipes) in an isocaloric diet, to check the participant's&#xD;
      unusual diet diary and food records for accuracy, to review the 'MyPlate' guidelines and to&#xD;
      check the empty pistachio wrappers for compliance. Participants will also get email/text&#xD;
      reminders about meetings and reminder instructions on how to prepare for study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collected at both sites during Fall 2012 (wk 1 and wk 12) &amp; Spring 2013 (wk 1 and wk&#xD;
      12):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Measurements: Body weight will be measured using a calibrated scale and&#xD;
      recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height will be measured using a stadiometer and recorded to&#xD;
      the nearest 0.1 cm. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as weight (kg) divided by height&#xD;
      (m) squared. Waist circumference will be measured using a flexible measuring tape between the&#xD;
      middle of the bottom rib and iliac crest (top of the hip bone) and recorded to the nearest&#xD;
      0.1 cm. Hip circumference will be measured using a flexible measuring tape around the largest&#xD;
      part of the hips (i.e. buttocks) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. Measurements will be&#xD;
      taken twice and averaged. We will also calculate their waist-to-hip ratio. Protocols will be&#xD;
      based on NHANES III standardized procedures and student volunteers will be thoroughly trained&#xD;
      on these protocols (see link-NHANES) Blood Pressure: Blood pressure will be taken using an&#xD;
      automatic blood pressure monitor. Protocol will be based on Mayo Clinic standardized&#xD;
      procedures and student volunteers will be thoroughly trained on these protocols (see&#xD;
      link-Mayo Clinic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition Measurement: Body fat percentage will be assessed by bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      analysis using the Tanita Body Composition Analyzer Scale (model TBF-310); from Tanita&#xD;
      Corporation, (Tokyo, Japan). It will also be used to measure weight, body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      percent body fat, impedance, fat mass (TBF), fat free mass (FFM), total body mass (TBM), and&#xD;
      total body water (TBW). The participants will need to fast for 12 hours before their study&#xD;
      visit (i.e. no caffeine in the morning but 1.5 cups of water prior to the visit will be&#xD;
      encouraged).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Records/Unusual Diet Diary (ie. Dietary Adherence &amp; Compliance): Adherence and&#xD;
      compliance to the assigned diets will be assessed using an Unusual Diet Diary (developed at&#xD;
      CP-P), which is filled out by the participant when unusual quantities of foods or accidental&#xD;
      pistachio consumption occurs, medical treatment is required, a suspected allergic&#xD;
      reaction/side effect occurs or pharmaceuticals are consumed. If a participant experiences an&#xD;
      allergic reaction to pistachios they will have been told to call 911 and after contacting the&#xD;
      researchers, they will be removed from the study to limit further risk. Food records will be&#xD;
      administered during each treatment to obtain information regarding the subject's diet and&#xD;
      determine if the subject is adhering to treatment protocols. Participants will be thoroughly&#xD;
      trained on how to keep accurate food records. Participants will be asked to perform 9&#xD;
      randomly selected food records throughout the study. Investigators will use the Nutrition&#xD;
      Data System for Research (NDSR) from the University of Minnesota on both campuses for the&#xD;
      diet analysis software (see NDSR link).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satiety and Hunger ratings: Participants will rate their hunger using a rating scale (1-10)&#xD;
      before, during and after each snack or meal directly on their 9 required food records during&#xD;
      each treatment, and will use a validated visual analog scale (VAS) to rate their hunger after&#xD;
      consuming their snack or meal with pistachios for the intervention group and randomly chosen&#xD;
      snacks/meals for the control group. Participants will be given binders with the food record&#xD;
      forms and VAS questionnaires in them with the randomly chosen dates and instructions listed.&#xD;
      Completed forms will be checked for accuracy and collected at the weekly visits from the&#xD;
      binders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire: Participants will be asked to recall their physical activity&#xD;
      level over the preceding week (7 day recall) using the 2002 International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form. Participants will be encouraged to maintain their usual&#xD;
      levels of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chem Panel/Iron Panel/Blood Lipids: Blood will be drawn on campus at the Health Center at&#xD;
      week 1 and 12 to examine a lipid panel, a standard chem. panel and iron status. The&#xD;
      participants will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, however, consuming 1.5&#xD;
      cups of water in the morning will be encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory Markers: Blood will be drawn on campus at the Health Center at week 1 and 12 to&#xD;
      examine inflammatory markers (ie, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha&#xD;
      (TNFa), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)). The participants will need to fast for 12 hours before the&#xD;
      blood draw, however, consuming 1.5 cups of water in the morning will be encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of Bone Turnover: Blood will be drawn on campus at the Health Center at week 1 and 12&#xD;
      to examine markers of bone turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collected at the Cal Poly, SLO site only :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition/Bone Mineral Density (DXA): Full-body DXA (iDXA, General Electric&#xD;
      Healthcare) will be used to determine body fat mass, body fat percentages, lean body mass and&#xD;
      bone mineral density of each subject. A pregnancy test will be given to participants before&#xD;
      the test to ensure safety of the fetus. If positive, the participant will be asked to&#xD;
      terminate their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collected at the Cal Poly, Pomona site only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythrocyte Membrane Incorporation (Lipomics): Erythrocytes membranes will be measured for&#xD;
      all fatty acids. Erythrocytes will be packed in dry ice and shipped overnight to Lipomics&#xD;
      Technologies, West Sacramento, California 95691.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: A statistician will be consulted and all statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS version 9.2). Time-repeated analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) will be performed for comparisons between the variables during the two time&#xD;
      points and ANOVA's will be performed between the two treatment groups. Spearman's correlation&#xD;
      will be used to examine associations between the variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debriefing of Participants: Subjects will be consented to this study and will be aware of the&#xD;
      purpose of this study. All subjects will be given a copy of the consent form.&#xD;
