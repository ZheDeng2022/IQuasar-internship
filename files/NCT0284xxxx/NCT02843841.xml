  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of allograft rejection in kidney transplantation requires administering to the&#xD;
      patient an immunosuppressive regimen of induction. The induction strategy is based on an&#xD;
      injection of polyclonal anti-lymphocyte globulin (ATG-FLAG or fresenius®) driving a&#xD;
      lymphocyte lysis, or an injection of monoclonal antibodies directed against non-lymphopenic&#xD;
      the α chain of the IL-receptor 2 (anti-CD25 antibody, basiliximab), by immunological risk&#xD;
      patients. Our group showed a significant increase in death rates in transplant patients with&#xD;
      lymphopenia CD4 continued beyond 2 years of transplantation. This excess mortality is related&#xD;
      to complications following chronic inflammation observed in some patients lymphopenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies have shown that the induced lymphodéplétion ATG appears to be accompanied&#xD;
      by an increase of the bacterial products in the blood of transplanted since a significant&#xD;
      increase in the sCD14 is observed in these patients one year. We also observed increased&#xD;
      concentrations of LPS in patients in the ATG group. This could indicate a secondary bacterial&#xD;
      intestinal translocation to a weakening of intestinal immunity linked to the ATG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess the impact of anti-lymphocyte globulin&#xD;
      polyclonal on intestinal permeability, estimated by the rate lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a&#xD;
      constituent of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria) blood after kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate bacterial translocation, the effect of bacterial&#xD;
      translocation on structural and metabolic functions of the intestinal epithelium, chronic&#xD;
      inflammation, immune reconstitution, regeneration, activation and proliferation of T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, the polymorphism of the LPS receptor that causes the activation of innate&#xD;
      immunity and the composition of the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of renal transplant patients of Nephrology of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Besancon. Patients will be divided into 2 groups according to induction&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy prescribed the day of renal transplantation as part of their usual&#xD;
      care, ie treatment with anti-lymphocyte globulin polyclonal (ATG-Fresenius®) or antibody&#xD;
      treatment monoclonal anti-CD25 (basiliximab Simulect). The patient group treated with&#xD;
      anti-CD25 antibody will serve as a control group (no depletion of the immune system) to the&#xD;
      group of patients treated with ATG.&#xD;
