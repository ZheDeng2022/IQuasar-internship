    <textblock>
      Sleepwalking (also called somnambulism) is a disorder in which only SWS is disrupted. This&#xD;
      NREM parasomnia is characterized by inappropriate motor behaviors, usually initiated during&#xD;
      arousal from SWS, that induce psychological distress and alter quality of life, leading to&#xD;
      fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, and objectively impaired vigilance in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of sleepwalking remains poorly understood. Sleepwalkers had difficulty&#xD;
      maintaining stable, consolidated sleep and experienced more arousals and microarousals,&#xD;
      specifically from SWS, leading to increased NREM instability, especially during the first&#xD;
      sleep cycles. The brain is partially awake, resulting in behavioral manifestations, and&#xD;
      partially in NREM sleep, resulting in no conscious awareness of actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Single Photonic Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) study of one sleepwalking episode&#xD;
      found increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum, with&#xD;
      deactivation in the frontoparietal associative cortices. Data from intracerebral EEGs during&#xD;
      confusional arousals confirmed both local arousal of the motor and cingulate cortices and&#xD;
      increased delta activity in the frontoparietal associative cortices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators thus proposed a controlled study of SPECT imagery in 24 sleepwalkers (12&#xD;
      SPECT during a SW episode and 12 SPECT during slow wave sleep and 24 during wakefulness) and&#xD;
      12 controls (during slow wave sleep and wakefulness). SW episodes will be elicited by sleep&#xD;
      deprivation condition associated with forced arousal (auditory stimulus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparative analyses of SPECT acquisitions between different states (wakefulness, slow&#xD;
      wave sleep and SW) and populations (sleepwalkers versus controls) will provide new insights&#xD;
      about the complex pathophysiology of SW episodes.&#xD;
