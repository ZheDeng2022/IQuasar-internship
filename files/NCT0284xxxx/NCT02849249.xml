    <textblock>
      The study was designed according to the draft of allergenic product regulation published by&#xD;
      Spanish Regulatory Agency. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      subcutaneous immunotherapy with polimerized (100/100) mixture of pollens: Olea europaea and&#xD;
      Phleum pratense in patients with rhinoconjunctivitis with or without associated mild asthma.&#xD;
      In addition, surrogate efficacy parameters will be evaluated: immunoglobulin level changes&#xD;
      and skin reactivity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must sign the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be between 18 and 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis produced by Phleum pratense and&#xD;
             Olea europaea during at least 2 years prior to participating in the study. Although&#xD;
             the pathology being studied is allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, patients who have&#xD;
             concomitant mild or moderate asthma may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have had a skin prick test result ≥ 3 mm in diameter against Phleum&#xD;
             pratense and Olea europaea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who have specific IgE ≥ class 2 (CAP/PHADIA) to Phleum pratense and Olea&#xD;
             europaea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients will preferably be polysensitized to Phleum pratense. Polysensitized patients&#xD;
             to otherallergenic sources may only be included in the study if their other&#xD;
             sensitizations are produced by:&#xD;

                  Olea europaea.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Pollens whose seasons do not overlap with Phleum pratense or Olea europaea and&#xD;
                  which are not expected to produce symptoms during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Other allergens which are not expected to produce symptoms during the study&#xD;
                  period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the time&#xD;
             they begin the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients who received immunotherapy in the previous 5 years for Phleum pratense and&#xD;
             Olea europaea or for any allergen with cross reactivity or patients that are currently&#xD;
             receiving immunotherapy for any allergen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with severe asthma or forzed expiratoy volumen in 1 second FEV1&lt; 70% even if&#xD;
             the are pharmacologically controlled .&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with: immunological, cardiac, renal or hepatic illnesses or any other medical&#xD;
             condition that the investigator deems relevant so as to interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a previous history of anaphylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with chronic urticaria,&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have participated in another clinical trial within 3 month prior to&#xD;
             enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients under treatment with tricyclic antidepressives, phenothiazines , β- blockers,&#xD;
             or Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
