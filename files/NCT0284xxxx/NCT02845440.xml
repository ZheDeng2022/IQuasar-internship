  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to test the effect of academic detailing (i.e.&#xD;
      provider-level educational intervention focused on evidence-based smoking cessation treatment&#xD;
      for those with psychiatric illness), alone or in combination with practical support from a&#xD;
      community health worker, on the provision and utilization of standard of care smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment to those with serious mental illness (SMI). Further, this study will&#xD;
      determine if these interventions improve smoking cessation rates for adults with SMI who&#xD;
      smoke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to test whether a provider-level educational&#xD;
      intervention in the form of targeted, practical, action-oriented education to primary care&#xD;
      physicians and nurses on safety and effectiveness of and how to use evidence-based smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment for those with psychiatric illness, termed academic detailing (AD), alone&#xD;
      or in combination with practical support offered to the primary care physician / primary care&#xD;
      team and the smoker with SMI in the form of a community health worker (CHW) will improve&#xD;
      recommendation and utilization of standard of care smoking cessation treatments to and by&#xD;
      those with SMI and, if so, whether the intervention improves smoking cessation rates for&#xD;
      adults with SMI who smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do so, the investigators will randomize primary care clinics that serve approximately 1300&#xD;
      adult smokers with SMI who receive psychiatric rehabilitation services, Community Based&#xD;
      Flexible Support (CBFS) or Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)), from the two largest&#xD;
      providers of these services in the Boston area to either receive AD for their prescribers or&#xD;
      not in a cluster randomized design. Half of the smokers with SMI in the study who receive&#xD;
      primary care at the clinics assigned to the AD intervention to providers will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to be offered CHW support in addition to their ongoing psychiatric rehabilitation&#xD;
      (CBFS or ACT) services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also utilize mixed methods research to identify and define barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to implementation of components of the integrated care intervention in primary&#xD;
      care clinical settings using an interactive convergent mixed-methods design. The aim of this&#xD;
      portion of the study is to better understand the factors that impact the integration of&#xD;
      Integrated Care and evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation for those with SMI in&#xD;
      primary care settings. Qualitative interviews will be conducted for enrolled participants,&#xD;
      CHWs, primary care physician, and stakeholders.&#xD;
