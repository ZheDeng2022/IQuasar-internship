      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Cannabidiol Oral Solution on&#xD;
      hyperphagia-related behavior in subjects with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, impact on&#xD;
      quality of life, and impact on physical activity of Cannabidiol Oral Solution in subjects&#xD;
      with PWS.&#xD;
