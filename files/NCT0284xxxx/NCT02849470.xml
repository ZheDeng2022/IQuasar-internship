      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cosmetic discipline of hair restoration is rooted in numerous landmark studies and&#xD;
      progressive medical science in the medical literature. , , , , With the advent of advance&#xD;
      theories and science within the scope of regenerative medicine, numerous reports are noted in&#xD;
      the literature. , , , , , using biological modalities, e.g., HD-PRP concentrates defined as &gt;&#xD;
      4-6 times patient circulating baselines, for stimulation of scalp tissues and hair follicles&#xD;
      in androgenetic alopecic (AGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of this study is intended to be a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial with&#xD;
      blinding of outcomes for independent observer, clinical provider and patient&#xD;
      observation/satisfaction studies. The study proposes adipose-derived (AD) biocellular&#xD;
      material when mixed with platelet high density concentrates (HD-PRP) offers a potential&#xD;
      advantage for a markedly more effective therapeutic profile in areas of follicular&#xD;
      miniaturization, tissue age related senescence, and effect the decreased vascular&#xD;
      capabilities by stimulation of vasculoneogenesis. The benefits of using autologous&#xD;
      adipose-derived stem/stromal cell (ADSCs) populations are cell proliferation and&#xD;
      vasculogenesis that is intrinsically linked with native immunomodulatory capacities. Reports&#xD;
      describing the safety and efficacy of this biocellular combination have been reported in peer&#xD;
      reviewed literature. , In the second and third arm of this study, the use of regenerative&#xD;
      protocols currently being utilized in the treatment of degenerative musculoskeletal&#xD;
      conditions is employed. These protocols feature the use of an emulsified AD-tSVF and&#xD;
      emulsified cell enriched AD-cSVF containing the full heterogeneous stem/stromal cell&#xD;
      population and matrix that is injected into the regions of scalp containing the&#xD;
      microenvironment (niche) of the hair follicle. In Arm 3, cellular enrichment of the&#xD;
      emulsified AD-tSVF is accomplished via a semi-automated, closed sterile system (Healeon&#xD;
      CentriCyte 1000 system) to isolate and concentrate AD-cSVF. The AD-cSVF is then mixed with&#xD;
      high-density platelet rich plasma (HD-PRP) concentrates and emulsified AD-tSVF tissues&#xD;
      (AD-tSVF) prior to scalp injection. This injected cell-enriched product contains native&#xD;
      adipose tissue scaffolding, autologous HD-PRP, and enriched adipose stem/stromal&#xD;
      cell-enriched concentration of stromal/stem cells (AD-cSVF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the HD-PRP + AD-tSVF +&#xD;
      AD-cSVF biocellular injections into the scalp of men and women with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      non-scaring alopecias, with full reporting of AE and SAE (adverse events). The biocellular&#xD;
      material is injected 3-5 mm in depth within the mid-reticular dermis to upper subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat layer of the scalp for the purpose of regenerating the miniaturized hair follicle, and&#xD;
      delivering a milieu of stromal/stem cells that facilitate regenerative changes within the&#xD;
      tissue sites. In addition to providing tissue scaffolding, and a greater number of&#xD;
      stromal/stem cells to the tissues surrounding the follicular niche, the novel use and&#xD;
      emulsification of AD tissues with cell-enriched biocellular material permits ergonomic&#xD;
      facilitation of layered injection patterns in the scalp with small gauge (25-27 gauge)&#xD;
      needles This emulsified AD Biocellular methodology reduces injection pressure requirements&#xD;
      using smaller gauge needles. When clinically compared to the use of much larger needles&#xD;
      required to inject non-emulsified AD-tSVF, it is an improvement on current techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful stem/stromal cell-enrichment of AD-tSVF and HD PRP biocellular mixture has been&#xD;
      reported in numerous peer-reviewed and published clinical experiences of injections for&#xD;
      structural tissue augmentation in plastic surgery, chronic wound therapies, and ultrasound&#xD;
      guided musculoskeletal treatments in orthopedic surgery. A &quot;retrograde&quot; filling technique&#xD;
      creating a potential space and subsequently injecting into this space the biocellular&#xD;
      material as the needle is withdrawn is advanced in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo venipuncture for obtaining HD-PRP concentrates following FDA&#xD;
      approved Emcyte II manufacturer's guidelines. Those patients having biocellular treatment&#xD;
      with also undergo a small volume closed syringe microcannula lipoaspiration to acquire&#xD;
      AD-tSVF tissues, which will be emulsified via the Healeon ACM System per manufacturer's&#xD;
      guidelines. Cellular testing of samples in Arm 2 and Arm 3 will be performed by flow&#xD;
      cytometry (ORFLO, MoxiFlow, Ketchum, ID, USA) for viability and cell concentrations. The&#xD;
      trial will include the biocellular mixture of HD-PRP + emulsified AD-tSVF (Arm 2) and/or,&#xD;
      HD-PRP + emulsified AD-tSVF + AD-cSVF (Arm 3). Study will utilize a standardized high-density&#xD;
      PRP concentration system on all patients in the same volume. The definition of HD-PRP&#xD;
      concentrates is a minimum =/&gt;4 times patient circulating platelet counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed patient medical history, informed consent, and screening evaluation will determine&#xD;
      eligibility and candidacy for the study. Each patient will undergo a small volume&#xD;
      lipoaspiration (defined as &lt;100 cc) under local anesthesia with, or without, oral sedation.&#xD;
      Candidates will be assigned to one of three treatment ARMs. The treatment ARMS are: ARM 1:&#xD;
      HD-PRP + Matristem Matrix (A-Cell) (control); ARM 2: HD-PRP + emulsified AD-tSVF; and, ARM 3:&#xD;
      HD-PRP + emulsified AD-tSVF + cell-enriched AD-cSVF. All patients will receive a standard&#xD;
      ring block local anesthesia of the scalp treatment areas, followed by retrograde injection&#xD;
      pattern of the biocellular material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of the platelet baseline and treatment concentrates, flow cytometric examination of&#xD;
      cell viability, and cell counts of AD-cSVF will be completed on each patient. Biocellular&#xD;
      injections and treatment will be given on two (2) separate procedures three (3) months apart.&#xD;
      Follow up clinical examinations are to be performed at 6 months and 1year period with&#xD;
      completion of outcomes analyses including independent observer, clinician, and subject&#xD;
      satisfaction. The volume of the HD-PRP concentrates will be the standardized in volume for&#xD;
      all trial ARMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate reporting to the study group for all AR and SAR will be documented and recorded for&#xD;
      the safety records directly to Ken Williams, DO, as Principal Clinical Investigator. This&#xD;
      Clinical Trial will have a sample size of 60 patients at up to six (6) centers utilizing the&#xD;
      same protocols, equipment and reporting requirements.&#xD;
