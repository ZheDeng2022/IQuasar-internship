      This research study aims to predict treatment response to anti-angiogenic therapy (Avastin)&#xD;

      This research study is an Imaging Study, in which investigators are examining if advanced&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) are able to predict the outcome of&#xD;
      participants with a brain tumor (glioblastoma) treated with an anti-angiogenic treatment&#xD;
      called Avastin (Avastin is the trade name for bevacizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI studies the tumor size and other physical aspects of a tumor and the MRS adds an&#xD;
      additional analysis that measures the chemical changes that a tumor undergoes. This study&#xD;
      aims to test whether addition of MRS to standard MRI testing will help better predict how a&#xD;
      tumor is responding to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI/MRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avastin Avastin works by interfering with the process of new blood vessel growth and is&#xD;
           thus an anti-angiogenic. Avastin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
           for use in Glioblastoma .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's treating physician may complement the Avastin treatment with chemotherapy&#xD;
      including Temozolomide (TMZ) or Lomustine (CCNU). Both treatments are approved by the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration for use in Glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to predict treatment response to anti-angiogenic therapy in&#xD;
      brain tumor participant using advanced MRI and MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI/MRS is an FDA-approved test that uses magnets to take pictures of the brain and lets us&#xD;
      &quot;see inside&quot; the body/brain without surgery.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma and evidence of&#xD;
             recurrence. Patients with low-grade tumors who have progressed to glioblastoma are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥&#xD;
             10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be anti-angiogenic therapy naïve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years. We exclude children because the chances of recruiting children with&#xD;
             recurrent glioblastoma who will be treated with bevacizumab are small.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to undergo MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants whose clinical care plan includes treatment with bevacizumab mono-therapy&#xD;
             (Group I) or bevacizumab (+ cytotoxic agents Temozolomide (TMZ) or Lomustine (CCNU).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have already received anti-VEGF or investigational anti-angiogenic&#xD;
             therapy for glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of MR imaging on the&#xD;
             fetus are unknown and gadolinium-based intravenous contrast material is not&#xD;
             recommended for use in pregnant patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with bevacizumab, Temozolomide (TMZ)&#xD;
             or Lomustine (CCNU).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are no suitable to undergo MRI or use gadolinium contrast due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of metallic objects or implanted medical devices in body (i.e. cardiac&#xD;
                  pacemaker, aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial hearts, valves&#xD;
                  with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or steel&#xD;
                  implants)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sickle cell disease&#xD;
