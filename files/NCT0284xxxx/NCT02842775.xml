    <textblock>
      Cervical myelopathy is common among the aging population.One of the complications of cervical&#xD;
      myelopathy is balance impairment.In this study, the patients with cervical myelopathy undergo&#xD;
      biomechanical, imaging, neurophysiological and functional assessment. Besides, the dynamic&#xD;
      balance training is introduced to the patients with cervical decompression surgery.This study&#xD;
      is expected to provide important empirical evidence to evaluate the prognosis of the surgery,&#xD;
      to further guide the postoperative rehabilitation of myelopathy patients and to improve&#xD;
      patients' long-term quality of life.&#xD;

      Taiwan is quickly becoming a nation of the aging population with myelopathy reporting to be&#xD;
      one of the most common spinal cord disorders associated with spinal degeneration. Given the&#xD;
      high prevalence rate of the condition, current project aims to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      myelopathy on motor control from a biomechanical perspective with the overall aim to develop&#xD;
      an interactive balance perturbation rehabilitation program targeting individual patients and&#xD;
      identified the deficiency. The efficacy of the individual rehabilitation program will be&#xD;
      assessed and determined to utilize a prospective longitudinal study design. A break down of&#xD;
      the proposed three-year project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 1: Myelopathy patients prepared to receive cervical decompression surgery as well as&#xD;
      age-matched asymptomatic controls will be recruited and subjected to the following clinical&#xD;
      evaluations: 3-dimensional biomechanical motion analysis, diagnostic Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging, pain and disability questionnaires, motor performance assessment, spinal curvature,&#xD;
      muscle strength assessment as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation examination. Motor&#xD;
      control and coordination of functional movements will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 2: Continue to recruit potential participants and further develop the use of the&#xD;
      interactive split-belt balance perturbation treadmill as modalities for gait and balance&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 3: Physical Therapy rehabilitation programs at 3-month post surgery, one group will&#xD;
      participate in a specific and personalized interactive balance perturbation training program&#xD;
      targeting balance and gait retraining, while the other group receives the routine Physical&#xD;
      Therapy program. Both treatment groups will be assessed pre-operatively, at 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months postoperatively. Patients will be classified based on their severity and grade of the&#xD;
      spinal cord compression before being compared for any difference in treatment responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 4: Follow-up monitoring and documenting the number of falls experienced by patients at&#xD;
      one year postoperatively as an outcome of effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome and significance The findings from the current project will provide&#xD;
      important empirical evidence to guide the postoperative rehabilitation of myelopathy&#xD;
      patients. Through detailed biomechanical motion analysis, it is anticipated that this project&#xD;
      will provide an in-depth understanding of the influence of decompression surgery on motor&#xD;
      control and spinal stability. The tailored and innovative rehabilitation program will also&#xD;
      improve patients' long-term quality of life.&#xD;
