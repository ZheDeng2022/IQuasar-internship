  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether the gut microbiome is involved in determining whether children&#xD;
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) develop worsening GI symptoms (e.g. pain) when given&#xD;
      fructans (a sugar often found in wheat). Participants will both receive a diet with fructans&#xD;
      and a diet without fructans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fructans (fructo-oligosaccharides) are a type of carbohydrate which can not be hydrolyzed by&#xD;
      humans. It is commonly found in wheat in the American diet. After ingestion they arrive&#xD;
      essentially intact into the colon where they are metabolized by the colonic microbiome.&#xD;
      Fructan avoidance has been found to help decrease gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. pain) in&#xD;
      those with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However not all individuals with IBS have worsening symptoms when eating fructans in their&#xD;
      diet. This study seeks to evaluate whether the microbiome is involved in determining whether&#xD;
      an individual with IBS has worsening symptoms with fructan ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a one week baseline period, participants will be randomized in a double-blind&#xD;
      cross-over fashion to either a 72 hour meal period with fructans or a 72 hour meal period&#xD;
      with maltodextrin (placebo). A washout period of at least 10 days will occur in between.&#xD;
      Symptoms will be captured using a stool and pain diary. Stool specimens and urine specimens&#xD;
      will be obtained at baseline and during the dietary interventions. Breath hydrogen testing&#xD;
      will be obtained during the dietary interventions.&#xD;
