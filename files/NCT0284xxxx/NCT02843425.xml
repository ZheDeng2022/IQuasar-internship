  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because either you are a survivor who has a&#xD;
      previous history of colorectal cancer or an MD Anderson patient who had a precancerous&#xD;
      colorectal polyp or you have a previous history of colorectal cancer, and you have a current&#xD;
      adult body mass index (BMI) score of 25 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BMI score is used as an indicator of the level of body fat, based on height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if eating canned, pre-cooked beans can&#xD;
      help improve the levels of healthy bacteria in the digestive system and reduce the effects of&#xD;
      obesity on cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to&#xD;
      1 of 2 study groups (intervention or control). This is done because no one knows if one study&#xD;
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Both groups will be given a diet to&#xD;
      follow for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group participants will add canned beans into their diets beginning at Â½ cup per&#xD;
      day. This will be increased to 1 cup per day during the first 2 weeks, and then will continue&#xD;
      at 1 cup per day for the following 6 weeks of the study. You will be asked to keep a log of&#xD;
      your bean consumption during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group participants will be instructed to follow their normal diet (not including&#xD;
      beans) for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active participation on the study will last a total of 20 weeks. Your participation on&#xD;
      the study will be over after the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 2 times each year for up to 5 years, a member of the study staff will contact you and&#xD;
      ask about how you are doing. You will be contacted by phone, email, or standard mail. These&#xD;
      calls will last 15-20 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months and 1 year after your last visit, you will complete the same questionnaires you&#xD;
      completed at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, your waist measurements and weight will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for&#xD;
      routine tests. You will be asked to bring a stool sample to each visit and mail a stool&#xD;
      sample at the end of week 1 during the intervention. You will be provided with a container&#xD;
      and instructions to collect each stool sample. You may send your stool sample back to the&#xD;
      study staff by mail. If you choose to send it by mail, you will be given a pre-paid envelope&#xD;
      for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4, your study group assignment will be switched, and you will be assigned to the&#xD;
      opposite group and diet from your first assignment (meaning intervention group members will&#xD;
      be switched to the control group as well as the other way around). You will follow this new&#xD;
      diet for the remaining 8 weeks.&#xD;
