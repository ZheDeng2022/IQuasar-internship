      The diagnosis of LAP (lesions Ano-perineal) requires the inspection, palpation, anoscopy and&#xD;
      possibly additional examinations including endoscopy and imaging; any of these steps of the&#xD;
      diagnosis can only be replaced by another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of data in the literature on the evaluation of specific LAP Crohn inspection,&#xD;
      Clemence Horaist et al established definitions of these lesions inspection with the help of&#xD;
      an expert group, then evaluated the diagnostic agreement LAP these definitions in the same&#xD;
      group from a selection of photographs. Definitions ulceration, fistula, inflammatory external&#xD;
      os, erythema and abscess had an acceptable agreement diagnosis (kappa&gt; 0.70)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LAP is a predictor of severe Crohn's disease, hepato any gastroenterologist it is&#xD;
      appropriate that recognizes and adopts adequate care, this care has been a consensus in 2014.&#xD;
      The interns Hepato gastroenterology must learn during their training to know the terminology&#xD;
      of LAP Crohn inspection and to recognize so considered acceptable by experts.&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators work is to show that training giving the consensus&#xD;
      definitions of Crohn's lesions on inspection and typical images of these lesions is effective&#xD;
      to enable students to achieve a level of diagnosis of these lesions acceptable to experts&#xD;
      (ideally not significantly different from that of the experts). Assuming alternates, we will&#xD;
      identify difficult diagnosis of lesions for students to find the most appropriate teaching&#xD;
      method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: all Gastroenterology Hepato-house of France (including overseas&#xD;
      territories)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      non-interventional multicentre prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      February 2015 to July 2015&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Clinical Research Centre of the coordinating center. Quantitative&#xD;
      variables are expressed by their mean, standard deviations, their minimum and maximum values&#xD;
      as appropriate. The variables will be expressed in numbers and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A broad group of experts (19 proctology and a dermatologist) will be contacted to choose&#xD;
           two typical images of LAP (superficial ulceration, deep ulceration ...) from a selection&#xD;
           of photos and give their opinions about fistula definition proposal. (Photos used does&#xD;
           not identify patients, they have just typical lesions of LAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical pictures chosen by the experts will be integrated into the training material issued&#xD;
      after 1 internal questionnaire. This support will appear on one page and resume the&#xD;
      definitions established by experts with or without the typical pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Internal Gastroenterology France (about 470 domestic total) will be contacted by email,&#xD;
           their department heads have been told that work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Internal will inform their characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Internal details: name, email address&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Year boarding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  boarding area.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Validation IUD (inter-university degree) 1st / 2nd year of proctology.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conducting an internal internship in a proctology service?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participation in specific courses on the LAP?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  buddy Training on LAP?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sending a first questionnaire to internal Google Drive: description pictures of LAP (12&#xD;
           photos lesion initially selected by experts) using checkboxes. Eg ulceration: YES / NO /&#xD;
           DO NOT KNOW (Figure 1). The Google Drive platform enables automatic input results in a&#xD;
           Microsoft Excel database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Draw (using a randomization list EXCEL based on the random function of EXCEL) of 2&#xD;
           groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group A (training with typical definitions established + photos)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group B (only definitions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sending mail to the board of education, different depending on the group, the internal&#xD;
           will have as long as they wish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sending a second questionnaire with pictures of different LAP those of the first&#xD;
           questionnaire. Answers by checkboxes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis: a schedule will each questionnaire with a weighting based on the primary /&#xD;
           secondary diagnosis. A comparison of pre and post training scores will be performed. And&#xD;
           this difference may be calculated between the two groups A and B. In addition, the&#xD;
           difficult diagnosis of lesions will be identified.&#xD;
