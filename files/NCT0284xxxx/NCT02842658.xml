  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supervised exercise-training program,&#xD;
      initiated prior to chemotherapy induction (pre-conditioning) and continued throughout&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment, can preserve short- and long-term cardiovascular performance,&#xD;
      skeletal muscle function, cognitive ability and quality of life better than current standard&#xD;
      or care recommendations for exercise during chemotherapy.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of a novel, high-intensity aerobic&#xD;
      interval exercise preconditioning protocol to ameliorate anthracycline-mediated cardiac and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle toxicity in women with breast cancer undergoing de novo chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with breast cancer scheduled to undergo de novo chemotherapy with anthracyclines will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Qualified patients will be randomized to either 1) a high-intensity interval&#xD;
      exercise group, or 2) an attention-control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised exercise training will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic Cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      center in Arizona on cycle ergometers using Electrocardiogram (EKG) telemetry. Patients in&#xD;
      the high-intensity interval exercise group will perform four, 4-min intervals at 85-90% peak&#xD;
      heart rate (PHR), separated by 3 min at 50% PHR. Each training session will begin with a&#xD;
      10-minute warm-up at 50% of PHR and end with a 5-min cool down at 50% PHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attention-controls will receive counseling consistent with standard of care regarding&#xD;
      physical activity during chemotherapy. Attention-control group will receive a weekly phone&#xD;
      call to maintain physical activity during chemotherapy and compliance will be verified using&#xD;
      physical activity diaries and pedometers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for each group will commence 1-week prior to chemotherapy induction. The first dose&#xD;
      of chemotherapy will be given within 16-18 hours of the last bout of exercise. High-intensity&#xD;
      intermittent exercise (HIIE) training will be continued throughout four, 2-week cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (total training time = 9 weeks, 3 days/week).&#xD;
