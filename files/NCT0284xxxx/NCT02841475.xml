  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common condition whose prevalence increases with advancing age&#xD;
      . One of the main complications of this arrhythmia is the occurrence of systemic&#xD;
      thromboembolism, the first of which the occurrence of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) . The&#xD;
      advanced age itself is an independent risk factor for occurrence of stroke in the context of&#xD;
      AF , evidenced by the score awarded to the age over 75 years in the risk estimate&#xD;
      thromboembolism in the score CHA2DS2-Vasc . Making the elderly a priority target for the&#xD;
      prevention of thromboembolism, both because of the increased thromboembolic risk and&#xD;
      prevalence of AF in this population. For many years, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have proven&#xD;
      their effectiveness in this context . But the effectiveness and safety of thromboembolism&#xD;
      prevention by anti-vitamin K treatment involves maintaining the INR (International Normalized&#xD;
      Ratio) in the therapeutic range. Indeed occurred of a thromboembolic or haemorrhagic adverse&#xD;
      event directly correlates to having an INR outside the therapeutic range and maintaining the&#xD;
      INR in the therapeutic range is subject to many variations inter- and intra-individual. They&#xD;
      include, genetic factors , food , drug interactions , as well as disease processes . Or one&#xD;
      of the elderly characteristics is the coexistence of multiple pathological processes or&#xD;
      comorbidities . The supposed interaction between comorbidities and variability of INR has&#xD;
      been little studied: Only a few studies have examined the factors associated with the&#xD;
      stability of the INR and unstable . The identification of patients at risk of instability INR&#xD;
      yet allow clinicians greater vigilance and better identification of patients for whom the&#xD;
      initiation of treatment with vitamin K does not appear the best therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study seeks to determine whether comorbidity, assessed by the Charlson comorbidity index,&#xD;
      are associated with instability of the INR, among more than 80 years for patients treated&#xD;
      with AVK atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
