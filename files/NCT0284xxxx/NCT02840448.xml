      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with Williams Syndrome (WS) and supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) have less&#xD;
      elasticity in their blood vessels. This is called blood vessel stiffness. Blood vessels may&#xD;
      have focal narrowings called stenoses or may just be globally more narrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to see how blood vessel differences in people with Williams Syndrome and&#xD;
      supravalvular aortic stenosis affect organs in the body including the heart, gut, kidneys,&#xD;
      and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3-85 who have WS or SVAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers ages 3-85&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have yearly visits for up to 10 years. All participants will be&#xD;
           offered the same tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give consent for the study team to review their medical records. If&#xD;
           the participant is a child or an adult with WS, a parent or guardian will give the&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the NIH where they will have a physical exam and medical&#xD;
           history. Based on their health history, participants will undergo a series of imaging&#xD;
           tests and measures of blood vessel function over the course of 2-4 days. Tests of&#xD;
           cognitive abilites will also be performed. Blood will be drawn and an IV may be placed&#xD;
           for specific tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elasticity in the aorta buffers the body from damage due to pulsatile blood flow. Data from&#xD;
      humans and mice show that with increasing age, vessels lose elasticity and become stiff.&#xD;
      Vascular stiffness is associated with progressive cognitive impairment and dementia in aging&#xD;
      adults, but little is known about the effects of early-onset/congenital vascular stiffness.&#xD;
      Similarly, elastin-mediated arteriopathy in the form of stenosis has the potential to impact&#xD;
      additional end organs such as the heart, lungs, gut, skeletal muscle and kidney causing&#xD;
      feeding and exercise intolerance, as well hypertension. This study evaluates the impact of&#xD;
      elastin arteriopathy and vascular stiffness on end organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent, the investigators will work with the subjects and their caregivers to&#xD;
      determine which tests are most appropriate for the patient based on their age/capabilities&#xD;
      and preferences and may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  testing of cognitive and neurobehavioral abilities as well as measures of general health&#xD;
           and well being&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo non-invasive measurements of vascular stiffness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo brain imaging by MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo ultrasound imaging and flow studies of various vascular beds and tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo CT angiogram of relevant vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  undergo non-invasive tissue oxygenation and endothelial functional assessment with near&#xD;
           infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of the limbs and/or head/brain (fNIRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perform a 6 minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perform pulmonary function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive an eye exam and Optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  give blood/urine for relevant laboratories&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate biomechanical properties of skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate baseline fitness information using a fitness tracker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete medica photography evaluating relevant features of the condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive a dental examination and dental photography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits may be conducted in person at the Clinical Center, by telehealth, or with a&#xD;
      combination of in person and telehealth, at the discretion of the study team. When telehealth&#xD;
      is used, only testing that can be performed at home (e.g. clinical consultations,&#xD;
      neurobehavioral testing, fitness tracking, ambulatory ecg monitoring, and photography) will&#xD;
      be selected. The other tests require the individual to be on site at the CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, some participants may have certain consultations at home and other testing on&#xD;
      site to limit time in the CC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will request permission to review the participant's medical records&#xD;
      to obtain additional information about general and cardiovascular health. For individuals&#xD;
      with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) or Williams syndrome (WS), the clinical report&#xD;
      confirming the individuals diagnosis will be reviewed when available.&#xD;
