  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human safety studies were carried out to test whether hop botanical dietary supplements used&#xD;
      by peri- and post-menopausal women are safe to use with Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA)-approved drugs. To test this, a hop dietary supplement (previously tested in women at&#xD;
      the University of Illinois at Chicago without any harmful effects) was given with four&#xD;
      selected FDA-approved drugs to determine if the hop supplement can increase or decrease how&#xD;
      these medications are absorbed, metabolized and excreted by the human body. Preclinical&#xD;
      studies had predicted that the hop supplement might affect the metabolism or break down of&#xD;
      these probe drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the start of a study, subjects were administered low doses of a mixture of four&#xD;
      FDA-approved drugs (caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and alprazolam), and serial&#xD;
      blood samples were drawn and analyzed for the concentration of each drug over time.&#xD;
      Afterwards, participants consumed the hop dietary supplement twice daily for 14 days to allow&#xD;
      for potential inhibition or induction of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters.&#xD;
      Thereafter, the same drugs were taken again to obtain a second measure of drug concentrations&#xD;
      in blood over time. Changes in the concentration-time curve values for each probe drug&#xD;
      obtained before and after ingestion of the supplement would indicate that metabolism of the&#xD;
      probe drugs is impacted by the hop dietary supplement.&#xD;
