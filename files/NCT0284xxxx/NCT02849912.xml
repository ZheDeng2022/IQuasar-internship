    <textblock>
      Non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the 5th cancer in France. Advances in NHL therapy have resulted&#xD;
      in improved cure rates with a 5 year relative survival rate estimated at 55% and a 5-year&#xD;
      prevalence estimate of 27,750 cases. Since 2000, the addition of anti-CD20 antibody to the&#xD;
      standard treatment regimen composed of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and&#xD;
      prednisone (CHOP) led for the first time to decline of the specific mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, patients with NHL experienced elevated risks for therapy-related leukemia,&#xD;
      several solid tumors and late toxicities such as cardiovascular or neuro-psychiatric diseases&#xD;
      which impact on quality of life. However little is known concerning long-term toxicity of&#xD;
      this class of new agents so called &quot;targeted drugs&quot; such as anti-CD20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this cohort study is to estimate long term toxicity in NHL patients&#xD;
      (i.e. 10 to 20 years) using data already collected (i.e. internal analysis) and to compare&#xD;
      drugs consumption to that of controls (i.e. external analysis).&#xD;

      The French public healthcare system perspective developed a unique SNIIR-AM (interregimens&#xD;
      National Information Health Insurance system.) data base that contains up to 18 TeraOctet of&#xD;
      medical consumption data (consultations, exams and drug prescriptions and hospitalization,&#xD;
      yes/no). Its main limitation to detect disproportionate consumption after cancer care is the&#xD;
      lack of data available on socio-demographic, pre-diagnostic patient and disease&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LYSA (Lymphoma Study Association) is a national cooperative group which is world pioneer&#xD;
      in NHL treatment with novel agents. Patient's bio clinical and demographic characteristics&#xD;
      (n=10.000) are fully monitored and stocked in a data base registered in 2006 by the French&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (INCA). The cooperative network of 100 LYSA centre allows following&#xD;
      all the patients on long term (up to 20 years after diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the mixture of these two sources of data will offer a unique material at the nation&#xD;
      scale to detect signal of late onset disease, possibly linked to the initial cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Disproportionate reporting of drugs consumption in fields of&#xD;
      neuro-psychiatric troubles, cardio-vascular diseases, anti-cancer agents, antibiotics and&#xD;
      antiviral agents will be extract from the French public healthcare database (external&#xD;
      analysis). An economical study is embedded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the LYSA data contained all fully monitored patients' bio clinical and demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, special attention will be paid to the addition of new agents, in particular&#xD;
      anti-CD20 antibody, to the cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in conjunction with other&#xD;
      well-known risk factors (e.g. tobacco, obesity, comorbidities; internal analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be reported according to the initial NHL treatment strategy and cross-validated by&#xD;
      long-term medical consultations. Multivariate analysis will be computed to account for&#xD;
      competing risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results No studies have yet been published in France on the use of care issues in long&#xD;
      remission or cure of cancer. There are very few international publications on this subject&#xD;
      and they lacked of statistical power or follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project follows the recommendation from the French Medicine Academy which in its&#xD;
      March 15, 2011 decision call for more rigorous follow up of new agents in Oncology. In&#xD;
      addition, this project is in concordance with the so named &quot;plan cancer 2&quot; from the INCA&#xD;
      which aimed to focus on sequels in cancer survivors. If the results of this study are&#xD;
      relevant, the investigators should have to run through the consumption of care, a good&#xD;
      objective (unbiased) indicator of healing and Health-related quality of life (HRQL) in cancer&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such an indicator could help to learn about survivors recovery after their cancer, with or&#xD;
      without differences according to the patient characteristics, initial location of the cancer,&#xD;
      its treatment and possible iatrogenic complications.&#xD;
