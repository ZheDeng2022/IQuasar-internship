      In this trial, various factors that may influence the antibiotic concentrations measured in&#xD;
      the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients are studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first factor is aerosol use. As cystic fibrosis patients often use aerosols, such as&#xD;
      hypertonic saline, dilution of the antibiotics in sputum can be expected. The extent of this&#xD;
      dilution is unknown and will be determined by comparing sputum samples collected before and&#xD;
      after the use of an aerosol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second factor is the homogeneity of the antibiotics within one sputum sample. Multiple&#xD;
      aliquots of the same sputum sample will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third factor is the variability between several sputum samples collected during a drainage&#xD;
      session. The antibiotic concentrations in 3 separate sputum samples will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final goal is to standardise the sputum sample collection and processing of the samples&#xD;
      to ensure a accurate concentration measurements in sputum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic therapy is a cornerstone in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF). Nevertheless,&#xD;
      little research focusses on the actual concentrations reached in the lung secretions of CF&#xD;
      patients. As the pathogens causing the expedited decline in lung function primarily reside in&#xD;
      the lung secretions, many physicians are now interested in these data. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators have developed and validated a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy&#xD;
      (UPLC-MS/MS) method to quantify the intravenous administered beta-lactam antibiotics&#xD;
      ceftazidime, piperacillin and meropenem, as well as inhaled aztreonam in the sputum of CF&#xD;
      patients. Besides having a validated analytical method, the sample collection and sample&#xD;
      preparation needs to be standardised as the well to ensure an accurate concentration&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, three factors which may cause a bias in the concentration measurements in&#xD;
      sputum are studied using sputum from patients receiving therapy with one of the IV&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first factor is aerosol use. As cystic fibrosis patients often use aerosols, such as&#xD;
      hypertonic saline, Ventolin or Pulmozyme, dilution of the antibiotics in sputum can be&#xD;
      expected. Likely, the moments at which patients use aerosols will need to be considered when&#xD;
      collection sputum for antibiotic concentration measurements. To investigate the extent and&#xD;
      duration of a concentration change induced by aerosol use, a sputum sample is collected&#xD;
      before aerosol use and right after completion of the aerosol as well as 30 min, 1h and 2h&#xD;
      after completion of the aerosol, more samples are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second factor is the homogeneity of the antibiotics within one sputum sample. Sputum&#xD;
      samples generally have a heterogeneous appearance. To investigate if the distribution of&#xD;
      antibiotics is heterogeneous as well, the concentration of multiple aliquots of the same&#xD;
      sputum sample will be compared. Five aliquots will be tested and the remaining sputum is&#xD;
      homogenised and analysed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third factor is the variability between several sputum samples collected during a&#xD;
      autogenous drainage session. A drainage session lead by a physiotherapist takes approximately&#xD;
      30 minutes and aims to loosen and remove the thick lung secretions as much as possible. It&#xD;
      can be assumed that sputum spontaneously expectorated in a drainage session originates from&#xD;
      different parts of the lung. To verify if the antibiotics are homogeneously or&#xD;
      heterogeneously distributed in the lungs, sputum samples are collected in the beginning,&#xD;
      middle and at the end of the drainage session. The antibiotic concentrations in the 3&#xD;
      separate sputum samples will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data originating from these 3 tests will allow to standardise the time point of sample&#xD;
      collection with respect to aerosol therapy and autogenous drainage as well as to evaluate if&#xD;
      homogenisation of the collected samples is necessary.&#xD;
