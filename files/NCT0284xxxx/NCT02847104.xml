  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit (ICU) patients commonly display hyperglycemia, even without previously&#xD;
      known diabetes. It was demonstrated that hyperglycemia was associated with increased hospital&#xD;
      mortality in various medical and surgical ICU situations. However, discrepant results from&#xD;
      recent randomized, clinical trials of tight blood glucose control in ICUs have not allowed&#xD;
      conclusions regarding whether there is a causal link between hyperglycemia and ICU mortality.&#xD;
      In addition to the mean blood glucose level, glucose variability has recently been emphasized&#xD;
      as an independent predictor of ICU and hospital mortality. This concept has been described in&#xD;
      a wide variety of medical, surgical and trauma ICU patients. In all of these settings,&#xD;
      glycemic variability was measured with various indices but was steadily associated with ICU&#xD;
      and/or hospital mortality in non-diabetic ICU patients. Conversely, glycemic variability was&#xD;
      either weakly or not associated with mortality in ICU patients with previously known&#xD;
      diabetes. Notably, all of these data have been observational, and interventional trials&#xD;
      remain lacking to assess the impact of glycemic variability reduction on ICU mortality and&#xD;
      thus to demonstrate causality. However, glycemic variability was considered sufficiently&#xD;
      important to be mentioned in recent international guidelines for the management of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia in critically ill patients. In these publications, experts from the American&#xD;
      College of Critical Care Medicine emphasized that glycemia should be maintained at less than&#xD;
      9.9 mmol/L in ICU patients while avoiding hypoglycemia and minimizing glycemic variability.&#xD;
      To achieve these goals, computer-based insulin infusion protocols have demonstrated their&#xD;
      superiority to paper-based protocols. Glucose concentrations, variation per unit of time&#xD;
      between the last and current glucose measurements, insulin dosage, and carbohydrate intake&#xD;
      were the main input variables used in these different computerized algorithms. However, such&#xD;
      protocols are not widely available because commercial systems have licensing fees and&#xD;
      academic protocols do not always go beyond the pilot phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this issue, the investigators adapted a previously validated, paper-based, dynamic&#xD;
      protocol (DP) to an actual recommended glycemic target range. Our aim was to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, feasibility and acceptance by nurses of this dynamic insulin protocol,&#xD;
      compared to a paper-based, sliding scale static protocol (SP).&#xD;

        This prospective trial involved adult patients who were admitted to the medical intensive&#xD;
        care department of a French university hospital to compare the effects of two continuous&#xD;
        intravenous insulin infusion (CIII) protocols on glycemic variability. According to the&#xD;
        local protocol, patients with two consecutive capillary blood glucose measurements greater&#xD;
        than 180 mg/dL (9.9 mmol/L), one hour apart, were considered to require CIII and were&#xD;
        included in the trial. All of the patients or their family members received written&#xD;
        information about the trial.&#xD;
