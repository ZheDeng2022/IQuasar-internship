  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the magnitude of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) -induced cognitive and functional change in patients with mild traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury. This study will also attempt to identify biomarkers associated with treatment&#xD;
      response. Last, acceptability and tolerability of procedures will be assessed. To accomplish&#xD;
      these aims, a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel groups, pilot study will be&#xD;
      conducted in which participants are assigned to 24 sessions of tDCS or sham stimulation&#xD;
      offered concurrent with working memory training. Neural efficiency will be measured with&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) pre and post-intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive neuromodulation&#xD;
      technique that shows promise as an intervention technique. The primary aim of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the magnitude of tDCS-induced cognitive and functional change in patients with mild&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this double-blind, sham-controlled, pilot study, 24 veterans&#xD;
      with mild TBI will be randomized to tDCS or sham conditions. Stimulation will be administered&#xD;
      with a StarStim neurostimulator at 2 milliamps (mA) for 20 minutes. The anodal electrode will&#xD;
      be placed over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Twenty-four sessions of stimulation&#xD;
      will be administered concurrent with 20 minutes of working memory training. Participants will&#xD;
      continue with an additional 40 minutes of working memory training post-stimulation.&#xD;
      Participant experience with neuromodulation will be assessed with a self-report questionnaire&#xD;
      that lists common reactions to tDCS. Participant perception of the value of neuromodulation&#xD;
      procedures will be assessed at weeks 4 and 8. A second aim is to identify biomarkers of&#xD;
      treatment response. Resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) will be collected at three time&#xD;
      points: prior to the first tDCS training session, immediately after the first training&#xD;
      session, and post-intervention. This study will provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy&#xD;
      of providing tDCS as an intervention to enhance cognitive and functional outcomes for&#xD;
      individuals with mild traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, the results of this study will&#xD;
      also increase the understanding of the mechanisms by which tDCS enhances cognitive&#xD;
      performance. This knowledge has the potential to provide insight into the underlying&#xD;
      therapeutic process as well as to guide development of the next generation of interventions.&#xD;
      In addition, acceptability of the intervention will be monitored to identify potential&#xD;
      barriers to administering tDCS in clinical practice.&#xD;
