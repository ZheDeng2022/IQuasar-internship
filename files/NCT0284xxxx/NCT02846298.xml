    <textblock>
      Since the discovery of streptomycin in 1944, aminoglycosides retain a remarkable bactericidal&#xD;
      activity vis-à-vis including aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Thus, their synergistic effect&#xD;
      with beta-lactams and their rapid bactericidal on many make unavoidable pathogens and make it&#xD;
      a cornerstone of the treatment of patients with severe sepsis or state of septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is antibiotics exclusively parenteral administration. Their effectiveness is&#xD;
      concentration-dependent and are administered by 30-minute infusion. Tolerance of venous is&#xD;
      usually excellent. Their potential nephrotoxicity or cochleovestibular toxicity requires&#xD;
      accurate monitoring of antibiotic residuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover the fact that the effectiveness of the aminoglycosides is concentration dependent,&#xD;
      the rate at the peak is decisive. A first sub-therapeutic dose leads to adaptively resistant&#xD;
      bacteria compared to the aminoglycoside and therefore an increase of Minimal Inhibitory&#xD;
      Concentrations (MIC). Many studies have been conducted in patients hospitalized in intensive&#xD;
      care, highlighting underdoses in aminoglycosides when the prescribed dosages consistent with&#xD;
      those used in non reanimated patients. Dr Moore showed in 89 ICU patients with bacteremia&#xD;
      gram-negative bacilli, the relationship between the clinical course and obtaining whether&#xD;
      therapeutic levels during the first administration of aminoglycosides. Thus, mortality in&#xD;
      patients whose antibiotic concentrations to peak were subtherapeutic, amounted to 20.9%&#xD;
      against 2.4% when concentrations were within the therapeutic range. In the context or an&#xD;
      initial peak in the PK / PD ( Pharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic) objectives namely Cmax / MIC&#xD;
      ≥ 8-10 desirable, individualized therapeutic drug monitoring and identification of factors&#xD;
      that may cause a concentration of antibiotic at sub-therapeutic peak seems necessary , in&#xD;
      patients for the majority an increased volume of distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the β-lactams and glycopeptides, due to the increased volume of distribution&#xD;
      in critically ill patients in sepsis, evaluation of serum 24 hours after starting treatment&#xD;
      to check that the PK / PD goals for these molecules is achieved.&#xD;

      Primary / secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to conduct a study with the goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the rate of patients for whom efficacy endpoint PK / PD Cmax / MIC ≥ 8-10 is&#xD;
           reached at the first dose of the usual doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the 30-day mortality among patients with subclinical a first rate versus those&#xD;
           who have reached the desired peak&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the rate of patients for whom PK / PD efficiency target for related antibiotics&#xD;
           is reached:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum residual&gt; 4X MIC for the β-lactam rate and continuous function of β-lactam&#xD;
                and the germ.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum between 25 and 35 mg / L vancomycin continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the factors associated with obtaining a rate of aminoglycoside subtherapeutic&#xD;
           peak in a population of critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the residual to 12h after injection to an anticipation of residual dosed at 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type Of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective, single-center type of professional practice evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected duration of the study six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective inclusion: 50 to 100 patients. Computing the number of patients to be included&#xD;
           was done via the BioStaTGV software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description Of the study (according to recommendations):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission of patients in intensive care unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levy peak aminoglycoside 30min after the end of the 30 minutes of infusion the first&#xD;
           administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of residual aminoglycoside to + 12h and between 23h-30 and 24 hours after&#xD;
           injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extraction of the residual H + 24h, 30 min before injection to the β-lactam associated&#xD;
           administered discontinuously or without time constraints if administration batchwise to&#xD;
           the β-lactam and vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routing unsettled and not frozen tubes in &lt;2 hours of collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reception and registration levy of the laboratory assay of anti-infective under his&#xD;
           usual care as recommended service&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of aminoglycoside and vancomycin immunoturbidimetric method (Indiko PLUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Β-lactam assay by LC-MS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rendering the usual result (result server consultation for partial and report PDF&#xD;
           available on the patient's medical record DXcare).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Director-post of MIC of aminoglycoside and β-lactam vis-à-vis the offending germ for&#xD;
           each bacterial strain isolated and documenting infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Destruction Levies: levies will not be retained after being used for the study. They&#xD;
           will be destroyed in accordance with the rules of good practice research laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring and support:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be collected on a computer CRF including clinical, biological and&#xD;
      microbiological data of patients via the patient's medical record on DXcare: demographics,&#xD;
      weight, height, BMI, hydration status, kidney function, liver function, shock, chronic heart&#xD;
      failure, malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia burned, cirrhosis, chronic rheumatic disease, other&#xD;
      antecedents, pregnancy, reason for hospitalization, etiology of sepsis motivating the&#xD;
      introduction of aminoglycosides, β-lactam or glycopeptide and also other associated&#xD;
      treatments. The data collected will help identify risk factors associated with a&#xD;
      sub-therapeutic dosing aminoglycosides, β-lactam or glycopeptide.&#xD;
