  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unlike older adults with hip osteoarthritis, young adults with pain in the groin, lateral hip&#xD;
      or buttock do not have general loss of ROM, but have a specific directional motion loss, such&#xD;
      as hip flexion and internal rotation. Therefore, the most common manual therapy designed to&#xD;
      gradually improve hip range of motions (ROM) for osteoarthritis, long axis distraction, may&#xD;
      not be appropriate for treating young adults with hip pain. A manipulation technique,&#xD;
      unrestrained femoral internal rotation (UFIR), was designed specifically for treating young&#xD;
      adults' hip pain. Manipulation is a procedure that involves the use of a high- amplitude and&#xD;
      low-velocity thrust at the mid or end range of a restricted joint for the purpose of&#xD;
      improving range of motion (ROM) within the joint and the ability of the joint to tolerate&#xD;
      loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although clinicians routinely use this hip manipulation technique for treating young adults'&#xD;
      hip pain with satisfying success, no study yet has been conducted to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this hip manipulation technique. The investigators are interested in&#xD;
      identifying which young adults with pain in the groin, lateral hip or buttock would benefit&#xD;
      from this hip manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects of this manipulation have been reported to be none to mild. Mild soreness or&#xD;
      muscle tenderness at the posterior greater trochanter region has been reported. In a&#xD;
      preliminary study on the UFIR manipulation of 35 participants, 5 reported mild discomfort&#xD;
      immediately after manipulation, but no participants reported adverse effects of a UFIR&#xD;
      manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to identify the characteristics of young adults with&#xD;
      pain in the groin, lateral hip or buttock who will benefit from manipulation of the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the predictors for a positive outcome of hip manipulation on young adults with&#xD;
      groin, lateral hip or buttock pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, all participants with groin/lateral hip/buttock pain will be&#xD;
      informed of the risks, benefits and procedures of the study. Once the participants agree to&#xD;
      participate, they will be asked to sign a written consent form approved by the TWU&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board - Dallas. Once each participant signs the consent form, a number&#xD;
      will be assigned to the participant and all forms to be used will be marked with this number.&#xD;
      All data collection including the testing and treatment will be performed at the Texas&#xD;
      Woman's University (TWU) - Dallas, Lab #8113, or in a private treatment room at the Physical&#xD;
      Therapy &amp; Injury Specialist clinic, Englewood, CO. Each participant will come twice with&#xD;
      24-48 hours between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1st Visit: On the first visit, all participants will be asked to fill out an intake form and&#xD;
      a medical questionnaire to further determine the eligibility of each participant. Next, one&#xD;
      of the investigators will perform a neurological exam, including dural tests, femoral nerve&#xD;
      tests, deep tendon reflexes, key muscle tests and Babinski/Hoffman to rule out lumbar or&#xD;
      neurologic involvement. If a participant is found to have a positive neurological test, the&#xD;
      participant will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures and Special Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant is determined to be eligible for the study, each participant will be&#xD;
      asked to complete the following 4 questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) with body charts&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lower Extremity Functional Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Special questions for functional activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reliability and validity of the NPRS, LEFS and HAGOs have been shown to be reliable and&#xD;
      valid. The special questions were used to describe the characteristics of the participants&#xD;
      who are young adults with groin, lateral hip or buttock pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard physical therapy examination specific to the hip will be performed by the&#xD;
      investigator who will not perform the hip manipulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Functional tests: 3 functional tests will be assessed: deep squat, hurdle and inline&#xD;
           lunge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Palpation tests: 11 palpation tests will be examined. The surrounding bony landmark and&#xD;
           soft tissue also will be palpated for tenderness and abnormality. To improve test&#xD;
           accuracy, the investigators will video tape 2 palpation tests: single leg stand and&#xD;
           single leg stance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Range of motion (ROM) measurements: 8 hip ROMs will be measured in supine and prone. A&#xD;
           universal goniometer will be used to take all of hip ROMs. Two measurements will be&#xD;
           taken for each motion, and the average of the two will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Manual muscle strength tests: 8 hip manual muscle tests will be performed in sitting,&#xD;
           supine, sidelying and prone positions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sitting: flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Supine: flexion, internal rotation and external rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sidelying: abduction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prone: extension, internal rotation and internal rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Provocation tests of lumbar, sacroiliac and hip joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other investigator, a licensed physical therapist and different from the one who&#xD;
      performed physical examination as described above, will perform the intervention technique,&#xD;
      hip manipulation UFIR. During the manipulation, the participant will be asked to lie on the&#xD;
      unaffected side with the affected side up, their hip(s) flexed to approximately 30 degrees,&#xD;
      and knees flexed to approximately 50-70 degrees. Pillows will be place between the&#xD;
      participant's knees as needed for comfort. The investigator will stabilize the anterior&#xD;
      inferior iliac spine (ASIS) and ilium with the fingers of one hand and place the thumb on the&#xD;
      posterior aspect of the greater trochanter of the involved hip. The participant will be asked&#xD;
      for verbal approval prior to receiving the manipulation. The manipulation will be performed&#xD;
      with the investigator's non-stabilizing hand, by thrusting the greater trochanter anteriorly&#xD;
      with an internal rotation moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manipulation will be performed on the involved side. If the participant or the&#xD;
      investigator feels a cavitation or shift in the hip joint after the first manipulation, the&#xD;
      intervention will be considered complete. If no cavitation/shift is heard or felt by the&#xD;
      participant or the investigator after the first manipulation, the investigator will repeat&#xD;
      the manipulation up to a maximum of three times. The manipulation will be performed by either&#xD;
      of two physical therapists who have specialized in manual therapy, and have been certified&#xD;
      after participating in an extensive clinical education and examination process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Intervention After the hip manipulation intervention, the investigator will advise the&#xD;
      participant to continue any regular activity but to not perform new activities. In addition,&#xD;
      the participant will be asked to fill out the NPRS with body charts (Appendix E) and the&#xD;
      Global Rating of Change (GROC) Scale (Appendix M).16 The participant will reminded of the&#xD;
      second visit day and appointment time within 24-48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd Visit During the 2nd visit, the same investigator who has evaluated the participant on&#xD;
      his/her 1st visit will perform the same physical exam as described on the first visit, with&#xD;
      the same measurement or reporting details. Following this physical exam, the participant will&#xD;
      be asked to fill out the NPRS with body charts, LEFS, HAGOS and GROC forms. There will be no&#xD;
      further treatment for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The participants will be dichotomized into two groups based on their response&#xD;
      to the hip manipulation: successful or non-successful. Success will be defined as 2 points or&#xD;
      greater change in the NPRS or 4 points or greater change in the GROC. These criteria will be&#xD;
      used as reference standards to dichotomize the participants for all variables collected from&#xD;
      patient's history, self-reported questionnaires and physical exam. Regression analysis will&#xD;
      be used to examine significant predictors/characteristics for a successful outcome of hip&#xD;
      manipulation on young adults with groin, lateral hip or buttock pain.&#xD;
