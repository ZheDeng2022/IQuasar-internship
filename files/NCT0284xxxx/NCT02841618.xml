      The purpose of this study is to understand how consuming healthy cookies every day for two&#xD;
      weeks will affect different types of fat in the blood. Specifically, the overall goal of this&#xD;
      study is to find out if the healthy cookies can increase a polyunsaturated fat called&#xD;
      linoleic acid in plasma, red blood cells and white blood cells.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overall, linoleic acid has many health benefits including altering body composition and&#xD;
      energy metabolism, possibly through its impact on cardiolipin. It is therefore imperative to&#xD;
      develop foods products that allow for Americans to easily increase their intake of linoleic&#xD;
      acid. It's also important to understand the mechanism in which linoleic acid exerts these&#xD;
      positive health effects, particularly in states of muscle mass and quality loss associated&#xD;
      with mitochondria dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of&#xD;
      this research by pursuing the following three specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the extent to which cookies, made with grapeseed oil , increase linoleic&#xD;
      acid in plasma, red blood cells (RBCs), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)&#xD;
      fraction of blood after two weeks consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which cookies, made with grapeseed oil, increase&#xD;
      cardiolipin and linoleic acid content of cardiolipin in PBMCs after two weeks of consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine and compare the acceptability of consuming cookies made with grapeseed&#xD;
      oil or high oleic safflower oil every day for two weeks&#xD;
