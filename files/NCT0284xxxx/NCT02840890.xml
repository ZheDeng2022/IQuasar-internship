  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy with the protocol 3 cure of 5-FU + Epirubicine + Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (FEC100) and 3 cure of Taxotere is a standard treatment in the management of patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer and in adjuvant situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of 3 FEC100 and 3 Taxotere protocol in adjuvant situation for women treated for&#xD;
      breast cancer is associated with several invalidating side effects for the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients. 92% of women treated will present gastrointestinal toxicities of any grade. 11%&#xD;
      will present nausea and vomiting of grade 3-4. Current treatments to prevent these&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities include Emend from Day 1 to Day 3 in association with setrons at&#xD;
      Day 1 and corticosteroids from Day 1 to Day 3. Despite the marked improvement in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities with preventive treatments, 83% of patients would use&#xD;
      alternatives medicine: homeopathy, herbal medicine, acupuncture, hypnotherapy and / or&#xD;
      osteopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathy is a method of care and unconventional therapeutic approach. In France, the&#xD;
      professional title of osteopath is recognized. It aims to prevent and treat functional&#xD;
      disorders, especially those related to adverse effects of treatment. In oncology, this&#xD;
      discipline may have additional support for the patient by limiting the mechanical and&#xD;
      physical constraints of sensitive areas to the toxicity of the treatment. In the case of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities of myofascial and musculoskeletal techniques are used in&#xD;
      abdominal areas to relieve symptoms. The investigators hypothesis is that osteopathy could&#xD;
      have an interest in the management of gastrointestinal toxicities related to chemotherapy in&#xD;
      women with breast cancer and in adjuvant treatment situation.&#xD;
