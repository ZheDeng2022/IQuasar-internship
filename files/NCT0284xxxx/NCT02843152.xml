      This study use Loewenstein cognitive function rating scale to meet the standards of the&#xD;
      elderly cognitive function assessment. POCD diagnostic criteria used is the recommended value&#xD;
      Z current international law, in order to reduce the effects of exercise, we selected 50 cases&#xD;
      of patients with age-matched healthy control group as a spouse, the same scale testing. And&#xD;
      Loewenstein Assessment Scale cognitive function after some domestic research proved to have&#xD;
      good sensitivity, and easy to test small changes in cognitive ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the investigation began strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, the use of simple&#xD;
      intelligence scale exclude preoperative cognitive decline in the elderly significantly, the&#xD;
      use of depression rating scale for anxiety rating scale before surgery to exclude severe&#xD;
      depression and severe anxiety in elderly self self patient. Testing by the same person in the&#xD;
      same way neurocognitive assessment test twice, 7 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in Chinese population, susceptibility SNPs and genetic POCD but there are few reports&#xD;
      of this project uses 1: 1 matched case-control study, by comparison POCD SNPs and control&#xD;
      groups of different polymorphisms, polymorphisms Discussion Han population of postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction associated with susceptibility to find Chinese Han population of&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive disorders genetic susceptibility markers, which provide scientific&#xD;
      screening and early diagnosis of postoperative cognitive impairment at high risk in&#xD;

      1. study 1.1 The study inclusion criteria: The study in January 2015 - June 2015 Xuzhou&#xD;
           Medical College Hospital orthopedic ward in elderly patients, level of education for&#xD;
           primary ((0 &lt;schooling ≤6). Check all other indicators of the patients were in the&#xD;
           normal range, no liver, kidney, lung, heart and other organ dysfunction, the operation&#xD;
           time was 60 ~ 180min, ASA classified as class II.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 study exclusion criteria: Severe vision (1) no history of cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
           (2) Other medical history (3) No alcohol dependence and other substance abuse history&#xD;
           (4) to cause central nervous system damage did not affect cognitive function can not&#xD;
           affect cognitive tests, hearing and limb movement disorder (5) without mental illness&#xD;
           (6) Exclude known preoperative cognitive dysfunction (7) can not articulate the&#xD;
           patient's own meaning or do not match, the patient can not communicate very well.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In contrast to cases by sex and age and frequency matching. Study subjects were Chinese&#xD;
           Han population, and signed informed consent form, a collection of peripheral blood&#xD;
           specimens (5mlEDTA anticoagulated blood). At the same time, by specially trained&#xD;
           investigators to complete the epidemiological survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. field epidemiology survey methodology 2.1 Questionnaire items (perioperative&#xD;
           observations Indicator) 2.1.1 Preoperative: gender, age, education, past medical history&#xD;
           (hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease), surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2 Surgery: The operation time, the number of anesthesia, fentanyl, remifentanil, the&#xD;
      dosage of atropine, hypotension, hypertension. Intraoperative hypotension cases: surgery or&#xD;
      any time SBP≤90 mm Hg compared with preoperative blood pressure reduced by more than 30% for&#xD;
      longer than 5min; intraoperative hypertension cases: surgery any time SBP≥140 / 90mmHg or&#xD;
      comparing preoperative more than 30% increase in blood pressure over the duration of 5min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.3 Postoperative: Postoperative 7d or prior to discharge using a visual analog scale&#xD;
      (vasual analogue scale, VAS) to assess the degree of pain the patient and postoperative&#xD;
      complications were recorded (with or without infection, reoperation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 neuropsychological assessment tools: 2.2.1 Simple Intelligence Scale (Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination, MMSE) 2.2.2 Self-Rating Depression Scale (Self-Rating Depression Scale, SDS)&#xD;
      2.2.3 Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale SAS) 2.3.4 know Abilities&#xD;
      Screening Instrument 2.3 postoperative cognitive dysfunction assessment program and criteria:&#xD;
      POCD for assessment, the project recommended using the current Z value of international law,&#xD;
      in order to reduce the effects of exercise, selected 50 cases of patients with age-matched&#xD;
      healthy control group as a spouse, the same scale test, the exclusion criteria with the&#xD;
      control group. POCD is calculated as: Z = (X-X reference) / SD .. X is a preoperative patient&#xD;
      surgery, the score of the difference, X reference is the difference between the scale scores&#xD;
      before and after the control group, SD is the standard deviation of the difference between&#xD;
      the control group. When the Z value of the test in two or more scale test is greater than&#xD;
      1.96 is considered POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answers were recorded accurately complete the test score or the time required. MMSE scale is&#xD;
      mainly used for screening in elderly subjects, excluding preoperative cognitive function in&#xD;
      patients with significantly decreased. Self-Rating Depression Scale suitable for different&#xD;
      age, gender patients with depression score. Self-Rating Anxiety Scale suitable for different&#xD;
      age, gender patients' anxiety before surgery to evaluate anxiety and depression status,&#xD;
      excluding severe anxiety and depression survey, no longer be evaluated cognitive abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we selected 50 cases of patients with age-matched healthy control group as a&#xD;
      spouse, learn to reduce the effects of neuropsychological tests before the subject later.&#xD;
      Testing by the same person in the same way neurocognitive assessments, test twice, 7 days&#xD;
      apart. Loewenstein cognitive function using standard rating scale for the assessment of&#xD;
      cognitive function in older people. Loewenstein cognitive neuropsychological rating scale is&#xD;
      Luria and Piaget's developmental model is based, including the time and place orientation,&#xD;
      visual perception, spatial perception, action apply, depending on the sports organization,&#xD;
      logical thinking, attention and concentration, assessment the project was more than MMSE, and&#xD;
      a detailed breakdown can not only reflect the patient's cognitive problems in these areas,&#xD;
      but also to predict the progress of change and prognosis of brain injury, a more appropriate&#xD;
      amount is used to assess postoperative cognitive impairment table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, an international research organization POCD recommended Z-score method to&#xD;
      determine the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and is divided into POCD and&#xD;
      control groups. To analyze the effect of learning, healthy control subjects before and after&#xD;
      the calculation of each individual test item score difference, the difference between the&#xD;
      results of mean and standard deviation, and then calculated for each patient before and after&#xD;
      surgery score difference between the individual test items, use When this difference is&#xD;
      divided by the standard deviation that is obtained by subtracting the mean of each individual&#xD;
      test item Z-score, Z score greater the greater the decline after the test scores compared&#xD;
      with preoperative. Each individual test items Z summing points, healthy control subjects Z&#xD;
      points and calculate the standard deviation S, each patient divided by the S and Z-score is&#xD;
      the composite of the patient's Z-score, if the composite Z-score ≥21.96 individual tests or&#xD;
      have two or more Z-score greater than or equal 96, it is considered that the patients POCD.&#xD;
      Orthopedic patients in the control group from the same period, the age and gender of the&#xD;
      patient group want to match.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 survey items related definitions 2.4.1 alcohol. Drinking 2 years and above, equivalent to&#xD;
      an ethanol content of women ≥20 g / d, male ≥40 g / d.&#xD;
