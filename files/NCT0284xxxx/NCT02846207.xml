  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research is based on the fundamentals of using Chinese medicine, which will&#xD;
      improve Qi and promote blood circulation, to treat patients in the recuperating stages of&#xD;
      cerebral infarction with deficiency in Qi and blood stasis syndrome. By assimilating Chinese&#xD;
      medical theory, this research aims to study the biological basics of the stroke and the cause&#xD;
      for the deficiency in Qi and blood stasis syndrome; explore the therapeutic mechanism of the&#xD;
      treatment methods; as well as ascertaining the relationship between Qi, blood and blood&#xD;
      vessels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral infarction, or ischemic stroke, is a common yet challenged illness with four&#xD;
      telltale signs (high occurrence rate, high incapacitate rate, high mortality rate, and high&#xD;
      recurrence rate), posing not only a threat to a man's health and life, but also imposing a&#xD;
      burden to the society and his loved ones. As such, seeking a cure has always been the hot&#xD;
      topic in this field of research. With regard to the illness' high incapacitate and recurrence&#xD;
      rates, it has become apparent that the treatment methods used in the recuperating stages of&#xD;
      stroke are very significant to the patient, allowing him the chance to regain his health and&#xD;
      increase his quality of life. In Chinese medical terms, the pathogenesis key of stroke is a&#xD;
      deficiency in the vitals of the body coupled with superficiality extremities. As such, in the&#xD;
      recuperating stage of the stroke, a lack of Qi accompanied with blood stasis syndrome is&#xD;
      often observed. Hence, improving Qi and promoting blood circulation is essential during&#xD;
      treatment. Research further supports that this treatment method is highly effective in&#xD;
      treating cerebral infarction, but the mechanism involved is still incomprehensible, largely&#xD;
      due to the fact that the pathology of cerebral infraction is highly complicated, and that&#xD;
      Chinese medicine is multi-leveled, multi-channeled, with multi-targets. To further study the&#xD;
      relationship of Qi and blood in cerebral infraction, patients in the recuperating stages with&#xD;
      deficiency in Qi and blood stasis underwent observation in a double blind clinical research.&#xD;
      The patients were sorted in random into groups: improving Qi group, promoting blood&#xD;
      circulation group, improving Qi and promoting blood circulation group, and the control group.&#xD;
      Each group of patients was given the standard Western medicine treatment, coupled with&#xD;
      Chinese medicine treatments with respect to their sorted groupings. The treatment lasts for&#xD;
      12 weeks and 360 clinical cases were studied. Testing methods used include enzyme linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay, Western Blot, FQ RT-PCR, LC-MS, and radiology. Through the relations&#xD;
      between Neurotransmitter - endocrine hormone - immune cytokine network, blood rheology,&#xD;
      vascular structure and endothelial function, interactions involving vasoactive substances&#xD;
      with vascular endothelium and blood cells, it is hoped that the biological basis of cerebral&#xD;
      infraction's deficiency in Qi and blood stasis syndrome can be deciphered. This will aid in&#xD;
      the understanding of the whole process of causing the syndrome, deciphering the therapeutic&#xD;
      mechanism involved during treatment, as well as determining the relationship between Qi,&#xD;
      blood and blood vessels.&#xD;
