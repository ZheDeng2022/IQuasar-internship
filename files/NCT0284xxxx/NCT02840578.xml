      Objectives: To examine whether NK cell activity associates with two confirmed risk factors:&#xD;
      (1) presence of indeterminate lung nodule(s) and (2) smoking exposure after controlling for&#xD;
      potential confounders, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), personal history of any&#xD;
      cancer, and family history of cancer. This project is aimed at measuring NK cell activity,&#xD;
      which may eventually help in reducing false positive rates of LDCT screening, improve early&#xD;
      detection of lung cancer, and assist in risk assessment in patients with lung cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that measurement of NK cell activity may be a useful tool for&#xD;
      assessing changes in immunosurveillance in patients with conditions or diseases where NK cell&#xD;
      activity has been shown to be reduced, such as lung cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Despite&#xD;
      considerable clinical research in multi-modality cancer treatment, there has been no&#xD;
      significant decrease in lung cancer-specific mortality over the past three decades. The&#xD;
      recent results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) established that screening&#xD;
      high-risk individuals using low-dose CT (LDCT) significantly reduces lung cancer-related&#xD;
      mortality. One caveat is that approximately 96% of the &quot;positive&quot; results in the NLST were&#xD;
      found not to be related to lung cancer. The difficulty in determining which subjects with&#xD;
      suspicious lesions should be biopsied or operated on could be alleviated by the development&#xD;
      of highly specific lung cancer biomarkers that could complement LDCT. Thus, novel,&#xD;
      complementary, non-invasive diagnostic tools with high sensitivity and specificity would&#xD;
      clearly be of enormous benefit to patients with a &quot;positive&quot; screening exam. This study will&#xD;
      look at measuring the activity of natural killer (NK) cells using the in vitro diagnostic&#xD;
      device NK Vue™ in a cohort of current and former smokers (n=100) who meet the criteria for&#xD;
      LDCT screening established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as a result of&#xD;
      the positive findings from the NLST. This project is aimed at measuring the NK cell activity,&#xD;
      which may eventually help in reducing false positive rates of LDCT screening, improve early&#xD;
      detection of lung cancer, and assist in risk assessment in patients with lung cancer. The&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that measurement of NK cell activity may be a useful tool for&#xD;
      assessing changes in immunosurveillance in patients with conditions or diseases where NK cell&#xD;
      activity has been shown to be reduced, such as lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Specific Aim 1: To examine whether NK cell activity associates with two confirmed&#xD;
      risk factors: (1) presence of indeterminate lung nodule(s) and (2) smoking exposure after&#xD;
      controlling for potential confounders, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), personal&#xD;
      history of any cancer, and family history of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 (Exploratory): In the study cohort, investigators expect approximately 45% of&#xD;
      patients having at least one indeterminate lung nodule. Among those with lung nodule(s),&#xD;
      investigators will examine whether NK cell activity associates with size of the largest lung&#xD;
      nodule after controlling for potential confounders, including smoking exposure, age, gender,&#xD;
      BMI, personal history of any cancer, and family history of cancer&#xD;

      Blood sample (1 ml) will be collected following a set of established Standard Operating&#xD;
      Procedures (SOPs). Blood samples will be incubated for 20 hours after initial draw then&#xD;
      centrifuged. Serum will then be frozen and stored at USC until they are sent to Cynvenio's&#xD;
      CLIA and CAP certified laboratory in Thousand Oaks, CA for ELISA processing. All serum&#xD;
      samples will be picked up by a Cynvenio representative who will personally deliver the&#xD;
      specimens to the Cynvenio Labs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of registration, subjects must have a current or previous cumulative&#xD;
             cigarette smoking history of ≥ 20 pack years (packs per day multiplied by the number&#xD;
             of years smoked). If smoking history is between 20 and 29 pack years, subjects must&#xD;
             have an additional risk factor (i.e. radon exposure, occupational exposure, personal&#xD;
             history of smoking-associated cancer, family history of lung cancer in first-degree&#xD;
             relatives, COPD or pulmonary fibrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of registration former smokers without additional risk factor(s) must have&#xD;
             quit smoking within the preceding 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to provide blood samples as biospecimens for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of registration, subjects must have recovered from the toxic effects of&#xD;
             prior therapy: ≥6 months (182 days) from the last dose of prior cytotoxic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of registration, subjects must have recovered from the effects of prior&#xD;
             pneumonia or acute respiratory infection treated by antibiotics by a physician: ≥12&#xD;
             weeks (84 days) from the first dose of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical or psychiatric condition precluding informed medical consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment for or advisement by a physician of evidence of any cancer within the past&#xD;
             five years, with the exceptions of non-melanoma skin cancer and most in-situ&#xD;
             carcinomas. (Treatment for, or evidence of, melanoma or in-situ bladder/transition&#xD;
             cell carcinomas within the preceding five years renders the potential participant&#xD;
             ineligible.)&#xD;
