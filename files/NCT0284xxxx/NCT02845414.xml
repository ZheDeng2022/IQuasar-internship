        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix II), or modified&#xD;
             RECIST criteria for mesothelioma (Appendix II).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 1 prior line of systemic therapy considered standard for the malignancy, and&#xD;
             for which no standard therapies exist. Prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             biological therapy, radiation therapy and/or surgery are allowed before the first dose&#xD;
             of dCD133KDEL with the following restrictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 14 days since any systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 28 days since any experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 14 days since any radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 28 days since any major surgery, defined as a surgery involving a risk&#xD;
                  to the life of the patient, specifically, an operation upon an organ within the&#xD;
                  cranium, chest, abdomen, or pelvic cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Recovered from the acute toxic effects (≤ grade 1, CTCAE v4.0) of previous cancer&#xD;
             treatment prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (Appendix III).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate organ function within 14 days of study registration, defined as follows&#xD;
             System Parameter Laboratory Value Hematologic Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x&#xD;
             10^9 /L Hemoglobin* 9 g/dL Platelets* ≥100 x 10^9 /L Hepatic Total bilirubin &lt; 2 x&#xD;
             ULN^ ALT &lt; 2 x ULN^ Renal Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL OR estimated GFR &gt;50 by&#xD;

&#xD;
             ^ Upper limit of institutional normal.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Albumin ≥ 3.0 gm/dL within 14 days of study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate cardiac function, defined as an ejection fraction ≥40% on transthoracic&#xD;
             echocardiogram done within 14 days of study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. QT/QTc interval ≤ 450 milliseconds within 14 days of study registration. If this&#xD;
             screening EKG demonstrates a QT/QTc interval &gt; 450 milliseconds, a second screening&#xD;
             EKG will be done within 7 days to document that the QT prolongation is persistent. The&#xD;
             patient will be eligible if the second screening EKG shows a QT/QTc interval ≤ 450&#xD;
             milliseconds but will require additional EKGs during the study period as outlined in&#xD;
             section 6.1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate pulmonary function, defined as resting oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air&#xD;

             or ≥ 60% of predicted. PFT testing is required within 28 days of study registration&#xD;
             only if the patient is symptomatic or prior known impairment is present.&#xD;
