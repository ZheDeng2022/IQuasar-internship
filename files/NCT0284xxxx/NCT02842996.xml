  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an ageing population, hip fractures are likely to become a significant public health&#xD;
      burden. Hip fracture surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patient&#xD;
      outcomes and experience underpin the National Health Service (NHS) Constitution in driving&#xD;
      quality improvement and performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to conduct a qualitative research study to ascertain the important patient and carer&#xD;
      reported experience measures following hip fracture surgery in the elderly to improve quality&#xD;
      of care and service provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about patient and care-giver experience to ascertain which aspects are important to&#xD;
      patients and what can be improved.&#xD;

      Rationale for research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery following hip fracture surgery has been associated with poor functional outcome;&#xD;
      (Marcantonio et al. 2001; Luger et al. 2010) these patients may require longer hospital&#xD;
      stays, are more often discharged to long-term care, and have a generally poor prognosis for&#xD;
      returning home or regaining function in activities of daily living (ADL). (Dolan et al. 2000)&#xD;
      Loss to living independently in the community has a significant detrimental effect on their&#xD;
      quality of life and some patients have reported that they would rather be dead than&#xD;
      experience the loss of independence that results from a hip fracture. (Salkeld et al. 2000)&#xD;
      Patients report that going home following hip fracture surgery would be their main priority.&#xD;
      (Robinson et al. 2015) Recovery for patients is multi-faceted and includes physical, social&#xD;
      and emotional domains. (Miller &amp; Mythen 2014) Increasingly focus is being modified to include&#xD;
      patient related experience of the healthcare pathway to inform policymakers, health&#xD;
      regulation and service improvement. (Gibbons &amp; Fitzpatrick 2012) Patient public involvement&#xD;
      (PPI) via the Clinical Research Ambassador Group (CRAG) at Heart of England NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust has helped to identify the research question with particular focus on the improving the&#xD;
      perioperative care pathway. Members of the CRAG group have reported the impact of hip&#xD;
      fracture to include loss of functional ability leading to additional stress for family&#xD;
      members. They have advocated a qualitative study to assess the impact on patients and their&#xD;
      carers based on their personal experiences. We aim to conduct interviews to ascertain&#xD;
      important and relevant patient reported experience measures in elderly patients undergoing&#xD;
      hip fracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To review and evaluate the literature to ascertain the themes related to patient and carer&#xD;
      experiences following hip fracture surgery which can improve quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct interviews to ascertain what are the patient and carer experiences surrounding&#xD;
      discharge from hospital following hip fracture surgery? To identify important themes to guide&#xD;
      us in improving the care-pathway surrounding patient discharge following fractured neck of&#xD;
      femur surgery in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To pilot a resource/information pack designed specifically to improve patient and carer&#xD;
      experience following hip fracture surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the published literature what are the themes related to patient and carer experiences&#xD;
      following hip fracture surgery which can improve quality of care? What are the patient and&#xD;
      carer experiences surrounding discharge from hospital following hip fracture surgery? From&#xD;
      patient and carer experience following hip fracture surgery what are the important themes&#xD;
      that can improve the discharge pathway for patients and their carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What information should be included in a resource pack designed to help patient and carer&#xD;
      following hip fracture surgery? Will a resource/information pack designed specifically help&#xD;
      to improve patient and carer experience following hip fracture surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore physical, mental and emotional impact on patient and care-givers following hip&#xD;
      fracture surgery we will conduct semi-structured interviews of patients and their&#xD;
      care-givers. Participants will include patients who have undergone hip fracture surgery and&#xD;
      their named care-giver. Participants will be screened at a single study site using clinical&#xD;
      databases as well as reviewing new patients that are admitted on the orthopaedic ward.&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if they are unable to consent or unable to partake in the interview&#xD;
      due to speech and language impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients and their carers at their location&#xD;
      of choice. This will be at their residence or at the study site; if they choose to travel to&#xD;
      the study site their travel expenses will be re-imbursed. If patients and their carers are&#xD;
      being interviewed at the same time, we will aim to interview them separately, unless they&#xD;
      request to be interviewed together. The interviews will be carried out by one member of the&#xD;
      research team this will aim to ensure consistency of interview questions and technique&#xD;
      throughout the study. Prior to starting the interview with the participants we will reconfirm&#xD;
      consent. The interviews will be audio-recorded and written notes will also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations and consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained from participants during their in-patient hospital stay. An&#xD;
      informal capacity/consent process will be used by a trained member of the research team.&#xD;
      Written and verbal information will be provided about the study, using a suitable style and&#xD;
      format for the participant. The researcher will ask the participant to recall study&#xD;
      information to check understanding; this together with the clinical teams view will be used&#xD;
      to assess capacity to consent. Consent will be sought for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accessing medical records for the purpose of collecting relevant patient outcomes and&#xD;
           patient health service use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participating in a face to face interview following hospital discharge. If a patient is&#xD;
           deemed to not have capacity they will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, burdens and benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a small risk of distress for the patient and/or their carer during the interview&#xD;
      when describing their memories and experiences. There may also be a time-burden to patients&#xD;
      and their carers by taking part in the interview. To minimise these factors we will ensure&#xD;
      that interviews are conducted on a day and time convenient to the patient and their carer.&#xD;
      They will be able to stop the interview at any time and take a break if they require. If the&#xD;
      patient/carer request or are identified as requiring support we will offer to contact their&#xD;
      general practitioner (GP) on their behalf. The patient and their carer will be interviewed&#xD;
      separately but if either requires support or feel vulnerable if left alone they will be&#xD;
      interviewed together. If the patient requires the interview to be conducted in the community&#xD;
      or at the patient's home there is a risk of the researcher, conducting the interview, to be&#xD;
      put in a potential vulnerable situation. This will be minimised by ensuring the researcher&#xD;
      follows Birmingham Heartlands Hospital lone worker policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be recorded and analysed anonymously with only the author knowing participant&#xD;
      details. Data will be transcribed verbatim; transcripts will thereafter be reviewed to check&#xD;
      for accuracy. Coding of the transcripts will occur, a second reviewer will check these.&#xD;
      Results from the data analysis will guide development of a resource/information pack designed&#xD;
      specifically help to improve patient and carer experience following hip fracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not directly benefit the participants but it will improve services for&#xD;
      patients in the future undergoing hip fracture surgery. It will identify areas of&#xD;
      need/support to guide National Health Service (NHS) policymakers and healthcare provision and&#xD;
      development of services to facilitate discharge to the community. By understanding the&#xD;
      important patient reported experience measures we can go on to use these and compare quality&#xD;
      of healthcare in this group of patients to improve care pathways.&#xD;
