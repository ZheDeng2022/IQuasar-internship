  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using stakeholder feedback (i.e., behavioral health providers &amp; caregivers), the goal of this&#xD;
      study is to develop a behavioral parenting program that focuses on both parent mental health&#xD;
      and parenting for parents of toddlers (12-35 months old). Using a deployment focused&#xD;
      intervention model, this study will : (1) develop an early parenting intervention for parents&#xD;
      of at-risk toddlers which integrates a focus on parent mental health with evidence-based&#xD;
      behavioral parenting strategies, and (2) examine context-specific factors related to the&#xD;
      intervention, including feasibility and acceptability to design a more practice-ready&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very early identification of children and families at risk of developing psychopathology can&#xD;
      lead to early prevention/intervention to address challenging behaviors before they become&#xD;
      more severe, likely reducing the length and cost of interventions. Using the information&#xD;
      provided by the stakeholder group, the current study will implement in an open trial the&#xD;
      early parenting intervention for ADHD parents of at-risk toddlers (n = 10 families) via&#xD;
      telehealth by primary care co-located psychologists. Investigators will examine&#xD;
      implementation factors including fidelity, feasibility (utility, adherence) and acceptability&#xD;
      (facilitators, barriers) of the early parenting intervention. Quantitative data (adherence&#xD;
      checklists, symptom measures, observational parenting measures) will be used to assess the&#xD;
      extent to which primary care providers and office staff adhere to the intervention manual, as&#xD;
      well as changes in toddler and parent behavior resulting from the intervention. Qualitative&#xD;
      data (interviews/ focus groups) with stakeholders (behavioral health providers and caregivers&#xD;
      of toddlers) will inform a refined intervention model and assess perceptions of utility, fit,&#xD;
      and satisfaction of the intervention components. This mixed-methods approach will offer the&#xD;
      most comprehensive examination of an early parenting intervention model for parents of&#xD;
      at-risk toddlers in a pediatric primary care setting.&#xD;
