  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether low level electric stimulation, called&#xD;
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), on the part of the brain (i.e.,&#xD;
      presupplementary motor area) thought to aid in memory will improve verbal retrieval in&#xD;
      military veteran participants with histories of traumatic brain injuries. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are neuropsychological assessments of verbal retrieval, and the secondary measures&#xD;
      are neuropsychological assessments of other cognitive abilities and electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG) measures. Additionally, the study will examine the degree to which baseline assessments&#xD;
      of cognition and concussion history predict responses to treatment over time, both on&#xD;
      assessments administered within the intervention period and at follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using two treatment arms, the study will examine improvement of verbal retrieval and other&#xD;
      cognitive deficits associated with remote traumatic brain injury by comparing (1) 1 milliamp&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) active treatment applied to presupplementary&#xD;
      motor area for 20 minutes over 15 sessions to (2) sham tDCS following the same schedule.&#xD;
      Additionally, after completing the initial active or sham treatment and 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      testing sessions, selected participants will be invited back for newly assigned treatment&#xD;
      conditions, 30 minutes over 15 sessions and will be and re-evaluated at 2- and 3-months&#xD;
      follow-up testing sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veterans with histories of traumatic brain injuries and observed cognitive deficits will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms (and re-assigned for the second round of&#xD;
      intervention, as described above). Primary outcome verbal retrieval measures, secondary&#xD;
      neuropsychological and electroencephalography (EEG) measures, and prescreening assessments&#xD;
      for study concussion history and contraindications for treatment will be collected prior to&#xD;
      being assigned to a treatment arm (i.e., baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome verbal retrieval measures and secondary neuropsychological and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) measures will be collected after treatment sessions 5, 10, and&#xD;
      15 and two times following treatment competition (i.e., 2-months and 3-months). For&#xD;
      participants selected for the second round of intervention, primary outcome verbal memory&#xD;
      measures and secondary neuropsychological and electroencephalography (EEG) measures will be&#xD;
      collected again after treatment sessions 5, 10, and 15 and two times following competition of&#xD;
      the second treatment (i.e., 2-months and 3-months).&#xD;
