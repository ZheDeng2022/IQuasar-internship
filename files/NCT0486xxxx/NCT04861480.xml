    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of C-4-29 in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and to obtain the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of C-4-29 and phase II Recommended dose.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label study. The study plans to set up 3 dose&#xD;
      groups, adopting a dose-escalating 3+3 design, and plan to recruit about 9-18 subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.C-4-29 cells will be infused to the subject by&#xD;
