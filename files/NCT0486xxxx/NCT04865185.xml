  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to systematically test the occurrence of paradoxical and&#xD;
      illusory responses to cold and warm stimuli in healthy volunteers with artificial sensory&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficient thermal sensation is important for adequate behavioral response to cold or warm&#xD;
      stimuli and early signs of neuropathy can be changes in the thermal sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in thermal perception can results in paradoxical heat sensation (a warm&#xD;
      perception when the skin is cooled) or a peculiar/burning sensation when the skin is&#xD;
      stiumlated with simultaneous warm and cold (a &quot;thermal grill&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clarifying the occurrence of these paradoxical and illusory sensations, may help&#xD;
      understanding early signs of peripheral neuropathy as well as thermal sensory perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct a study on thermal sensory perception using a model of&#xD;
      sensory loss in healthy volunteers and systematically test the occurrence of paradoxical heat&#xD;
      sensations and responses to the thermal grill.&#xD;
