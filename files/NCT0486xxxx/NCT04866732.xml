  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and&#xD;
      older African Americans (AAs) living in rural areas are disproportionately affected by this&#xD;
      healthcare problem. The investigators propose conducting a mixed-methods study to gain&#xD;
      information about CVD-related knowledge, perceptions regarding CVD-related healthcare needs,&#xD;
      preferences and access barriers, and cultural aspects within this population. The information&#xD;
      will be used in tailoring an existing intervention to meet those needs and preferences and&#xD;
      evaluate its feasibility among older AAs living in rural Alabama. This study will lay a&#xD;
      foundation for developing a federal grant application and a line of independent research by&#xD;
      this early-stage investigator.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Older&#xD;
      populations are inherently more vulnerable to such conditions. Older African American (AA)&#xD;
      populations living in rural areas are disproportionately affected by CVD, which has been&#xD;
      shown to cause an increased risk for mortality in this population. Evidence suggests using&#xD;
      lifestyle Physical activity programs to prevent CVD risk factors, which can decrease the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rates associated with these health conditions. There are limited&#xD;
      resources and healthcare services available to these populations, especially those living in&#xD;
      Alabama's black belt. Therefore, this research project proposes conducting a phased&#xD;
      mixed-methods study to collect data from rural AA older adults. These data are the critical&#xD;
      first step towards developing a culturally sensitive, accessible, and acceptable intervention&#xD;
      that addresses their needs and risk factors, incorporates their preferences, and mitigates&#xD;
      identified barriers, which will be tested for feasibility and acceptability in this pilot&#xD;
      study. The aims for this study are Aim 1: Through survey and interviews, assess: i) the&#xD;
      knowledge and perceptions of AA older adults living in rural Alabama regarding CVD-related&#xD;
      risk factors; ii) the needs/existing resources and access barriers for a community-based&#xD;
      physical activity program; iii) the perceptions about a proposed intervention and its&#xD;
      components, method of delivery, time/effort, and incentives; and iv) the cultural preferences&#xD;
      regarding recruitment strategies, treatment strategies, and incentives. Aim2a: Based on the&#xD;
      findings of Aim 1, develop a PA program for improving CVD-related risk factors among older AA&#xD;
      populations living in rural Alabama. Aim2b: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      delivering a PA program (developed in Aim 2a) among the older AA populations living in rural&#xD;
      Alabama. The enhanced program would enable AA older populations to prevent and manage&#xD;
      CVD-related risk factors. It will also help in filling the gap of health disparity between&#xD;
      AAs and other ethnicities.&#xD;

    <description>Based on our target population's needs/preferences, an existing Physical Activity (PA) program will be modified and tailored to the needs of the target population. We anticipate that this PA program will include the following components: a) PA component - ( duration of walk) from baseline to the end of the study; b) weekly informational sessions on various topics related to CVD risk factors prevention; c) daily diary to record if they are facing any barriers in completing various components of the intervention; d) problem-solving sessions</description>

    <description>The investigators anticipate that the physical activity program will include the following components: a) physical activity component - the investigators propose an incremental physical activity component whereby participants will gradually increase their physical activity ( duration of walk) from baseline to the end of the study; b) weekly informational sessions on various topics related to Cardiovascular disease risk factors prevention; c) daily diary, which will be used to document record about any barriers for completing various components of the intervention; d) problem-solving sessions whereby participants will meet once a week with the investigators to talk about the barriers and facilitators of their weekly activity and any adherence issues.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators expect that the results of the proposed study will be of great interest to the scientific community. Investigators will collect and analyze the data for the course of the study and allow one calendar year from the end of the budget period to complete data analysis and publication of results. In the interim, data will be presented at scientific meetings and shared with providers and clinicians, surrounding prevention and treatment centers, and appropriate councils and organizations, such as the Alabama Department of Public Health and academic institutions with a curriculum focused on Cardiovascular disease prevention education. The findings will be disseminated using peer-reviewed journals and presentations at local, national, and international conferences. All these avenues are instrumental in the successful dissemination of the research findings. The investigators will also ensure that the NIA has access to our data through clinicaltrials.gov.</ipd_description>
