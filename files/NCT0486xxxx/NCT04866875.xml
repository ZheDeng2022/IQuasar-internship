  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 30 women randomized in two distinct groups: G1: Slow weight loss and&#xD;
      G2: Rapid weight loss . The total duration of the program will be different for each group,&#xD;
      being over 20 and 10 weeks for G1 and G2, respectively, in attempt to match the groups on&#xD;
      amount of weight loss (approximately 20 pounds per subject). Participants who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be randomized to rapid or slow weight loss groups. The energy&#xD;
      deprivation of the rapid and slow weight loss will be in -1000 kcal/day and -500 kcal/day,&#xD;
      respectively. Calculated based on the baseline resting energy expenditure (REE; determined by&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry) and their physical activity level measured for one week. The diet&#xD;
      macronutrient composition will be personalized for each participant based on the results of&#xD;
      2-day energy intake at preliminary session, measured with food items selected from a&#xD;
      validated food menu. Individuals will be instructed to maintain the level of energy&#xD;
      restriction and macronutrient composition during the diet period, however they will be able&#xD;
      to do food exchanges, based on the Canadian Diabetes Association system. It will be measured&#xD;
      participant's body weight, body compositions, appetite sensations, resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure, energy intake, palatability, olfactory performance, food reward, food&#xD;
      reinforcement and impulsivity. Participants will have 7 sessions in total: 1 preliminary,&#xD;
      baseline, 7 days of intervention, 3 follow ups and final assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary session (approximately 3 hours) During this visit, participants will receive the&#xD;
      consent form and they will be informed of the experimental procedures, which will be used&#xD;
      during each experimental session, as well as the equipment that will be used to obtain the&#xD;
      necessary data. Their weight (digital scale), height (standard stadiometer), waist&#xD;
      circumference and blood pressure will be measured at the start the session. If participants&#xD;
      match the study inclusion criteria, they will have an equal chance of being assigned to one&#xD;
      of two groups; one intervention will last 10 weeks and the second intervention will last 20&#xD;
      weeks but both groups are designed to produce the same amount of weight loss. We will measure&#xD;
      their resting metabolism (the energy you use while at rest) (indirect calorimetry). We will&#xD;
      then serve a breakfast according to their personal choice and we will recommend them to &quot;eat&#xD;
      as much or as little as they want&quot; in 15 minutes. Then, they will be asked to complete other&#xD;
      questionnaires the Yale Food Addition Questionnaire that measure personality traits and food&#xD;
      addiction symptoms, respectively. This session will be used to determine their breakfast&#xD;
      during the experimental sessions and to determine the macronutrient composition (percentage&#xD;
      of carbohydrates, fat and protein) will be adopted for them during their diet. They will be&#xD;
      asked to fill a food menu and choose your meals for the rest of your day as well as for the&#xD;
      day that will follow their visit. We will provide all your food items in lunch boxes and&#xD;
      individual bags. They will be able to carry these items and they will be instructed to eat&#xD;
      only the items that they have chosen for these 2 days. Lastly, they will be asked to wear a&#xD;
      biaxial accelerometer around your upper arm, 24 hours per day during 7 days, including when&#xD;
      sleeping, but should remove it when in contact with water (for instance, when bathing,&#xD;
      showering or swimming) because this device is not waterproof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Visit: (approximately 1 hour) Upon completion of the preliminary phase, participants&#xD;
      will be invited to a 2nd meeting at the lab, in order to receive the dietary instructions&#xD;
      related to their weight loss program. This diet is the one that you will be instructed to&#xD;
      follow for the duration of the weight loss program (10 or 20 weeks depending on their group).&#xD;
      The diet will be prescribed using the Canadian Food Exchange System. This method will allow&#xD;
      you to select foods you enjoy during the weight loss, however in smaller quantities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exchange lists are groups of foods that contain a similar mix of carbohydrates, protein, fat,&#xD;
      and calories. The Canadian exchange system there are seven exchange groups: Grains &amp;&#xD;
      Starches; Fruits; Milk &amp; Alternatives; Vegetables; Meat &amp; Alternatives; Fats; Unlimited&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within any group, participants can exchange one food serving for another. For example, in the&#xD;
      Meats group, some sample foods that equal one lean meat exchange might be: 1 oz. of white&#xD;
      meat chicken or turkey with no skin or 1 oz. of lean beef.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily meal plan will contain foods from all seven Food Exchange lists in order to assure&#xD;
      them a complete and a balanced nutrition. However, the number of portions from each group&#xD;
      will be recommended based on their individual diet evaluated in the preliminary session. This&#xD;
      session will also be used to clarify any potential questions that participants have regarding&#xD;
      the project and the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third and Fourth experimental sessions (approximately 6 hours each)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arrival at the laboratory (12 hours fasted, at 7:30 h)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a total of 3 experimental sessions: before starting the diet (baseline&#xD;
      measurement), 5 to 7 days after the beginning of the weight loss program and at the end of&#xD;
      the weight loss program. Each of these visits will take approximately 6 hours. Here is a&#xD;
      detailed description of the different methods/procedures that will be employed during each&#xD;
      experimental session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Anthropometric, body composition and resting metabolic rate assessments, consumption of a&#xD;
      standard breakfast and appetite measurements (Approximately 4.5 hours)-Participant's height&#xD;
      and body weight will be measured as soon as they arrive in the laboratory for the&#xD;
      experimental session. Their amount of body fat and muscle (by dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry) and your resting metabolism (by indirect calorimetry) will also be measured.&#xD;
      Afterwards, we will serve breakfast to them. This meal will contain the exact amounts of each&#xD;
      item that you consumed during the preliminary session. They will have 15 minutes to consume&#xD;
      this entire meal. Additionally, they will be asked to answer 4 specific questions that&#xD;
      quantify appetite sensations (desire to eat, hunger, fullness and prospective food&#xD;
      consumption) using 100-millimeter visual analogue scales that will be administered before,&#xD;
      immediately after (time 0), and every 30 minutes for 3 hours (30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180&#xD;
      minutes) following breakfast consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Approximately 10 minutes): We will assess participant's&#xD;
      body fat using the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). They will be asked to wear a&#xD;
      standard issue hospital gown, to lie on an examination table and do not make any movement&#xD;
      during the assessment. In the meantime, a low-intensity X-ray will scan your entire body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Indirect Calorimetry (Approximately 45 minutes) - Participant's will be required to remain&#xD;
      resting for 30-min during this measurement. A plexiglass hood (similar to a plastic bubble)&#xD;
      will be placed over their head through which fresh air will be drawn. The expired air will be&#xD;
      sampled for analysis and percentages of oxygen and carbon dioxide will be determined over the&#xD;
      30-min collection period. With this measurement, we will be able to determine participant's&#xD;
      resting rate of oxygen consumption. With this information we can calculate their resting rate&#xD;
      of energy expenditure. There are no risks associated with this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ) (Approximately 15 minutes)-This task provides&#xD;
      measures of the wanting and liking for an array of food images presented to participants on a&#xD;
      computer screen. During the test, each food image is presented with every other food image in&#xD;
      turn. Participants will be instructed to select the food you &quot;most want to eat now&quot; during&#xD;
      each trial. Participants will also need to rate each of the visual food cues in turn on a&#xD;
      100-millimeter visual analogue scale (anchored by Not at all-Extremely), based on the&#xD;
      following questions: &quot;how much do you want some of this food now?&quot; and &quot;How pleasant would it&#xD;
      be to experience a mouthful of this food now&quot;, respectively. This task will be completed at&#xD;
      60 minutes and 180 minutes post-breakfast consumption, immediately following lunch&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Behavioral Choice Task - For this task, participants will sit in front of a laptop which&#xD;
      will present to them 2 slot machine games: one is to earn points towards your preferred snack&#xD;
      food and the other is to earn points towards your favorite fruit/vegetable. They will then&#xD;
      have the opportunity to earn points towards your favorite snack and/or favorite&#xD;
      fruit/vegetable by playing these different slot machines. To earn points, they must press a&#xD;
      button on the mouse when the cursor is placed over the slot machine of choice, which then&#xD;
      starts that slot machine. Points are then earned when all three objects on the screen match.&#xD;
      This task will be completed immediately following the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire&#xD;
      administered at 180 minutes post-breakfast consumption and the amount of snack/ fruit earned&#xD;
      during the game will be served with their lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Olfactory (smell) capacity measurement -Participants will be required to complete 3&#xD;
      different odor tests. First, a set of 3 capsules will be subsequently presented to them and&#xD;
      they must identify which of the 3 capsules presents an odor (the other 2 capsules are&#xD;
      odorless). Second, a set of 3 capsules will be subsequently presented to them and them must&#xD;
      identify which of the 3 capsules presents a different odor (the other 2 capsules will have&#xD;
      the same odor). Finally, they will be required to identify the correct odor released by the&#xD;
      capsule. Examples of some of the odors include rose, marker, banana, and grass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Assessment of food intake at lunch (Approximately 30 minutes)-The energy intake of lunch&#xD;
      will be measured with a test meal administered in the end of your experimental sessions&#xD;
      (approximately 4 hours upon you arrive at the laboratory). This test meal will be selected&#xD;
      from a food menu, which contains 57 different food and beverage items. Once the selected food&#xD;
      items are prepared and served, participants will have 30 minutes to consume &quot;as much or as&#xD;
      little as they want&quot; from the foods that you selected on the menu. The selected food items&#xD;
      will then be prepared, measured and placed for you to eat at the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four follow-up sessions (approximately 90 minutes each) During the intervention, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to visit the laboratory for a bi-weekly or a monthly evaluation (depending on&#xD;
      the group to which you will be randomized). During these follow-up sessions we will evaluate&#xD;
      participant's weight, resting metabolic rate and fasting appetite. As soon as they arrive at&#xD;
      the laboratory (12 hours fasted), we will measure their current weight, appetite and resting&#xD;
      metabolic rate. We will offer breakfast before participants leave. In total, participants&#xD;
      will complete 3 follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINAL EXPERIMENTAL SESSION (Approx. 6 hours) The same protocol applied at the baseline&#xD;
      experimental session will be repeated after the intervention.&#xD;
