  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      mRNA-1273 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine in adults with a&#xD;
      kidney or liver solid organ transplant (SOT) and in healthy adult participants. The primary&#xD;
      goal of the study is to evaluate the safety of mRNA-1273 and the serum antibody (Ab)&#xD;
      responses obtained 28 days after the last dose of mRNA-1273.&#xD;
