  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to elucidate the influence of protein beverages differing in&#xD;
      their lubrication properties (low/medium/high lubricating) and control (water) on satiety and&#xD;
      satiation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers propose an acute, randomized cross-over study that compares three types of&#xD;
      protein beverages differing in their lubricating properties, i.e. one with low lubricating&#xD;
      properties made using sodium caseinate, one with medium lubricating properties made by whey&#xD;
      protein, and the third one with high lubricating properties made by heated whey protein. All&#xD;
      three beverages contain added banana flavour and non-nutritive sweetener. Water acts as a&#xD;
      control and has the same flavour and sweetness to match those of the protein beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to come to the laboratory on four occasions. Before participating,&#xD;
      each participant is screened for eligibility criteria using an online health screening&#xD;
      questionnaire and Three Factors Eating Questionnaire. Participants are offered one of the&#xD;
      four treatments (water or either of the three protein beverages), the order of which is&#xD;
      randomized and counterbalanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are instructed to fast for 11 hours and to restrict from drinking alcohol for 24&#xD;
      hours before each session. Each session lasts 1.5 hours (8.40 am until 10.10 pm). In the&#xD;
      first session, weight and height are measured. Participants then provide baseline (- 5 min)&#xD;
      appetite ratings on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). After that they are given the&#xD;
      preload - either protein beverages differing in their lubricating properties or water. Then,&#xD;
      participants are asked to rate their appetite on a 100-mm VAS every 10 minutes for the next&#xD;
      30 minutes. Ad libitum food is offered as breakfast after 30 min after ingesting the preload&#xD;
      and the last VAS is taken. Saliva is taken three times during each session before preload,&#xD;
      after preload consumption and before ad libitum breakfast.&#xD;

    <description>Liking and wanting of both the protein beverages and water are assessed through a 100 mm VAS scale where 0 means &quot;not at all&quot; and 100 means &quot;extremely&quot;. Within the liking the ratings are taking on following attributes: the texture, flavor, sweetness and overall liking/pleasantness. The questions asked are: &quot;How much did you like the texture of the product you have just consumed?&quot;, &quot;How much did you like the flavor of the product you have just consumed?&quot;, How intense was the sweet taste of the product you have just consumed?&quot;, &quot;How pleasant was the product you have just consumed? &quot;with anchors from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;. And for the wanting assessment the question is: &quot;How much did you want to consume the product you have just had?&quot; with anchors from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;.</description>
