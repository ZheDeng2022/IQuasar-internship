  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a new type of personalized neoantigen cancer&#xD;
      vaccine（iNeo-Vac-P01）combined with anti-PD-1 antibody and radiofrequency ablation as a&#xD;
      possible treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of iNeo-Vac-P01 in combination&#xD;
      with anti-PD-1 and radiofrequency ablation, so as to provide a new personalized therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that cancer patients have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are&#xD;
      specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to&#xD;
      produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that&#xD;
      these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the&#xD;
      participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the cancer to come back in the&#xD;
      future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time&#xD;
      points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an&#xD;
      immune response.&#xD;
