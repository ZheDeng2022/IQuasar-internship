    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle weakness is a common complication of acute respiratory failure, shock and&#xD;
      other manifestations of critical illness or injury. ICU acquired weakness (ICUAW) - an entity&#xD;
      defined as a bundle of critically illness neuro-myopathy and disuse atrophy - is generally&#xD;
      diagnosed on the basis of a volitional, clinical strength evaluation, which however requires&#xD;
      patient cooperation and ability to comprehend the assessor's instructions. As patients are&#xD;
      often unconscious or uncooperative, due to sedation or delirium, such clinical diagnosis is&#xD;
      often not possible or is delayed. A further subclassification of critical illness&#xD;
      neuromyopathy can be achieved using detailed nonvolitional electrophysiological&#xD;
      investigations, which can be challenging in the ICU as they require skilled personnel for&#xD;
      both assessment and interpretation. An average Medical Research Council strength score&#xD;
      (MRC-SS) combined for 12 specified muscle groups lower than 48 has been widely used for&#xD;
      diagnosing ICUAW. Recent studies reported the clinical applicability of the MRC-SS in a&#xD;
      general ICU population, in particular its clinical usefulness in predicting ICU and&#xD;
      in-hospital patient outcomes . Moreover, interobserver agreement and clinical predictive&#xD;
      value have already been showed (8). However, ICU general population is less likely to be able&#xD;
      to cooperate with volitional strength assessment and more likely to have limited access to&#xD;
      their extremities because of trauma, burns and treatment involving medical devices. For these&#xD;
      reasons, MRC-SS may be confined to the later stages of ICU stay. Skeletal muscle ultrasound&#xD;
      is used for the evaluation of muscular, tendon and joint disorders. It allows the evaluation&#xD;
      of normal and pathological skeletal muscles through the measure of parameters reflecting&#xD;
      size, such as cross sectional area (CSA) , and architecture by calculating the pennation&#xD;
      angle, and it allows quick and repeated bedside evaluations. Despite such promising features,&#xD;
      to date, there are few published studies that have reported the clinical applicability of the&#xD;
      muscle ultrasound in prediction of ICUAW during the ICU stay. The principal aim of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the variation of peripheral muscle ultrasound characteristics (such as CSA and&#xD;
      pennation angle) during the ICU stay and its possible early predictive value of ICUAW as&#xD;
      compared to the MRC-SS performed when patients are able to cooperate.&#xD;

      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and ethical approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      observational, single-center study in a mixed medical and surgical ICU in a university&#xD;
      teaching hospital. We will investigate the variation of CSA and pennation angle of rectus&#xD;
      femoris over the ICU stay. Moreover, we will examine the clinical predictive value of these&#xD;
      two variables as compared with MRC-SS at awakening. Patients 18 years of age and older who&#xD;
      had been invasively ventilated for 48 hours were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      included preexisting neurological weakness, pregnancy, malignancy, and those admitted for&#xD;
      routine overnight postoperative surgical recovery. A flow diagram of the study is showed in&#xD;
      figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      At ICU admission (T1), patients underwent muscular ultrasound comprehensive of rectus femoris&#xD;
      cross sectional area (RFCSA) and pennation angle, diaphragm, and parasternal intercostal&#xD;
      end-expiratory thickness appraisal. At the same time, anthropometric data and biochemical&#xD;
      parameters necessary for the calculations of severity score (Sequential organ failure&#xD;
      assessment -SOFA (16); Simplified acute physiology score- SAPS II ; Acute Physiology and&#xD;
      Chronic Health Evaluation - APACHE II ) were collected. All the same measures were repeated&#xD;
      at day 3 (T3) and 7 (T7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements of body length and weight will be recorded at ICU admission. The&#xD;
      actual body weight as reported by the patients when able to do it was collected. From&#xD;
      anthropometric data, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) will be calculated, while ideal body weight&#xD;
      was calculated using a standard formula as previously described .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscular ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      RFCSA will bemeasured by B-mode ultrasonography using an 8 MHz, 5.6 cm linear transducer&#xD;
      array (MindRay TE-5 machine, Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co. Ltd. Shenzen, China),&#xD;
      similar to the method described elsewhere (11). The pennation angle, the angle of insertion&#xD;
      of muscle fascicles into the deep aponeurosis, of the rectus femoris will be measure on the&#xD;
      longitudinal view by rotating the probe parallel to either the lateral or medial head of the&#xD;
      muscle on the position where we measured CSA. To obtain precise measurements of muscle&#xD;
      parameters, all measurements will be performed by the same sonographer (PF) with 5 years of&#xD;
      experience . All data will be measure three times, and the average value will be used for&#xD;
      further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragm end-expiratory thickness will be measure in the right hemi-diaphragm in the zone of&#xD;
      apposition as described elsewhere . All ultrasound examinations will be performe using a&#xD;
      10-15 MHz linear transducer in B mode (MindRay TE-5 machine, Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics&#xD;
      Co. Ltd. Shenzen, China) by the same trained operators (PF). The inferior border of the&#xD;
      costophrenic sinus will be identifiy as the zone of transition from the artefactual&#xD;
      representation of the lung to the visualization of diaphragm and liver. The expiratory&#xD;
      thickening of the parasternal intercostal muscles will be assesse with a linear probe placed&#xD;
      3 cm laterally from the sternum, and oriented along the sagittal plane, between the 2nd and&#xD;
      the 3rd ribs (22). Muscle thickness will be measure just above the pleural line between the&#xD;
      inner and outermost hyperechogenic layers of the muscle fascial borders. Images will be&#xD;
      recorde for a subsequent computer-assisted quantitative analysis performed by a trained&#xD;
      investigator (MU), unaware of the ventilatory condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRC-SS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consciousness level of patients will be determine using the Richmond Agitation Sedation&#xD;
      Scale, with a score from -1 to +1 being indicative of wakefulness. Awake patients will then&#xD;
      required to demonstrate a positive response to simple one-stage commands. Successful&#xD;
      completion of commands was followed by muscle strength assessment using the MRC-SS - a&#xD;
      six-point grading scale ranging from 0 (no visible contraction) to 5 (normal power) applied&#xD;
      to six upper- and lower-limb muscle groups bilaterally (25). The day upon which MRC-SS will&#xD;
      be performe will be recorded. ICUAW is defined as an MRC-SS less than 48 out of a possible&#xD;
      score of 60. A standardized protocol for performing the MRC-SS will be always followed during&#xD;
      testing. Given the volitional nature of manual muscle testing, strong verbal encouragement&#xD;
      will be provided during all strength assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computation of the study power isbased on the primary outcome (prediction of ICU-acquired&#xD;
      weakness). A previous study found a correlation between diaphragm ultrasound and the&#xD;
      development of ICU-acquired weakness of r=0.3. Since the current study also assesses&#xD;
      peripheral muscle ultrasound, we hypothesized that a stronger correlation (about twice that&#xD;
      found in the cited study) could be found with 80% power at a 5% significance level by&#xD;
      enrolling 47 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using Stata/SE 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX USA) statistical&#xD;
      software package. Two-tailed P-values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      Normality will be assessed by the Shapiro-Francia test. Results will be reported as mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation if normally distributed, or median [25-75th percentiles] otherwise, and&#xD;
      differences will be tested with a two-sided t test or the MannWhitney U test. Categorical&#xD;
      variables are expressed as counts and percentage and the Chi-square or Fischer exact test&#xD;
      will be used for analysis.&#xD;
