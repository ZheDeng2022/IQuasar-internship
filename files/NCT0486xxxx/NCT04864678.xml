    <textblock>
      This retrospective audit will investigate if young people who are homeless or at risk of&#xD;
      homelessness in Melbourne were up-to-date with routine childhood and adolescent vaccines on&#xD;
      first encounter with a nurse-led primary health clinic (the Young People's Health Service),&#xD;
      and if they commenced and completed immunisation catch-up plans following referral to the&#xD;
      Young People's Health Service immunisation nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to establish baseline immunisation coverage within the&#xD;
      targeted population, then to explore the impact of an immunisation nurse role on immunisation&#xD;
      coverage in a population of young people aged 15-24 years who are experiencing or at risk of&#xD;
      homelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Young People's Health Service is a program of the Royal Children's Hospital Department of&#xD;
      Adolescent Medicine. The data collected will be sourced solely from the Royal Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Electronic Medical Records.&#xD;

    <description>Where available, data collected from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) will include risk factors for vaccine-preventable diseases and relevant social determinants of health based on the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the Australian Government Department of Health and the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance publications.&#xD;
Participants will be considered at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases if the EMR includes documentation of at least one of: a history of identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, of arriving in Australia as a migrant, refugee or asylum seeker, of incarceration, of men who have sex with men, of alcohol or other drug misuse, of smoking cigarettes, of living with Hepatitis C or HIV, of out of home care, of being a young parent, of having non-professional tattoos, or of sex work.</description>

    <description>Electronic medical records will be reviewed to record the percentage of participants who were not up-to-date with scheduled vaccines for their age on referral, and commenced a vaccine catch-up plan following referral to an immunisation nurse at the Young People's Health Service.&#xD;
Vaccines required to complete a vaccine catch-up plan will depend on the age of the participant and will be determined by an immunisation nurse.&#xD;
A participant will be considered to have commenced an immunisation catch-up plan if they receive at least one immunisation on the plan.</description>
