    <textblock>
      This is a prospective registry trial to determine the outcomes of single port robot-assisted&#xD;
      nipple sparing mastectomy (SPrNSM) utilitzing the SP da Vinci surgical system.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Robotic assisted nipple sparing mastectomies with multi-port robots, like the Da Vinci Xi,&#xD;
      have been described previously but pose significant hurdles due to the small area like the&#xD;
      breast. The Single-Port da Vinci SP (Intuitive Surgical), which was designed for application&#xD;
      to small cavity surgery, may be more appropriately suited for this procedure. This is a&#xD;
      prospective registry trial to study the outcomes of performing a single-port robot-assisted&#xD;
      nipple sparing mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who undergo rNSM and bilateral breast reconstruction of the affected breast via&#xD;
      single site small hidden axillary scar technique will be offered participation in the&#xD;
      prospective registry trial at their pre-operative visit in the UT Southwestern Breast Clinic.&#xD;
      The patient will then be seen at their regularly scheduled clinic appointments at 2 weeks, 1&#xD;
      month, 6 months, and 1 year post operatively at both Breast and Plastics and Reconstructive&#xD;
      Surgery (PRS) departments. Outcomes will be tracked in a prospectively kept electronic&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
