  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endocrine therapy is an established treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer,&#xD;
      but can cause significant side effects with deterioration in quality of life. The side&#xD;
      effects of all forms of endocrine therapy are well recognized and can lead to treatment&#xD;
      non-persistence or non-compliance. Chronotherapy, also called chronotherapeutics, is defined&#xD;
      as the administration of a medication in coordination with circadian rhythm in order to&#xD;
      minimize side effects and yield a greater efficacy. The investigators propose to perform a&#xD;
      pragmatic, multi-centre, open-label, randomized clinical trial to establish the optimal&#xD;
      timing (morning vs. evening) of administering endocrine therapy based on side effects and&#xD;
      benefits in early stage breast cancer patients.&#xD;

      Endocrine therapy is an established treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer,&#xD;
      but can cause significant side effects with deterioration in quality of life. The side&#xD;
      effects of all forms of endocrine therapy are well recognized and can lead to treatment&#xD;
      non-persistence or non-compliance. Compliance is defined as the degree or extent of&#xD;
      conformity to the recommended administration by the provider, whereas persistence refers to&#xD;
      the act of continuing treatment for a certain prescribed duration. Treatment adherence is&#xD;
      especially important in breast cancer, as early cessation or reduced compliance to hormonal&#xD;
      therapy are associated with reduced disease-free survival and increased mortality.&#xD;
      Chronotherapy, also called chronotherapeutics, is defined as the administration of a&#xD;
      medication in coordination with circadian rhythm in order to minimize side effects and yield&#xD;
      a greater efficacy. The investigators propose to perform a pragmatic, multi-centre,&#xD;
      open-label, randomized clinical trial to establish the optimal timing (morning vs. evening)&#xD;
      of administering endocrine therapy based on side effects and benefits in early stage breast&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by the change in total Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks following the beginning of endocrine therapy. FACT-ES is a validated sub scale of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) measurement system. FACT-ES consists of 46 items on a 5 point Likert type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). It is designed to measure five domains of health related quality of life in breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy: physical, social, emotional, functional well-being as well as an endocrine symptom sub-scale (ESS).</description>

    <description>Measured by the change in the total score and individual sub scales of the validated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with Breast cancer (FACT-B) questionnaire from baseline to 4, 8, 12 and 52 weeks following the beginning of endocrine therapy. The FACT-B consists of 37 items on a 5 point Likert type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). It is designed to measure five domains of health related quality of life in breast cancer patients: physical, social, emotional, functional well-being as well as a breast-cancer sub-scale (BCS).</description>
