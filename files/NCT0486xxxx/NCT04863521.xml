  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the use of&#xD;
      MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) 3.0 in clinical practice over a 1 year period of time. The&#xD;
      investigators will pilot MHP 3.0 (Spanish and English language options) at practice sites at&#xD;
      the Obstetrix Medical Group of Houston, Texas and the UPMC Healthcare System. Feedback from&#xD;
      both patients and the care team will be assessed throughout this study. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed using a short acceptability and feasibility survey that will be administered by the&#xD;
      Naima Health team by phone four times during the study term: week 14-18, week 24-28, week 34&#xD;
      and week 36-42.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study the investigators pilot MHP products in two clinical settings to determine&#xD;
      their acceptability and feasibility in clinical practice. The investigators will pilot MHP&#xD;
      3.0 (Spanish and English language options) at practice sites at the Obstetrix Medical Group&#xD;
      of Houston, Texas and the UPMC Healthcare System for a 1-year period. Participants will&#xD;
      receive MHP to use as part of their prenatal care, along with communication from the&#xD;
      prescribing provider about how the app will be used and when the provider will have access to&#xD;
      their information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Sample Size: The investigators will recruit a sample of 75 patients from each&#xD;
      clinical site in women's first trimester of pregnancy. In the case of Obstetrix Medical Group&#xD;
      of Houston, the investigators will oversample for Spanish speakers (approximately 20% of our&#xD;
      population). Women will be eligible for recruitment if they are at least 18 years old, are&#xD;
      currently pregnant and under the care of a participating provider/clinic, own a smartphone,&#xD;
      and are literate in English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A site coordinator will identify eligible women to match our demographic requirements and&#xD;
      introduce the study during an initial prenatal appointment, then consent women to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources and collection (patients): A short acceptability and feasibility survey will be&#xD;
      administered by the Naima Health team by phone three times during the study term. A final&#xD;
      questionnaire will be conducted by phone between weeks 36-42 to review their psychosocial&#xD;
      screening experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Plan and Sample Size Considerations: The investigators will focus on feasibility (a&#xD;
      priori defined as ≥ 67% completion of weekly questionnaires administered through the app) and&#xD;
      acceptability (a priori defined as satisfaction scores of ≥ 4 on a 7-point Likert scale among&#xD;
      ≥80% participants) as primary outcomes for this aim. Descriptive statistics will be used to&#xD;
      characterize baseline demographic characteristics of the participants. The investigators will&#xD;
      use point estimates (i.e. means and sample proportions) and 95% confidence intervals to&#xD;
      characterize the sample with respect to baseline demographic characteristics. Debriefing&#xD;
      interview transcripts will be coded for themes of acceptability, satisfaction, and barriers&#xD;
      to app use.&#xD;
