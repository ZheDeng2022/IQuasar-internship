  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is an extremely common health problem and recent studies have shown that nearly&#xD;
      up to 52% of patients have low back pain caused by lumbar facet joint syndrome.&#xD;
      Intra-articular injection of facet joints has gradually become one of the vital therapeutic&#xD;
      methods for lumbar facet joint syndrome, Steroid is one of the most commonly used injected&#xD;
      drugs; however, previous studies have indicated that it has limited ability in long-term&#xD;
      relief of low back pain. Therefore, it seems meaningful to apply a new injectable drug and to&#xD;
      prove its effectiveness and safety for the treatment of lumbar facet joint syndrome. Recent&#xD;
      studies indicate that autologous platelet rich plasma(PRP) is an appropriate injectable&#xD;
      material with great potential in treating many different musculoskeletal disorders and&#xD;
      currently it is not yet used on a wide scale as a treatment for lumbar facet joint synovitis.&#xD;
      In this study the investigators compare the efficacy and safety of Intra-articular injection&#xD;
      of PRP versus conventional steriods in patients with lumbar facet joint synovitis.&#xD;

      The study is conducted upon Thirty patients who present to Ain Shams University hospitals&#xD;
      outpatient clinic complaining of chronic low back pain diagnosed to have potential lumbar&#xD;
      facet joint syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking informed written consent the recruited patients will be subjected to the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. History:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Clinical Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full history taking&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Thorough clinical examination to exclude radicular or neurological manifestation (motor&#xD;
           weakness, incontinence, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis of pain using:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  low back pain visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest: VAS is a subjective numerical&#xD;
                pain rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates&#xD;
                the worst pain ever experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ), as experienced by the patient in the&#xD;
                last 24 hours, of a total score of 24, where a score of 0 represented no disability&#xD;
                and a score of 24 represented the maximum disability .&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  - Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), ODI is currently considered as the gold&#xD;
                     standard for measuring degree of disability and estimating quality of life in&#xD;
                     a patient with low back pain. The ODI is comprised of 10 items which reflect&#xD;
                     the patient's ability to manage their everyday life while dealing with their&#xD;
                     pain. Each item in the ODI had 6 options to represent a score from 0 to 5,&#xD;
                     where choice of the first option of the 6 scores 0 and the last scores 5. A&#xD;
                     percentage score is calculated: total score of the patient/ max score possible&#xD;
                     x 100%. A 10% change has been identified as being clinically meaningful. The&#xD;
                     result had 5 levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  minimal disability (0% - 20%)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  moderate disability (21% - 40%)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  severe disability (41% - 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  crippled (61% - 80%)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  bed-bound or exaggerating symptoms (81% - 100%)(Fairbank et al., 1980). II.&#xD;
                     Radiological investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging : Done by a single consultant radiologist to detect and grade&#xD;
      facet joint synovitis according to the following grading system :&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 : No signal abnormality&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. : Signal abnormality confined to joint capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. : Periarticular signal abnormality involving less than 50 % of the perimeter of the&#xD;
           joint*&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. : Periarticular signal abnormality involving more than 50 % of the perimeter of the&#xD;
           joint *&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. : Grade 3 with extension of signal abnormality into the intervertebral foramen,&#xD;
           ligamentum flavum, pedicle, transverse process, or vertebral body.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Signal abnormality may extend into the articular pillar or lamina but does not&#xD;
                contribute to the definition of the grade&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The participants will be randomly assigned for intra-articular injection to&#xD;
                     either; Group (I) (n =15) to be injected with autologous platelet rich plasma&#xD;
                     and Group (II) (n=15) to be injected with corticosteroids(a mixture of 0.5%&#xD;
                     lidocaine and 5mg/ml of betamethasone) . The treated segments will be&#xD;
                     determined by clinical signs and MRI detected facet joint synovitis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Preparation of Autologous PRP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under sterile conditions, about 20 ml of peripheral venous blood will be collected with&#xD;
      addition of sodium citrate to the test tube. The PRP will be prepared based on the standard&#xD;
      2-step centrifugation method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . The sample is first centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 15 min to separate erythrocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum supernatant is subjected to the second centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes&#xD;
           to remove part of the platelet poor plasma and concentrate the platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, approximately 2 to 4 mL of buffy coat autologous PRP is collected in a clear syringe&#xD;
      for fluoroscopy guided injection as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Lumbar Facet Joint Injection Injection will be performed under supervision of an&#xD;
      experienced pain physician, X-ray guided under fluoroscopy. The site for needle penetration&#xD;
      will be marked at the intersection of the beam of a C-arm - a device used to guide the needle&#xD;
      to a specific area while watching that needle on a live x-ray screen- and the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard antisepsis of the skin will be applied, local anesthesia with 0.5% lidocaine will be&#xD;
      administered followed by a 21-G spinal needle insertion into the facet joint space under&#xD;
      fluoroscopic control, then the targeted joint will be injected with approximately 0.5 mL of&#xD;
      autologous PRP in the first group and with 0.5 to 1 ml of a mixture of 0.5% lidocaine and&#xD;
      5mg/ml of betamethasone in the second group. Multiple joints can be injected in the same&#xD;
      setting according to our decision depending on clinical examination and MRI findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Follow-up and Clinical Evaluation All the patients will be followed at 3 months after the&#xD;
      injection and no anti-inflammatory treatment will be given to the patients during the follow&#xD;
      up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation: criteria and scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  low back pain visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging For facet joint synovitis detection and grading in the&#xD;
           injected joints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data is coded, tabulated, and statistically analyzed using SPSS program&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software version 17.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be done for numerical parametric data as mean +/-SD (standard&#xD;
      deviation) and minimum &amp; maximum of the range and for numerical non parametric data as median&#xD;
      and 1st&amp; 3rd inter-quartile range, while they will be done for categorical data as number and&#xD;
      percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential analyses will be done for quantitative variables using independent t-test in&#xD;
      cases of two independent groups with parametric data and Mann Whitney U in cases of two&#xD;
      independent groups with non parametric data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential analyses will be done for qualitative data using Chi square test for independent&#xD;
      groups. The level of significance will be taken at P value &lt;0.050 is significant, otherwise&#xD;
      is non significant. The p-value is a statistical measure for the probability that the results&#xD;
      observed in a study could occur by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved from the Ethical committee of the department of physical medicine ,&#xD;
      rehabilitation and rheumatology, faculty of medicine, Ain shams university and from the&#xD;
      Research Ethical Committee (REC) Ain shams University.&#xD;
