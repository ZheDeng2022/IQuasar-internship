  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perineal trauma at the time of vaginal delivery is common, and when the anal sphincter is&#xD;
      included, these injuries can be associated with additional morbidity including incontinence,&#xD;
      pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction. Techniques studied include hands-on vs hands-off,&#xD;
      perineal massage, warm compresses, Ritgen maneuver, and others. It is unclear if a hands-on&#xD;
      technique decreases the incidence of perineal trauma compared to a hands-off technique&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different strategies have been adopted in the late first and/or second stage of labor to&#xD;
      decrease the incidence of perineal lacerations. These strategies include not only the&#xD;
      hands-on technique, but also warm compresses, perineal massage, the use of oil or jelly, the&#xD;
      Ritgen maneuver and a new perineal protection device. The review by Aasheim reported a&#xD;
      decreased risk of third- and fourth-degree lacerations in the perineal massage group (two&#xD;
      studies, RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.94).4 This review also showed a similar reduction in&#xD;
      third- and fourth-degree lacerations with warm compresses (two studies, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28&#xD;
      to 0.84), but no significant changes with use of a Ritgen maneuver. Additional reviews have&#xD;
      evaluated delayed versus immediate pushing, with no significant difference in perineal&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding how the interventions may work, initially the hands-on technique was hypothesized&#xD;
      to control the velocity of the crowning process and therefore decrease perineal trauma. Given&#xD;
      the fact that the hands-on approach has been found to be possibly associated with more&#xD;
      perineal lacerations instead of less, some have proposed that the harm may be caused by the&#xD;
      hands-on approach's additional pressure resulting in some perineal ischemia. Moreover, using&#xD;
      one intervention (e.g. hands-on) may predispose to use other interventions (e.g. episiotomy),&#xD;
      which have themselves been proven to increase perineal trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perhaps a combination of perineal interventions, such as massage or compresses, with a&#xD;
      hands-off approach and avoidance of episiotomy, will prove to show improved perineal&#xD;
      outcomes. Larger studies, including evaluation specific for nulliparous subjects, are&#xD;
      required to make definitive recommendations for management.&#xD;
