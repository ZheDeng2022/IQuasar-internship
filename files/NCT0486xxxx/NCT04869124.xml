  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the DAPA-VOLVO trial is to investigate the effects of Dapagliflozin on top of&#xD;
      recommended standard therapy on volume status and vascular function in clinically stable&#xD;
      heart failure patients after hospitalization because of an acute decompensated heart failure&#xD;
      event.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical trials found that Dapagliflozin can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      hospitalization and death in heart failure (HF) patients with reduced left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFrEF) in the presence of absence of diabetes. Additional trials are&#xD;
      ongoing to investigate whether these results can be translated also to HF-patients with&#xD;
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the underlying mechanisms leading to the&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes are not completely understood but the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin on volume status and vascular function are discussed as potential key factors.&#xD;
      This study is designed as a mechanistic study to investigate the impact of Dapagliflozin on&#xD;
      volume status and vascular function in clinically stable heart failure patients after&#xD;
      hospitalization/ ambulatory care because of an acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF)&#xD;
      event. After being informed about the study and potential risks all patients given written&#xD;
      informed consent will be screened for the defined eligibility criteria and thereafter&#xD;
      randomized in a double-blind manner (patients, investigators) 1:1 ratio to either receive the&#xD;
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) Dapagliflozin (10mg/day) or Placebo on top&#xD;
      of recommended standard therapy for in total 12 weeks. The results of this study may provide&#xD;
      new mechanistic insight into the beneficial effects of Dapagliflozin on volume regulation and&#xD;
      vascular function and have great potential to contribute to change current clinical&#xD;
      guidelines in the management of patients with heart failure.&#xD;
