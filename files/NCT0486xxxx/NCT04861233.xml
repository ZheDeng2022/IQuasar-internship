    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to check the side effects from lubiprostone in adults with&#xD;
      constipation. Participants will be treated with lubiprostone according to their clinic's&#xD;
      standard practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational post-marketing surveillance study of lubiprostone in&#xD;
      participants with constipation. The study will assess the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      lubiprostone for its approved indication with real-world setting in South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. The data will be collected&#xD;
      prospectively at the study sites will be recorded into electronic case report forms (e-CRFs).&#xD;
      All the participants will be assigned to a single observational cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ All Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in South Korea. The overall duration of the study will be&#xD;
      approximately 6 years. Data collection will be based on routinely scheduled visits during a&#xD;
      12-month follow up period for each participant up to a final follow-up when the participant&#xD;
      discontinues treatment or at the end of follow-up period for any participants still taking&#xD;
      lubiprostone.&#xD;
