  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to identify and register practical observations and experiences in&#xD;
      connection with planning and implementing decentralized, patient-centered clinical trials at&#xD;
      a geographic distance with virtual elements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single arm, multi-center, Phase II interventional pilot trial. Primary objective&#xD;
      will be to assess participant satisfaction with the decentralized clinical trial (DCT)&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will enroll men and pre- and post-menopausal women with a HR-positive/HER2-negative&#xD;
      ABC (loco regionally recurrent not amenable to curative therapy or metastatic) with a PIK3CA&#xD;
      mutation, which progressed on or after endocrine-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive alpelisib 300 mg daily and fulvestrant 500 mg administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly on Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 1, Day 15, and on Day 1 of each cycle thereafter&#xD;
      until Cycle 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-menopausal women will receive goserelin 3.6 mg on Day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;
