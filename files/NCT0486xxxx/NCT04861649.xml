    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress can affect the balance of intestinal flora and intestinal structure of&#xD;
      patients, resulting in intestinal flora disorder. Its bacterial metabolites stimulate the&#xD;
      parasympathetic nerve, regulate insulin secretion and other metabolic pathways of patients&#xD;
      through neuroendocrine regulation, resulting in abnormal energy metabolism of lipids and&#xD;
      sugars in the digestive tract, and finally lead to malnutrition.We hypothesized that fecal&#xD;
      bacteria transplantation could reconstruct the normal intestinal flora, restore the&#xD;
      intestinal digestion and absorption function of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease（COPD）patients and improve the state of malnutrition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. improve the COPD patients with malnutrition is the key to improve the digestion and&#xD;
           absorption function of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the&#xD;
           world's third most common cause of death, is characterized by progressive airflow&#xD;
           limited, mainly by the long-term exposure to tobacco smoke and other harmful air&#xD;
           pollutants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It has been reported that 20%-71% of COPD patients suffer from malnutrition, and there&#xD;
           is a negative correlation between BMI and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is increasing evidence that patients with COPD with lower BMI or fat-free mass&#xD;
           index are associated with poorer prognosis and impaired long-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At present, nutrition supplements are mainly used to solve the problem of COPD&#xD;
           malnutrition, including vitamins and minerals, essential amino acids and biological&#xD;
           amino acids, anti-inflammatory omega-3, high fat and high carbohydrate, etc., while the&#xD;
           causes of COPD malnutrition and the relationship between COPD and metabolism have not&#xD;
           been paid attention to.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although there is evidence that there is no malnutrition nutritional support can improve&#xD;
           the prognosis of patients with COPD, but exist in patients with malnutrition, due to&#xD;
           impaired digestion and absorption, increase nutrition supply, prone to patients with&#xD;
           abdominal distension, vomiting, and diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, in order to improve malnutrition in patients with COPD, it is necessary to&#xD;
           improve digestion and absorption function in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improve digestion and absorption function, first of all, correct the oxidative stress&#xD;
           caused by intestinal flora disorder as part of the systemic oxidative stress response,&#xD;
           copd patients with intestinal oxidative stress, oxidative stress result of active oxygen&#xD;
           free radicals on colon epithelium mucosa layer of mucin, lead to the loss of protein,&#xD;
           mucous layer thickness can be reduced to 50%, resulting in changes in the structure of&#xD;
           intestinal tract; In addition, under the action of active oxygen free radicals,&#xD;
           epithelial cells of the digestive tract, the close connection between protein oxidation&#xD;
           lead to intestinal epithelial permeability enhancement, on the one hand, the intestinal&#xD;
           toxins can after connection into the intestinal permeability increased cells, affect the&#xD;
           digestion and absorption function of intestinal cells, on the other hand, the oxidative&#xD;
           stress products into the lumen of blood, lead to bacterial flora disorder, further&#xD;
           affect intestinal digestion and absorption of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The common clinical manifestations of intestinal flora disorder are: mild abdominal&#xD;
           distension, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, water and electrolyte disturbance,&#xD;
           hypoproteinemia, malnutrition, and even shock. Therefore, in order to improve intestinal&#xD;
           digestion and absorption function, it is necessary to correct intestinal flora disorder&#xD;
           caused by oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. intestinal flora and the relationship between nutrition, immunity, metabolism,&#xD;
           neuroendocrine, normal human intestinal bacteria number, up to about 1013 ~ 1014&#xD;
           microbes, equivalent to 10 times of the total number of human tissue cells and its&#xD;
           metabolites other tissue cells function to human body impact, the total number of genes&#xD;
           at the same time, the intestinal bacteria coding is about more than 100 times of the&#xD;
           total number of human genes, some experts believe that intestinal flora is one of the&#xD;
           normal function of the human body organ, the abnormal organs, inevitably affects the&#xD;
           health of human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal flora by helping to break down food and absorb nutrition, synthesis of nutrients,&#xD;
      metabolites indirectly stimulate the nerve endocrine effects such as the host's nutritional&#xD;
      status: promote ingested B vitamins (B3, B5, B6, B12) and other micronutrients, help absorb&#xD;
      minerals (calcium, magnesium and iron, etc.), regulating metabolism of glucose and lipid&#xD;
      storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synthesis of micronutrients such as vitamin K, B12, biotin, folic acid and pantothenates; By&#xD;
      affecting the integrity of mucosal epithelium, it plays an immune defense role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal flora disturbance is related to the formation of metabolic diseases such as&#xD;
      obesity and diabetes in the host. Rachels study showed that intestinal flora disturbance in&#xD;
      rats can increase the production of acetate, and feeding acetate to rats can promote the&#xD;
      secretion of insulin in rats, the mechanism of which is realized by the activation of acetate&#xD;
      through the parasympathetic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The production of acetate increases, and the stimulation intensity of parasympathetic nerve&#xD;
      is enhanced, which promotes insulin secretion, and promotes ghrelin secretion by consuming&#xD;
      glucose and reducing hypoglycemia, leading to obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study also showed that the intestinal microbiome shifted from lean donors to&#xD;
      patients with metabolic syndrome, resulting in increased insulin sensitivity of the&#xD;
      receptors.4) animal models and patients with copd, there exist dysbacteriosis.&#xD;
