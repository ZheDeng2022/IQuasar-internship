  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this multicentre study is to evaluate the standard of care of participants&#xD;
      diagnosed with Chronic Otitis Media that have already gone through a first middle ear surgery&#xD;
      but still have at least a moderate hearing loss. The study has a retrospective part&#xD;
      (extraction of medical chart data) and a prospective part with a survey and three&#xD;
      questionnaires collecting data on the use of health care services, on health related quality&#xD;
      of life and hearing performance.&#xD;

    <measure>Self-reported health status and health related quality of life via the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>HUI provides descriptive evidence on multiple dimensions of health status, a score for each dimension of health and an overall Health Related Quality of life score. The HUI3 classification system is comprised of 8 attributes: Vision, Hearing, Speech, Ambulation, Dexterity, Emotion, Cognition and Pain - each with 5 or 6 levels of ability/disability The scoring systems provide utility (preference) scores on a generic scale where 0.00 indicates death and 1.00 indicates perfect health.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported health related quality of life of participants with COM via the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test-15 (COMOT-15) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>COMOT-15 measures Health Related Quality of life of participants with COM. It consists of three subscales: ear symptoms, hearing function, and mental health forming the overall score. In addition, two questions related to COM are asked: one on the general evaluation of quality of life and one on the frequency of doctor visits in the last six months. The total score and the sub-scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale by dividing the sum of the raw scores of the items by the sum of spans of the items, then multiplying by 100. A higher score indicates a worse health-related quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported auditory disability via the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ-12) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>SSQ-12 measures speech, spatial and hearing experiences. The total score summarizes these parameters. A scale from 0 to 10 is used. A mark 0 means &quot;be quite unable to do or experience what is described&quot; and a mark 10 means &quot;be perfectly able to do or experience what is described in the question&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Validation of the COMOT-15 questionnaire in French and Spanish</measure>

    <description>Questionnaire to be completed by a minimum of 30 participants per language with an accompanying audiogram done within 12 months of questionnaire completion and with completed SSQ-12 and HUI3 questionnaires. The Cronbach's alpha value of 0.7 is used as a cut-off to measure consistency between the data.</description>
