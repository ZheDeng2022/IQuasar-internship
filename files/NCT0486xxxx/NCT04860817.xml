  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T cells are a type of immune cell. Like other cells of the body, T Cells can develop cancer.&#xD;
      T cell cancers mainly include T cell leukaemia and T cell lymphoma, both of which have a&#xD;
      relatively poor prognosis. Currently, patients with relapsed/refractory type (the name given&#xD;
      to cancer that reappears or grows again after a period of no changes or signs of cancer) of&#xD;
      this leukaemia or lymphoma have limited choices for treatment. CAR-T cells are immune cells&#xD;
      that are engineered to target specific cell markers. For example, CAR-T cells targeting the&#xD;
      marker CD19 have shown great effectiveness in the treatment of B cell tumors that carry this&#xD;
      marker. Here investigators construct a new universal CAR-T design targeting CD7 which is&#xD;
      found on the cells of relapsed/refractory type T cell leukaemia and lymphoma and hope to test&#xD;
      its safety and efficiency in the treatment of relapsed/refractory type T cell leukaemia and&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Who can participate? Patients diagnosed with relapsed/refractory T cell leukaemia or&#xD;
      lymphoma. Both genders, aged 2-25 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What does the study involve? Enrolled participants are randomly chosen to receive one of&#xD;
      three different dose levels of CAR-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose level one: 0.6×10^7 cells/kg;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose level two: 1×10^7 cells/kg;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dose level three: 1.5×10^7 cells/kg. Before CAR-T infusion, all participants will&#xD;
           receive a preconditioning therapy including several chemotherapy agents or other&#xD;
           interventions that are required to help the effect of the CAR-T cells. After completion&#xD;
           of preconditioning therapy, infusion of the CAR-T cells via a tube into the vein needs&#xD;
           to start within 1 week. Participants will receive one infusion of CAR-T cells which will&#xD;
           take between 15 and 30 mins. All participants will have a blood test before infusion and&#xD;
           at 4, 7, 10 and 14 days following infusion to measure their response to the treatment&#xD;
           and some further tests will be required in some participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? The universal CAR-T cells&#xD;
      targeting CD7 may lead to durable disease control and long term survival. The main risks of&#xD;
      participating include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector cell-associated&#xD;
      neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where is the study run from? Haematology department of 920th Hospital of Joint Logistics&#xD;
      Support Force of People's Liberation Army of China (China).&#xD;

Dose level one: 0.6×10^7 cells/kg;&#xD;
Dose level two: 1×10^7 cells/kg;&#xD;
Dose level three: 1.5×10^7 cells/kg. Before CAR-T infusion, all participants will receive a preconditioning therapy suggested as: Fludarabine 30 mg/m^2×6d, Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2×6d or Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m^2×6d. After completion of preconditioning therapy, infusion of CAR-T cells needs to start within 1 week.
