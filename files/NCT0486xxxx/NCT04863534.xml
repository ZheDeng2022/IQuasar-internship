  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30% of the patients affected by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) may&#xD;
      develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires in the majority of&#xD;
      patients a respiratory support with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and, very often, the&#xD;
      intubation . Recent evidence is growing in describing the characteristics of this disease,&#xD;
      with main focus on lung morphology. Therapeutic strategies implemented for their management&#xD;
      may often lead to short-term muscular and functional alterations resulting in ICU-Acquired&#xD;
      weakness. These lead to long-term disabilities expressing through dependence and quality of&#xD;
      life impairment of survivors. Indeed, few data are still available regarding the peripheral&#xD;
      and respiratory muscular characteristics, mainly because this investigation is usually&#xD;
      confined in more advance stages of disease. Muscular ultrasonography allows visualization and&#xD;
      classification of muscle characteristics which may be described besides muscles' thickness&#xD;
      with their echogenicity. In fact, lean muscle tissue has a low echogenicity, whereas&#xD;
      intramuscular fat and connective tissue are characterized by a high echogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a greyscale analysis, the total muscle echo-intensity may in fact be quantified. The&#xD;
      assumption is that the higher the mean pixel intensity of a muscle region of interest, the&#xD;
      lower the muscle quality (i.e., more intramuscular fat or connective tissue) and thus its&#xD;
      inhomogeneity. Muscle echogenicity has already been investigated during critical illness,&#xD;
      although its modifications over the time and its associated histopathological characteristics&#xD;
      remain to be determined. In fact, inflammation and infection as well as fluid shifts may&#xD;
      substantially contribute to the increment in muscular inhomogeneity. Few data are available&#xD;
      regarding the characteristics of respiratory muscle ultrasound quality during critical&#xD;
      illness, as most of the study restricted this methodology to the analysis of peripheral&#xD;
      muscles in the detection of ICU acquired weakness. Recently, the parasternal intercostal&#xD;
      muscles and the diaphragm have been investigated together in the critical care setting as&#xD;
      they represent the easiest accessible respiratory muscles to be investigated by ultrasound .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that a combined assessment of respiratory (i.e., intercostal&#xD;
      and diaphragm) and peripheral (i.e., quadriceps) muscles quantity (as measured by thickness)&#xD;
      and quality (as assessed by greyscale analysis), would reflect the severity of illness.&#xD;
      Thus,the aims of this study are to assess if the quality characteristics of parasternal&#xD;
      intercostal, diaphragm and quadriceps muscles of ICU COVID19 patients influenced the outcomes&#xD;
      and are correlated with other variables, such as fluid or protein balance, or indexes of&#xD;
      inflammation&#xD;
