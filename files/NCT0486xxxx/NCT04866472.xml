      This study will assess the feasibility of using the TCI Articulating Device with&#xD;
      video-laryngoscope in predictive, difficult airway, endotracheal intubation cases. It is&#xD;
      meant to show the use of this device is equivalent to using the GlideRite Rigid Stylet with&#xD;
      video-laryngoscope.&#xD;

    <description>Once subject is in the operating room, standard monitoring will be instituted including nerve stimulator. Induction will follow standard practice.Once full muscle relaxation is confirmed with a train of four of 0/4 laryngoscopy will be preformed using a video-laryngoscope (VLS) with a #3 blade for women and a #4 blade men. Endotracheal intubation will be performed using a #7 endotracheal tube in women and # 8 in men using the GlideRite Rigid Stylet. The stylet will be shaped to the curvature of the blade of the VLS and lubricated with a water-based lubricant. After successful tracheal intubation the circuit will be connected and ventilation confirmed with capnography and auscultation.</description>

    <description>In the operating room, standard monitoring will be instituted including nerve simulator. Induction will follow standard practice. Once full muscle relaxation is achieved (train of four of 0/4) laryngoscopy will be performed using a video-laryngoscope (VLS) using a #3 blade in women and a #4 blade in men. A #7 endotracheal tube will be used for women and a #8 for men. Endotracheal intubation will be performed by placing the tube on the back of the TCI articulating introducer, after shaft is lubricated with a water based lubricant. The tip of the TCI articulating introducer will be maneuvered into the trachea and advanced until the green zone of the introducer shaft is adjacent to the glottis. The handle of the articulating introducer will then be removed and the ETT will be advanced over the articulating introducer and into the trachea via Seldinger's technique. Once in place the respiratory circuit will be connected and confirmed with capnography and auscultation.</description>
