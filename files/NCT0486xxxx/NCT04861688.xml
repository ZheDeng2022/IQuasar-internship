    <measure>Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNS-VS), Domain score: Complex Attention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months of treatment compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Change in complex attention score, determined using Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNS-VS) computer cognitive testing system, after 6 months of treatment compared to baseline in the group of patients receiving NeuroAiD II™ (MLC901), compared to the placebo group.&#xD;
In the domain dashboard, above average domain scores indicate a Standard Score (SS) greater than 109 or a Percentile Rank (PR) greater than 74, indicating a high functioning test subject. Average is a SS 90-102 or PR 25-74, indicating normal function. Low average is SS 80-99 or PR 9-24 indicating a slight deficit or impairment. Below average is SS 70-79 or PR 2-8, indicating moderate level of deficit or impairment. Very low is SS less than 70 or a PR less than 2, indicating a deficit and impairment. Lower score is better for Complex Attention.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient with mild TBI, which occurred 1-12 months prior enrolment to the study. Mild&#xD;
             TBI is defined as an external force from an incident causing injury to the brain and&#xD;
             resulting in an altered level of consciousness. The mTBI diagnosis should be&#xD;
             documented. Mild TBI is evidenced by any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  best Glasgow Coma Score 13-15 as assessed on scene, on admission and over next 3&#xD;
                  days&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  loss of consciousness for up to 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  dazed and confused at the time of injury or post-TBI amnesia of &lt; 24 hours&#xD;
                  duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient experiencing cognitive impairment following injury, determined by the&#xD;
             Cognitive Failures Questionnaire score &gt;30.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. The patient has signed an Informed Consent form (ICF) for participation in this study&#xD;
             before initiation of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient can understand all protocol requirements, perform the study procedures,&#xD;
             and agree to all limitations specified in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient agrees to use adequate contraception methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Moderate or Severe TBI, determined by best Glasgow Coma Score of &lt;13 (as assessed on&#xD;
             scene, on admission and over next 3 days), or injury requiring neurosurgery (even if&#xD;
             surgery was not done)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Co-existing severe co-morbidity, including end stage renal failure, spinal cord&#xD;
             injury, significant substance abuse, severe liver disease, significant mental&#xD;
             illnesses, diabetes requiring insulin injections, severe agitation, advanced cancer or&#xD;
             other severe conditions with life expectancy of less than 5 years. The decision on&#xD;
             significance of the comorbidity for inclusion/exclusion from current study is made by&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

          8. Other medical condition which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator would place&#xD;
             undue risk on the patient if included in the trial or likely to interfere with&#xD;
             NeuroAiD II™.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of psychic (including depressive) disorders, physical and other factors that&#xD;
             do not allow for adequate self-assessment of one's behaviour and for compliance with&#xD;
