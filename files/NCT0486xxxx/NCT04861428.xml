  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel heat-not-burn tobacco product (IQOS) will be provided to smokers, compared against a&#xD;
      (cigarette) smoking as usual period in counter-balanced order in a cross-over design. This&#xD;
      study will examine the short-term effects of IQOS, switching from combustible to&#xD;
      noncombustible nicotine and withdrawal-related symptoms over a two week-long &quot;practice&quot;&#xD;
      period, relative to smoking as usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current within-subjects crossover study aims to directly compare initial efficacy of IQOS&#xD;
      vs (cigarette) smoking as usual on switching from tobacco cigarettes during two-week&#xD;
      &quot;practice&quot; periods in smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions include IQOS, a commercially available, over the counter product. The&#xD;
      IQOS is a commercially available tobacco product that consists of a holder which contains a&#xD;
      rechargeable battery and an electronically heated metal blade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will take place in the Prevention and Early Detection Center (PEDC) at the&#xD;
      UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. Participants will be assessed daily via remote CO assessment and&#xD;
      online questionnaire throughout the entire study (WK1-WK5). At the end of a one-week baseline&#xD;
      of normal smoking (WK1), participants will be randomized to either: 1) begin a two-week&#xD;
      period of attempting to completely switch to exclusive IQOS use (IQOS First); or 2) continue&#xD;
      to smoke as usual (IQOS Last; WK2-WK3), followed by a second two-week period during which&#xD;
      they will smoke as usual or attempt to switch to IQOS (opposite of the first period;&#xD;
      WK4-WK5).&#xD;
