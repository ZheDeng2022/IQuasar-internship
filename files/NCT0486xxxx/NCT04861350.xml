  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired neuromuscular control is a risk factor for groin pain in athletes participating&#xD;
      multidirectional sports, which leads to decreased hip muscle strength and range of motion.&#xD;
      Injured athletes with adductor-related groin pain who trained with neuromuscular control&#xD;
      strategy would return to sports activities earlier than those who only trained with muscle&#xD;
      strengthening. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of imagery training (IT) on&#xD;
      motor control and muscle strength in athletes, which also revealed that imagery training&#xD;
      combined with physical training (IPT) can lead to faster recovery of neuromuscular control&#xD;
      than physical training (PT) alone. Besides, monitoring the neurophysiological changes of&#xD;
      brain plasticity and motor learning after training helps to understanding the mechanisms on&#xD;
      the training effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare (1) the cortical control mechanisms between 3&#xD;
      types of motor control training strategies; and (2) the effects of 3 types of motor control&#xD;
      training on neuromuscular performance in athletes with long-standing adductor-related groin&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 30 athletes with hip adductors-related groin pain, and compare&#xD;
      the effect of three types of motor control training (movement training, imagery training,&#xD;
      combined movement and imagery training) on Y balance test performance, cortico-muscular&#xD;
      coherence, and event-related desynchronization (ERD, α band) and event-related&#xD;
      synchronization (ERS, β band).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi squared test is used to examine the group differences in motor imagery ability and&#xD;
      severity of groin pain. The repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to&#xD;
      compare the intervention effect between groups. The alpha level was set at 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects will stand on Y-balance kit and reach their legs alternatively to anterior, posterolateral and posteromedial direction, with dominant leg first, in sequence. The subjects will practice 6 times first to familiarize the test procedure, then the final three measurements were collected and normalized with subjects' lower limb length for statistical analysis.</description>

    <description>The investigator will place 32-leads EEG on subjects' head and bipolar surface EMG(MP150, BIONOMADIX; BIOPAC, Systems, Inc.) on subjects' internal oblique abdominis, gluteus medius and adductor longus. The investigator will collect the signals and process them into cortico-muscular coherence as the functional connection between cortex and muscle during neuromuscular task.</description>

    <description>The investigator will collect the EEG signals from subjects during the first and the last set of intervention, and the signals will be band-pass filtered (3-60 Hz) and processed with power spectrum density analysis to calculate frequency power at alpha (4-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands. The training data will be normalized with resting values to determine event-related synchronization or desynchronization, which represent the cortical activation changes during physical or imagery training.</description>
