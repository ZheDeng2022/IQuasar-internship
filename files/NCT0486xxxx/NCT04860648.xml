  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) occur in many patients, especially those with&#xD;
      high risks, and are associated with increased hospital length of stay, morbidity and costs of&#xD;
      care. According to European Perioperative Clinical Outcome definitions, major pulmonary&#xD;
      complications include atelectasis, respiratory infection, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax.&#xD;
      Because identifying patients at high risk for PPCs may allow earlier treatment, predictive&#xD;
      scores ( the Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia score [ARISCAT]) have&#xD;
      been developed.Lung ultrasound (LUS) is more accurate than chest X-ray in diagnosing&#xD;
      pulmonary complications, and lung ultrasound performed in the postanesthesia care unit may&#xD;
      identify patients at higher risk for pulmonary complications. So we aimed to study if lung&#xD;
      ultrasound can guide the prevention of PPCs in moderate to high risk patients.&#xD;

      patients recruited are randomized into the two groups: LUS group and Control group. Patients&#xD;
      in LUS group received ultrasound examination and guided the treatment according to the&#xD;
      ultrasound results, while the control group did not receive ultrasound examination, just the&#xD;
      same as the routine clinical practice. This study aims to explore whether ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      clinical treatment can reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in&#xD;
      moderate to highrisk patients. Before operation, informed consent was signed according to the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, and the incidence of pulmonary complications within 5 days after&#xD;
      operation (or before discharge) was recorded after operation.&#xD;
