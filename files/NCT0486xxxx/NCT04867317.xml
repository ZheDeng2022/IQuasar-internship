      The purpose of this study is to determine whether growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT)&#xD;
      is effective versus placebo in the improvement of Quality of Life in patients with adult&#xD;
      growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).&#xD;

    <measure>QoL-AGHDA (Quality of Life-Assessment of Adult Growth Hormone in Adults)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>25 question survey on quality of life; The primary objective of CSP #2018 is to determine the efficacy of rhGH, given daily for 6 months, versus placebo to improve QoL, as measured by difference in mean QoL-AGHDA score, among Veterans with a history of mTBI and AGHD (primary outcome). The primary hypothesis is that, compared to placebo, patients treated with rhGH will exhibit a 3.5-point lower mean score (higher quality of life) in QoL-AGHDA at 6 months. QoL-AGHDA: minimum score=0 (high QoL: best outcome); maximum score=25 (low QoL: worst outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Composition</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>DEXA (Dual-Energy x-ray absorptiometry); The secondary objective of CSP #2018 is to investigate the efficacy of rhGH vs placebo on long-term surrogate outcomes: a) body composition, assessed through dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and b) cardiometabolic risk factors including lipids, autonomic function, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein. The specific hypotheses for these outcomes are that compared to placebo there will be a 4.5% mean reduction in total truncal body fat percentage and a mean reduction of 10 mg/dL in LDL serum levels after 6 months of treatment and follow-up of rhGH.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms measured by Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tertiary endpoint of interest: Depressive and anxiety symptoms measured by DESS-21 scores and post-traumatic stress symptoms measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 are expected to be lower (improved) within the rhGH arm after 6 months of therapy compared to the placebo arm.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tertiary endpoint of interest: Cognition will be measured by the NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition Composite Score (NIHTB-FCCS), which is comprised on tests that measure executive function, inhibition, processing speed, and episodic memory. It is expected that this composite score will be higher (improve) within the rhGH arm after 6 months of therapy compared to the placebo arm.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of Fatigue Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tertiary endpoint of interest: Severity of fatigue symptoms measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 15-item somatic symptom severity scale PHQ-15 are expected to improve after 6 months of rhGH therapy compared to the placebo arm.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory objective and hypothesis: Sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score (PSQI). We hypothesize that subjective measures of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness will significantly improve in the active arm compared to placebo.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Pain Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory objective and hypothesis: Chronic pain assessed using the Defense Veterans Pain Report System-II (DVPRS-II); hypothesize that pain severity and pain interference with activities of daily living will be significantly reduced among participants receiving GHRT compared to placebo.</description>

    <description>Participants (n=172) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to rhGH (n=86) versus placebo (n=86) for six months, stratified by participating site. Both study participants and the study team will be blinded to treatment assignment. All participants will complete in-clinic follow-ups at Days 14, 40, 65, and 90 (3 months) and at day 180 (6 months). The primary outcome will be the mean difference in QoL-AGHDA scores between treatment arms at 6 months follow-up. Patients will discontinue the study intervention at 6 months, and will be followed-up two weeks subsequent, in order to assure patient safety and wellness, and to ensure maximal facilitation of patient transition back into routine care.</description>
