      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of a new isolation device to&#xD;
      contain aerosol during aerosol-generating procedures in the operating room.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections may require procedures that generate infectious aerosols&#xD;
      (suspension of tiny particles or droplets in the air). Aerosols are believed to be the&#xD;
      primary method of spread of SARS-CoV-2, as well as many other communicable diseases. In the&#xD;
      health care setting, the providers who are in close proximity to patients during these&#xD;
      aerosol-generating procedures (ie. Intubation (tube in your throat to help you breathe),&#xD;
      noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (breathing support administered through a face or&#xD;
      nasal mask) methods such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (BiPAP), bronchoscopy (thin tube through nose or mouth into the lungs), high&#xD;
      flow nasal cannula (oxygen delivery through the nose at a very high flow rate)) are at risk&#xD;
      for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. The current standard of care to prevent the spread of&#xD;
      virus to health care workers involves the use of N-95 respirators (particulate filtering&#xD;
      facepiece respirators), which have been intermittently in short supply throughout the current&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, even when there are adequate supplies of N-95 respirators,&#xD;
      health care workers have been reusing the respirators multiple times, which may result in&#xD;
      decreased efficacy and potential viral exposure. In order to provide enhanced protection to&#xD;
      health care workers during aerosol-generating procedures, the study investigators have&#xD;
      created a device, named SLACC (Suction-assisted Local Aerosol Containment Chamber). SLACC has&#xD;
      the ability to isolate the atmosphere around the patient's upper airway (nose, mouth, throat)&#xD;
      via negative pressure in a manner analogous to isolation rooms used to house patients with&#xD;
      communicable diseases spread by aerosol (e.g. tuberculosis). Furthermore, SLACC is&#xD;
      inexpensive, portable, and relatively simple to manufacture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SLACC uses an external suction source to maintain a negative pressure micro-atmosphere&#xD;
      around a patient's head (the source of infectious aerosols). The components of SLACC include&#xD;
      a clear polymer frame, a flexible drape, and integrated sealed arm sleeves to protect the&#xD;
      hands and forearms of the health care provider. The structure is flexible during use,&#xD;
      transparent, can be rapidly assembled, and easily collapsible for removal and transport. It&#xD;
      is assembled using adhesive-backed polymer sections, allowing the structure to fold from a&#xD;
      flat shipping/storage conformation into a free-standing structure. Once deployed with the&#xD;
      patient's head inside the chamber, the drape is secured across the open side of the chamber&#xD;
      with adhesive and covers the patient's torso. Many other containment devices have been&#xD;
      proposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, but none have been demonstrated to contain aerosols&#xD;
      effectively. With external suction applied, the investigators believe SLACC vastly improves&#xD;
      upon the aerosol containment ability of other devices. The investigators have tested SLACC in&#xD;
      a simulated setting and recently published the results in a high-quality, peer-reviewed&#xD;
      journal (PMID: 32541251).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test the safety and efficacy of SLACC in containing&#xD;
      contamination during aerosol-generating procedures in the operating room through a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The investigators have identified a method of objectively quantifying&#xD;
      health care worker exposure to respiratory particles and plan to compare exposure to the&#xD;
      number and size of respiratory particles when SLACC is used compared to the current standard&#xD;
      of care (no device used).&#xD;
