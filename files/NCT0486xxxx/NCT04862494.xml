  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A diaphragmatic eventration is an abnormal and permanent elevation of a portion or an entire&#xD;
      intact hemidiaphragm. This rare pathology, found in 0.2 - 1 for every 1000 patients in large&#xD;
      radiological series, is either congenital or acquired due to phrenic nerve palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most diaphragmatic eventrations are asymptomatic and discovered thanks to chest x-rays, where&#xD;
      the diaphragmatic dome is elevated and visualized above the 4th intercostal space and&#xD;
      sometimes up to the clavicle. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging confirms the&#xD;
      eventration by visualizing the diaphragmatic muscle distended and intact, unlike a&#xD;
      diaphragmatic rupture or hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical indications are usually due to respiratory disorders or visceral repercussions, such&#xD;
      as gastric emptying disorders or acute accidents like gastric volvulus. Surgical treatment is&#xD;
      a phrenic plication, which can be performed via a lateral thoracotomy (classical approach),&#xD;
      thoracoscopy or laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When surgery is not indicated, follow up consists of regular clinical and radiological&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is, however, no consensus when it comes to their medical and surgical management due to&#xD;
      the very low number of patients per center and per year, and the fact that very few studies&#xD;
      specifically address this subject in the literature.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective multicenter descriptive cohort study based on French national&#xD;
      healthcare data. The aim of this study is to describe the current trends in management of&#xD;
      diaphragmatic eventrations in France in order to indentify potential risk factors for&#xD;
      complications and to improve and homogenize practices.&#xD;
