  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a multi-methods approach, including both qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative methods. In the quantitative methodology, the investigators will use a before&#xD;
      and after approach to compare medical student grades/scores before and after the integration&#xD;
      of Simulation based learning (SBL) in the curriculum. The hypothesis is that SBL will&#xD;
      generally increase knowledge and skills and hence improve the scores from the theory (MCQ)&#xD;
      and clinical (OSCE) examinations conducted outside simulated settings in the clinical&#xD;
      departments.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Simulation faculty development will be measured by retention and engagement in simulation&#xD;
      sessions. The investigators will use survival analysis methods and plot Kaplan Meier curves&#xD;
      to calculate probability of retention and determine the factors that are associated with&#xD;
      retention as derived from participant in-depth interviews and departmental meetings. A&#xD;
      faculty member will be considered disengaged if they do not participate in simulation session&#xD;
      for at least 6 months post training, despite reminders and opportunities for participation.&#xD;
      Reasons for potential disengagement will be explored qualitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the qualitative approach, the investigators will conduct in-depth key informant interviews&#xD;
      (45 minutes to 1 hour) with administrators at the institution, namely Academic Registrar,&#xD;
      Deans of Medical School, heads of Departments and Simulation facilitators (the post-graduate&#xD;
      student trainers). The investigators will conduct focus group discussions (1 hour) with&#xD;
      postgraduate simulation facilitators, the medical and nursing students before, during and&#xD;
      after their enrollment in SBL. The interviews and focus group discussions will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded and transcribed.&#xD;
