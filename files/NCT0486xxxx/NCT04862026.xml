    <textblock>
      It is planned to enroll 950 patients in an open, prospective, randomized study to assess the&#xD;
      impact of telemonitoring on the development of clinical events and improve the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients with acute coronary syndrome. The duration of the study is 365 days, of&#xD;
      which 180 days are enrollment of patients, 180 days are observation. The study of patients&#xD;
      will include the collection of anamnesis, assessment of the clinical status of patients using&#xD;
      special questionnaires, data of objective, laboratory and instrumental examinations. The&#xD;
      instrumental complex of the examination will include: electrocardiography (ECG), 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test (6MWT), Holter ECG monitoring (HMECG), echocardiography, veloergometry (VEM),&#xD;
      assessment of the actual nutrition Nutrilogic, autogeneration of an individual diet&#xD;
      (Nutrilogic), weekly telemonitoring. Laboratory examination includes: biochemical blood test.&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study are to study the effect of telemonitoring on mortality from&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD), as well as the number of readmissions for cardiovascular&#xD;
      pathology in patients with ACS. The secondary endpoints of the study include quality of life&#xD;
      as measured by the HeartQol questionnaire and adherence to ambulatory monitoring.&#xD;

      Purpose of the study: to study the effect of telemonitoring on the development of clinical&#xD;
      events and improving the quality of life of patients with ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improving the effectiveness of medical care in patients who have undergone ACS:&#xD;
           increasing the level of compliance of patients, increasing the level of medical&#xD;
           awareness of patients, reducing the number of unmotivated requests for medical care,&#xD;
           reducing the time to achieve the observed targets, reducing the proportion of&#xD;
           complications, reducing the number of destabilizing conditions with further inpatient&#xD;
           treatment, optimization of the workload on medical personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Creation of a unified methodology for remote observation using telemedicine technologies&#xD;
           in patients with ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Creation of a unified model of remote nutrition correction in patients after ACS.&#xD;

&#xD;

           agreement on the number of patients to be included in the study, each specific&#xD;
           healthcare facility will be provided with sealed envelopes in the required volume,&#xD;
           taking into account the equal distribution of volunteers into 2 groups. After opening&#xD;
