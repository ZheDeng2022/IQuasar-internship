    <textblock>
      With the rapid development of China's economy, changes in diet structure, lifestyle and&#xD;
      excessive mental pressure have led to a younger trend in the incidence of ACUTE coronary&#xD;
      syndrome, and the mortality rate has been on the rise, especially in Shenzhen, the country&#xD;
      with the youngest average age.Coronary heart disease among young people not only reduces the&#xD;
      quality of life and loses the ability to work, but also prematurely consumes medical&#xD;
      resources and increases social costs, bringing heavy burdens to families and&#xD;
      society.Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct researches on the transcription,&#xD;
      metabolism and microbiome of young patients with ACUTE coronary syndrome and obtain the&#xD;
      multi-group characteristics of these patients for early warning, guiding the improvement of&#xD;
      life style, regulating treatment, improving treatment rate, and reducing family and social&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;

      1. Research purpose and significance In recent years, with the rapid development of China's&#xD;
      economy, the changes in dietary structure and lifestyle, as well as excessive mental stress,&#xD;
      and other factors have led to an obvious trend of younger incidence of Coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD), and an increase in the death rate.This is especially true in Shenzhen, which&#xD;
      has the youngest average age in the country.CAD in young people not only reduces the quality&#xD;
      of life and loses the ability to work, but also prematurely consumes medical resources,&#xD;
      increases social costs, and brings heavy burden to families and society.Therefore, it is of&#xD;
      great significance to study the transcriptome, metabolome and intestinal flora of young CAD&#xD;
      and obtain the multiomic characteristics of these patients for early warning, guiding the&#xD;
      improvement of lifestyle, regulating treatment, improving treatment rate, and reducing the&#xD;
      burden of family and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Research status at home and abroad&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The public health burden of coronary artery disease in China With the development of&#xD;
           social economy, China's national lifestyle has undergone profound changes. Under the&#xD;
           social background of population aging and urbanization, the risk of Atherosclerotic&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is increasing day by day.The incidence of cardiovascular&#xD;
           diseases continues to increase.ASCVD is the number one cause of death in China,&#xD;
           surpassing cancer and other diseases.CAD is an important part of ASCVD. According to&#xD;
           China Cardiovascular Health and Disease Report 2019, the total number of CAD patients in&#xD;
           China is about 11 million.CAD causes extremely high mortality and disability rate,&#xD;
           causing serious public health burden and social and economic burden.The 5th Chinese&#xD;
           health service survey in 2013 showed that the prevalence rate of coronary artery disease&#xD;
           among residents ≥15 years old was 12.3‰ in urban areas, 8.1‰ in rural areas, and 10.2‰&#xD;
           in urban and rural areas.According to China's Health Statistics Yearbook 2018, the&#xD;
           mortality rate from coronary artery disease was 115.32 per 100,000 urban residents and&#xD;
           122.04/100,000 rural residents in 2017.Based on the sample database of inpatients&#xD;
           insured by China's basic medical insurance from 2010 to 2014, the annual hospitalization&#xD;
           rate of acute myocardial infarction was estimated to be 44.2/100,000.The median&#xD;
           hospitalization cost for patients with acute myocardial infarction in urban China is&#xD;
           31,000 yuan, and the median hospitalization cost for patients receiving coronary&#xD;
           intervention therapy is 52,000 yuan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is an indisputting fact that CAD causes serious social burden. How to let more CAD&#xD;
           patients find their disease as early as possible, intervene as early as possible, and&#xD;
           avoid returning to poverty, becoming disabled or even dying due to disease due to the&#xD;
           aggravation of disease is an urgent public health problem.According to the Healthy China&#xD;
           2030 Plan, the premature mortality rate from major chronic diseases is expected to drop&#xD;
           from 18.5% in 2015 to 15.9%, indicating that the management of chronic diseases is also&#xD;
           being increasingly emphasized at the national health policy-making level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epidemiological characteristics of coronary heart disease in young people With the&#xD;
           improvement of diagnosis and treatment level and people's attention to CAD, the case&#xD;
           fatality rate of CAD in the world has decreased significantly.Epidemiological data in&#xD;
           the United States showed that from 1980 to 2002, the mortality rate of male and female&#xD;
           CAD patients decreased by 52% and 49% respectively [3].Unfortunately, improvements in&#xD;
           CAD outcomes have not covered all age groups.Epidemiological data from the United States&#xD;
           [3], the United Kingdom [4], Canada [5] and Australia [6] all show that the morbidity&#xD;
           and mortality of young CAD patients younger than 45 years old are increasing year by&#xD;
           year.The research group also confirmed in the previous study that the proportion of&#xD;
           young CAD patients admitted to the Department of Cardiology of Shenzhen People's&#xD;
           Hospital increased year by year from 2015 to 2019.This shows that young CAD patients&#xD;
           have different disease development characteristics, and the theory and basis of young&#xD;
           CAD are derived from the study of the whole population, and the corresponding innovation&#xD;
           of treatment concept has not significantly improved the prognosis of young CAD&#xD;
           patients.Therefore, it is of great significance to promote the research of youth CAD,&#xD;
           reveal the pathogenesis of youth CAD, and explore the prediction, diagnostic markers and&#xD;
           therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of youth CAD and the improvement of&#xD;
           national health level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compared with the general population, young CAD patients are often associated with&#xD;
           multiple risk factors.According to statistics, more than half of the young people aged&#xD;
           18-24 have at least one CAD risk factor [9, 10], and nearly 1/4 of the young people have&#xD;
           atherosclerotic plaques. The size and range of atherosclerotic plaques are directly&#xD;
           positively correlated with the number of risk factors.Poor diet, overweight,&#xD;
           hyperlipidemia, physical inactivity, and smoking are the major risk factors for young&#xD;
           adults, and the number of risk factors is closely related to long-term&#xD;
           outcomes.Ignorance of relevant risk factors in young people further increases the risk&#xD;
           of CAD, and once coronary atherosclerotic plaque forms, the condition continues to&#xD;
           progress to coronary artery disease, which will seriously affect the quality of life and&#xD;
           life expectancy of young patients [11-13].However, at present, there are very few&#xD;
           researches on the mechanism behind the special epidemiological phenomenon of CAD in&#xD;
           young people [7, 8], and corresponding researches are urgently needed to explain the&#xD;
           pathogenesis of this unique CAD population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dynamic pathological changes of coronary artery disease CAD is a chronically&#xD;
           progressive, dynamically changing pathological process that can be in a long-term stable&#xD;
           state or become unstable at any time. Plaque rupture or erosion can cause acute&#xD;
           thrombotic events.According to clinical manifestations, CAD can be divided into Acute&#xD;
           coronary syndrome (ACS) and Chronic coronary syndrome (CCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ACS is a group of clinical syndromes characterized by acute myocardial ischemia,&#xD;
           including ① unstable angina pectoris (UA);② Acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
           infarction (NSTEMI);③ Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).The main&#xD;
           mechanism is the rupture or erosion of coronary atherosclerotic plaque combined with&#xD;
           thrombosis and/or vasospasm, which causes the sharp aggravation of coronary artery&#xD;
           stenosis or acute occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CCS covers the different developmental stages of CHD in addition to the clinical&#xD;
           manifestations dominated by acute coronary thrombosis, including asymptomatic myocardial&#xD;
           ischemia, vasospasm, and microcirculatory lesions.The six most common CCS clinical&#xD;
           conditions include: (1) patients with suspected coronary heart disease and &quot;stable&quot;&#xD;
           angina pectoris, with or without dyspnea;② patients with newly emerged heart failure or&#xD;
           left ventricular dysfunction, suspected of CAD;③ Patients with asymptomatic or stable&#xD;
           symptoms within 1 year after ACS, or patients with recent revascularization;(4) Patients&#xD;
           with or without symptoms at least 1 year after initial diagnosis or revascularization;⑤&#xD;
           patients with angina pectoris, suspected vasospasm or microcirculation diseases;(6)&#xD;
           Asymptomatic patients with coronary heart disease were found during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The dynamic pathological process of CAD has become the focus of current research, and&#xD;
           every link in the pathophysiological process may become a potential new target for&#xD;
           prevention and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research status of transcription, metabolism and intestinal flora of coronary artery&#xD;
           disease Recent studies have shown that CAD is associated with changes in intestinal&#xD;
           microbiota in different populations, and metabolites of intestinal microbiota are&#xD;
           considered to be major markers of heart damage.Koren et al. found that the&#xD;
           atherosclerotic plaques contained DNA sequences of bacteria such as Staphylococcus&#xD;
           aureus, Veroncoccus and Streptococcus, which could also be observed in the plaques of&#xD;
           the intestinal vessels of the same individual.Liu et al. conducted multi-omics analysis&#xD;
           on 161 CAD patients and 40 healthy controls, and found that the composition of&#xD;
           intestinal flora and metabolites significantly changed with the severity of CAD.These&#xD;
           studies suggest that intestinal flora can influence the dynamic pathological process of&#xD;
           CAD by regulating the metabolic pathways of the host.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Some special non-coding RNA molecules, such as circRNAs (Circularrnas) and Long&#xD;
           non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were abnormally expressed during the development of CAD and&#xD;
           had certain regulatory functions.As a biomarker and therapeutic target, it plays an&#xD;
           important role in the diagnosis and treatment of CAD.At the same time, previous&#xD;
           transcriptome analysis of a variety of atherosclerotic cells, animal and human vascular&#xD;
           tissues revealed that a large number of genes were expressed abnormally during the&#xD;
           pathological process of CAD [1-7], suggesting that these genes may be involved in the&#xD;
           pathological process of CAD, but whether these genes are susceptible genes for young CAD&#xD;
           remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Our project ideas CAD in young people imposes a heavy burden on families and&#xD;
           society.Young CAD has its own characteristics of the disease, and the elderly patients&#xD;
           are different, smoking, drinking, staying up late and other bad lifestyle, as well as&#xD;
           unreasonable diet, work pressure is more common in young CAD patients.Previous omics&#xD;
           studies on CAD were conducted in the whole population and could not accurately reveal&#xD;
           the pathogenesis of the young population.Therefore, only by studying the transcriptome,&#xD;
           intestinal flora and metabolism of young CAD, revealing its pathogenesis and exploring&#xD;
           new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, can we fundamentally solve the problems of young&#xD;
           CAD and provide effective strategies for clinical prevention and treatment of young CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This topic proposed line selected 18 to 45 years old coronary interventional diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of 200 patients, according to the results of coronary angiography and clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of divided into young patients with normal coronary group (40 cases), the&#xD;
      young patients with chronic coronary syndrome group (80 cases) and youth group (80 cases),&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome patients to metabolism of the full spectrum of blood group and the&#xD;
      whole transcriptome sequencing,And intestinal microflora metagenome and full spectrum&#xD;
      metabolome sequencing of feces.&#xD;
