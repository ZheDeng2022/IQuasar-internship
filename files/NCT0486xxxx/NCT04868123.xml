  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to explore the effects of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) and&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation in persons living with HIV (PLHIV) and painful neuropathy in the feet.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to conduct an interventional pilot trial of mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation and transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) to mitigate the symptoms and improved&#xD;
      function in persons living with HIV (PLHIV) and painful neuropathy in the feet. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to determine the feasibility and effects of (1) mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      or (2) transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) on clinical and functional outcomes in&#xD;
      participants with HIV-associated painful distal sensory polyneuropathy in the feet. This aim&#xD;
      will be achieved with a randomized control pilot trial with 3 groups: TENS group, Mindfulness&#xD;
      Mediation Group, and Usual Treatment (Control) group. The interventions will be performed at&#xD;
      home over a period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
