      Based on the development of new tools, including drug coated balloon, paclitaxel eluting&#xD;
      stent, interwoven stents, debulking tools, More and more acute or subacute thromboembolic&#xD;
      occlusions of lower extremity included stage IIb were treated with endovascular procedures.&#xD;
      Most guidelines suggests only stage I and stage IIa lesions are suitable for endovascular&#xD;
      treatments. Therefore, a well-designed real-world study that track the safety and clinical&#xD;
      relevant outcomes, are required to determine the optimal therapies for patients with acute or&#xD;
      subacute thromboembolic occlusions of lower extremity.&#xD;

      According to the Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II guidelines, acute arterial&#xD;
      occlusion which in stage IIb was recommended for thrombectomy. However, with the development&#xD;
      of new tools, including drug coated balloon, paclitaxel eluting stent, interwoven stents,&#xD;
      debulking tools, stage IIb patients and some subacute thromboembolic lesions were also&#xD;
      effective in some retrospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite The shift of Endovascular-first strategy has been documented in recent literature.&#xD;
      There still lack evidence to support either approach have a significant advantage over the&#xD;
      thrombectomy. And stage IIb lesions and subacute lesions are often excluded in prospective&#xD;
      clinical trials. Therefore, a well-designed real-world study that track the safety and&#xD;
      clinical relevant outcomes, are required to determine the optimal therapies for patients with&#xD;
      acute or subacute thromboembolic occlusions of lower extremity.&#xD;

Surgeons can choose treatment methods such as PMT pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) for thrombus removal according to the characteristics of the lesions and hospital conditions.</description>
