      Background: Cognitive impairment and difficulties are frequently observed in individuals&#xD;
      suffering from major depressive disorder. These impairments and difficulties can persist into&#xD;
      remission as residual cognitive symptoms. Consequently affecting daily life functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life for those affected. Few scalable interventions have targeted these symptoms&#xD;
      and measured long-term clinical effects such as depression relapse.&#xD;

      Background:Cognitive impairment and difficulties are frequently observed in individuals&#xD;
      suffering from major depressive disorder. These impairments and difficulties can persist into&#xD;
      remission as residual cognitive symptoms. Consequently affecting daily life functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life for those affected. Few scalable interventions have targeted these symptoms&#xD;
      and measured long-term clinical effects such as depression relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim is to assess the clinical effects of an intervention targeting residual&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms after major depressive disorder. More specifically, if residual cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms would be significantly decreased from pre- to post-treatment and remain stable at&#xD;
      the 6-month and 2 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: the study is a randomized, waitlist controlled trial including a total of 60&#xD;
      participants (30 in each arm). Primary measures are residual cognitive symptoms measured by&#xD;
      the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functions Adults (BRIEF-A) and Perceived Deficit&#xD;
      Questionnaire 5 (PDQ-5). Secondary outcome measures are Depression measured by Montgomery&#xD;
      Aasberg Depression Rating Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and 2 (PHQ-9 and PHQ2),&#xD;
      Satisfaction with life measured by Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), Credibility measured&#xD;
      by the Treatment Credibility and Expectation Scale, Rumination measured by the Rumination&#xD;
      Response Scale (RRS), Depression screening assessed using the MINI International Psychiatric&#xD;
      Interview, Usage data measured by number of log-ins, session length and days in treatment.&#xD;
      Quantitative statistical methods will be used to analyze data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The results from the study will contribute to field of internet interventions and&#xD;
      provide former depressed adults with an easy access intervention in the treatment of residual&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A; Roth, Isquith, &amp; Gioia, 2005) is a 75-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure adults' behaviors associated with executive problems.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Deficit Questionnaire 5</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Brief assessment of subjective cognitive difficulties and covers problems with concentration (e.g. &quot;trouble concentrating on things like watching a television program or reading a book?&quot;), memory (e.g. &quot;forget what you talked about after a telephone conversation?&quot;), and executive functioning (e.g. &quot;have trouble getting things organized?&quot;). Every item is rated on a scale of 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost always) to yield a sum score of 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater severity of cognitive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Rumination Response Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Rumination Response Scale (RRS; Treynor, Gonzalez, &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2003) is a questionnaire frequently used to assess rumination in depression. The 22-item RRS measures the current degree of ruminative responses to depressed mood.</description>

    <measure>Montgomery Aasberg Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale Self-report (MADRS-S; Svanborg &amp; Åsberg, 2001) is a self-report questionnaire measuring depressive symptoms during the past three days. The MADRS-S consists of 9 items where the following symptoms are rated on a seven-point scale ranging from 0 to 6.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionaire 9 and 2</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9: Kroenke et al., 2001) is a self-report tool used to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. Reliability and validity of the tool have indicated it has sound psychometric properties. Internal consistency of the PHQ-9 has been shown to be high.</description>

    <measure>The Satisfaction With Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SWLS (Kobau et al., 2010) is a short 5-item instrument designed to measure global cognitive judgments of satisfaction with one's life. The scale usually requires only about one minute of a respondent's time.</description>
