  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extremely premature children benefit from specific follow-up that requires high nutritional&#xD;
      intake and the use of specific therapies that expose them to the risk of nephrocalcinosis.&#xD;
      Other identified risk factors are extreme prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of nephrocalcinosis in very premature infants is unclear, ranging from 7 to&#xD;
      64%. Most studies are observational and only few case-control studies can properly analyse&#xD;
      the risk factors for nephrocalcinosis in significant populations that include only preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This nephrocalcinosis of prematurity regresses spontaneously in more than half of the cases,&#xD;
      but has been associated with a risk of long-term complications: impaired renal function, high&#xD;
      blood pressure, etc. This is an aggravating factor in the context of prematurity, which has&#xD;
      been associated with an increased risk of renal impairment and hypertension in childhood and&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons, nutritional intakes and therapeutics are monitored very closely and a&#xD;
      renal ultrasound is routinely performed at discharge at 35 weeks of corrected gestational age&#xD;
      in all children who are born at a gestational age ≤ 32 weeks and/or birth weight ≤ 1500 g.&#xD;
