      Clinical oral implant related research is facing many interesting challenges. One of them is&#xD;
      to create and maintain stable soft and hard tissues around osseointegrated oral implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was suggested in a classic study that a minimum of 2 mm of keratinized mucosa (KM) around&#xD;
      natural teeth is necessary to maintain gingival health. The lack of a sufficient wide zone of&#xD;
      KM has been investigated as a potential contributing factor for peri- implant disease and&#xD;
      therefore might influence the long- term success of oral implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have found a negative influence of the absence of KM on plaque accumulation.&#xD;
      Oral implants with a narrow zone of KM (&lt;2 mm) frequently exhibit significantly higher plaque&#xD;
      scores than those with wider zones of KM. Even a subdivision can be made between KM and&#xD;
      attached KM (AKM). A statistically significant higher plaque accumulation and gingival&#xD;
      inflammation around implants in the groups with KM &lt;2 mm and AKM &lt;1 mm was observed. However,&#xD;
      this could not be confirmed in another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the presence of an adequate band of KM adjacent to the implant seems to reduce&#xD;
      inflammation, hyperplasia and recession of the marginal peri- implant soft tissues.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it might facilitate restorative procedures, improve aesthetics and enable the&#xD;
      patient to maintain an adequate oral hygiene without irritation or discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, in the lower jaw, a scarce amount of KM can be regularly encountered. A&#xD;
      reduced height of the alveolar process, due to crestal bone resorption, result in loss of KM&#xD;
      due to the reduced distance between the bone crest and &quot;genetically defined&quot; position of the&#xD;
      mucogingival line. Notably, in the posterior segments of the lower jaw, a narrow KM might be&#xD;
      related to muscle pull, high frenulum attachments and a shallow vestibule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, the golden standard to augment KM is a free gingival graft (FGG) harvested from the&#xD;
      palate. The main problem with this technique is the morbidity for the patient as it involves&#xD;
      a second surgical site. Reported problems following FGG procedure are pain, change in diet,&#xD;
      paresthesia, herpetic lesion, mucocele, arteriovenous shunt and excessive bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome this problem, different authors have proposed alternative techniques and&#xD;
      materials to augment keratinized tissue around teeth and oral implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have substantiated the viability of platelet concentrates on enhancement of&#xD;
      osseous and associated tissue healing and PRF is one of the recent innovations of various&#xD;
      platelet concentrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet- rich fibrin (PRF) is a 2nd generation platelet concentrate, which was introduced by&#xD;
      Choukroun et al in 2001. It is obtained by a simple and inexpensive procedure that does not&#xD;
      require biochemical blood handling. Its 3- dimensional fibrin network promotes&#xD;
      neovascularization, accelerates wound closing and fast cicatricle tissue remodeling. Platelet&#xD;
      concentrates are considered a source of autologous growth factors that promote cell migration&#xD;
      and proliferation. Given that PRF is produced without using any additive, the fibrin&#xD;
      polymerization occurs in a physiological way, resulting in a similar fibrin network as the&#xD;
      one formed during natural healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies show a constant release of growth factors such as PDGF (platelet-derived growth&#xD;
      factor) or TGF-b (transforming growth factor) for at least 1 week up to 28 days and proved&#xD;
      its accelerating effect on the healing process.&#xD;
