  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender men (trans men; assigned female sex at birth but identify as male) are generally&#xD;
      thought to be at low risk of HIV acquisition, perhaps because of the assumption that they&#xD;
      have sex with cis-gender women. Emerging data from resource-rich settings show that trans men&#xD;
      often face many of the same high risks as transgender women (trans women; assigned male sex&#xD;
      at birth but identify as female). Trans men report similar rates to trans women of engagement&#xD;
      in sex work and engage in unprotected receptive vaginal and/or anal sex with cis-gender men.&#xD;
      Additionally, they report high sexual risk-taking behaviors including inconsistent condom use&#xD;
      which puts them at risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Little is&#xD;
      known about HIV risk in trans men globally, and no published data are available from&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa. We will recruit a cohort of 50 trans men through respondent driven&#xD;
      sampling. We will use mixed methods to gain a deeper understanding of the sexual health&#xD;
      experiences and risk behaviors of trans men in Uganda. Guided by the Social Ecological Model,&#xD;
      we will conduct in-depth interviews with up to 20 trans men to understand individual,&#xD;
      interpersonal, community and social contextual factors that influence sexual risk behaviors&#xD;
      and HIV/STI risk (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will characterize HIV and STI prevalence and risk&#xD;
      among trans men by conducting a behavioral HIV risk assessment including sexual practices,&#xD;
      alcohol and drug use, partner violence, gender dysphoria, male hormone use and willingness to&#xD;
      take PrEP. In Aim 3, we will evaluate PrEP uptake and persistence among HIV-negative trans&#xD;
      men with HIV risk. Participants will be offered PrEP and followed monthly for 12 months. At&#xD;
      quarterly visits, participants will receive integrated next steps adherence counseling and&#xD;
      drug level feedback using a point-of-care urine tenofovir lateral-flow immunoassay. Free&#xD;
      testing and treatment of common curable STIs (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis&#xD;
      and Trichomonas vaginalis) will be provided. Primary outcomes are: 1) PrEP persistence at 6&#xD;
      and 12 months as measured by tenofovir levels in dried blood spots collected quarterly, and&#xD;
      2) STI incidence. Assessment of PrEP use by trans men will help increase the utilization of&#xD;
      HIV services, including HIV and STI testing and PrEP, with a goal of decreasing HIV&#xD;
      acquisition.&#xD;

      Transgender men (trans men; assigned female sex at birth but identify as male) are generally&#xD;
      thought to be at low risk of HIV acquisition, perhaps because of the assumption that they&#xD;
      have sex with cis-gender women. Emerging data from resource-rich settings show that trans men&#xD;
      often face many of the same high risks as transgender women (trans women; assigned male sex&#xD;
      at birth but identify as female). Trans men report similar rates to trans women of engagement&#xD;
      in sex work and engage in unprotected receptive vaginal and/or anal sex with cis-gender men.&#xD;
      Additionally, they report high sexual risk-taking behaviors including inconsistent condom use&#xD;
      which puts them at risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Little is&#xD;
      known about HIV risk in trans men globally, and no published data are available from&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa. In partnership with the trans community, we are testing the effectiveness&#xD;
      of peer-delivered HIV self-testing, STI self-sampling and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)&#xD;
      (Peer Study), same-day PrEP initiation and sexual health for trans women in Uganda (Tandika&#xD;
      PrEP Study) and conducting a pilot evaluation of HIV and STI risk in trans men (HASTE study).&#xD;
      This study is designed to leverage the community linkages, collaborative partnerships with&#xD;
      transgender organizations, peer networks, scientific expertise and research infrastructure of&#xD;
      these ongoing studies with trans women and men and proposes a concurrent mixed methods study&#xD;
      (1) to explore HIV and STI risk characteristics, and PrEP adherence among trans men. Thus,&#xD;
      the work extends our unique research experience in the transgender population in Uganda and&#xD;
      this study will be the first, to our knowledge, to characterize HIV and STI risk and PrEP&#xD;
      adherence among trans men in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: In Aim 1, we will characterize HIV and STI prevalence and risk in a new cohort of&#xD;
      trans men. In Aim 2, we will evaluate PrEP uptake and persistence among HIV-negative trans&#xD;
      men followed for 12 months. In Aim 3, we will explore the sexual health experiences and risk&#xD;
      behaviours of trans men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Characterize HIV and STI prevalence and risk among trans men. We will recruit a novel&#xD;
      cohort of up to 50 trans men through the respondent driven sampling (RDS) approaches used in&#xD;
      the above-noted studies. We will conduct a behavioral HIV risk assessment including questions&#xD;
      about gender identity, HIV and STI testing, and willingness to take PrEP.&#xD;
      Interviewer-administered questionnaires will collect data on demographic characteristics, HIV&#xD;
      and STI testing behaviors, perception of risk, alcohol and drug use, sexual practices,&#xD;
      partner violence, gender dysphoria and male hormone use. Primary outcomes will be: 1) HIV&#xD;
      prevalence as measured by the proportion testing HIV positive, 2) STI prevalence as measured&#xD;
      by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis test positivity and&#xD;
      3) sexual risk behaviours as measured by the proportion reporting condom-less sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate PrEP uptake and persistence among HIV-negative trans men. HIV-negative trans&#xD;
      men will be offered PrEP and followed monthly for 12 months. At quarterly visits,&#xD;
      participants will receive integrated next steps counseling (iNSC) adherence counseling and&#xD;
      drug level feedback using a point-of-care (POC) urine tenofovir lateral-flow immunoassay.&#xD;
      Free testing and treatment of common curable STIs (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia&#xD;
      trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis) will be provided. Those who screen positive for&#xD;
      depression will be actively linked to mental health services. Primary outcomes are: 1) PrEP&#xD;
      uptake as measured by pharmacy records and 2) PrEP persistence as measured by intracellular&#xD;
      tenofovir diphosphate concentrations in dried blood spots at months 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Explore sexual health experiences and risk behaviours of trans men in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use qualitative methods to gain a deeper understanding of the sexual health&#xD;
      experiences of trans men in the context of their everyday lives and communities. Guided by&#xD;
      the Social Ecological Model, we will conduct in-depth interviews with up to 20 trans men to&#xD;
      understand individual, interpersonal, community and social contextual factors that influence&#xD;
      sexual risk behaviors and HIV/STI risk. We will explore unmet HIV/STI prevention needs,&#xD;
      examine perceptions of PrEP and explore barriers and facilitators of retention in HIV care&#xD;
      (stigma, discrimination, and concerns about interactions between hormones and PrEP).&#xD;

    <description>PrEP eligible participants will be asked to follow up monthly for 12 months. PrEP will be prescribed for once-daily use and discontinued if HIV tests are positive. At quarterly visits, participants will receive Integrated Next Steps Counseling (iNSC) for PrEP adherence with point-of-care drug level feedback. Participants will receive iNSC Support Level 1 to address PrEP adherence and sexual health needs. Those with urine tenofovir levels &lt;1500 ng/mL will receive iNSC Support Level 2, in which participant responses to two 7-item questionnaires on PrEP adherence and sexual health will guide problem solving on improved dosing. Medication refills will consist of 3-month supplies.</description>
