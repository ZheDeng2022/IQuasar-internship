  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The department of radiotherapy in UZLeuven recently included Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) in the standard of care for the management of patients with spinal metastases. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to prospectively document neurological outcome, performance and quality of&#xD;
      life following surgery + SBRT for spinal metastases with imminent / actual spinal cord&#xD;
      compression, and compare outcomes with the historical cohort of the UZLeuven patients&#xD;
      included in the Global Spine Tumor Study Group database between 2011 and 2019 in whom&#xD;
      prospective neurological, performance and quality of life outcomes were collected following&#xD;
      surgery + conventional radiotherapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients that had previous radiotherapy on the index spinal level without the&#xD;
