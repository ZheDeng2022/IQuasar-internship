  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a serious, disabling and unfortunately common disease. Its prevalence is in&#xD;
      the order of 0.6 to 1% in the general population, a figure that remains relatively stable in&#xD;
      the various cultures. The overall prognosis, particularly in terms of function, remains&#xD;
      largely negative. We know that a global management can considerably slow down this&#xD;
      unfavourable evolution: according to the recommendations, the patient suffering from&#xD;
      schizophrenia requires an effective and well-tolerated pharmacotherapy, associated with an&#xD;
      adapted psychotherapy as well as cognitive remediation workshops, training in social skills,&#xD;
      and psycho-education. There are indeed a large number of studies that have shown these&#xD;
      elements in patients with schizophrenic disorders that have been present for several years.&#xD;
      We now know that early treatment is a key prognostic element. Indeed, the earlier care is&#xD;
      provided during the first psychotic episode, the better the subsequent prognosis: the&#xD;
      probability of further decompensation is reduced, as is the risk of developing deficits, such&#xD;
      as cognitive difficulties. However, there is a lack of access to all the recommended aspects&#xD;
      of management in the initial phase of the disorder, particularly concerning early&#xD;
      psycho-educational programmes for patients, which have been relatively little studied in&#xD;
      clinical research. In this context, it seems relevant to study the impact of a new programme&#xD;
      of this type on a fundamental parameter, conditioning the subsequent access to care: the&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance. &quot;PPIC&quot; is a short psycho-educational programme in 4 sessions,&#xD;
      specifically designed to accompany young patients, and focused on the issues of this crucial&#xD;
      period of the care process.&#xD;

    <description>4 individual sessions (S1, S2, S3, S4) of one hour each spread over 2 weeks, i.e. 2 sessions per week. S1 explains the different clinical signs and discusses the prognosis of the disease, S2 deals with the question of drug treatments, their different forms and their mechanisms of action. S3 discusses the evolution of the disease and the organisation of the care pathway. Finally, S4 looks at the aspects of quality of life, lifestyle and the fight against addictive co-morbidities, and concludes with a review of the patient's motivation and involvement in the subjects covered.</description>
