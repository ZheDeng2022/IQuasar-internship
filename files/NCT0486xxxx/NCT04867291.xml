  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the influence of the food matrix of seaweed-containing food products on&#xD;
      iodine bioavailability. The investigation will ascertain whether iodine bioavailability (as a&#xD;
      percentage of the dose ingested that is excreted in urine) is comparable between seaweed&#xD;
      sheets, seaweed powder (in capsules), pizza fortified with powdered seaweed, and potassium&#xD;
      iodide supplements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iodine deficiency can have serious consequences, especially during pregnancy and lactation&#xD;
      where the fetus is entirely dependent on its mother for the provision of iodine. There is no&#xD;
      current iodine fortification programme in the United Kingdom, and the main sources of iodine&#xD;
      are from dietary sources, such as dairy products and seafood. However, seaweed is also a rich&#xD;
      source of iodine; the inclusion of iodine (via powdered seaweed) in commonly consumed foods&#xD;
      is of potential benefit as a strategy, as it removes the need for consumers to alter their&#xD;
      dietary behaviours, which are often culturally standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seaweed intake (via supplements) can increase the iodine status of women with habitually&#xD;
      low-iodine diets. However, reduced bioavailability of iodine from the seaweed matrix has also&#xD;
      been displayed, which could impact iodine intake should individuals choose to use seaweed as&#xD;
      a dietary source of iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study tests the influence of the food matrix of seaweed-containing products on iodine&#xD;
      bioavailability. This will be evaluated over the course of 27 days, in a randomized crossover&#xD;
      trial design with 4 arms. Each arm will be separated by 7 washout days, and participants will&#xD;
      follow a low iodine diet (avoiding all seafood, seaweed products, eggs, dairy, fortified&#xD;
      plant milk and goitrogens (cabbage, soy etc.) for the 2 days preceding and the 1 day&#xD;
      following each feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Food arm: portion equivalent to 200µg of iodine, half a pizza (Eat Balanced pizza)&#xD;
           (consumed with ~450mL of water)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Seaweed sheet arm: portion equivalent to 200µg of iodine, ~10g of seaweed sheets&#xD;
           (consumed alongside 2 slices of white bread and ~450mL of water)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Seaweed powder arm: portion equivalent to 200µg of iodine, 1 capsule (consumed alongside&#xD;
           2 slices of white bread and ~450mL of water).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Potassium iodide supplement arm: portion equivalent to 200µg of iodine with ~450mL of&#xD;
           water (Piping Rock Potassium Iodide Supplement, consumed alongside 2 slices of white&#xD;
           bread)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iodine excretion will be monitored in urine collected during the 12 hours preceding and 36&#xD;
      hours following the meal. Urine will be collected in 8 timed fractions (0-1h, 1-2h, 2-3h,&#xD;
      3-5h, 5-8h, 8-12h, 12-24h, 24-36h) and participants will be provided with containers and&#xD;
      instructions on how to collect their urine. A single fecal sample will also be collected&#xD;
      before the first feed, and within 24 hours of all feeds. Participants will also keep a&#xD;
      detailed food diary on all study days to enable iodine ingestion monitoring.&#xD;
