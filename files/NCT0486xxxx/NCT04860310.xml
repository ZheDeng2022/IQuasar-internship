      Detailed Description:In the process of women's menstrual cycle, there are different&#xD;
      physiology at different time points in a cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change, investigators select women with a menstrual cycle of 28 days and take samples every 3&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 4, Day 7, Day 10, Day 13, Day 16, Day 19, Day 22, Day 25, Day 28 days, a total of 10 time&#xD;
      points, 20 healthy women were selected, and the transcription, Protein and phosphorylation&#xD;
      proteomics, systematically integrated analysis; at the same time, 20 subjects were classified&#xD;
      by age group Divide into 4 groups, 21-year-old group, 28-year-old group, 35-year-old group,&#xD;
      and 42-year-old group. At the same time, investigators then analyze the differences in the&#xD;
      receptivity of the endometrium of different ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design groups are: 21-year-old group, 28-year-old group, 35-year-old group,&#xD;
      42-year-old group, Each group includes D1 group Vs D4 group Vs D7 group Vs D10 group Vs D13&#xD;
      group Vs D16 group Vs D19 group Vs D22 group Vs D25 group Vs D28 group; in phosphorylation&#xD;
      modification omics, different time points are compared with each other, Look for transcripts,&#xD;
      proteins and phosphorylated proteins that change significantly during the cycle of change.&#xD;
      Analyze phosphorylation modification An important role for changing proteins and an important&#xD;
      role for cycle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment quantified the proteome and protein acylation modification through TMT (Tandem&#xD;
      Mass Tag), and passed GO, KEGG Pathway, Localization, Functional enrichment analysis, Cluster&#xD;
      analysis Bioinformatics analysis&#xD;

    <description>Subjects need to collect 5ml whole blood (EDTA or heparin anticoagulant) once in the morning on an empty stomach. Endometrial tissue samples were taken during a complete 28-day menstrual cycle, a total of 6 times, and blood was taken to measure the level of gonadal hormones before each sampling.</description>
