    <textblock>
      This investigation is a randomized, controlled, open-label, comparative, cross-over,&#xD;
      multicenter investiga-tion, with two test periods. In total, 82 subjects will be included and&#xD;
      randomized, and each subject will have three test visits overseen by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, or designee. Each subject will be enrolled for 2 × 35 -1/+3 days in total for&#xD;
      the entire investigation, thus approximately 70 days. The subjects will test the non-CE&#xD;
      marked test product and the comparator product in randomized order.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with intestinal stomas have, despite development of better stoma products, problems&#xD;
      with leakage induced peristomal skin complications which influence quality of life negatively&#xD;
      , . In fact, the primary cause of peristomal skin complication development is due to leakage&#xD;
      of ostomy effluents under the adhesive bar-rier , . Some of the common clinical signs of&#xD;
      peristomal skin complications include pain, itching, burning, discoloration, bleeding, and&#xD;
      wounds . To overcome this, Coloplast A/S has developed a new baseplate which is comprised of&#xD;
      a protective layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is a randomised, controlled, open-label, comparative, cross-over,&#xD;
      multicentre investigation, with two test periods. In total 82 subjects will be included and&#xD;
      randomised, and each subject will have at least three test visits overseen by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, or designee. Each subject will be enrolled for 2 × 35 -1/+3 days; thus&#xD;
      approximately 70 days. The subjects will test the non-CE marked investigational product and&#xD;
      the comparator product in a randomised order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the test periods, the subjects are invited for a screening visit (V0). Subjects will&#xD;
      be consented prior to any study procedures. Once consented, during their participation, the&#xD;
      subjects will complete three study visits (V1, V2 and V3). The visits can be at the Principal&#xD;
      Investigators clinic or in the subject's home. In rare cases (i.e. global pandemic), visits&#xD;
      can be done remotely via video conference. In addition, the Principal Investigator, or&#xD;
      designee, will call the subjects four times during the course of the investigation to inquire&#xD;
      if the subject has had any issues or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the test visits the subject will complete a quality of life questionnaire and&#xD;
      discuss/record any adverse events or device deficiencies. The subject will also be asked&#xD;
      about the use and handling of the product, and their preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every baseplate change the subjects will be asked to take photos of their stoma/peristomal&#xD;
      skin and the backside (adhesive side) of the used product. The photos will be taken with a&#xD;
      smartphone using the Coloplast Clinical Trial App. The subject will also be asked to complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire about their peristomal skin condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coloplast will provide both the investigational product and the comparator product for all&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject experiences a problem with the investigational product during the investigation,&#xD;
      he/she should contact the investigator for advice. Subjects that cannot complete a test&#xD;
      period with the test product may choose to use their own product (i.e., SenSura® Mio) for the&#xD;
      remainder of the test period. However, this must be documented by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the test periods (35 -1/+3 days) and number of visits should be adequate to&#xD;
      assess data on the skin condition of the subjects. The investigational products are tested&#xD;
      for 35 -1/+3 days in each study period to ensure that the skin will have time to adjust to&#xD;
      new conditions, reach a steady state, and for the sub-jects to test the product for an&#xD;
      adequate number of days to give a thorough evaluation of the products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To account for a possible carry-over effect, the steady state period of the treatment period&#xD;
      begins after two weeks of product use. It is anticipated that the skin will have adapted to&#xD;
      the new product after two weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the performance and safety of an ostomy baseplate with a novel skin protection technology and its ability to reduce peristomal skin complications compared to SenSura® Mio. The subject will be randomized to either test product or comparator at enrollment. The subject will wear the test product for approximately 35 days and then cross-over to the comparator (or vice-versa) for approximately 35 days. At each baseplate change, the subject will answer questions about their skin, and take pictures of their stoma and used baseplate. They will also answer quality of life questionnaires at each study visit.</description>
