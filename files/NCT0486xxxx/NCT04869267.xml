  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that has transformed from a single cancer disease into one&#xD;
      of the most striking global health problems. Lung cancer has an insidious onset, and most&#xD;
      patients are first diagnosed with the middle and advanced stage. Cancer related fatigue is&#xD;
      the most common and distressing symptom reported by lung cancer patients. For cancer&#xD;
      patients, fatigue has lasting impact on physical, psychological and social functions,&#xD;
      interferes with activities and participating in life events, thereby worsening the&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is the third-wave&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy to improve functioning and health-related quality of life by&#xD;
      increasing psychological flexibility. The study aims to examine the effectiveness of ACT on&#xD;
      fatigue interference and health-related quality of life in patients with advanced lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two-arm, assessor-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of ACT on advanced lung cancer patients compared to usual care. Participants in the&#xD;
      same ward will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group or control group. Block&#xD;
      randomization will be conducted by an independent research assistant using randomly varying&#xD;
      block size of 4, 6 to avoid selection bias. The study aims to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      ACT on fatigue interference and health-related quality of life in patients with advanced lung&#xD;
      cancer. The Specific objectives are: 1) To investigate the effects of ACT on primary&#xD;
      outcomes: fatigue interference and health-related quality of life compared to control group&#xD;
      at post-intervention and three months follow-up. 2) To investigate the effects of ACT on the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes: cancer-related fatigue, depressive symptoms, anxiety, distress and&#xD;
      exercise capacity and process outcomes including psychological flexibility, ACT related&#xD;
      variables (acceptance and cognitive defusion) at post-intervention and three months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

This session aims to let the participants get familiar with the interventionist. The interventionist will tell them the purpose of the program and basic rules. And the interventionist will promise their privacy protection.&#xD;
Session 2:&#xD;
This session includes how to separate thoughts/feelings/sensations related to diagnose with advanced lung cancer and experience of fatigue with facts and see these feelings in an objective way with observing self.&#xD;
Session 3:&#xD;
This session mainly aims to help participants understand the importance of values, differentiate values from goals and clarify their personal values.&#xD;
Session 4:&#xD;
This session aims at helping patients practice to engaging in committed action based on chosen values, motivated to change behavior in consistency with life direction and health goal.</description>
