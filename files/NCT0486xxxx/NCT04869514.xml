  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: One mechanism underlying the clinical effects of spinal manipulation therapy&#xD;
      (SMT) might be related to sustained changes in the signaling of proprioceptive afferents,&#xD;
      thereby affecting proprioceptive function. Proprioceptive function can be assessed using&#xD;
      vibrotactile stimulation (VS) in combination with balance control. The central nervous system&#xD;
      uses different proprioceptive weighting (PW) strategies by modifying the weighting of&#xD;
      proprioceptive signals from either ankle or paraspinal muscles, depending on environmental&#xD;
      changes. For example, during VS, healthy participants at risk of developing back pain have&#xD;
      demonstrated increased reliance on ankle instead of lumbar proprioception. Therefore, a&#xD;
      potential effect of SMT on lumbar proprioceptive function can be tested by comparing pre- and&#xD;
      post-SMT PW strategies by using VS and balance control. Objectives: The investigators aim to&#xD;
      compare changes in PW strategies in healthy participants after lumbar and thoracic SMT,&#xD;
      lumbar mobilization and no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Using a randomized controlled trial, participants will undergo two visits within 10&#xD;
      days, receiving the intervention in the first visit and pre- and post-intervention postural&#xD;
      sway assessments. Primary outcomes will include changes of postural sway and PW ratios. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed by linear mixed models.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Manual therapy is widely used by patients with back pain with about 75% of patients&#xD;
      consulting either a chiropractor, physiotherapist or osteopath. Often used manual therapies&#xD;
      include spinal manipulative therapy (SMT), which is recommended in several clinical&#xD;
      guidelines for management of back pain, mostly for acute low back pain (LBP) but also for&#xD;
      chronic LBP. Despite the clinical benefits of SMT, the mechanisms underlying its&#xD;
      effectiveness are poorly understood. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed&#xD;
      including biomechanical and neurophysiological effects observed on spinal and supraspinal&#xD;
      levels with unclear relationship to potential analgesic effects. Furthermore, non-specific&#xD;
      effects such as placebo effects can strongly influence treatment outcomes and are difficult&#xD;
      to control as consensus is lacking regarding the &quot;active&quot; agent of SMT, making it challenging&#xD;
      to design an adequately controlled and blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential biological mechanism underlying the effectiveness of SMT might be related to&#xD;
      sustained changes in lumbar proprioceptive function following repeated mechanical pressure on&#xD;
      spinal tissues. In support of this, evidence from animal studies indicates that SMT&#xD;
      comparable forces applied to the spine increase the discharge frequency of proprioceptive&#xD;
      afferents in anesthetized cats, pointing towards an immediate effect of SMT on the activity&#xD;
      of proprioceptive afferents. Proprioception is sub-served by mechanoreceptors on superficial&#xD;
      and deep tissues. Located in the muscle belly parallel to the extrafusal muscle fibers,&#xD;
      muscle spindles represent the main transmitters of proprioceptive information. Proprioceptive&#xD;
      deficits have been suggested to provoke LBP through sensorimotor incongruence, abnormal&#xD;
      loading across joint surfaces, and spinal instability due to less finely tuned muscular&#xD;
      control, potentially causing sensorimotor dysfunction and degenerative processes in spinal&#xD;
      tissues. In humans, there is anecdotal evidence that an SMT-induced repetitive barrage of&#xD;
      proprioceptive input results in pain reduction and improves perceived function that might&#xD;
      help to prevent LBP. However, a potential sustained and specific effect of SMT on lumbar&#xD;
      proprioceptive function has not been systematically tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How one can test lumbar proprioceptive function in humans? Impairments in lumbar&#xD;
      proprioception have been reported in LBP patients but only in sitting positions and mostly&#xD;
      using proxy measures of proprioceptive function such as joint repositioning sense (JRS) and&#xD;
      threshold to detect passive motion (TTDPM). The validity of these measures has been&#xD;
      questioned as they measure position- and velocity-related proprioceptive sensation and the&#xD;
      JRS is additionally influenced by motor skills and memory effects. Proprioceptive function&#xD;
      can also be tested by assessing balance control (postural sway). Balance control presupposes&#xD;
      a complex interplay involving the precise integration of proprioceptive inputs and motor&#xD;
      outputs that can be tracked by analyzing postural sway on a force plate, a methodology that&#xD;
      has been often used to assess differences in balance control in many diseases and conditions,&#xD;
      including LBP. However, postural sway has been shown to be insensitive to changes of lumbar&#xD;
      proprioceptive function, perhaps because postural sway relies on afferent input from various&#xD;
      body locations and tissues. This can be overcome with a more direct assessment of&#xD;
      proprioceptive function, achieved by using vibrotactile stimulation in combination with&#xD;
      balance control measures. Vibration applied at frequencies between 60-80Hz (and amplitudes&#xD;
      between 0.5-1mm) to muscles can selectively disturb proprioceptive signaling (mediated&#xD;
      through primary (Ia) and secondary (II) muscle spindle afferents), affecting balance control&#xD;
      by provoking corrective movements, often assessed through changes of the center of pressure&#xD;
      (COP) in anterior-posterior direction. When endogenous or environmental conditions change, as&#xD;
      in the instance of vibrotactile stimulation applied to the muscle, the balance control system&#xD;
      must identify and selectively focus on sensory inputs providing the most reliable&#xD;
      information, a process called sensory reweighting. Under normal conditions and while standing&#xD;
      on a stable surface, healthy individuals rely on proprioceptive signals originating from&#xD;
      ankle and paraspinal muscles. In contrast, standing on an unstable support surface (e.g. foam&#xD;
      pad) forces individuals to rely less on ankle proprioception while up-weighting&#xD;
      proprioceptive signals from paraspinal muscles. Differences in proprioceptive reweighting&#xD;
      have been observed between healthy subjects and LBP patients by applying paraspinal and ankle&#xD;
      muscle vibrotactile stimulation during a balance control task. Namely, during vibrotactile&#xD;
      stimulation, individuals with recurrent LBP demonstrated an increased reliance on ankle&#xD;
      proprioceptive signals compared to healthy subjects who up-weighted the proprioceptive&#xD;
      signals from the paraspinal muscles (while down-weighting those from the ankle muscle to&#xD;
      control postural balance). Importantly, a more &quot;ankle-focused&quot; strategy while standing on a&#xD;
      stable support surface seems to increase the risk for developing or having recurrences of&#xD;
      mild LBP within a time period of two years in young healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test potential specific and sustained effects of SMT on lumbar proprioceptive function,&#xD;
      the investigators aim to 1) assess SMT-induced changes in proprioceptive weighting (PW) over&#xD;
      a two-week period and 2) use a rigorously controlled approach to control for non-specific&#xD;
      effects. The planned experiments will be performed in healthy subjects because this will&#xD;
      demonstrate a potential specific effect of SMT on lumbar proprioceptive function in a&#xD;
      straight-forward manner without the need to control for possible confounding effects of&#xD;
      pain/nociception on proprioception as it would be the case for pain patients. This will allow&#xD;
      to draw conclusions w.r.t. an isolated effect of SMT on lumbar proprioceptive function,&#xD;
      providing a clear mechanism for SMT-induced changes in sensorimotor function and a solid&#xD;
      basis for further investigations in different LBP populations.&#xD;
