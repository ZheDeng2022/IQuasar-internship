      The purpose of this study is to determine to what extent a short systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
      with estradiol and progesterone, administered early to hospitalized and confirmed COVID-19&#xD;
      positive patients of both sexes in addition to standard of care (SOC) can reduce the severity&#xD;
      of symptoms and outcomes compared to SOC alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), causing COVID-19, has killed over&#xD;
      2.8 million people globally, including 550,000 in the US as of March 2021. Although, the&#xD;
      vaccination campaign is ramping up, vaccination hesitancy in the United States represents up&#xD;
      to 25-30% of the population, and hospitalizations and deaths are still at the level of 2020.&#xD;
      Apart from corticosteroids, most available therapeutic options are at best marginally&#xD;
      efficient in reducing disease severity and mortality and extremely expensive. Therefore, the&#xD;
      systematic investigation of clinically approved drugs is a priority in order to determine&#xD;
      what does improve the disease and invest resources to go to full-scale production. Our&#xD;
      current understanding of the disease is that COVID-19 deaths result from an inappropriate&#xD;
      immune response with outpouring of pro-inflammatory chemokines leading to lung infiltration&#xD;
      and hyperactivation of monocytes and macrophages producing pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      (cytokine storm), resulting in lung edema, reduced gas exchange, and ultimately leading to&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. Men with COVID-19 have a&#xD;
      uniformly more severe outcome than women. In series from China, Europe and the U.S., COVID-19&#xD;
      mortality was consistently 1.5 to 2-fold higher in men than in women, suggesting that female&#xD;
      biological sex is protecting women from COVID-19 mortality. It is established that women&#xD;
      exhibit heightened immune responses to viral infections compared to men, which is at least&#xD;
      partially due to the genetic benefit of gene dosage in X-linked immune-response genes.&#xD;
      Ovarian steroids, however, also play a protective role. In New York City, among 5700&#xD;
      hospitalized patients, the female protection from COVID-19 mortality was observed at all&#xD;
      ages, but was more pronounced in subjects under 50 years of age (18% mortality in women)&#xD;
      compared to patients &gt; 50 years of age (40.5% mortality in women), suggesting that ovarian&#xD;
      steroids are involved in mitigating COVID-19 mortality in pre-menopausal women. Further, the&#xD;
      analysis of electronic health records of over 68,000 COVID-19 patients revealed that estrogen&#xD;
      therapy is associated with more than 50% reduction in mortality. The main female steroids,&#xD;
      17β-estradiol and progesterone exhibit potent immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory actions&#xD;
      via estrogen and progesterone receptors expressed in all immune cells, including epithelial&#xD;
      cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) and cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 8 (CD8+) lymphocytes, and B cells. Progesterone also acts partially via the&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptor. Together estradiol and progesterone produce a state of decreased&#xD;
      innate immune cells production of proinflammatory cytokines, enhanced T cells&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory responses and immune tolerance, and enhanced B-cell-mediated antibody&#xD;
      production. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel&#xD;
      recommends the use of dexamethasone 6 mg per day for up to 10 days or until hospital&#xD;
      Discharge (whichever comes first) as standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of hospitalized&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen but who are not mechanically ventilated and&#xD;
      for the treatment of hospitalized patients who are mechanically ventilated. Remdesivir is SOC&#xD;
      at Tulane for COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen but who are not mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated. We believe that in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a short treatment with the&#xD;
      combination estradiol and progesterone, administered early and as a prevention in addition to&#xD;
      SOC, will prevent or mitigate the cytokine storm while increasing antibody production and&#xD;
      prevent severe outcomes, without side effects. Therefore, it will provide steroid&#xD;
      immunomodulation without immunosuppression. The advantage of repurposing estradiol and&#xD;
      progesterone compounds is the depth of knowledge regarding their clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity that has accumulated from decades of clinical and basic studies. Estradiol and&#xD;
      progesterone are widely available in hospitals, inexpensive, manufacturable to scale, and can&#xD;
      be prescribed immediately.&#xD;
