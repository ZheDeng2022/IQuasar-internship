  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large body of research has demonstrated that intensive lifestyle interventions and&#xD;
      metformin are effective treatments to prevent or delay diabetes among high-risk adults, yet&#xD;
      neither treatment is routinely used in practice. The Behavioral Nudges for Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention (BEGIN) Trial will test two low-touch interventions designed to motivate adoption&#xD;
      of these treatments to prevent diabetes. Given that 38% of U.S. adults have prediabetes, the&#xD;
      proposed study has potential for large public health impact by testing pragmatic, scalable,&#xD;
      and sustainable approaches based in primary care to promote evidence-based treatment for this&#xD;
      common condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large randomized trials have found that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and metformin&#xD;
      are safe and effective treatment options for promoting modest weight loss and preventing type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2D) among adults with prediabetes. However, these treatments are rarely used in&#xD;
      practice, and little existing research has focused on patient-centered approaches for&#xD;
      promoting their use. One potential approach, behavioral nudges, involves manipulating health&#xD;
      messages and treatment options to make behavior change more likely and easier to enact. While&#xD;
      a large body of evidence suggests that behavioral nudges are effective, they have not been&#xD;
      definitively studied for T2D prevention. The study team will address this critical knowledge&#xD;
      gap by conducting the Behavioral Nudges for Diabetes Prevention (BEGIN) Trial. The proposed&#xD;
      study will take place in primary care clinics, whose unprecedented reach and regular&#xD;
      interaction with prediabetic adults make this an ideal setting for translational T2D&#xD;
      prevention research. This definitive study will test two low-touch interventions: 1)&#xD;
      In-person intervention consisting of a prediabetes decision aid designed to nudge uptake of&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments and delivered by health educators; and 2) Automated intervention&#xD;
      consisting of motivational letters and text messages that deliver similar information and use&#xD;
      the same behavioral nudges. The proposed R18 study will accomplish the following specific&#xD;
      aims to determine the most effective low-touch intervention that promotes maximal treatment&#xD;
      adoption and weight loss.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will utilize a 2x2 factorial design to test the effectiveness of the two proposed interventions on outcomes. Each of the participating clinical sites will be randomized to one of 4 treatment conditions. Employing a full factorial design, the participating clinics sites will be randomized to 1 of the following 4 treatment conditions: a) in-person intervention alone; b) automated intervention alone; c) both interventions; and d) usual care [i.e. neither intervention].</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The number of participants that initiate ILI, Metformin, or both treatments at follow-up which will be assessed in the following ways. Because initiation of metformin requires a provider prescription, this will be assessed pragmatically using the electronic health record (EHR) and confirmed by participant self-report of taking at least 1 dose. Attendance logs will be used to confirm whether participants attended at least 1 ILI session. Those who received a prescription for metformin but do not take any doses will not be considered to have initiated treatment. Similarly, those who are referred to ILI but do not attend any sessions will not be classified as initiating treatment. Receiving a provider's prescription for metformin or referral for ILI without initiating treatment will be an exploratory outcome.</description>
