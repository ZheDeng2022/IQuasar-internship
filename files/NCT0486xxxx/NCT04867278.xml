  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One complication that can occur after surgery on the acetabulum is the development of bone in&#xD;
      abnormal places such as muscle and soft tissues. There is some evidence that a single dose of&#xD;
      radiation to the surgical site within 3 days of surgery will prevent this abnormal bone from&#xD;
      forming. However, there are no high quality studies proving that radiation works any better&#xD;
      than doing nothing at all. The purpose of our study is to determine whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in abnormal bone formation after acetabular surgery when patients are treated with&#xD;
      external beam irradiation versus no treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a common complication after surgical fixation of acetabular&#xD;
      fractures, with incidence rates reported as high as 90%. HO can be a debilitating&#xD;
      complication and surgical excision for more severe cases carries a high complication rate.&#xD;
      Numerous strategies have been employed to prevent HO formation but results are mixed and the&#xD;
      optimal treatment strategy remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common modalities used to prevent HO formation are oral administration of&#xD;
      indomethacin or single-dose external beam irradiation therapy (XRT). Despite the common use&#xD;
      of indomethacin and observational data to support its use, more recent randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate any significant reduction in the incidence of severe&#xD;
      HO when patients were administered 6 weeks of indomethacin versus placebo. Similarly, XRT has&#xD;
      been shown to be effective against HO formation in smaller observational studies, but there&#xD;
      are no adequately powered RCTs to support its use compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high incidence, impact on outcomes, and controversy regarding treatment, there&#xD;
      remains a need for continued research to determine optimal treatment strategies for HO&#xD;
      prophylaxis. While XRT remains standard of care for prophylaxis at many centers, including&#xD;
      our own, there are no RCTs to support its use. Given the associated cost and resources, and&#xD;
      potential risk even if minor, our study will help determine the feasibility of a larger RCT&#xD;
      to help determine if the use of XRT is justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this feasibility study, eligible patients will be randomized to XRT versus control. Both&#xD;
      arms will receive gluteus minimus debridement in the OR, which is the standard of care at&#xD;
      Shock Trauma. If randomized to the treatment group, patients that undergo surgical fixation&#xD;
      of an acetabular fracture via a posterior or combined anterior and posterior approach will&#xD;
      undergo a single fraction of external beam radiotherapy to the surgical site within 72 hours&#xD;
      of surgery. This treatment is currently the standard procedure performed for all patients who&#xD;
      undergo a posterior or combined approach at our institution. The control treatment arm will&#xD;
      only include gluteus minimus debridement in the OR and will not receive XRT. We will have 30&#xD;
      patients randomized to each group. We will look at consent rate, power, and HO formation on 3&#xD;
      month post-op radiographs.&#xD;
