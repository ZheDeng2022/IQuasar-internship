      Sixteen patients with COPD (GOLD I) with mild and moderate (GOLD II) severity aged 51 - 80&#xD;
      years old who visited at the outpatient examination room, Phramongkutklao Hospital divided&#xD;
      into 2 groups; diaphragmatic breathing group (DB; n=8) and Farinelli's breathing group (FB;&#xD;
      n=8). Participants in each group were administered to complete breathing exercise 5 times per&#xD;
      week for 8 weeks. Physiological data and pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1, PEF, FEV1/FVC,&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Peak Expiratory Flow at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is the amount and rate of air that can be forcefully breathed out of the lungs. The participants were asked to wear a nose clip while sitting on a chair, and the researcher gave the participants the step-by-step protocol to prevent an incorrect maneuver.

    <description>FEF25-75% is the average flow from the point at which 25 percent of the FVC has been exhaled to the point at which 75 percent of the FVC has been exhaled. The participants were asked to wear a nose clip while sitting on a chair, and the researcher gave the participants the step-by-step protocol to prevent an incorrect maneuver. For the FVC maneuver, three cycles of slow normal breathing were performed before demonstrating forced inspiration and expiration. FEF25-75% is measured in liters/seconds.</description>

    <description>It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC). The participants were asked to wear a nose clip while sitting on a chair, and the researcher gave the participants the step-by-step protocol to prevent an incorrect maneuver. For the FVC maneuver, three cycles of slow normal breathing were performed before demonstrating forced inspiration and expiration. FEV1/FVC was showed in percentage.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline respiratory muscle strength at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory muscle strength was assessed by measuring Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) in cmH2O. The participants were in a sitting position using a portable handheld mouth pressure meter (i.e., MicroRPM) with a nose clip. For the MIP measurement, the participants were asked to exhale until they felt no air remaining in their lungs (starting with the functional residual capacity [FRC] point), then held the device on their mouth and inhaled forcefully for 1-2 seconds. For the MEP measurement, the participants were asked to inhale until their lungs were completely filled with air (starting with the total lung capacity [TLC] point), then they kept the device on their mouth and exhaled forcefully for 1-2 seconds</description>

    <measure>Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Maximum Voluntary Ventilation at 8 weeks.</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of COPD change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Impact of COPD at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of COPD was assessed using the mMRC and the CAT. The mMRC has a 5-point (0-4) scale based on the severity of dyspnea, whereas the CAT is a patient-completed instrument to assess and quantify the quality of life and burden of the symptoms in patients with COPD. It consists of eight questions, each of which had a semantic 6-point (0-5) differential scale, providing a total score of up to 40 points. The scores 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, and 31-40 represented mild, moderate, severe, and very severe clinical impact, respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cytokines change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline cytokines at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were asked for intravenous blood puncture 5 cc. The levels of cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor alpha;TNF-α and Interluekin-6; IL-6 were measured in pg/ml) were determined by using the multiplex inflammation from the plasma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Malondialdehydes (MDA) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Malondialdehydes at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were asked for intravenous blood puncture 5 cc. Malondialdehydes (MDA) was analyzed by the lipid peroxidation (MDA) fluorometric assay kit in μmol/L.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aerobic capacity change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline aerobic capacity at 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Aerobic capacity was assessed using the 6-MWD, following the guidelines of the 2002 ATS. A modified settlement of the 25 m straight walking test with turning points. Participants were asked to wear comfortable clothes and shoes during the test, and their vital signs (i.e., resting heart rate and blood pressure) were evaluated before and after the test. The participants were asked to walk at a comfortable pace for 6 minutes under the supervision of a nurse and were permitted to terminate and rest during the test if they sensed heavy dyspnea.</description>
