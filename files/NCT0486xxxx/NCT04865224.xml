  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemoglobin is an important protein that gives the blood its red color and helps transport&#xD;
      oxygen to organs. There are quite a lot of people in the world who need to have their&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels checked regularly, especially anemia patients. It is important to keep the&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels in the blood of these individuals under control. For this, it is necessary&#xD;
      to measure in frequent periods. A large group, from adults to children, needs to take these&#xD;
      measurements. Most of these are invasive measurements made with blood that require devices&#xD;
      and trained people. These painful methods are quite uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, non-invasive hemoglobin level measurement was aimed with a combined DL model&#xD;
      created by using nail images with age, height, weight, BMI, and gender information of the&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
