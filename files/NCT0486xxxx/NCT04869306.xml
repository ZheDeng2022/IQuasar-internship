  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyaluronic acid (HY) is used in dentistry to improve wound healing after oral and periodontal&#xD;
      surgical interventions. After the application of HY, a positive effect on the wound healing&#xD;
      of extraction sockets and periodontal defects has been described. The removal of a mandibular&#xD;
      wisdom tooth (LM3) often leads to remaining residual defects with increased probing depths&#xD;
      distal to the second molar. To date, the influence of HY on periodontal healing of the distal&#xD;
      aspect of the second molar after removal of the LM3 has not yet been investigated.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the aim of this double-blind, controlled and randomized clinical study is the&#xD;
      influence of the application of HY Gel or HY Gel in combination with an absorbable collagen&#xD;
      sponge on the periodontal healing of the second molar after surgical removal of the LM3&#xD;
      compared to the standard procedure (blood clot). A total of 102 patients with an impacted LM3&#xD;
      and a pre-existing bone defect of at least 5 mm distal to the second molar will be included.&#xD;
      In the HY test group (n = 34), HY gel is applied to the LM3 extraction socket, and in the HY&#xD;
      + C test group (n = 34) HY gel and an absorbable collagen sponge, while the control group (n&#xD;
      = 34) does not receive any additional treatment. Patients are followed up for 12 months and&#xD;
      the presence of an increased probing depth (≥ 5mm) on the distal side of the second molar is&#xD;
      defined as the main parameter. A more stable blood clot and thus improved wound healing&#xD;
      including periodontal healing is expected through the use of HY.&#xD;
