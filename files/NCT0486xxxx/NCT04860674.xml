  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no standard chemotherapy regimens for relapse/refractory gray area lymphoma. The&#xD;
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) encoding gene is located in 9p24.1, so it is&#xD;
      speculated that the programmed cell death pathway plays an important role in gray area&#xD;
      lymphoma formation by evading immune surveillance in GZL.The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with ICE in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory gray area lymphoma.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      combined with ICE in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory gray zone lymphoma.&#xD;
      The main study endpoint is the Objective Response Rate (ORR), including Complete Remission&#xD;
      Rate (CRR) and Partial Remission Rate (PRR), was evaluated according to Lugano2014 lymphoma&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation criteria.&#xD;
