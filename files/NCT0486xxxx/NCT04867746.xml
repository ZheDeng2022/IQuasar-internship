  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate functional outcomes of a new, intraoperative lateral positioning of&#xD;
      the anchors on the tuber ischiadicum, in comparison to regular anatomical anchoring direct on&#xD;
      top of the tuber ischiadicumafter hamstring muscle repair. This study is to quantify at least&#xD;
      2 years postoperative functional, biomechanical and clinical outcomes including side-to-side&#xD;
      differences in muscle strength, unipedal balance, gait, jumping and squatting function,&#xD;
      muscle activity, in patients treated by hamstring muscle repair.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this pilot study is a descriptive cross-sectional single centre analysis&#xD;
      involving all patients previously treated with hamstring repair. All of these patients will&#xD;
      be asked to participate in clinical and detailed functional analysis at least 2 years after&#xD;
      surgery. Specifically, biomechanical and functional data including isokinetic muscle&#xD;
      strength, clinical scores, ROM, joint kinematics and kinetics during walking, running,&#xD;
      squatting and single leg jumps, muscle activity and single leg balance ability in the&#xD;
      affected and contralateral leg will be collected. These parameters will be compared between&#xD;
      legs and correlated with clinical scores.&#xD;

    <measure>Perth Hamstring Assessment Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (total timeframe for each participant approx 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The Perth Hamstring Assessment Tool (PHAT) is to evaluate functional outcomes of proximal hamstring re-attachment surgery. The PHAT provides a score out of 100, with a higher score corresponding to higher function. The questionnaire uses a visual analogue scale for pain scores as well as categorical scores for activity levels.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (total timeframe for each participant approx 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline (total timeframe for each participant approx 20 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) is intended to assess functional status in patients with disability of the lower extremity. It is a 20 item questionnaire. The maximum score obtainable is 80 which means complete function and the lowest score is 0 which means very low and severely impaired function.</description>

    <description>Muscle strength will be measured bilaterally using a dynamometer (Biodex System 4 Pro: Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). For the knee, maximum isokinetic flexion and extension torques will be collected between full extension and full flexion at a movement speed of 60°/s (5 repetitions) and 240°/s (15 repetitions). Maximum joint torques in each movement direction will be recorded for each joint and normalized to body weight.</description>

    <description>Instrumented gait analysis on a treadmill with an embedded plantar pressure plate (h/p/cosmos, Zebris FDM-T, Isny, Germany; 7168 sensors; area, 1.5 * 0.5 m; range, 1-120 N/cm2; precision, 1-120 N/cm2 ± 5%; sampling rate, 120 Hz) and on an overground walkway with two embedded force plates (Kistler force plate 9260AA6, Kistler AG, Winterthur, Switzerland; sampling rate 2400 Hz). Simultaneously with the plantar pressure or force data, kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) data will be collected. Participants will then walk for 1 minute at their preferred walking speed (0% slope and at 15% slope) and at 1.2 m/s (0% slope). For all conditions, kinematic, EMG and pressure data will be recorded for 1 minute. Subsequently, the treadmill speed will be increased to preferred running speed and 2.3 m/s (0% slope), and data for 1 minute running will be recorded. Subjects will then complete overground walking and running trials on the walkway with embedded force plates.</description>

    <description>Participants perform three jumps on a force plate. Maximum jump length, Maximum flexion and extension angles and joint moments will be identified. Subsequently, participants perform three squats onto two force plates (one per foot). On- and off times will be computed for each muscle and condition.</description>
