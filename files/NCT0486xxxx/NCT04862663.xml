      A Phase Ib/III Randomised Study of Capivasertib plus Palbociclib and Fulvestrant versus&#xD;
      Placebo plus Palbociclib and Fulvestrant in Hormone Receptor-Positive and Human Epidermal&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib/III study (CAPItello-292) aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and the degree&#xD;
      of added benefit of capivasertib combined with palbociclib and fulvestrant in participants&#xD;
      with endocrine-resistant locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.&#xD;
      Although the dosing regimens of capivasertib + fulvestrant and of palbociclib + fulvestrant&#xD;
      are established, the dose and schedule for the triplet combination (capivasertib +&#xD;
      palbociclib + fulvestrant) needs to be confirmed. Therefore, the initial dose finding Phase&#xD;
      Ib part of the study will confirm the recommended Phase III doses (RP3D) and schedule of&#xD;
      administration of capivasertib and palbociclib for the triplet combination including&#xD;
      fulvestrant which will then be used in the Phase III part of this study.&#xD;
