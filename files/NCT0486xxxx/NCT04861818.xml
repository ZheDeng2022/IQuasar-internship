  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cumulative evidence indicates that a single bout of exercise has beneficial impacts on memory&#xD;
      in young adults. From a physiological perspective, acute exercise leads to changes of heart&#xD;
      rate variability (HRV), which is associated with memory retrieval process. From a&#xD;
      psychological perspective, acute exercise increases the arousal level and thus facilitates&#xD;
      cognitive processing including memory storage and retrieval. Such HRV- and/or arousal-based&#xD;
      effects of exercise on memory could be differed by the time of day in young adults based on&#xD;
      their circadian rhythms of HRV. Moreover, young adults prefer afternoon or evening to morning&#xD;
      in their circadian rhythms, demonstrating less wakefulness and lower memory performance in&#xD;
      the morning relative to afternoon. Based on the potential psychophysiological mechanisms,&#xD;
      exercise could impact young adults' memory differently by the time of day. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to 1) determine the extent to which the time of day modulates how moderate-intensity&#xD;
      cardiovascular exercise impacts verbal-auditory and visuospatial short- and long-term memory&#xD;
      in young adults, and 2) consider potential psychological and physiological markers that may&#xD;
      mediate exercise's effects on cognitive performance. As cognitive benefits of exercise might&#xD;
      differ by the time of day, it is important to investigate such interaction and make the right&#xD;
      recommendations of the timing of exercise for young adults in academic settings.&#xD;

      Cumulative evidence indicates that a single bout of exercise has beneficial impacts on short-&#xD;
      and long-term memory in young adults. From a physiological perspective, acute exercise leads&#xD;
      to changes of heart rate variability (HRV), which is associated with memory retrieval&#xD;
      process. From a psychological perspective, acute exercise increases the arousal level and&#xD;
      thus facilitates cognitive processing including memory storage and retrieval. Such HRV-&#xD;
      and/or arousal-based effects of exercise on memory could be differed by the time of day in&#xD;
      young adults based on their circadian rhythms of HRV; sleep-wake transition led to rapid&#xD;
      changes of HRV. Moreover, young adults prefer afternoon or evening to morning, showing less&#xD;
      wakefulness and lower memory performance in the morning relative to afternoon. Based on the&#xD;
      potential physiological and/or psychological mechanisms, exercise could impact young adults'&#xD;
      memory differently by the time of day. Few studies, however, tested the effects of exercise&#xD;
      on memory based on the time of day; rather, a recent study found null effects of&#xD;
      exercise-induced arousal on implicit and explicit memory performance in college students in&#xD;
      the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators here aim to 1) determine the extent to which the time of day moderates how&#xD;
      moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise impacts verbal-auditory and visuo-spatial short-&#xD;
      and long-term memory in young adults, and 2) consider potential physiological and&#xD;
      psychological markers that may mediate exercise's effects on cognitive performance.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will conduct a mixed-design randomized experiment to compare&#xD;
      the effects of a single session of moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise on cognitive&#xD;
      performance at two times of day - in the morning (7 - 9 AM) and late afternoon (3 - 5 PM).&#xD;
      Participants in each of two groups (morning versus afternoon) will complete two sessions of&#xD;
      cognitive tests - at baseline without exercise and after an exercise intervention, while&#xD;
      their emotional states, arousal levels, and heart rate (HR) will be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      before, during, and after the exercise and memory sessions. The hypotheses are 1) acute&#xD;
      exercise in the morning will be more beneficial for short- and long-term memory than an equal&#xD;
      volume of exercise in the afternoon; 2) resting HRV and changes in perceived arousal and&#xD;
      emotional states will be associated with memory performance following the exercise&#xD;
      intervention. The rationale for the hypotheses is that cognitive benefits of exercise can&#xD;
      differ by the preference for the time of day, so it is important to investigate such&#xD;
      interactions to inform recommendations of the timing of exercise for young adults in academic&#xD;
      settings. Moreover, exploring the role of psychophysiological markers in mediating exercise&#xD;
      effects on cognition help to further understanding of the benefits of exercise for brain&#xD;
      health.&#xD;

    <description>Eligible participants will come into the lab on day 1 and 3 at the same time of day (either morning at 7-10am or afternoon at 3-5pm). They will be then randomly assigned for a rest or an exercise session prior to the memory test. For the rest condition, they will be required to sit and relax while watching Planet Earth for 30 minutes on a cycle ergometer. During the exercise session, they will complete a moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise for 20 minutes following a 5-min warm-up and followed by a 5-min cool-down on a cycle ergometer. They will start the memory test immediately after the rest/exercise session.</description>
