    <description>The level of health literacy was evaluated in four categories according to the score obtained: (0-25) points: inadequate health literacy, (&gt; 25-33) points: problematic - limited health literacy, (&gt; 33-42) points: adequate health literacy, and (&gt; 42-50) points: excellent health literacy. The health literacy level of the students was determined and the intervention and control group was selected from among the students with insufficient and problematic-limited health literacy level.</description>
