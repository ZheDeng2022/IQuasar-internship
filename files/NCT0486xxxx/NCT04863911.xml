    <textblock>
      The aim of this work is to compare the role of CT hip arthrography to MR arthrography in the&#xD;
      detection of intra-articular hip pathology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hip joint is a ball-and-socket synovial joint designed to allow multi-axial motion while&#xD;
      transferring loads between the upper and lower body. The acetabular rim is lined by&#xD;
      fibrocartilage (labrum), which adds depth and stability to the femoro-acetabular joint. The&#xD;
      articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage that dissipates shear and compressive&#xD;
      forces during load bearing and hip motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various anatomical factors make the investigation of suspected intra-articular hip pathology&#xD;
      challenging. Lesions of the labrum, cartilaginous lesions, femoro-acetabular impingement&#xD;
      (FAI), and intra-articular foreign bodies are the most common intra-articular pathology ,&#xD;
      others causes of intra-articular hip pain include ligamentum teres rupture, degenerative&#xD;
      changes, arthritis (inflammatory, infectious, etc.), and synovial proliferative disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The labrum is a fibrocartilaginous triangular-shaped incomplete ring that surrounds the bony&#xD;
      acetabulum. The labrum increases the depth of the acetabulum, thereby assisting hip stability&#xD;
      and distributing hip load. It also seals the hip joint, helping to maintain synovial fluid&#xD;
      within the central compartment and becoming a mechanical stabilizer. The articular cartilage&#xD;
      of the acetabulum has a horseshoe shaped appearance with an opening at the acetabular notch,&#xD;
      is not as thick as in other joints such as the knee. Hip cartilage in adults has been&#xD;
      estimated to be between 1 and 2 mm in thickness. Thus, plain MRI and CT have limited value in&#xD;
      assessing labral and articular cartilage disorders. Acetabular labral tears are a potential&#xD;
      source of hip pain in young adults. Many underlying conditions may predispose to labral&#xD;
      degeneration and tear including prior trauma, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI),&#xD;
      developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), capsular laxity, and congenital abnormalities&#xD;
      involving the axis of the joint such as acetabular retroversion and anteversion. Labral tears&#xD;
      rarely occur in the absence of bony abnormalities and that neglecting these underlying&#xD;
      structural abnormalities may result in treatment failure. FAI is defined as an abnormal&#xD;
      contact between the femoral head and the acetabulum that limits normal range of motion.&#xD;
      Although two types were defined (pincer when focal or general acetabular over coverage occurs&#xD;
      and cam when there is an abnormal contact between the femoral head-neck junction and the&#xD;
      anterior acetabulum), most patients have mixed types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arthroscopy is the gold standard for clarifying diagnostic dilemmas but is an invasive&#xD;
      procedure with possible complications and cannot be applied to every patient with suspected&#xD;
      but not established hip pathology. Thus, imaging may play an important role in planning&#xD;
      joint-preserving treatment options in those cases and thus preventing early hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of a labral tear is made on CT arthrography (CTa) and MR arthrography (MRa)&#xD;
      when contrast fluid gets inside the labrum. Fluid-sensitive sequences are needed on MRa to&#xD;
      detect intrasubstance labrum changes, especially those that do not extend to the articular&#xD;
      surface. Unless calcified, these changes are missed on CTa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the radiology literature has focused on the use of MRa of the hip to detect labral&#xD;
      and cartilage pathology. Both non-contrast MRI and MRa have limitations in terms of spatial&#xD;
      resolution, which can make the detection of subtle labral and cartilage pathology&#xD;
      challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT arthrography (CTa) with its superior spatial resolution offers several advantages over&#xD;
      plain MRI for the evaluation of articular cartilage. Image acquisition at a submillimeter&#xD;
      scale together with the availability of multiplanar reformations can reveal early&#xD;
      intraarticular changes that are poorly detected on plain MRI. Although Multidetector Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (MDCT) has higher spatial resolution than MR, it has significantly lower contrast&#xD;
      resolution, and thus labra and extraarticular pathology are not evaluated to the same extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTa may be indicated in cases of MR incompatibility and MR contraindications. So in our study&#xD;
      we try prospectively to evaluate the diagnostic value of CTa in comparison to MRa in&#xD;
      detection of intraarticular hip pathology&#xD;

    <description>1 mL of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) will be diluted with 100 mL of saline; 8 mL of this will be mixed with 7 mL of iodine solution (340 mg/cc) and 3 mL of lidocaine 2% and injected under ultrasonographic guidance.&#xD;
The fixed US-guided technique, the needle will be inserted into the needle guide hole and directed toward the hip joint, targeting the femoral head-neck junction. The volume injected varies from 10 to 20 mL, with a mean of 15 mL.&#xD;
Ideally CT should be performed immediately after the injection and MR should be performed within 90 minutes after the initial injection.</description>
