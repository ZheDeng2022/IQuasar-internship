  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effect of rotary instrumentation using ProTaper Next rotary&#xD;
      system versus TruNatomy rotary system on postoperative pain and the bacterial load reduction&#xD;
      following single visit root canal treatment in necrotic mandibular molars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last years several rotary systems had launched to the market for mechanical&#xD;
      preparation. The new era in the mechanical instrumentation aims to preserve the maximum&#xD;
      amount of the peri-cervical dentine without affecting the proper cleaning and bacterial&#xD;
      elimination. This will improve the long-term survival of the tooth with appropriate removal&#xD;
      of microbes and microbial irritants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ProTaper Next is a rotary system made from M wire. It is characterized by an innovative&#xD;
      off-centered rectangular cross section that is suggested to give the files a snake-like&#xD;
      swaggering movement as it advances into the root canal. This movement minimizes the&#xD;
      engagement between the file and dentin and improves extruding debris out of the canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TruNatomy (Dentsply Sirona), is recently introduced as a new generation of rotary file&#xD;
      system. TruNatomy files are designed to shape root canal systems to a continuously tapering&#xD;
      preparation with maximum preservation of peri-cervical dentine. TruNatomy system offers a&#xD;
      more safety, simplicity, improved cutting efficiency and mechanical properties compared to&#xD;
      previous generations of rotating instruments, Many researches had been conducted to address&#xD;
      the effect of ProTaper Next on post-operative pain considering it the most commonly used&#xD;
      system. Thus, this study will be performed to evaluate and compare the influence of using the&#xD;
      two systems on the intensity of postoperative pain and bacterial load reduction.&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative pain will be measured by modified VAS at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post-obturation.&#xD;
The modified VAS consists of from 0-10 point scale anchored by two extremes &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as could be&quot;. The patients will be asked to choose the mark on an appendix that represents their level of pain. Pain level will be assigned to one of four categorical scores:&#xD;
None (0)&#xD;
Mild (1-3)&#xD;
Moderate (4-6)&#xD;
Severe (7-10) numerical rating scale (NRS) at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post-obturation and at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post-obturation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Mandibular permanent molar teeth:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed clinically with pulp necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
