  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The kidneys are important at getting rid of toxins and excess water from the body. If they&#xD;
      fail, then toxins and excess water builds up within the body. Kidney failure is treated by&#xD;
      either giving patients a new kidney (a transplant) or by removing the toxins and fluid from&#xD;
      the body by the process of dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' aim is to personalise the care given to patients with kidney failure, and&#xD;
      as such, they have started measuring the fitness of patients with kidney failure, who either&#xD;
      already require dialysis or may need dialysis in the near future. This is currently done in a&#xD;
      number of ways including measuring how strong their grip is, assessing their walking speed&#xD;
      and asking questions about how difficult they find certain activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the future, the investigators think that this will allow targeted treatments to help&#xD;
      improve their fitness and potentially identify any problems earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current approaches to measuring activity and fitness have limitations and in particular may&#xD;
      over- or underestimate the level of the physical activity. To over come these limitations,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to wear an activity tracker (called an accelerometer) on for a&#xD;
      week. Readings from the accelerometer will be compared against the other markers of fitness&#xD;
      and activity to see if they are comparable. It will also be noted whether patients are&#xD;
      prepared to wear the device for 7 days (compliance).&#xD;
