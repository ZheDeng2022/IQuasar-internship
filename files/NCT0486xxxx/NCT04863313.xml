  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the data from the Di@bet.es study, which is part of the National Diabetes&#xD;
      Strategy, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Spanish population is 13.8%. Diabetic&#xD;
      patients suffer from several short and long term complications, which are related to a&#xD;
      significant worsen of quality of life and a substantial increase in death rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, it is important to prevent the development of Type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is of high relevance to identify and to treat prediabetic subjects prior to the development&#xD;
      of the disease. Many strategies have been implemented to reverse this situation, such as&#xD;
      changes in diet and lifestyle, among others. However, it is hard to achieve changes in&#xD;
      lifestyle and despite the use of some drugs in this phase of the disease, the problem&#xD;
      continues growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, new strategies to combat the development of type 2 diabetes are been&#xD;
      investigated, such as the use of probiotic formulations. However, at the moment, few studies&#xD;
      evidence the effect of probiotics on glycemic regulation. Therefore, an interesting&#xD;
      opportunity arises according to the potential ability of probiotic formulation for the&#xD;
      control of prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering this background, the main objective of this research is to assess the effect of a&#xD;
      new probiotic formulation on glycemic control, insulin resistance and the composition of the&#xD;
      fecal microbiota in prediabetic subjects.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a 12-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel&#xD;
      study. It is focused on prediabetic overweight / obese men and women between 18 and 70 years&#xD;
      old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants attend the Nutrition Intervention Unit of the Center for Nutrition Research&#xD;
      in the University of Navarra for the screening visit and 4 more times during the intervention&#xD;
      (week 1, 4, 8 and 12 of study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening visit: evaluation of the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria are provided with a stool collection kit and a 72&#xD;
      h food record questionnaire. Moreover, they are randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: placebo supplemented; Experimental group: probiotic supplemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical investigation day 1 (day 1): The volunteer attend the Nutrition Intervention&#xD;
           Unit in fasting state. Each volunteer is asked to provide the stool sample and the&#xD;
           72-hour food record questionnaire. Then, anthropometric, body composition and blood&#xD;
           pressure measurements are taken and the gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaire is&#xD;
           completed. After that, volunteer is provided with the capsules of the study for one&#xD;
           month. Finally, fasting blood samples are collected and then an oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
           test is carried out and blood samples are taken at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the&#xD;
           ingestion of the glucose solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical investigation day 2 (week 4): The volunteer attend the Nutrition Intervention&#xD;
           Unit in fasting state. The gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaire is completed and the&#xD;
           adherence to the study and to the capsule consumption is assessed. After the measurement&#xD;
           of anthropometric, body composition and blood pressure a blood sample is collected.&#xD;
           Finally, volunteer is provided with capsules for the next month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical investigation day 3 (week 8): The volunteer attend the Nutrition Intervention&#xD;
           Unit in fasting state. The gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaire is completed and the&#xD;
           adherence to the study and to the capsule consumption are assessed. After the&#xD;
           measurement of anthropometric, body composition and blood pressure, a blood sample is&#xD;
           collected. Finally, the stool collection kit, 72h food record questionnaire and capsules&#xD;
           for one month are given to the volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical investigation day 4 (week 12): The volunteer attend the Nutrition Intervention&#xD;
           Unit in fasting state. Each volunteer is asked to provide the stool sample and the&#xD;
           72-hour food record questionnaire. Then, anthropometric, body composition and blood&#xD;
           pressure measurements are taken and the gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaire are&#xD;
           completed. Finally, fasting blood samples are collected and then an oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test is carried out and blood samples are taken at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes&#xD;
           after the ingestion of the glucose solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month later, the online version of the gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaire is send to&#xD;
      each volunteer in order to asess any gastrointestinal symptom after stopping capsule&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
