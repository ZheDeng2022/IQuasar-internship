    <textblock>
      Malnutrition affects millions of children throughout the World. According to ESPEN&#xD;
      nutritional risk screening tools have been designed to detect protein and energy under&#xD;
      nutrition and predict if under nutrition may develop or worsen. The Screening was validated&#xD;
      Tool for Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics (STAMP) that evaluates patient's clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis, nutritional intake during hospitalization and anthropometric measurements,&#xD;
      developing a care plan based on the child's overall malnutrition risk. The Screening Tool for&#xD;
      Impaired Nutritional Status and Growth (STRONG kids) consists of four items: clinical&#xD;
      assessment, high-risk diseases, nutritional intake and losses, weight loss or poor weight&#xD;
      gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score (PYMS) is adopted among patients between 1 and 16&#xD;
      years of age assesses four items: BMI, history of recent weight loss, changes in nutritional&#xD;
      intake and the expected effect of current medical condition on patient's nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect calorimetry, calculated from analysis of the inspired and expired gases, is the best&#xD;
      method for evaluating individual energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein requirements are highe. The catabolic effects of illness lead to negative nitrogen&#xD;
      balance. Randomized protein-supplemented enteral diet achieved 3.1g/kg/day protein and&#xD;
      positive nitrogen balance by PICU day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral nutrition is more physiological, simpler, can be started more quickly and cheaper, it&#xD;
      does not require special preparation, and it can be started and modified at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Par enteral nutrition has reserved for those patients with intestinal obstruction or severe&#xD;
      gastrointestinal damage, ischemia, inflammation, hemorrhage, peritonitis and paralytic ileus.&#xD;

    <description>We will conduct this study to compare early (6-24 h) with late (after 24 h) initiation of enteral feeding in PICU. Enteral nutrition is more physiological,early enteral nutrition has a trophic effect on the intestinal mucosa, and stimulates the intestinal immune system, decreasing bacterial overgrowth and translocation; it therefore reduces the incidence of sepsis and multiorgan failure. Furthermore,early enteral nutrition is associated with fewer hepatic and metabolic complications than late and parentral nutrition.</description>
