  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the efficacy of a brief pre-hospital naloxone education module added to&#xD;
      the standard &quot;Total Joint Class&quot; curriculum on patient safety and experience. Participants&#xD;
      will consist of 250 patient-and-support-person pairs. The primary outcome is &quot;readiness to&#xD;
      use&quot; naloxone - a proxy for opioid overdose safety. Patient factors contributing to this&#xD;
      primary outcome as well as the effect on patient attitude and experience will also be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are powerful pain medications which currently serve a necessary role in recovery&#xD;
      after knee or hip replacement surgery. However, opioids also pose a danger to both the&#xD;
      patient and to other members of the household in the event of accidental overdose because&#xD;
      they can cause respiratory depression and death. To minimize the risk of opioid overdose,&#xD;
      patients are educated in appropriate use and storage of their medication. They are also&#xD;
      provided with a prescription for naloxone. Naloxone is an emergency-use, potentially&#xD;
      life-saving antidote to opioid pain medication. It can be sprayed into the nostrils of the&#xD;
      opioid overdose victim by a non-medically trained bystander while waiting for the ambulance&#xD;
      to arrive, and can make the difference between life and death for a child or adult. However,&#xD;
      only about 30% of patients choose to fill their naloxone prescription when they go home from&#xD;
      hospital after joint replacement surgery at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital. The first&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate whether teaching patients about opioid overdose and&#xD;
      naloxone treatment influences whether patients fill their naloxone prescription and whether&#xD;
      they can appropriately administer naloxone in the event of an overdose in the home.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will look at what factors, other than pre-surgery education,&#xD;
      influence whether a patient fills their naloxone prescription or not. The resources available&#xD;
      for opioid overdose prevention in the community are limited, and this study will help guide&#xD;
      the effective use of those resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in this study will be patients who are planning hip or knee replacement&#xD;
      surgery. They will enroll together with their primary support person. Two hundred and fifty&#xD;
      patient and primary-support-person pairs will be enrolled prospectively over a 9-month&#xD;
      period. All participant pairs will be randomized to receive either only the current&#xD;
      three-hour pre-operative Joint Class (which is mandatory for all patients with their support&#xD;
      person and includes education on opioids and pain management), or to receive, in addition, a&#xD;
      new educational module. The new module will consist of a modified version of the REVIVE!&#xD;
      Course, a course designed for people without prior medical training on the recognition of an&#xD;
      opioid overdose and appropriate response including naloxone administration. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to complete an enrollment questionnaire prior to the educational intervention, a&#xD;
      2-week Recovery Journal (pain and medication diary) following surgery, and a follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaire at the first post-operative visit, 2 weeks after surgery. Patients will also&#xD;
      receive a short, 3-4 item questionnaire 6 months after surgery to collect data on the risk of&#xD;
      long-term opioid use and the outcome of the naloxone in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data that is collected will be used to describe the study population&#xD;
      and determine factors that act as barriers to effective opioid overdose reversal with&#xD;
      naloxone in the home. This study will also examine the influence of education on the&#xD;
      experience of the patient within the healthcare system, attitudes of patients towards opioids&#xD;
      and naloxone, and patient safety. Standardized assessments that will be used to address these&#xD;
      study questions include the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS), the Opioid Overdose&#xD;
      Attitude Scale (OOAS), and the PROMIS Pain Medication Misuse, Pain Intensity, and Pain&#xD;
      Interference short forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies that examine the influence of naloxone education for the layperson, so&#xD;
      evidence in this field is limited. This study is unique in that it moves the conversation&#xD;
      from the arena of chronic pain management and opioid addiction and focuses on the population&#xD;
      of patients managing acute pain before and after surgical procedures. Outcomes of this&#xD;
      research will help to direct prevention resources by answering very topical questions about&#xD;
      the usefulness and effects of naloxone co-prescription with opioids for acute pain.&#xD;

    <measure>&quot;Readiness to Use Naloxone&quot; assessed by survey and Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale administration</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 2 weeks (from surgery to first follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is expressed as a binary yes/no for each patient-support person pair. It can be assessed with the survey tool used at the patient's follow up appointment. The patient/ support person pair must satisfy each of the three following conditions.&#xD;
patient reports naloxone is present in the home (or carried with the patient) (assessed by Y/N question)&#xD;
the support person reports knowledge of and immediate access to the naloxone (assessed by Y/N question)&#xD;
the support person demonstrates competency for naloxone administration by scoring a passing mark on the modified Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) (Williams et al. 2013). For our purposes, this will be a score greater than or equal to 34/45.&#xD;
If the three conditions are met, then the pair is assessed a &quot;yes&quot; score on &quot;Readiness to Use Naloxone&quot;. If any condition is not met, then the pair is assessed a &quot;no&quot; score on &quot;Readiness to Use Naloxone&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>7 months (time from enrollment to 6 month follow-up phone call)</time_frame>
    <description>Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from one to five. To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question. For the adult 6-item form, the lowest possible raw score is 6; the highest possible raw score is 30 (see all short form scoring tables in Appendix 1). All questions must be answered in order to produce a valid score using the scoring tables. If a participant has skipped a question, use the HealthMeasures Scoring Service (https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_scoringservice) to generate a final score. Locate the applicable score conversion table in Appendix 1 and use this table to translate the total raw score into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean.</description>

    <description>Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five. To find the total raw score for the short form, sum the values of the response to each question. The lowest possible raw score is 3; the highest possible raw score is 15.&#xD;
For most Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System instruments, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10 because calibration testing was performed on a large sample of the general population. The T-score is provided with an error term (Standard Error or SE). The Standard Error is a statistical measure of variance and represents the &quot;margin of error&quot; for the T-score.&#xD;
Important: A higher Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System T-score represents more of the concept being measured.</description>
