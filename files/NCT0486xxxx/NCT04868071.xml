    <description>Exercise interventions were carried out over a total of 16 weeks in the mornings (08:00 am-12:00 am) under the supervision of at least two fitness instructors. Participants performed four exercises for lower limbs (Figure 9): 1st) squat on the chair, 2nd) seated unilateral hip flexion, 3rd) seated unilateral knee extension, and 4th) bilateral calf raise with 12-15 submaximal repetitions avoiding fatigue (i.e., inability to complete a repetition in a full range of motion). The number of sets was increased linearly during the first month, such that one set was performed in the 1st week, two sets in the 2nd week, 3 sets in the 3rd week, and 4 sets in the 4th week. Subsequently, participants performed the main exercise period. After a brief warm-up, participants performed the same exercises that were performed during the familiarization period using an adjustable weight vest and ankle weights (DOMYOS®, Shangai, China).</description>
