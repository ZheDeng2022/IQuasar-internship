  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high rate of intravesical (bladder) recurrence following extirpative surgery for&#xD;
      upper tract urothelial carcinoma. There is no single established standard of care for&#xD;
      prevention of intravesical recurrence; however, one protocol in common use involves the use&#xD;
      of intravesical gemcitabine instilled into the bladder during surgery and prior to entry into&#xD;
      the bladder. There are barriers to the use of gemcitabine, especially at lower volume&#xD;
      centers. Some evidence suggests that intravesical irrigation with sterile water has&#xD;
      equivalent efficacy to intravesical chemotherapy in prevention of recurrent bladder cancer&#xD;
      following transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT). This study is intended to&#xD;
      compare recurrence rates using intravesical gemcitabine (as a pseudo-standard of care) and&#xD;
      continuous bladder irrigation with sterile water.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper tract urothelial carcinoma is a relatively rare disease, accounting for 5-10% of&#xD;
      urothelial malignancies. Following radical nephroureterectomy (RNU), recurrence of urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma in the bladder (UCB) is reported in up to 50% of cases. Although the mechanism of&#xD;
      bladder cancer recurrence following RNU is still controversial, recent evidence suggest that&#xD;
      these tumors have similar clonal origin to upper tract tumors, supporting the theory of&#xD;
      downstream seeding; specifically, that manipulation of the upper tract during surgery results&#xD;
      in shedding of tumor cells which then implant in the bladder and give rise to bladder tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different strategies have been suggested to reduce UCB recurrence rates following RNU. Early&#xD;
      clipping of the ureter distal to the tumor may prevent seeding and reduce UCB recurrence,&#xD;
      while the correct technique for bladder cuff resection remains debatable. A single,&#xD;
      post-operative, prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy instillation (pIVC) has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce recurrence rates following resection of UCB. Specifically, two prospective studies&#xD;
      have evaluated the use of pIVC using mitomycin-C (MMC) or pirarubicin (THP) following RNU,&#xD;
      showing a 11-25% absolute reduction in the risk of UCB recurrence. The safety of pIVC has&#xD;
      previously been reported by Moriarty et al. with no directly associated adverse events. The&#xD;
      investigators' group also compared bladder recurrence rates in patients who received&#xD;
      intraoperative or postoperative pIVC. In this cohort, 12- and 24-month recurrence rates in&#xD;
      the I-pIVC groups were 10.8% and 14.4%, respectively, with a favorable safety profile.&#xD;
      Current practice at this institution, which is widely employed at many centers but is not&#xD;
      supported by Level I evidence, is to instill gemcitabine into the bladder intraoperatively&#xD;
      and to allow it to dwell within the bladder until excision of the ureter, at which time the&#xD;
      gemcitabine is drained prior to entry into the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its demonstrated benefits, there appears to be considerable underutilization of pIVC&#xD;
      for various reasons. Based on a national survey in the United States, less than 50% of&#xD;
      urologic oncologists use pIVC, mainly due to concerns including lack of evidence, fear of&#xD;
      extravasation and office infrastructure. While educational measures should be taken to&#xD;
      increase urologists' awareness of the importance and high level evidence supporting the use&#xD;
      of pIVC, other concerns, such as extravasation and logistical issues (which may include&#xD;
      office infrastructure, availability of chemotherapeutic agents outside of a hospital setting,&#xD;
      availability of trained personnel, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible alternative to pIVC that would circumvent logistical, availability-, and&#xD;
      toxicity-based concerns is the use of intravesical continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) with&#xD;
      sterile water. In this method, a multi-way urinary catheter is placed in the bladder which&#xD;
      allows water to be irrigated into the bladder while simultaneously and freely draining out&#xD;
      via a separate lumen, allowing the bladder to be continuously irrigated with sterile fluid.&#xD;
      In this setting, irrigation would be initiated at the start of the surgical procedure and&#xD;
      would be terminated and the bladder drained immediately prior to entry into the bladder at&#xD;
      the time of excision of the distal ureter. There have been several studies that have&#xD;
      demonstrated the ability of hypotonic fluid (e.g., sterile water) to kill bladder tumor&#xD;
      cells. Distilled water irrigation has shown to delay tumor recurrence of bladder cancer by&#xD;
      osmolysis of tumor cells. A prospective, randomized, open-label, two-arm, single-center,&#xD;
      pilot study compared continuous sterile water irrigation to a single dose intravesical of&#xD;
      mitomycin C after transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) and found recurrence-free&#xD;
      rates for MMC and continuous sterile water irrigation groups were 47.1% and 52.6%,&#xD;
      respectively. Another study investigated the results of bladder irrigation with water for&#xD;
      injection after TURBT. A total of 239 patients (158 with single tumors, group A, and 81 with&#xD;
      multiple tumors, group B) received continuous intravesical postoperative irrigation with&#xD;
      water. Recurrence-free rate for those patients who received only intravesical irrigation with&#xD;
      water was 75.8%, 66.2% and 63.2% at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd year of follow up, respectively. A&#xD;
      systemic review of the literature evaluated bladder irrigation after TURBT. There were 6&#xD;
      studies, including 1515 patients of which 361 had saline irrigation and 463 had sterile&#xD;
      water. There was no significant difference between IVT chemotherapy, saline and sterile water&#xD;
      groups regarding to the median RFS at 1 year [IVT: 81%, IQR (77.70, -81.00), sterile water:&#xD;
      74%, IQR (63.3-74.9), saline: 76.7% IQR (76.0, 77.7), p = 0.21]. Adverse events were more&#xD;
      frequent amongst patients in the IVT chemotherapy group in comparison to the saline or water&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is hypothesized that intraoperative continuous bladder irrigation with&#xD;
      sterile water is noninferior to intravesical instillation of gemcitabine. If the two regimens&#xD;
      are substantially equivalent, irrigation with water would be considered a superior option due&#xD;
      to greater simplicity, wider availability, and reduced risk of toxic exposure to the patient&#xD;
      and operating room staff.&#xD;
