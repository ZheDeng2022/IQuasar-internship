  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Low birthweight (LBW) is associated with a wide range of short- and long-term&#xD;
      consequences and is related to a complex set of maternal psychosocial and behavioural&#xD;
      determinants. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of implementing fast-track&#xD;
      referral for early intervention on psychosocial and behavioural risk factors - smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, depression and interpersonal violence - on reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      LBW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: Parallel superiority pragmatic clinical trial randomized by clusters.&#xD;
      Primary health care units (PHCU) located in Portugal will be randomized (1:1) to intervention&#xD;
      or control groups. Pregnant women over 14 years of age attending these PHCU will be eligible&#xD;
      to the study. Risk factors will be assessed through face-to-face interviews. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, women who report at least one risk factor will have immediate access to&#xD;
      referral services. The comparison group will be the local standard of care for these risk&#xD;
      factors. The investigators will use intention-to-treat analyses to compare intervention and&#xD;
      control groups. A sample size of 2,832 pregnant women was estimated to detect a 30% reduction&#xD;
      in the incidence rate of LBW (primary outcome) between the control and intervention groups.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are the reduction of preterm births and reduction of risk factors targeted&#xD;
      by the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a parallel superiority pragmatic clinical trial randomized by&#xD;
      clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Primary Health Care Units (PHCU) located in the metropolitan&#xD;
      regions of Porto and Lisbon, in Portugal. All 236 PHCU, nested in 13 Primary Care Centres&#xD;
      (PCC), will be considered eligible to inclusion (109 PHCU in 7 PCC in Porto; 127 PHCU in 6&#xD;
      PCC in Lisbon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the PHCU as units of randomization and pregnant/newborn dyads as&#xD;
      the unit of analysis. In each of the 13 Primary Care Centres, all PHCU that adhere to the&#xD;
      study will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio for the intervention or control group and will&#xD;
      belong to that group until the end of the study. A research team statistician will generate&#xD;
      the randomization sequence through Excel Office 365 and implement the random allocation&#xD;
      sequence using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each PHCU, all pregnant women, of any gestational age, over the age of 14, who are&#xD;
      attending their first prenatal care visit during the study period, that currently reside in&#xD;
      Portugal and plan to have a birth in Portugal will be considered eligible and invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health professionals providing prenatal care will be responsible for recruiting pregnant&#xD;
      women at their first prenatal visit at the PHCU. Participation in the study is voluntary and&#xD;
      non-participation in the study does not affect the routine healthcare provided. The&#xD;
      recruitment of participants will last until the planned sample is reached (estimated period&#xD;
      of one year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed of the objectives of the study and giving informed and written consent,&#xD;
      pregnant women who agree to participate will answer a face-to-face questionnaire. Data&#xD;
      collection will take place in a private environment, that is, in a medical or nursing office,&#xD;
      without the presence of other pregnant women, partners or family members, to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality, using an online link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic questionnaire includes sociodemographic characteristics (date of birth,&#xD;
      nationality, marital status, education level, type of work) and risk assessment (smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol consume, depression and physical abuse). Considering the particular context of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which can affect intrauterine development of the foetus, the&#xD;
      questionnaire also includes information on COVID-19 tests and contact with positive cases.&#xD;
      Pregnant women with at least one of the psychosocial or behavioural risk factors will be&#xD;
      asked about chronic conditions, medication use, obstetric history, characteristics of the&#xD;
      current pregnancy and anthropometry. To assess smoking during pregnancy, the investigators&#xD;
      will use a set of questions including pre-pregnancy smoking and smoking during pregnancy&#xD;
      (frequency, number of cigarettes per day, gestational month). In women who report smoking&#xD;
      during pregnancy, the investigators will assess smoking addiction using the Fagerström&#xD;
      nicotine addiction test, validated in Portugal in an academic community of teachers and&#xD;
      staff. For alcohol consumption screening, the investigators will use the Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C), a scaled-down version of the Alcohol&#xD;
      Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), which has a good performance in detecting risky&#xD;
      consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. To assess depression, the investigators will use the&#xD;
      Portuguese version of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDE) with a 9-point&#xD;
      cut-off. To assess physical violence against pregnant women the investigators will use the&#xD;
      Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS) instrument due to its reliability, validity and easiness of&#xD;
      application by clinicians in the context of healthcare provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who present at least one of the risk factors will be eligible to receive the&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention will be the activation of fast-track referral for specialized&#xD;
      units and care programs for the four psychosocial and behavioural risk factors under study.&#xD;
      All pregnant women referred by the &quot;STOP LBW project&quot; would have access to consultations or&#xD;
      other health activities, such as counselling and group meetings, within a maximum of seven&#xD;
      days, in reference services available in each metropolitan area. The activation of the&#xD;
      fast-track referral will be the responsibility of the doctor/nurse who applies the&#xD;
      questionnaires to identify the risk factors. The intervention ends with childbirth, abortion&#xD;
      or if the participant decides to abandon the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will have the following process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Any tobacco use during pregnancy = Activation of fast-track referral for smoking cessation&#xD;
      consultation in Health Centre Units, Hospitals or other; and/or ii. Risk alcohol consumption&#xD;
      (score ≥4 on the test AUDIT-C) = Activation of fast-track referral for consultation in&#xD;
      support services for the cessation of alcoholic consumption in Health Centre Units,&#xD;
      Hospitals, Division of Intervention in Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (DICAD), social&#xD;
      service or other; and/or iii. Risk of depression (score ≥9 on the EPDE scale) = Activation of&#xD;
      fast-track referral for psychology consultation at Health Centre Units, Hospital Psychiatry&#xD;
      or other; and/or iv. Physical Violence (affirmative answer to the physical violence question&#xD;
      in the AAS) = Activation of the fast-track referral for social service and/or psychological&#xD;
      consultation in Health Centre Units, Psychiatry Hospitals, or other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be the standard of care currently existing in each PHCU. The standard&#xD;
      of care varies across the various PHCU and may include several approaches: routine screening&#xD;
      with care by the antenatal care provider; routine screening with referral to other health&#xD;
      professional in the same health unit; and routine screening with referral to other health&#xD;
      services, with the time elapsed for consultation depending on the health resources available&#xD;
      in each area. In each PHCU, different standards of care may exist for each of the four risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the incidence of LBW (objective of 30% reduction in the incidence of&#xD;
      low birthweight, from 9.0% to 6.5%). The secondary outcomes are: a) the prevalence of each of&#xD;
      the four psychosocial and behavioural risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, depression&#xD;
      and physical violence) at the first prenatal visit and after birth; b) the incidence of&#xD;
      preterm births (live births with less than 37 weeks of gestation); and c) the proportion of&#xD;
      pregnant women with adherence to care programs targeted at psychosocial and behavioural risk&#xD;
      factors and description of the determinants of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on birthweight, gestational age and type of delivery will be obtained from the&#xD;
      child health records at the first appointment of the newborn at the PHCU (the moment of the&#xD;
      first vaccination will be used whenever possible). The research team will conduct a telephone&#xD;
      interview in the first month after birth, using the same screening questionnaire used in the&#xD;
      first interview, to assess tobacco and alcohol consumption, the presence of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and exposure to interpersonal violence. The investigators will also measure&#xD;
      adherence to care programs aimed at the four risk factors and the determinants of adherence&#xD;
      and other strategies used by the pregnant woman to control these risk behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated considering the use of bilateral tests, for a significance&#xD;
      level of 5% and statistical power of 80%, in order to compare the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups in relation to the primary outcome defined in the main objective of the study. It was&#xD;
      assumed that the intervention can reduce the incidence of LBW by about 30%, that is, from&#xD;
      9.0% to 6.5%. Estimating an institutional adherence rate of 50%, using an intracluster&#xD;
      correlation coefficient of 0.01 (estimated from perinatal health studies in primary health&#xD;
      care) 60 and estimating a size variation of 20% in clusters (variation in the number of&#xD;
      eligible pregnant women in each PHCU), a sample size of 1,416 participants per intervention /&#xD;
      control group was estimated, in a total of 2,832 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the study, there will be no blinding of pregnant women, health&#xD;
      professionals or members of the research team after assignment of the intervention. However,&#xD;
      those involved in the outcome assessment and data analysis will be blinded as there will be&#xD;
      no identification of the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to the study protocol will be fostered using different strategies including&#xD;
      information to pregnant women, project communication through the creation and maintenance of&#xD;
      a website, involvement of health professionals during the planning and monitoring phases, and&#xD;
      close monitoring of the intervention by the research team. Data collection will be weekly&#xD;
      monitored comparing women attended in the first prenatal consultation, women invited to&#xD;
      participate and women included in the study. This efforts aim to prevent empty clusters and&#xD;
      ensure that the inclusion process of pregnant women is independent of the allocation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires will be coded using an alphanumeric unique code to ensure confidentiality&#xD;
      and anonymity. Clinical and sociodemographic data will be stored in a Limesurvey server from&#xD;
      the Institute of Public Health of the University of Porto, to which only two members of the&#xD;
      research team will have access (IB and PP). The access to the dataset is private and will&#xD;
      only be available by using a specific user account and password. This repository uses digital&#xD;
      certificates that guarantee the security of all the communications and traceability. Datasets&#xD;
      will be extracted to a SPSS software version 26.0 for analysis and report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct an intention-to-treat analysis to compare the results between&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups using random effects models that take into account the&#xD;
      cluster effect. Pregnant women who have miscarriages; stillbirths; early neonatal deaths&#xD;
      without information on birthweight; and pregnant women included in the study who decided to&#xD;
      leave the study or who became inaccessible by the research team will be classified as losses&#xD;
      to follow-up. The missing data for individual variables will be described and multiple&#xD;
      imputation methods used if the missing data is &gt;5%. Characteristics of included women versus&#xD;
      losses to follow-up and potential impact on results will be described, with use of&#xD;
      statistical techniques, if necessary, to address selection bias. Differences in LBW incidence&#xD;
      between the intervention group and the control group clusters will be tested using the&#xD;
      chi-square test (χ2) or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Adjusted analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted to control the effect of potential confounders if maternal characteristics such as&#xD;
      age, education, chronic conditions, marital status, type of pregnancy (single or multiple),&#xD;
      type of delivery, among others are misbalanced between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study was conducted from January 8 to June 18, 2020 in ten PHCU including 142&#xD;
      pregnant women (1 refusal, 0.7%). The average gestational age was 19 weeks and 28.2% had at&#xD;
      least one of the four risk factors: 14.8% reported smoking during pregnancy, 0.7% had high&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, 16.9% had depressive symptoms and 1.4% reported at least one episode of&#xD;
      physical abuse during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators had planned to start the clinical trial immediately after the pilot study&#xD;
      but it had to be stopped because of the covid-19 pandemic. The study will be resumed in 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and public were not involved in the definition of research questions, outcome&#xD;
      measures and design of the study. During the interviews, women will be asked about the burden&#xD;
      of the intervention and their acceptance.The investigators intend to involve patients and the&#xD;
      public in the plan to disseminate the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who agree to participate will sign a written and informed consent. Participants can&#xD;
      refuse to participate in the study or withdraw their consent at any time. Refusal or&#xD;
      abandonment does not affect the right to receive medical treatment or medical assistance, now&#xD;
      or in the future. There is no reason to believe that the intervention will harm the&#xD;
      participants. However, all cases of miscarriage, stillbirths, neonatal death, birth defects&#xD;
      or maternal death will be recorded. Any potential damage resulting from the investigation&#xD;
      will lead to the immediate suspension of part or all of it. The data will be stored&#xD;
      electronically on a secure server of the Public Health Institute of the University of Porto&#xD;
      (ISPUP), with access only by the research team. All information in the database will be&#xD;
      anonymized, using a unique identifier. The key to link the database records and the&#xD;
      identification of the participants will be kept by the health professionals of the PHCU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be disseminated to all health professionals and health service managers in&#xD;
      Portugal through meetings and reports. The results will also be made available to pregnant&#xD;
      women and the general population through the study website and the press. The main results&#xD;
      will be published in scientific journals.&#xD;
