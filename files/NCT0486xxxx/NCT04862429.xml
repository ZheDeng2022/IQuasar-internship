  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcification clusters are 30-40% of recalls in mammographic screening, but have a low&#xD;
      positive predictive value (~15%) for ductal cancer in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer. These&#xD;
      calcifications often need histological assessment with stereotaxic guided biopsy (Mammotome).&#xD;
      With extended calcifications, choosing the best area to biopsy may be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this 1:1 randomized controlled clinical trial is to compare the&#xD;
      accuracy of the CESM guide (study arm with biopsy under CESM guidance) with the traditional&#xD;
      Mammotome (control arm with biopsy under stereotactic guidance) in conducting the biopsy in&#xD;
      the area of greatest malignancy/grade of the lesion, using as gold-standard the histological&#xD;
      exam of the operating piece. Women recalled with indication to perform stereotactic biopsy&#xD;
      for clusters of suspicious calcifications on mammography (BIRADS R3 or R4 or R5) not&#xD;
      mass-associated will be included. Anticipated sample size is 100 women per arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale Suspicious calcifications requiring further assessment are about 30-40% of recalls&#xD;
      in mammographic screening. Nevertheless these findings have low positive predictive value&#xD;
      (~15%) for ductal cancer in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer. However, these calcifications are&#xD;
      more frequently sent to biopsy than other doubt or suspect findings, due the difficulty in&#xD;
      resolving the suspect with ultrasounds or with other imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For their histological check a biopsy with stereotaxic guidance (Mammotome) should be&#xD;
      performed; when calcifications appear in several distinct clusters or over extended area, it&#xD;
      is difficult to choose the best area to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CESM is a technique that fuses mammographic images able to capture the morphology of&#xD;
      calcifications (not visible at MRI) and the enanchement due to metabolic cellular and tissue&#xD;
      vascular changes (not visible at usual X-ray imaging). Contrast-enhanced mammography (CESM)&#xD;
      allows the description of both morphology and distribution of calcifications and contrast&#xD;
      enhancement (CE). In the identification of pathological calcifications, CESM showed 91%&#xD;
      sensitivity, 84% specificity, 77% VPP and 93% VPN, providing additional information for&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis and dimensional definition of the pathological area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique has the potential to allow a better sampling when biopsing calcifications than&#xD;
      standard stereotactic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: to compare the accuracy of CESM guide vs. stereotactic Mammotome guide in&#xD;
      conducting biopsy in the area of major malignancy/grade of lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the proportion of patients undergoing pre-operative imaging with contrast&#xD;
           media administration (it is expected to be almost 100% in intervention arm, but also in&#xD;
           control arm some women will require additional pre-surgery assessment with MRI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the proportion of upgrading from DCIS G1/G2 in pre-operative biopsy to DCIS&#xD;
           G3 in surgical specimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the sensitivity of biopsy in the diagnosis of microinvasive/invasive tumors&#xD;
           (pathology on surgical specimen as reference);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waiting time between biopsy and surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the CESM arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare mammography and CESM in terms of accuracy in the definition of lesion size&#xD;
           and multifocality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association between the intensity of enhancement at CESM and the grade&#xD;
           of malignancy of the lesion at histological examination on surgical specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Women recalled with indication to perform stereotactic biopsy for clusters of&#xD;
      suspicious calcifications on mammography (BIRADS R3 or R4 or R5) not mass-associated will be&#xD;
      included. Anticipated sample size is 100 women per arm; this sample size will give a 75%&#xD;
      power to detect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant therapy cannot be considered as an exclusion criteria, since the referral would&#xD;
      occur after the enrollment and randomization. However, since it is extremely rare that&#xD;
      not-mass associated lesions characterized by calcifications would require neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy, the investigators do not anticipate to include patients who will be referred to&#xD;
      therapy before surgery. If this unlikely event happens, women referred to neaodjuvant therapy&#xD;
      will be included in the study without contributing to the analyses on the main objective and&#xD;
      secondary objectives involving a comparison with post-operative pathological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Potentially eligible women will be informed about the study by the investigator&#xD;
      radiologist during the visit in which mammography results are communicated. Women who express&#xD;
      the willingness to participate will be asked to sign the informed consent and randomized to&#xD;
      one arm with a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the experimental arm will undergo CESM. If in the images contrast-enhancement is&#xD;
      visible, stereotactic biopsy will be performed under CESM guidance. After administration of&#xD;
      an additional dose of iodized contrast-enhancement (Omnipaque), the insertion of the biopsy&#xD;
      needle and the biopsy sampling will be targeted on the area of greatest enhancement in the&#xD;
      context of calcifications. In the absence of contrast-enhancement, stereotactic biopsy&#xD;
      Mammotome will be performed, using X-ray guidance. The insertion of the biopsy needle and&#xD;
      biopsy will be targeted on the most suspicious calcification cluster or area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the control arm will undergo stereotactic biopsy (with Mammotome), using X-ray&#xD;
      guidance. The insertion of the biopsy needle and biopsy will be targeted on the most&#xD;
      suspicious calcification cluster or area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, at the end of the procedure, a metal clip marker will be placed in the biopsy&#xD;
      site; the placement will be verified with dual orthogonal mammography projection (as regular&#xD;
      clinical practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the test and treat study design, surgical and medical treatments will be defined&#xD;
      accordingly to the imaging and histological findings obtained in the arm of allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The main outcome is the accuracy of biopsy in collecting material from the most&#xD;
      significant area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcomes will allow to measure downstream consequences of the biopsy. Surgical specimen&#xD;
      will be used as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses Main analyses will be conducted according to intention to treat strategy. The&#xD;
      outcomes accuracy of biopsy, proportion of patients undergoing pre-operative imaging with&#xD;
      contrast (CSM or MRI), proportion of upgraded lesions, biopsy sensitivity for&#xD;
      microinvasive/invasive tumors, waiting time between biopsy and surgery will be compared&#xD;
      between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes accuracy in the definition of lesion size and multifocality, and enhancement&#xD;
      predictivity for grade malignancy will be analysed within the experimental arm comparing CESM&#xD;
      and mammography images in the same woman (paired analysis).&#xD;
