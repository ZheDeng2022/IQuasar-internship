  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy alcohol use is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the US. Although&#xD;
      effective prevention for unhealthy alcohol use and medication treatment for alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders (AUDs) can be provided in primary care (PC), they have historically not been&#xD;
      included in routine services. As a result, most patients do not receive evidence-based&#xD;
      prevention or treatment for unhealthy alcohol use. Several efforts have successfully&#xD;
      implemented alcohol-related preventive care-referred to as screening and brief intervention&#xD;
      (SBI), but efforts to increase treatment of AUDs with medications have been less successful.&#xD;
      Moreover, implementation efforts have usually neglected smaller PC practices, in which most&#xD;
      PC is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Michigan SPARC trial is a partnership between Kaiser Permanente Washington Health&#xD;
      Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle, bringing extensive expertise implementing&#xD;
      evidence-based alcohol-related care, and Altarum Institute in Ann Arbor, Michigan, bringing&#xD;
      demonstrated success engaging over 500 small to medium Michigan-based PC practices in&#xD;
      effective quality improvement (QI) efforts. The project builds on Altarum's innovative&#xD;
      approach to implementing new or improved clinical care using practice facilitators to provide&#xD;
      continuing medical education and maintenance of certification (CME/MOC) programs to PC&#xD;
      providers, along with ongoing support for QI using evidence-based implementation strategies.&#xD;
      The KPWHRI team recently finished the highly successful AHRQ-funded Sustained&#xD;
      Patient-centered Alcohol-Related Care (SPARC) trial using similar implementation strategies&#xD;
      in KP Washington, including use of electronic health records and performance monitoring and&#xD;
      feedback, and also developed a patient decision aid to support shared decision-making between&#xD;
      patients with high-risk drinking and/or AUDs and their PC providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Michigan SPARC trial combines Altarum's expertise in QI in small-medium PC practices in&#xD;
      Michigan with KPWHRI's expertise implementing evidence-based prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      unhealthy alcohol use-specifically alcohol SBI and medication treatment for AUDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims of the Michigan SPARC trial are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test whether the Michigan SPARC model increases (a) alcohol SBI and/or (b) initiation of&#xD;
           medication treatment for AUDs, in small to medium PC practices in Michigan, in a&#xD;
           stepped-wedge trial with 6 waves, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test whether adding an innovative decision aid for AUDs to Michigan SPARC implementation&#xD;
           increases rates of (a) SBI, and/or (b) initiation of medication treatment for AUDs, in a&#xD;
           nested two-arm cluster randomized trial (with 1:1 randomization within each wave).&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Deidentified data will be shared in the following ways:&#xD;
External Evaluator. The Michigan SPARC investigators are committed to working with AHRQ's external evaluator (NORC) on the cross-grant evaluation.&#xD;
Other data sharing. We will also make de-identified data available, upon request, after Michigan SPARC trial results are completed and published. No PC practices will be identified in the dataset. Data will be available to investigators who propose a cogent analysis not already part of planned secondary analyses. Proposals must include a biosketch of the Investigator(s), as well as research question(s), sample, measures, methods and statistical issues. Proposals will be reviewed by the Multiple PIs and the leaders of the Michigan SPARC Data and Evaluation team. For approved projects, a data sharing agreement will be developed and subsequently data will be made available.</ipd_description>
