    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and anticancer activity of&#xD;
      BLU-945, a selective EGFR inhibitor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include a dose-escalation portion in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who have&#xD;
      previously received at least 1 prior EGFR-targeted TKI, followed by expansion groups&#xD;
      consisting of patients with tumors harboring specific mutation profiles: EGFR T790M and C797S&#xD;
      mutation (Group 1); EGFR T790M but not C797S (Group 2); or EGFR C797S but not T790M (Group&#xD;

             activating EGFR mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previously received at least 1 prior EGFR-targeted TKI. For patients enrolled to&#xD;
             expansion Group 2, prior treatment must include an approved EGFR-targeted TKI with&#xD;

             using either tumor tissue (ideally from a progressing lesion) and/or ctDNA in plasma.&#xD;
             It is preferable that samples used for analysis be obtained during or after disease&#xD;
             progression on the last EGFR-targeted TKI received.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Dose escalation: At each dose level, slots may be reserved for patients with the&#xD;
                  mutations of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Expansion Groups: Patients must have NSCLC harboring EGFR T790M and C797S&#xD;
                  mutation (Group 1); EGFR T790M but not C797S (Group 2); or EGFR C797S but not&#xD;
                  T790M (Group 3).&#xD;

             pretreatment tumor samples be obtained from a progression lesion, during or after&#xD;
             disease progression on the last EGFR-targeted TKI received.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients without archival tissue available, where biopsy is not considered safe and/or&#xD;
             medically feasible, may be discussed with the study medical monitor and may be&#xD;

          3. Received the following anticancer therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. EGFR-targeted TKI within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any immunotherapy or other antibody therapy (including EGFR-targeted antibodies&#xD;
                  or bi-specific antibodies) within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;
                  (immune-related toxicities must have resolved to &lt; Grade 2 prior to starting BLU&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
             for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or that have not resolved to baseline at the time&#xD;
             of starting study. Exceptions include alopecia and fatigue, and, upon discussion with&#xD;

             evidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome) that are stable on antiviral&#xD;
             treatment may be eligible if benefit/risk is justified and permission is granted from&#xD;
             the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Received neutrophil or platelet growth factor support within 14 days of the first dose&#xD;
             of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Requires treatment with a prohibited medication or herbal remedy (as specified in&#xD;
             Appendix 2) that cannot be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the start of study&#xD;
             drug administration. BLU 945 may be started within 14 days or 5 half-lives of these&#xD;
             therapies if considered by the Investigator to be safe and within the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient, with prior Sponsor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Major surgical procedure within 14 days of the first dose of study drug (procedures&#xD;
             such as central venous catheter placement, tumor needle biopsy, and feeding tube&#xD;
             placement are not considered major surgical procedures).&#xD;
