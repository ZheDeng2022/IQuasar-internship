  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practice of Reiki and back massage applications in support of pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      is among the nursing initiatives and these practices increase the autonomy of the profession.&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Reiki and back massage on pain,&#xD;
      analgesic use and vital signs in women who had undergone open abdominal hysterectomy. This&#xD;
      was an experimental study with a single, blinded, pretest-posttest control group. The&#xD;
      population of the study consisted of women who had abdominal hysterectomy in the Obstetrics&#xD;
      Clinics at Gazi Yasargil Training and Research Hospital and Dicle University Hospital between&#xD;
      July 2017 and February 2018. The patients were divided into three groups: Reiki, back massage&#xD;
      and control, with 34 patients in each group. Reiki or back massage were applied for 20&#xD;
      minutes once a day to the patients in the Reiki and back massage groups.&#xD;

      The study was carried out to determine the effect of Reiki and back massage application on&#xD;
      pain, analgesic use and vital signs in women underwent open abdominal hysterectomy. This&#xD;
      study used an experimental pretest and posttest design with two experimental groups (Reiki&#xD;
      and back massage), and a control group. The population of the study consisted of women who&#xD;
      underwent abdominal hysterectomy in the Obstetrics Clinics of the Gazi Training and Research&#xD;
      Hospital and Dicle University Hospital between July 2017 and February 2018. Open abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy is usually performed in clinics on a planned basis.The data were collected by&#xD;
      the researcher in the clinic by the face-to-face interview method using the Patient&#xD;
      Information Form, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and the Vital Signs and Postoperative&#xD;
      Analgesic Follow-up Form.&#xD;

    <description>The modern-day Reiki (pronounced &quot;ray-kee&quot;) practiced in the United States originated in Japan with Mikao Usui in the early 1900s. Reiki is a complementary and adjuvant therapeutic technique. Reiki, which is classified as an &quot;energy healing therapy&quot;, is a technique of channeling universal energy in order to reduce stress, promote relaxation, and enhance well-being.</description>

    <description>In the current study, at the beginning of the treatment, the researcher held his hands 2-3 cm above the patient sand adjusted the aura of the patient by making circular movements from the head to the feet. After this process of aura attunement, the researcher placed his hands directly on the patient's body. In the areas where the practitioner had placed his hands for an average of three minutes, starting from between the eyes, the researcher felt various degrees of warmth and tingling in his palms. Only the back was left exposed to prevent the patient becoming cold. The researcher took a little non-aromatic baby oil in hand and heated it, then began a 20-minute-long massage. The massage consisted of 6.5 minutes of effleurage (stroking), 3.5 minutes of petrissage (kneading), 13 minutes of effleurage and seven minutes of petrissage.</description>

        Open abdominal hysterectomy is usually performed in clinics on a planned basis. Patients&#xD;
        undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy are hospitalized over 1-2 days before the surgery&#xD;
        and they are discharged on the postoperative 3 rd day if there is no postoperative&#xD;
        complication. Routine analgesics and antibiotics are given to all patients in the&#xD;
        postoperative period.&#xD;
