      The main objective of the study is to determine effects of latissimus dorsi stretching on&#xD;
      functional disability related to chronic low back pain&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-blinded,randomized clinical trial will be conducted in /multiple rehabilitation&#xD;
      centers of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, after taking approval from ERB/IRB respective centers.&#xD;
      The study duration will be 3 months. the study participants will be having mechanical low&#xD;
      back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be included latissmus dorsi stretching along with spinal stabilization&#xD;
      exercises in one group and in comparative group spinal stabilization exercises alone.&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used to measure the disability related to the chronic&#xD;
      low back pain.&#xD;

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (aka the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) is an extremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient's permanent functional disability. The test has been around since 1980 and is considered the 'gold standard' of low back pain functional outcome tools. SCORE DISABILITY LEVEL 0 - 4 No disability 5 - 14 Mild disability 15 - 24 Moderate disability 25 - 34 Severe disability 35 - 50 Completely disabled The Oswestry Disability Index (aka the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) is an ex- tremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use</description>

    <description>Spinal stabilization exercises (SSE) including bridging, planks and tummy tuck-in will be performed. Each participant received a total 7 session thrice a week sessions in two weeks, . Each session had lasted for 30-40 minutes. Spinal stabilization exercises were repeated 5-15 times depending on the endurance of patients.&#xD;
Home exercise plan will also be given e.g. postural care, precautions in lifting and carrying weights etc.</description>

    <description>In experimental group in addition SSE group interventions, participants will receive the latissimus dorsi stretching (LDS). Each participant received a total 7 session thrice a week sessions in two weeks. Each session had lasted for 30-40 minutes. each stretch of latissimus dorsi was of 20-30 seconds with 10-20 repetitions in each session.</description>
