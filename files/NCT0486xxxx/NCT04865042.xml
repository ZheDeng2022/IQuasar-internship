  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists in evaluating the analgesic efficacy of Gabapentin versus Placebo in the&#xD;
      short term (72h) acute lumbosacral radiculalgia due to disc herniation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the usual analgesic treatment, the patient will receive gabapentin or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the three days of treatment, an evaluation of the pain and the tolerance will be&#xD;
      performed within the two groups: experimental and control.&#xD;

    <description>Visual analogue scales are 10-cm lines anchored at the ends by words that define the bounds of various pain dimensions. The patient is asked to place a vertical mark on the scale to indicate the level of intensity of his or her pain being 0 equivalent to no pain and 100 to the worst possible pain between 0 hours (H0) and 72 hours (H72), H0 corresponding to the first administered dose of the treatment (Gabapentin or Placebo).</description>

    <description>The presence of neuropathic pain will be evaluated by the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) scale. This is a self-questionnaire.The tool evaluates mean pain intensity in the last 24h in a verbal numeric scale from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Total pain intensity score may be calculated by the sum of 10 descriptors.Evolution of the NPSI (Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory) between H0 and H72, then between H0 and D7</description>

    <description>In the Dn4 questionnaire there are 4 questions with 10 items. Answers are yes or not. At the end of the questionnaire each &quot;no&quot; is considered as 0, each &quot;yes&quot; is considered as 1. The total score is 10. When addition of answers is 4 or more the test is considered as positive.</description>
