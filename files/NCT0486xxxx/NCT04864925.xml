  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS COVID 2 has caused a pandemic of proportions unparalleled in the past 100 years. The&#xD;
      virus has an uncanny ability for transmission and as such has been difficult to control. The&#xD;
      spread of the virus has affected everything from education, business, politics and survival.&#xD;
      While the investigators have learned a great deal in the last 9 months they still face an&#xD;
      uncertain day to day existence. Health care workers are particularly vulnerable to&#xD;
      transmission of this virus because of their close contact with patients. Moreover, dentists&#xD;
      are particularly vulnerable because the virus is spread via aerosols which are generated&#xD;
      quite easily in the dental office putting dentists and their associates at risk. The oral&#xD;
      cavity appears to be a likely domain for viral carriage particularly since both taste and&#xD;
      smell are hallmark effects of the virus. With these issues at hand it will be of great&#xD;
      advantage to have a simple routine oral hygiene method in the effort to reduce the oral viral&#xD;
      load. There is some reason to expect that oral hygiene procedures with known anti-microbial&#xD;
      effects could have some use in our efforts to reduce or control the oral viral load. With&#xD;
      this issue in mind investigators feel that stannous fluoride could modify the virus in such a&#xD;
      manner as to effectively reduce the oral viral load.&#xD;

      Study will measure reduction of SARS-CoV-2 levels in the oral cavity after brushing for up to&#xD;
      an hour. Subject sampling will occur at baseline, 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min&#xD;
