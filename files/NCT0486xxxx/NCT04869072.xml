  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, phase I study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) obtained from donors who were tested positive for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 and fully recovered from the infection and administered to patients who are&#xD;
      infected with the new coronavirus and present dyspnea or a poor prognosis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of a new highly contagious and life-threatening infective disease was first&#xD;
      reported in China in December 2019. Regardless of the undertaken containing measures, its&#xD;
      spreading could not be effectively stopped and currently we are confronting the pandemic&#xD;
      diffusion of a newly identified Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (1). This causes a systemic disease,&#xD;
      known as (Coronavirus Disease-19) COVID-19, characterised by a broad spectrum of clinical&#xD;
      manifestations, including ineffective hyper-inflammation and severe pneumonia, with&#xD;
      provisional epidemiologic data indicating a mortality rate of 0.1-15% (2). Do to the lack of&#xD;
      vaccination, specific anti-virus sera or monoclonal antibodies, the therapeutic efforts to&#xD;
      limit COVID-19 mostly rely on the empirical use of anti-viral drugs. Therefore, being the&#xD;
      option of an active immunisation not available and because of the controversial efficacy of&#xD;
      the available anti-viral therapies (3), we suggest the option of a passive immunisation for&#xD;
      those patients who are infected with the new coronavirus and present dyspnea or a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. The use of convalescent plasma, i.e. plasma obtained from donors who were tested&#xD;
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 and fully recovered from the infection, could provide a rapid&#xD;
      protection, limiting the observed evolution of COVID-19 towards life-threating manifestations&#xD;
      (7-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When carried on according to standardised measures, the transfusion of plasma is highly safe&#xD;
      (10-11) and we assume that products containing anti- SARS-CoV- 2 antibodies will provide the&#xD;
      recipients a passive immunity through different mechanisms, including viral neutralisation,&#xD;
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis.&#xD;
