  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify novel gene mutations which have contributed to&#xD;
      significant personal and family history of cancer. Adults with and without cancer will be&#xD;
      accrued to the study. Participants qualify to take part in this research study because&#xD;
      someone in their family has been diagnosed with or because they themselves have a cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' DNA and other clinical information will be obtained from a blood sample in&#xD;
      order to study the genetic basis of cancer and related complications. All portions in the DNA&#xD;
      that code for proteins (i.e., the exome) will be studied. Participant DNA sample and&#xD;
      information about family structure and family medical history and ethnic origin may also be&#xD;
      collected to better understand this information. Clinical information will be stored and&#xD;
      biological samples, including DNA, will be kept for up to three (3) years after collection&#xD;
      for future. Ultimately, once identified, the role of the specific genetics changes in the&#xD;
      development of inherited cancer(s) will be characterized.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data for this study will be obtained via both retrospectively and prospectively. Affected&#xD;
      individuals (who have cancer) with a family history suggestive of a known hereditary syndrome&#xD;
      or meeting National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria will be accrued from routine&#xD;
      clinical care to form a &quot;real world&quot; baseline of diagnostic yield using a multicancer panel.&#xD;
      These participants will not be additionally consented for WES as part the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other affected individuals identified as having five or more relatives with discordant&#xD;
      cancers will receive standard of care (SOC) multicancer panel. Families without any mutations&#xD;
      identified (with at least a minimum of 2 members with cancer, 1 without) will be considered&#xD;
      for additional sequencing as part of this study's primary objective of describing novel&#xD;
      inherited cancer syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the individual being evaluated in cancer genetics clinic (i.e. index patient) consents and&#xD;
      their family members express interest in the study, they will move on to study visit 1.&#xD;
      During this visit, pedigree information and medical histories will be explained, consent&#xD;
      verified, and individual genetic counselling provided. Individuals will decide whether or not&#xD;
      to be notified that incidental findings exist in their genomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab requisition will be done to facilitate blood draws and DNA extraction/storage and WES&#xD;
      analysis will be completed. Any identified monogenic variants of interest will be sent to an&#xD;
      industry partner with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)/College of American&#xD;
      Pathologists (CAP) certification for validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit 2 to be completed within the next 6 months, at which any identified monogenetic&#xD;
      variants of interest will be discussed with the participant. Those undergoing Germline High&#xD;
      Functional Impact (gHFI) variant counting will be notified if they have more or less than the&#xD;
      general population. Appropriate genetic counselling, recurrence risk, and additional clinical&#xD;
      referrals will be made as necessary. Participants will be notified with a binary yes/no of&#xD;
      any American College of Medical Genetics incidental findings and a routine clinical genetics&#xD;
      follow-up appointment will be made&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to identify novel gene variants associated with&#xD;
      generalized cancer susceptibility that is manifesting as a personal history of multiple&#xD;
      primary tumors or a family history of discordant cancers. This will be done through&#xD;
      exploratory, research grade (ie NOT CLIA/CAP certified) whole exome sequencing (WES) studies&#xD;
      provided to patients/families with family histories of discordant cancers as an adjunct to&#xD;
      SOC clinical genetics evaluation in order to clinically describe novel syndromic&#xD;
      manifestations of cancer susceptibility. Suspected germline variants supporting a generalized&#xD;
      cancer susceptibility will be further validated in a CLIA/CAP certified laboratory prior to&#xD;
      being reported out to the patient's medical chart&#xD;
