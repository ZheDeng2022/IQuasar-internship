      A clinical trial study to determine the effect of an investigational drug (SEP-363856) has on&#xD;
      the way that the drug Metformin travels through the body in people with schizophrenia. This&#xD;
      clinical trial will have approximately 24 subjects both male and female 18 year of age and&#xD;
      older. This study will be conducted in approximately 2 study sites in the United States.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, two-period crossover study in which each subject will&#xD;
      receive both treatments and therefore act as their own control to minimize confounding&#xD;
      covariates within the study population. Randomizing subjects to treatment sequence will&#xD;
      assist with reducing the potential order effects that might confound the findings if all the&#xD;
      subjects received the same treatment sequence. The single-blind method is used to keep&#xD;
      subjects blind to treatment assignment throughout the study period, in order to avoid&#xD;
      possible influence of the psychological factors of subjects on study assessments. This&#xD;
      clinical study will evaluate whether SEP 363856 influences the PK of a concomitantly&#xD;
      administered OCT2 substrate, metformin.&#xD;

                  compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Symptoms of mild to&#xD;
                  moderate mood dysphoria or anxiety are allowed so long as these symptoms are not&#xD;

                  ideation with specific plan and intent) on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating&#xD;
                  Scale (C SSRS) at Screening (ie, in the past 1 month) or at any subsequent C SSRS&#xD;
                  assessment prior to dosing (ie since last visit).&#xD;
