  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Test Anxiety is a highly prevalent and impairing condition in adolescents (i.e., 9th to 12th&#xD;
      grade students), significantly impacting on their mental health and well-being. Among&#xD;
      Portuguese university students, test anxiety is the primary reason for seeking specialized&#xD;
      psychological support, suggesting the importance of early intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test anxiety associates to low self-compassion, acceptance and mindfulness, which have been&#xD;
      increasingly acknowledged in literature as important processes to cultivate towards human&#xD;
      experience and suffering, within intervention programs, particularly in adolescence, and in&#xD;
      anxiety and fear of failure in academic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These processes are covered and enhanced within comprehensive models and evidence-based&#xD;
      therapies that adopt an integrative, contextual and biopsychosocial approach, such as&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), as&#xD;
      well as an evolutionary approach, such as Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT). These approaches&#xD;
      focus on receiving internal events (e.g., thoughts, emotions, memories) in an accepting and&#xD;
      compassionate way, as part of human experience, without changing them, while developing a&#xD;
      sense of vitality, well-being and commitment to valued ends in life, instead of focusing&#xD;
      solely or mainly on symptom reduction (although it is usually a consequent outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are no empirically validated therapeutic programs for adolescents with test&#xD;
      anxiety promoting these processes combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICT-based interventions are accessible, convenient, cost-effective and have been proved&#xD;
      effective in reducing anxiety disorders' symptomatology. Even though there are some&#xD;
      empirically validated online interventions for test anxiety in adolescents, having shown&#xD;
      promising results, these were mainly self-help/module-based programs, without a clinician&#xD;
      facilitating the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to develop and implement a 12-week ICT-based targeted, facilitated and&#xD;
      manualized individual intervention for adolescent students, developing compassion, acceptance&#xD;
      and mindfulness, in order to help improve test anxiety's regulation (and consequently symptom&#xD;
      reduction), as well as increase general and school-related well-being, while promoting valued&#xD;
      life action.&#xD;

      All ethical and deontological requirements are guarenteed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of adolescent students (from 9th to 12th grade) is being online-recruited, through&#xD;
      social media and contacts with Executive Boards of Portuguese secondary schools, private&#xD;
      practices and study centers, advertising the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/legal guardians are encouraged to contact the team. From this approach, parents/legal&#xD;
      guardians and respective adolescents who demonstrate interest are explained the aims and&#xD;
      procedures of the study and asked to sign a written consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents are then assessed for eligibility through a test anxiety self-report measure and&#xD;
      a clinical interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group, who will&#xD;
      reveive the intervention (facilitated by licenced psychotherapists with training in&#xD;
      contextual therapies and are familiar with the intervention protocol), or a waiting-list&#xD;
      control group, who will have access to the intervention after the six-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will complete a protocol with self-report measures, assessing psychopathology&#xD;
      indicators, emotion regulation processes, and general and school-related well-being, in four&#xD;
      different moments: at baseline (M0), immediatly after the intervention (M1), three months&#xD;
      (M2) and six months (M3) after the intervention.&#xD;
