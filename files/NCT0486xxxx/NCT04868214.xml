  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Perosphere Technologies' PoC Coagulometer measures clotting times of fresh whole blood&#xD;
      samples. Clotting is initiated by glass surface activation and terminates on optical&#xD;
      detection of fibrin assembly, the final step in the coagulation cascade. Since activation&#xD;
      occurs at the top of the intrinsic pathway and detection occurs at the bottom of the final&#xD;
      common pathway, the Perosphere Technologies' PoC Coagulometer has shown sensitivity to a&#xD;
      broad range of drugs and reagents that affect blood clotting processes, including the Direct&#xD;
      Oral Anticoagulants, DOACs (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban), as well as the&#xD;
      heparins (e.g. enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, and unfractionated heparin). The&#xD;
      purpose of the present study is to characterize the performance of the PoC Coagulometer&#xD;
      measuring Clotting Time Controls, as well as fresh whole blood from both healthy volunteers&#xD;
      and DOAC patients at three field testing sites.&#xD;
