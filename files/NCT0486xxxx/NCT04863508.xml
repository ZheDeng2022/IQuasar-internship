  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled out-of-office blood pressure (BP), measured by either home BP monitoring (HBPM)&#xD;
      or ambulatory BP monitoring, has been shown to predict higher cardiovascular risk. However,&#xD;
      HBPM could not identify daytime BP surge, which leads to underestimation of future risk among&#xD;
      treated hypertensive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeartGuide provides validated out-of-office BP measurements, along with activity/sleep&#xD;
      recordings. The present study is designed to examine whether BP monitoring with the&#xD;
      HeartGuide could identify masked uncontrolled hypertension in controlled hypertensive&#xD;
      patients based on office BP. We will enroll hypertensive patients with controlled office BP&#xD;
      according to their cardiovascular risk profile. We will also examine prevalence of&#xD;
      post-prandial BP changes and BP variability using HeartGuide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent hypertension guidelines stressed the importance of out-of-office BP monitoring.&#xD;
      Ambulatory BP (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) both predict future cardiovascular events&#xD;
      better than office BP. Masked hypertension is an important issue. As revealed by recent&#xD;
      studies, daytime BP surge can result in greater target organ damage for high-risk&#xD;
      hypertensive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous trials such as TASMINH2 and TASMINH-SR study showed positive effects of HBPM on BP&#xD;
      control in hypertensive patients. However, several issues preclude perfect applications of&#xD;
      HBPM. For example, HBPM could not provide BP recordings during activity or at night-time. In&#xD;
      addition, the currently recommended time schedule for HBPM may be insufficient for detecting&#xD;
      daytime surge especially among high-risk individuals. Wearable BP devices seem to fill in&#xD;
      this gap as a novel approach of out-of-office monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeartGuide, the new watch BP monitor, was recently validated to provide accurate BP&#xD;
      measurements. It could provide incremental knowledge with potentially larger numbers of&#xD;
      recordings. The primary objective of this study is to unveil uncontrolled masked hypertension&#xD;
      with HeartGuide, particularly for those undetected with current office BP and HBPM. A second&#xD;
      objective is to assess diurnal BP trends and BP variability.&#xD;
