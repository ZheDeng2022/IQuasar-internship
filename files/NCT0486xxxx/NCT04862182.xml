      The assessment and management of progress of labour is based on subjective clinical findings.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of delay in labour and decisions regarding the timing and / or type of&#xD;
      intervention(s) rely on clinical abdominal examination and digital vaginal assessment of the&#xD;
      degree of cervical dilatation, the position of the presenting part of the baby and its&#xD;
      station in relation to the maternal pelvis . Several studies have demonstrated the inaccuracy&#xD;
      and the lack of consistency in such assessment between different practitioners especially in&#xD;
      certain malpositions, malpresentations or with excessive subcutaneous tissue oedema .&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the important clinical parameters that is assessed in labour is the position of the&#xD;
      fetal head. Precise knowledge of fetal occiput position in labour is essential because some&#xD;
      malpositions, like a persistent occiput posterior position is associated with higher risk of&#xD;
      operative delivery and maternal and perinatal morbidity. The correct determination of head&#xD;
      position is crucial before attempting any operative vaginal delivery. Moreover, knowing the&#xD;
      exact presentation is also of paramount importance. For example, the differentiation between&#xD;
      a face and a brow presentation is important in clinical management particularly that the&#xD;
      engaging diameters of the latter presentation are too big in a term baby for a safe vaginal&#xD;
      birth to occur, Sonographic assessment of fetal head position is best performed by&#xD;
      transabdominal imaging in axial and sagittal planes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another parameter that is important in evaluating the progress of labour is the fetal head&#xD;
      station. The fetal head station is the level of the fetal head in the birth canal relative to&#xD;
      the plane of the maternal ischial spines. Serial clinical assessments by digital vaginal&#xD;
      examination give an indication of the progress in head decent throughout the labour process,&#xD;
      Sonographic assessment of fetal head station is best performed by transperineal ultrasound in&#xD;
      the midsagittal or axial plane .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several authors reported that ultrasound examination is more accurate and reproducible than&#xD;
      clinical examination in the diagnosis of fetal head position and station and in the&#xD;
      prediction of arrest of labor . It has also been suggested that ultrasound examination has&#xD;
      the potential to stratify women who have a spontaneous vaginal delivery from those who end up&#xD;
      having an operative birth Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that it is feasible to rely&#xD;
      on ultrasound to predict the outcome of a planned operative vaginal birth .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, currently, there is no consensus regarding the best timing of intrapartum scanning,&#xD;
      at least for some of these measurements. Similar there is no general agreement regarding&#xD;
      which measurements should be obtained and how useful if some of these measurements are&#xD;
      integrated into a prediction model together with demographic or other clinical parameters.&#xD;
