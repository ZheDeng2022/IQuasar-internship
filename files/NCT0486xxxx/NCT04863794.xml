      The aim of Study BP41660 is to quantify the amount and concentration of [89Zr]DFO-RO7248824&#xD;
      in the brain with positron emission tomography (PET) following a single sub-pharmacological&#xD;
      dose of RO7248824 and [89Zr]DFO-RO7248824 administered via IT injection to healthy&#xD;
