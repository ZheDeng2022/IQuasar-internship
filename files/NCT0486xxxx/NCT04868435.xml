  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Many people lose their sense of smell after they have had a cold, flu or sinus&#xD;
      infection. Recovery (if at all) generally starts with a &quot;parosmia&quot; phase which means&#xD;
      every-day smells become distorted and over-poweringly objectionable, and this can lead to&#xD;
      malnutrition and depression. We do not know much about how or why parosmia happens, but there&#xD;
      are key foods common to those who suffer from parosmia which seem to trigger the distortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parosmia and COVID-19 Loss of smell has recently been recognised as an official symptom of&#xD;
      COVID-19, and we are starting to get reports of people who have recently had COVID-19&#xD;
      developing parosmia. The triggers seem to be similar to those of the common cold, flu or&#xD;
      virus infections, but the journey between loss of smell and parosmia is different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Triggers of distortion will be the same for all parosmics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There may be additional trigger foods in different cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the trigger foods and beverages for parosmia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there regional/cultural variations?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does Covid-19 parosmia differ from &quot;standard&quot; post-viral parosmia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the project is to understand the mechanisms involved in parosmia. The&#xD;
      approach is to identify foods and everyday aromas associated with parosmia and to determine&#xD;
      whether they are the same across different continents/cultures/ethnic backgrounds, and&#xD;
      whether Covid-19 parosmia is any different to non-Covid-19 parosmia. The questionnaire will&#xD;
      ask about Covid-19 status, ethnic background, smell loss and parosmia, and the changes that&#xD;
      occurred between smell loss and parosmia. The participants will then answer questions on up&#xD;
      to 15 everyday smells, some of which our preliminary evidence shows are common triggers, and&#xD;
      others which are not. The questionnaire will be globally distributed, for example through&#xD;
      current collaborations in the UK, US, Germany, Iran, China, Japan and Brazil. It will be&#xD;
      completed by participants who are currently experiencing parosmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to record any foods that they find distorted and provide a&#xD;
      list of aromas which returned undistorted.&#xD;

      The questionnaire will be sent out to those reporting early stages of parosmia as a result of&#xD;
      post-viral infection, including post-COVID-19 infection. The questionnaire will record&#xD;
      demographic data and ask about COVID-19 status, COVID-19 diagnosis and results of COVID-19&#xD;
      tests. It will ask about loss of smell, taste and chemesthesis (irritation from the heat of&#xD;
      spices) and it will ask about the sequence of events leading to parosmia. Up to 15 everyday&#xD;
      items will be rated for aroma description, intensity and valence. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to list other distorted foods, and also smells that returned undistorted. The questionnaire&#xD;
      will be fully anonymous (unlinked anonymous) and voluntary. The questionnaire will be&#xD;
      designed, distributed and data collected using the secure platform provided by Compusense.&#xD;

        Study population will be drawn from those currently suffering from parosmia only.&#xD;
        Participants will initially be recruited from the AbScent membership which has a high&#xD;
        proportion of UK and US members, but it will be rolled out internationally via ENT&#xD;
        consultants.&#xD;
