  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a drug utilization study (DUS) using cross-sectional database analysis of&#xD;
      participants who are prescribed lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for treatment of BED. The study&#xD;
      will combine data from two sources of patient-level drug utilization data for&#xD;
      lisdexamfetamine dimesylate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NostraData database: Longitudinal participant level prescription dispensing database&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician survey: De-identified participant data provided by representative&#xD;
           psychiatrists and other physicians expected to treat participants with BED in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the NostraData database, actual drug dispensing data are collected, which allows for the&#xD;
      generation of information on actual drug usage. However, these data do not contain certain&#xD;
      participant variables, such as age and indication, needed to monitor potential off-label use.&#xD;
      Therefore, these data must be supplemented with another data source. The physician survey&#xD;
      will provide the data not included in the NostraData database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DUS will enroll approximately 150 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This DUS will be conducted in Australia. The overall time for data collection in the study&#xD;
      will be approximately 36 months after the launch date of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate.&#xD;
