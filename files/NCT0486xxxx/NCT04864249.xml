  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a single center, randomized controlled trial testing the&#xD;
      impact of a neonatal sleep intervention, the SNOO, on reducing maternal blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      in the postpartum period in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The SNOO is a&#xD;
      responsive bassinet designed to automatically calm and consolidate infants by responding to&#xD;
      their cries. Use of the SNOO has been demonstrated to improve infant sleep by 1-2 hours&#xD;
      nightly, thus increasing maternal sleep time. The investigators plan for 100 women with&#xD;
      pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia to be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      either receive and use the SNOO responsive bassinet for their infants, or to receive the&#xD;
      usual care of safe sleep education. Women will be followed longitudinally through 6 months&#xD;
      postpartum with serial BPs, weights, mood assessments, and subjective and objective sleep&#xD;
      assessments. The investigators hypothesize that for women with pregnancies complicated by&#xD;
      gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, that poor maternal sleep quality contributes to&#xD;
      increased BP in the postpartum period. The investigators further propose that compared to&#xD;
      usual care (safe sleep education), an intervention targeted to improve neonatal sleep (the&#xD;
      SNOO), and thus maternal sleep, will improve postpartum BP for these women.&#xD;

    <description>The SNOO is a commercially available device which is a responsive bassinet for neonates. The bassinet is designed to respond to the infant's cries and automatically respond by emitting engineered white noise sounds and providing a rhythmic rocking motion. The infant is also swaddled to remain securely back-down. The SNOO automatically increases the emitted sound and motion if the infant is still crying. However, if the infant does not settle within 3 minutes, the SNOO will shut off and alert the adults for additional assistance. Parents can also modify the SNOO settings to meet the baby's need for sound and/or motion.</description>
