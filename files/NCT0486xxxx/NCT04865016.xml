  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The innovations in phacoemulsification surgery and advances in surgical equipment ensure a&#xD;
      safe extraction of the crystalline lens and implantation of intraocular lenses (IOL). As a&#xD;
      result of developing intraocular lens technologies and changing patient demands, many&#xD;
      multifocal, accommodative, toric, toric-multifocal, and extended depth of focus (EDOF) IOLs&#xD;
      have been introduced and the original aim of restoration of far vision with implanted&#xD;
      monocular IOLs has been evolved to an objective of improved vision at different distances&#xD;
      with total spectacle independence. This study aimed to compare the visual acuity at different&#xD;
      distances, contrast sensitivity, spectacle needs, photic phenomena, and quality of life&#xD;
      parameters of patients bilaterally implanted with a low add bifocal (Tecnis ZKB00) or an EDOF&#xD;
      IOL (Tecnis Symfony), both with planned mini-monovision to improve near vision.&#xD;

    <description>monocular and binocular uncorrected and corrected distance (UDVA, CDVA; at 6 m), intermediate (UIVA, CIVA; at 60 cm), and near (UNVA, CNVA; at 40 cm) logMAR visual acuity were assessed with electronic shelled chart.Distance visual acuity was measured with LCD screen version (CSO Vision Chart, Mod CVC02, version 1.3.0, Florence, Italy) of Snellen Charts under photopic conditions (85 cd/m2). Intermediate and near visual acuities were measured and recorded with a Turkish reading chart prepared with reference to Bailey-Lovie and ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) reading charts covering international standards.13 The logMAR values of the chart designed for 35 cm distance were corrected with the formula &quot;log10(standard distance/new distance [cm])&quot; according to the distance used (40 and 60 cm).</description>

    <measure>The contrast sensitivity (CS),</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast sensitivity (CS) was evaluated at 3, 6, 12 and 18 cycle per degree (cpd) spatial frequencies with CSV-1000 E test (VectorVision, Ohio, USA) under mesopic (3.5 candela [cd]/m2) conditions at 2.5 m with distance refractive correction. The test was conducted with and without glare, and as a glare source, two halogen lamps located either side of the test chart and producing 2.5 cd/m2 luminance at eye plane were used. CS at different spatial frequencies was compared with the physiologic CS range for normal subjects of similar age. CS was also evaluated with the LCD screen version (CSO Vision Chart, Mod CVC02, version 1.3.0, Florence, Italy) of Pelli-Robson Test (PRT) under photopic (85 cd/m2) and mesopic (3.5 cd/m2) conditions at 3 m monocularly with distance refractive correction. To the best of our knowledge, PRT CS normal values, performed under similar conditions, are not available in the literature, so the data was used only for intergroup comparisons.</description>
