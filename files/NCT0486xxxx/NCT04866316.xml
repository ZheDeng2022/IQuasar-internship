  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Frailty is increasing in prevalence internationally with population ageing.&#xD;
      Frailty can be managed or even reversed through community-based interventions delivered by a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team of professionals, but to varying degrees of effectiveness. However,&#xD;
      many of the implementation insights of these care models are contextual, and may not be&#xD;
      applicable in different cultural contexts. The Geriatric Service Hub (GSH) is a novel frailty&#xD;
      care programme in Singapore, that includes key components of frailty care such as&#xD;
      comprehensive geriatric assessments, care coordination and the assembly of a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team. The aim of this study is to gain insights on the factors influencing&#xD;
      the implementation approaches adopted by five participating sites, and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will adopt a mixed-methods approach that includes a qualitative evaluation among&#xD;
      key stakeholders and participants taking part in the programme, through in depth-interviews&#xD;
      and focus group discussions. The main topics covered includes factors that affected the&#xD;
      development and implementation of each programme, operations and other contextual factors&#xD;
      that influenced implementation outcomes. The quantitative evaluation (1) monitors each&#xD;
      programme's care process through quality indicators, (2) a multiple-time point survey study&#xD;
      to compare programme participants' pre- and post- outcomes on patient engagement (collaboRATE&#xD;
      and 13-item Patient Activation Measure;PAM), healthcare experiences (Consumer Assessment of&#xD;
      Healthcare Providers and System Clinician and Group Survey Version 3.0; CG-CAHPS), health&#xD;
      status and quality of life (Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living, fall counts, the&#xD;
      EuroQol questionnaire and the Control, Autonomy, Self-realization and Pleasure scale;&#xD;
      CASP-19), impact on caregivers (Zarit Burden Interview) and societal costs (Client Service&#xD;
      Receipt Inventory). (3) A retrospective cohort design to assess healthcare and cost&#xD;
      utilisation between participants of the programme and a propensity score matched comparator&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The GSH sites share a common goal to increasing accessibility of essential&#xD;
      services to frail older adults, and providing comprehensive care. The results of this&#xD;
      evaluation study will provide valuable evidence to the impact and effectiveness of the GSH,&#xD;
      and inform to the design of similar programmes targeting frail older adults.&#xD;

    <description>It is hypothesised that better functional status, might reduce the healthcare utilisation (emergency hospitalisation, nursing home admission), caregiver burden and the associated indirect cost. In turn, we might expect overall costs to be lower compared to the comparison group.&#xD;
Changes in functional status will be measured using the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Count of falls questionnaire.</description>

    <description>GSH sites offer a range of medical, social and other services through either direct provision or referrals. Given that the model is intended to bridge service gaps (conduct of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment/ CGA in the community), in the short-term, we hypothesis an increase in the utilisation of appropriate services (rehabilitation, ambulatory services) in this time-limited programme.&#xD;
Utilisation of services will be measured using Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI).</description>

    <description>GSH participants are expected to benefit from the comprehensive package of health and social services and multidisciplinary team approach. With better care coordination and improved access, it is likely to elicit a higher level of satisfaction relative to comparator groups.&#xD;
Patient satisfaction will be measured using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and System Clinician &amp; Group Survey Version 3.0 (CG-CAHPS) tool.</description>
