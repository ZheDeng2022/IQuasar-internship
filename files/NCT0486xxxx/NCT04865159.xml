      A Phase I, single center, open-label clinical pharmacology study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of tipifarnib on cardiac repolarization (corrected QT interval [QTc] duration)&#xD;
      following a single dose of 900 mg and after repeated twice daily administration of 600 mg in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid malignancies. Subjects will receive a 900 mg single dose at&#xD;
      cycle 1 day 1 follow by 600 mg twice a day orally with a meal (Days 2-7 and 15-21) in 28-day&#xD;
      cycles. Beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 1, subjects will self-administer 600 mg tipifarnib,&#xD;
      orally with a meal, bid for 7 days in alternating weeks (Days 2-7 and 15-21) in 28-day&#xD;
      cycles. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and PK of tipifarnib. Series of&#xD;
      PK will be collected on day -1 of Cycle 1, Cycle 1 day 1 and Cycle 1 day 7.&#xD;

      Phase I study will evaluate the effect of tipifarnib on cardiac repolarization (corrected QT&#xD;
      interval [QTc] duration) following a single dose of 900 mg and after repeated twice daily&#xD;
      administration of 600 mg in subjects with advanced solid malignancies. The study will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 20 subjects with advanced solid malignancies (at least 8, but no more than 12,&#xD;
      male subjects). Subjects must have no approved/appropriate therapeutic options available.&#xD;
      Subject will undergo series of ECG at Cycle 1 day -1 follow by study drug dosing, series of&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic and ECG at Cycle 1 day 1 and Cycle 1 day 7. Beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 1,&#xD;
      subjects will self-administer 600 mg tipifarnib, orally with a meal, bid for 7 days in&#xD;
      alternating weeks (Days 2-7 and 15-21) in 28-day cycles. For Cycle 2 and beyond, subjects&#xD;
      will self-administer 600 mg bid on Days 1-7 and Days 15-21 in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
