      The National Cancer Institute estimated 625 thousand new cases of cancer (excluding cases of&#xD;
      non-melanoma skin cancer) in Brazil for each year between 2020-2022. In 2018, there were 2.1&#xD;
      million new cases of breast cancer in the world, being the first in the ranking of cancers in&#xD;
      women. Practices in healthy eating and exercise can protect and / or decrease the risk of&#xD;
      breast cancer and improve treatment results. Breast cancer treatments cause cardiovascular&#xD;
      changes due to age-related factors, pre-existing chronic diseases and comorbidities such as&#xD;
      obesity, smoking and dyslipidemia. Obesity is associated with the development of several&#xD;
      types of cancer, including breast cancer. Therapies for breast cancer have a strong&#xD;
      association with impaired cardiac function, ranging from permanent, transient cardiotoxic&#xD;
      effects and changes in lipid metabolism. In addition to the cardiotoxic effects, the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of cancer and treatment favor the appearance of muscle changes, such as&#xD;
      sarcopenia. There is sufficient evidence to support that exercise improves fitness before,&#xD;
      during and after the completion of cancer treatment. Pre-qualification in cancer treatment is&#xD;
      an opportunity to increase physiological reserves before neoadjuvant therapies or surgery,&#xD;
      with the intention of improving results and accelerating recovery. It can be composed of&#xD;
      physical exercises, nutritional interventions, and psychosocial. Excess weight or depletion&#xD;
      are factors that negatively influence surgical and cancer outcomes. In view of the evidence,&#xD;
      the aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of physical exercise in a surgical&#xD;
      pre-habilitation program for women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing cancer treatment&#xD;
      with a curative therapeutic proposal at the National Cancer Institute in Rio de Janeiro. This&#xD;
      is a randomized clinical trial, where patients will be randomly allocated to the Intervention&#xD;
      Group and the Control Group. The patients in the intervention group will be instructed to&#xD;
      practice physical exercises at home until the date of surgery and those in the control group&#xD;
      will only be instructed to maintain their usual activities. All patients will be guided&#xD;
      individually by a nutritionist with a view to a healthier nutritional status and control of&#xD;
      comorbidities.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The National Cancer Institute estimated 625 thousand new cases of cancer&#xD;
      (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer cases) in Brazil for each year between 2020-2022, In&#xD;
      2018, 2.1 million new cases of breast cancer occurred in the world , equivalent to 11.6% of&#xD;
      all estimated cancers, being the first in the ranking of cancers for females. Among the&#xD;
      environmental and behavioral risk factors for breast cancer, alcohol consumption, excess body&#xD;
      weight and physical inactivity, are some of the modifiable factors. Obesity, as a risk factor&#xD;
      for breast cancer, makes many women obese when diagnosed and when starting treatment.&#xD;
      Adhering to healthy eating and exercise can protect and / or decrease the risk of breast&#xD;
      cancer, in addition to improving results during and after the active phase of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the diagnosis of the disease and evaluation of its stage, the treatment can be defined&#xD;
      as neoadjuvant or adjuvant; systemic or regional locus. Breast cancer treatments cause&#xD;
      cardiovascular dysfunctions, which are due to age-related factors, pre-existing chronic&#xD;
      diseases, comorbidities such as smoking, dyslipidemia and obesity, in addition to cancer&#xD;
      treatment.Therapies for breast cancer have a strong association with impaired cardiac&#xD;
      function, from transient and reversible changes to permanent dysfunctions, as well as changes&#xD;
      in lipid metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiotoxic effects of cancer treatments can also affect vagal activity and, thus,&#xD;
      influence cardiac autonomic balance. In the long run, autonomic imbalance is associated with&#xD;
      an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, and in addition, the autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction that is common in many types of cancer leads to an increase in sympathetic tone&#xD;
      and a decrease in cardiac vagal tone. As a way of assessing autonomic activity and vagal&#xD;
      response, measures of heart rate variability (HRV) have been adopted. A reduction in&#xD;
      parasympathetic modulation and HRV indices was observed in women with breast cancer who&#xD;
      underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal therapy after one year of treatment.&#xD;
      Physical training, which already has satisfactory results in cancer patients in relation to&#xD;
      quality of life related to health, functionality and other aspects, also showed benefits in&#xD;
      the autonomic modulation of patients with breast cancer. In non-cancer patients, exercise&#xD;
      interventions show improvements in the modulation of autonomic function, minimizing&#xD;
      cardiovascular problems and reducing mortality after episodes of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the cardiotoxic effects, cancer treatment favors the appearance of muscle&#xD;
      changes. A systematic review with 754 women with breast cancer showed sarcopenia as a risk&#xD;
      factor for mortality in 68% of patients. Not only the pathophysiology of cancer, but also&#xD;
      drugs used for its treatment contribute to the loss of muscle mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research indicates that physical exercise can mitigate the declines induced by cancer&#xD;
      treatment. There is sufficient evidence to support that exercise improves fitness before,&#xD;
      during and after treatment is completed. A cardiovascular rehabilitation program based on&#xD;
      education and behavioral counseling offers a modification of cardiac risk, increases&#xD;
      functional capacity, ensures monitoring of the patient's functional status, improves&#xD;
      psychosocial well-being and can reduce recurrent hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home rehabilitation can be an alternative for patients with moderate cardiac risk,&#xD;
      self-monitoring capacity and with difficulties to attend due to social or displacement&#xD;
      reasons. Considering the profile of the user of the Unified Health System, interventions at&#xD;
      home and in the community seem to be the best way, together with telephone contacts for&#xD;
      questions and / or guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-qualification in cancer treatment is an opportunity to increase physiological reserves&#xD;
      even before neoadjuvant therapies or surgery, with the intention of improving results and&#xD;
      accelerating recovery. May consist of physical exercises, nutritional and psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing the nutritional profile of patients is of great importance considering the negative&#xD;
      impact of an impaired nutritional status on postoperative outcomes. Excess weight or&#xD;
      depletion has been reported as a factor that negatively influences surgical and cancer&#xD;
      outcomes. The identification of patients at nutritional risk and probable sarcopenia will&#xD;
      define an early nutritional orientation through an individualized diet with a focus on&#xD;
      improving body composition, glycemic control, since preoperative glycemic control is&#xD;
      associated with a lower incidence of infectious complications; and management of symptoms&#xD;
      related to cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined with treatment, behavioral counseling is effective in motivating changes in&#xD;
      lifestyle, which are part of the modifiable risk factors for breast cancer. Thinking about&#xD;
      the risks that accompany the diagnosis of breast cancer, a rehabilitation focused on treating&#xD;
      current disorders and anticipating future complications are the first steps to improve the&#xD;
      results of care and reduce costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS Main goal To evaluate the effectiveness of physical exercise in a surgical&#xD;
      pre-habilitation program for women diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent cancer&#xD;
      treatment with a curative therapeutic proposal at the Cancer Hospital III of the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the study population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the rate of adherence to physical exercise and associated factors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in functional and cardiopulmonary capacity, fatigue, health-related&#xD;
           quality of life, level of physical activity, cardiac autonomic modulation and sarcopenia&#xD;
           in women diagnosed with breast cancer, before and after surgical treatment and&#xD;
           throughout the follow-up periods. according to the intervention group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the nutritional status and body composition in the inclusion of patients in the&#xD;
           study and before surgical treatment in all participating women;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify the association between regular physical exercise before surgical treatment&#xD;
           and functional and cardiopulmonary capacity, fatigue, level of physical activity,&#xD;
           health-related quality of life, cardiac autonomic modulation and sarcopenia in&#xD;
           comparison with the control group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the perception of patients regarding the performance of pre-habilitation&#xD;
           exercises;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the behavioral change in the practice of physical exercises after the&#xD;
           surgical treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE For the calculation of the sample size, the incidence of complications (outcomes)&#xD;
      was considered to be 10% in the intervention group and 30% in the control group, with an&#xD;
      alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20 and a power of 80%. Based on these parameters, it&#xD;
      will be necessary to include 62 patients in each group. However, due to the evaluation of&#xD;
      different outcomes and the lack of data on the incidence of complications in this population,&#xD;
      all eligible patients will be included in the study inclusion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOSS CONTROL Losses related to change, lack of information and abandonment will represent a&#xD;
      small number, as patients remain on cancer treatment for approximately 5 years at the&#xD;
      institution. The non-recoverable losses will have data collected from the medical records to&#xD;
      be compared with the patients who completed the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS The data will be analyzed by intention to treat. The descriptive analysis will&#xD;
      be performed by measures of central tendency and dispersion (quantitative variables) and&#xD;
      distribution of absolute and relative frequency (qualitative variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the normal distribution of outcomes and quantitative control variables, the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess changes between groups in the pre- and / or post-intervention stages, the mean&#xD;
      values will be compared by the t-student test or Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric&#xD;
      distribution). When analyzing the pre-verus comparison after intra-group intervention, the&#xD;
      paired t-student test will be considered. For all analyzes, p-value less than 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the linearity between the outcome and the quantitative adjustment variables, the&#xD;
      dispersion diagram will be performed. Quantitative independent variables that do not have a&#xD;
      normal distribution will be categorized. To test the collinearity of the categorical&#xD;
      independent variables, Pearson's correlation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the association between the intervention groups and the quantitative outcomes, the&#xD;
      differences between the means will be calculated and tested by analysis of variance,&#xD;
      considering a value of p &lt;0.20. Multiple linear regression will be performed using the enter&#xD;
      method (stepwise forward), considering the 95% confidence interval. Homoscedasticity and&#xD;
      possible biases of the model will be analyzed through residual analysis and all assumptions&#xD;
      will be observed. To identify the explanatory power of the model, the determination&#xD;
      coefficient will be performed. The association between intervention groups and categorical&#xD;
      outcomes will be performed by univariate analysis, using the odds ratio (OR), assuming 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (95% CI). Associations with clinical and statistical significance in the&#xD;
      univariate analysis (considering p &lt;0, ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS This study was submitted to&#xD;
      the Research Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Institute (CEP / INCA), under CAAE&#xD;
      42627521.6.0000.5274, and approved as per opinion 4.576.731. At the time of recruitment,&#xD;
      women will be instructed on the objectives of the study and those who agree to participate&#xD;
      will sign the Free and Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK AND BENEFITS Performing physical assessments will not pose any health risks to patients.&#xD;
      The practice of unsupervised physical exercises is safe for people without any chronic health&#xD;
      impairment, as already mentioned in the exclusion criteria. To reduce the risks, patients&#xD;
      will be instructed on the level of effort during the practice and on signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      decompensation, being instructed to contact the researcher, if necessary.Despite the small&#xD;
      risk, palpitation, excessive sweating, dizziness and shortness of breath may occur when&#xD;
      exercising at home. If this occurs, patients will be instructed to end the exercise and&#xD;
      contact the research team.. The study population will benefit indirectly through the results,&#xD;
      which will analyze the effectiveness of the pre-habilitation program in improving functional&#xD;
      capacity, fatigue, health-related quality of life, level of physical activity and autonomic&#xD;
      modulation of women undergoing treatment for breast cancer, making it possible to plan&#xD;
      actions to control complications.The intervention group, which will perform home physical&#xD;
      exercises according to the guidelines, will benefit from the effects of physical exercise on&#xD;
      physical and emotional well-being. When adhering to a healthy habit, physical conditioning,&#xD;
      mental health and health-related quality of life improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINANCING This research will not impose any burden on the institution, since patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated on the day they attend their routine consultations and other information will be&#xD;
      collected from the physical and / or electronic medical record. The rest of the materials&#xD;
      will be paid for by the researchers responsible.&#xD;
