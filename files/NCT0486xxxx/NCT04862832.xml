      This is a randomized, 3-days study with the objective to compare the modulation of pain from&#xD;
      our musical intervention to the CPT-induced analgesia and silence. The mean pain felt before&#xD;
      and after CPT, the silence, and at three times points for the music conditions, 2.20 minutes,&#xD;
      11.30 minutes and 20 minutes, will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous data, the sample size has been estimated, and 30 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will undergo four conditions: CPT, silence, Most-Liked Music (MLM) and Least-Liked&#xD;
      Music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The music used will be Music Care, a personalized musical intervention used in clinical&#xD;
      settings. It has a U shape in six sections that each have different tempi, number of&#xD;
      instruments and volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two music conditions: the most-liked-music (MLM) and least-liked-music (LLM)&#xD;
      conditions. The sequence rated the highest will be listened to during the MLM and the one&#xD;
      rated the lowest will be listened during the LLM condition. MLM will be considered as a score&#xD;
      between 7 and 10 on the preference scale. LLM will be considered as a score between 0 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cold pressor test will consist in the immersion of the participants' arm in 10 degrees&#xD;
      circulating water for two minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The silence condition will consist of six minutes in which the participants stay seated on&#xD;
      the examination chair without access to their phones or other provided distractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three testing days for each participants. They will be seated in a comfortable&#xD;
      chair in a quiet room. The first day, before the pain tests started, consent form will be&#xD;
      read and signed by the participants. After, the MLM and LLM will be determined. Then, the&#xD;
      sociodemographic questionnaire, the two State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) subscales, Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI) and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) will be administered.&#xD;
      Finally, a first two minutes pain test will be performed (T1), the CPT and a second pain test&#xD;
      (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second and third day will consist of first the STAI, the state subscale, the silence&#xD;
      condition and then one music condition. The order of music condition will be randomized. The&#xD;
      silence condition will consist of a first pain test (T3 or T8), six minutes of silence and&#xD;
      then a second pain test (T4 or T9). Those 6 minutes will be chosen in order to equal the&#xD;
      duration between the end of the first pain test and the start of the second one of the music&#xD;
      intervention condition. In fact, for the music condition, whether it's the MLM or LLM, the&#xD;
      first pain tests will be performed at 2.20 minutes after the music started (T5 or T10). The&#xD;
      second will be after the relaxation phase at 11.30 minutes (T6 or T11) and the third after&#xD;
      the whole 20-minutes cycle (T6 or T12). A post music condition score of the MLM and LLM on&#xD;
      the same preference scale as the selection will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be described using mean, standard deviation, median, extreme values&#xD;
      (minimum and maximum) and the number of missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be described by their distributions in terms of numbers and percentages&#xD;
      by class as well as the number of missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality condition will be verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Quantitative variables&#xD;
      will be compared by the paired Student test if conditions were checked or by the&#xD;
      non-parametric test of the signed Wilcoxon ranks, as part of the comparison of 2 modalities.&#xD;
      The quantitative variables will be compared between the 3 conditions using a repeated-measure&#xD;
      ANOVA or Friedman test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests will be bilateral, with a threshold of 5%.&#xD;

      Background: Music is used as a management technique for pain in multiple clinical settings.&#xD;
      Music-induced analgesia (MIA) seems to be using the endogenous descending pain modulatory&#xD;
      system. This latter is demonstrated by the The Cold Pressor Test (CPT), used here alongside&#xD;
      silence as a control condition for MIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a randomized, 3-days study with the objective to compare the modulation&#xD;
      of pain from our musical intervention to the CPT-induced analgesia and silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this study will be to compare the modulation of pain from our&#xD;
      musical intervention to the CPT-induced analgesia and silence. In addition, the difference in&#xD;
      pain modulation from the most-liked music and least-liked music conditions will be evaluated.&#xD;
      It is predicted that most liked music will reduce pain perception in a similar fashion than&#xD;
      the CPT and more than the least liked music and silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean pain felt before and after CPT, the silence, and at three times points for the music&#xD;
      conditions, 2.20 minutes, 11.30 minutes and 20 minutes, will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Based on previous data, the sample size has been estimated, and 30 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Each participant will undergo four conditions: CPT, silence, Most-Liked Music&#xD;
      (MLM) and Least-Liked Music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The music used will be Music Care, a personalized musical intervention used in clinical&#xD;

      There will be two music conditions: the most-liked-music (MLM) and least-liked-music (LLM)&#xD;
      conditions. The sequence rated the highest will be listened to during the MLM and the one&#xD;
      rated the lowest will be listened during the LLM condition. MLM will be considered as a score&#xD;
      between 7 and 10 on the preference scale. LLM will be considered as a score between 0 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cold pressor test will consist in the immersion of the participants' arm in 10 degrees&#xD;
      circulating water for two minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The silence condition will consist of six minutes in which the participants stay seated on&#xD;
      the examination chair without access to their phones or other provided distractions.&#xD;

      the whole 20-minutes cycle (T6 or T12). A post music condition score of the MLM and LLM on&#xD;
      the same preference scale as the selection will be administered.&#xD;

      median, extreme values (minimum and maximum) and the number of missing data.&#xD;
