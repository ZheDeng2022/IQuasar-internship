      Rationale: Glioblastoma (GM) is the most frequent incurable adult brain tumor with median&#xD;
      survival of 15 months after diagnosis, despite extensive treatment with surgery, radiation&#xD;
      therapy and chemotherapy. Tumor recurrence is inevitable after which life prolonging&#xD;
      therapies are no longer available. The development of new treatments for GM is being hampered&#xD;
      by inter-and intratumoral heterogeneity of tumors and their microenvironment, which currently&#xD;
      cannot be predicted accurately with current diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish primary patient derived organoid cultures from GM to study mechanisms&#xD;
      that contribute to aggressive tumor growth and treatment resistance in primary and recurrent&#xD;
      GM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Preclinical study, using patient derived glioblastoma tissue. Study population:&#xD;
      Patients 18 years or older, with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Intra-and inter organoid genetic and epigenetic&#xD;
      heterogeneity that is representative for GM. Nature and extent of the burden and risks&#xD;
      associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Minimal burden, since the&#xD;
      biopsies are part of a regular neurosurgical procedure (debulking); which intends to&#xD;
      eradicate the macroscopical tumorload in order to optimize survival benefit. The tissue&#xD;
      (biopsy) that will be used for this trial is part of the tumor tissue that is resected during&#xD;
      the standard debulking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit: no benefit for the patient.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with glioblastoma (GM) have a median overall survival of approximately 15&#xD;
      months.Standard therapy for GM encompasses maximum surgical resection followed by radiation&#xD;
      and chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ) (1). Regardless of initial tumor response, tumor&#xD;
      recurrence is inevitable, after which survival drops to less than 6 months. GM tailored&#xD;
      approaches targeting oncogenes that might drive the growth of the bulk of primary tumors,&#xD;
      have been unsuccessful so far in clinical trials(2), creating a large unmet need warranting&#xD;
      new approaches to overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to current treatment schedules.&#xD;
      The objective of this research is to establish primary patient derived organoid cultures from&#xD;
      GM to study mechanisms that contribute to aggressive tumor growth and treatment resistance in&#xD;
      primary and recurrent GM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inter-and intratumoral heterogeneity in glioblastoma. Tumor tailored approaches for GM&#xD;
           are being hampered by inter-and intratumoral heterogeneity of both microenvironment and&#xD;
           genomic alterations in GM cells. It has been shown that tumors are composed of multiple&#xD;
           clones harboring distinct genetic alterations (3-7). The clonal evolution model posits&#xD;
           that tumor formation is initiated in a cell of origin and is followed by the subsequent&#xD;
           accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, leading to tumor cell&#xD;
           survival and growth advantage (8). Divergent genetic alterations in early transformed&#xD;
           cells give rise to a variety of clones under the selective pressure of the tumor&#xD;
           microenvironment (3-7). An important microenvironmental stressor is intratumoral&#xD;
           hypoxia, which is frequent in GM and a negative prognostic and predictive factor&#xD;
           associated with reduced survival (9,10).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Emerging evidence implicates a subpopulation of tumor cells with characteristics of&#xD;
           normal stem cells so-called glioma stem cells (GSC) in intrinsic and acquired treatment&#xD;
           resistance. GSC are endowed with specific properties including high tumor initiating&#xD;
           ability, unlimited self-renewal potential and capacity for multipotent differentiation,&#xD;
           generating a diverse progeny(11). GSC are marked by common stem cell markers including&#xD;
           CD133+, SOX2, Olig1, and have been shown to reside in the perivascular region as well as&#xD;
           in hypoxic areas. GSC are expanded under hypoxia12depend on glycolysis (13,14).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Combined with their low proliferation, increased DNA repair, high anti-oxidant activity&#xD;
           and among others, make GCS more resistant to conventional treatments (radiation and&#xD;
           temozolomide) then non-GSC (15,16) {Jamal, 2012 #52}.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This implies that GSCs form an important driver of GM recurrence after chemoradiation.&#xD;
           There are currently no effective treatments to eliminate glioma stem cells. Blocking&#xD;
           hypoxia signalling in tumors (inhibiting self-renewal and survival of GSC cells)(12,17)&#xD;
           and blocking the NOTCH stem cell pathway (rendering GSCs sensitive to radiation(18) and&#xD;
           TMZ(19-21)), seem to promising but drugs interfering with these pathways have not passed&#xD;
           beyond early phase clinical trials yet(22).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current standard of care of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is multimodal and consists of&#xD;
           surgery, radiation therapy and TMZ, an alkylating agent modifying purine bases of DNA&#xD;
           (O6-guanine; N7-guanine and N3-adenine). The addition of TMZ to radiotherapy has&#xD;
           increased the overall survival of GM patients significantly, but only up to 14.6&#xD;
           months(1). Intratumoral hypoxia has been shown to decrease therapeutic efficacy of RT&#xD;
           and chemotherapy(23). Hypoxic GM cells are genetically unstable and show increased MGMT&#xD;
           expression and thereby resistance to alkylating TMZ chemotherapy(24).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In non-GSCs, MGMT promoter methylation is a predictive marker for response to TMZ&#xD;
           treatment(25,26). However the interpretation of the MGMT methylation assay is complex,&#xD;
           since the extent of MGMT promoter methylation in GM is heterogeneous and the level of&#xD;
           heterogeneity is underestimated, since only GM biopsies or fragmented GM tissue is being&#xD;
           analysed(27,28). Importantly, MGMT is also expressed in the normal brain endothelial&#xD;
           cells and in immune cells including tumor infiltrating cells(29). Thus depending on the&#xD;
           extent of normal tissue contamination in GM biopsies the level MGMT methylation may also&#xD;
           differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since intra-tumoral heterogeneity in MGMT expression cannot be objectivated using&#xD;
           currently available diagnostics and since undertreatment of patients should be prevented&#xD;
           at all times, at present most patients diagnosed with ´de novo´ GM, receive TMZ;&#xD;
           although there seems to be little benefit of TMZ in GMs with MGMT unmethylated glioma&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Designing new treatment protocols for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is quite complex,&#xD;
           since diagnostic tools, predicting inter-and intra-GM heterogeneity of MGMT promoter&#xD;
           methylation status (or level of MGMT expression), are lacking. Additionally, the level&#xD;
           of MGMT expression, needed for significant TMZ response and improvement of clinical&#xD;
           outcome, is not known. Thus since most GMs are defined by both MGMT methylated and MGMT&#xD;
           unmethylated tumor clones, combining TMZ with drugs that target non-methylated glioma&#xD;
           cells/glioma stem cells and/or microenvironment might be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glioblastoma recurrence Even if a macroscopically complete resection of a GM can be&#xD;
           achieved, tumor cells remain at the resection site. It has been shown that GM cells have&#xD;
           a high capacity for dissemination. Invading tumor cells escape at the periphery of the&#xD;
           tumor mass and diffusely infiltrate the normal brain parenchyma. Deeply infiltrated&#xD;
           tumor cells are more likely to escape surgery and what is not known is whether&#xD;
           infiltration is a property of a more resilient cell population that initiates and drives&#xD;
           tumor recurrence. Even after postoperative chemotherapy and radiation outside of the&#xD;
           field of surgery to reduce infiltrative tumor cells, almost all GM recur, mostly around&#xD;
           the resection cavity. If a gross total resection cannot be performed; primary radiation&#xD;
           therapy and chemotherapy are also able to reduce clonal diversity, but are thus&#xD;
           insufficient to prevent recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This implies that tumor cells resistant to multiple therapies persist in the brain parenchyma&#xD;
      around the tumor cavity after gross total resection or in the remaining tumor after&#xD;
      chemoradiation which are responsible for tumor repopulation, making them a critical target to&#xD;
      overcome tumor recurrence. Genomic analysis of GM has shown that dominant clones in recurrent&#xD;
      tumors are composed of clones representative of the primary tumor as well as new clones with&#xD;
      little resemblance to the original tumor(3,30,31,32,33). Consequently targets identified&#xD;
      based on the analysis of the primary tumor may not be informative to identify the best&#xD;
      molecular targets to prevent recurrence(5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After failure of first line GM treatment (radiation, TMZ), recurrence seems to be accompanied&#xD;
      with a phenotypic shift of GSCs to the mesenchymal (MES) subtype (loss of CD133; gain of&#xD;
      BMI1, SOX2 and CD44)(34-38). Such cells are more aggressive, invasive and angiogenic than&#xD;
      primary tumor derived GSCs, mostly the proneural (PN) subtype (CD133+, CD15+)(39-41). MES GSC&#xD;
      also show a higher expression of the inflammasome genes, such as IL6, IL8, IL1B1C and CXCL2,&#xD;
      reinforcing the notion that interplay with the microenvironment and plays an important role&#xD;
      in recurrence and progression(42,43). GM specific clinical trials are being developed, using&#xD;
      immune modulators. It has been shown that MSH (mutS homologue) mutations correlate with TMZ&#xD;
      resistance, as they are neither found in pre-treatment GM nor radiotherapy post-treatment GM,&#xD;
      but were detected in approximately half of recurrent GM patients treated with TMZ and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. This strongly indicates that MSH6 alterations are associated with resistance to&#xD;
      alkylating agent therapy. Thus GM patients who initially respond to TMZ may acquire MMR&#xD;
      defective hypermutator phenotype(44-46). It is well established that an intact mismatch&#xD;
      repair and base excision repair (BER) contribute to effective TMZ cytotoxicity.&#xD;
      Pharmacological inhibition of BER using PARP inhibitors either alone or in combination with&#xD;
      TMZ has shown promise in clinical trials. However, acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors is&#xD;
      observed through up-regulation of base excision repair and homologous recombination repair to&#xD;
      compensate for diminished BER (47,48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, understanding the therapy induced genetic and epigenetic alterations of the&#xD;
      remaining tumor cells and GSCs and also the impact of standard of care to the&#xD;
      microenvironment /niche, in which recurrence occurs, will guide the development of new&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project we will use patient derived glioma stem cell organoids(49), mimicking de novo&#xD;
      GM and its intratumoral heterogeneity. Also these patient-derived organoids (PDO) organoids&#xD;
      will be used to study acquired temozolomide resistance and thus can be used for identifying&#xD;
      novel targeted agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor cell heterogeneity in MGMT expression and its relevance for TMZ response will also be&#xD;
      addressed using these organoids, using single cell proteomics and IHC for MGMT, GSC markers&#xD;
      and exome sequencing (for common driver mutations) to identify those populations that&#xD;
      clonally expand under TMZ (RT) selection and those that disappear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another interesting feature we will explore using PDO is the possibility to analyze the&#xD;
      supernatants for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or exosomes (secreted vesicles which contain&#xD;
      RNA, small non-coding RNA, proteins as well as DNA) before during after acquired TMZ&#xD;
      resistance which might lead to the identification of pharmacological response and predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers. Such biomarkers 'liquid biopsy' may become useful to measure treatment response&#xD;
      in blood or lumbar fluid of GM patients and enable dose-modification (escalation or&#xD;
      deintensification or termination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the PDOs (costs of materials) will be funded (607061 PI M. Vooijs, MAASTRO&#xD;
      and KWF grant Alpe D'Huzes PI M.Vooijs, MAASTRO. There are no additional costs associated&#xD;
      with obtaining the tumor tissue.&#xD;
