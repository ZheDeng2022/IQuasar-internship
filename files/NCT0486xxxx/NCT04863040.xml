      Project which objective is a) to test the effectiveness, in preschool children, of an&#xD;
      integrated physical activity intervention in the classroom based on intervallic training&#xD;
      (MOVI-HIIT) on improving executive function, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and&#xD;
      b) to evaluate teachers' perceptions of barriers and facilitating elements for the&#xD;
      implementation and monitoring of MOVI-HIIT interventions in the classroom.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade, this research group has tested the effectiveness of five interventions in&#xD;
      school settings. The first one (MOVI) was carried out in children 8 to 11 years children (4th&#xD;
      and 5th year of primary education) and showed a moderate effect in reducing adiposity of&#xD;
      schoolchildren with higher body mass index (BMI), and an improvement of the lipid profile&#xD;
      without significantly improving the global cardiometabolic risk, because it did not produce a&#xD;
      reduction in insulinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second edition (MOVI-2), carried out with schoolchildren of the same age range, increased&#xD;
      the duration and intensity of the sessions, and was focused on the development of muscular&#xD;
      strength in order to improve insulinemia levels. The intervention proved to be effective; in&#xD;
      addition, data from this intervention showed a modest improvement in girls' aerobic capacity,&#xD;
      but not in boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third edition (MOVI-KIDS) was aimed at children aged 4 to 7 years to test the hypotheses&#xD;
      that vigorous physical activity at early ages could produce lifelong cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      benefits. This study show that, as in the case of the IDEFICS study in children of similar&#xD;
      age, the intervention was not effective in improving fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth edition (MOVI-da10!) was carried out at schoolchildren of the same age range, but&#xD;
      focusing on active breaks designs, and as a controlled cluster-randomized trial, to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a classroom-based physical activity intervention on improving, body&#xD;
      composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fifth edition (MOVI-daFit!) was carried out with 9 to 11 years schoolchildren, and&#xD;
      consisted in a standardized recreative, non-competitive, physical activity intervention based&#xD;
      on games adapted to high intensity interval training methodology (out of school hours, four&#xD;
      times by week, one hour session). The aim was to test the effectiveness of an extracurricular&#xD;
      physical activity intervention based on high intensity interval training (MOVI-daFit!) on&#xD;
      improving cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic risk, executive function, and academic&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from these last two editions are currently under process of publishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new edition (MOVI-HIIT) has been designed controlled cluster-randomized trial including&#xD;
      10 schools from Ciudad Real province, Spain. It will include two arms (one intervention and&#xD;
      one control arm), in which 5 schools will be randomly assigned to the group in which a&#xD;
      physical activity intervention will be performed (MOVI-HIIT), and another 5 schools to the&#xD;
      control group in which the usual tasks will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the MOVI-HIIT intervention, based on high intensity interval training integrated into&#xD;
      the classroom for children of 2nd and 3rd grade of preschool education of one year of&#xD;
      duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) will increase in the intervention group (IG) whose&#xD;
           values are below the 50th percentile for their age and sex compared to those with the&#xD;
           same condition in the control group (CG), with an effect size (standardized mean&#xD;
           difference) of 0.3 (moderate). This hypothesis will be used to calculate the sample size&#xD;
           in this proposal. Considering only half of schoolchildren with lower cardiorespiratory&#xD;
           fitness in IG and CG is due to the fact that VO2 max cannot be increased in trained&#xD;
           subjects, and it is possible to increase it very little (less than 2%) in those with&#xD;
           acceptable levels of aerobic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It will reduce the percentage of body fat in the IG versus the CG by 6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It will improve the executive function.&#xD;

    <description>The design of the MOVI-HIIT intervention is framed within the socio-ecological model of behavior modification, in such a way that it will be designed to intervene in the individual, family and school environment. It will have a duration of one school year and will consist of two 5-minute daily physical activity breaks based on intervallic training, five days a week.</description>

    <description>Each HIIT break will last approximately 5 minutes and will not require any specific materials. The structure of the HIIT-Rest will be as follows: 1' to describe the work to be done; 3' of work following the HIIT protocol: 6 repetitions of a functional movement such as squats, Jumping Jack or running on site for 10&quot; at high intensity (85-90% of HR max) followed by 20&quot; of recovery (65-75% of HR max); and 1' to perform a return to calm in order to lower the activation and prepare the student body to return to class activities. To increase the workload, and after evaluation of cardiorespiratory capacity, after 12 weeks of program, the HIIT protocol will be changed to 20&quot; of high intensity work alternating with 10&quot; of recovery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Schools in the province of Ciudad Real with at least one class (classroom) at each&#xD;
             level (2nd and 3rd of preschool education), and in which the School Board gives its&#xD;
             approval to the interventions and to the basal and final evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participating schoolchildren must belong to the 2nd and 3rd year of preschool&#xD;
             education, not have any malformation that prevents them from learning the Spanish&#xD;
             language (or Spanish sign language), not have any type of physical or mental disorder&#xD;
             that parents and/or teachers have identified that prevents the performance of physical&#xD;
             activities, not suffer from any chronic disease such as heart disease, diabetes or&#xD;
             asthma that, according to the criteria of their pediatrician - after analysis of the&#xD;
             program of activities - prevents their participation in them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As this is an intervention in the classroom, the school faculty will include the&#xD;
             active breaks proposed in the center's programming, for which reason the intervention&#xD;
             will be received by all the children in each IG school. However, we will consider&#xD;
             school participants to be those who have the consent of the parent or guardian for&#xD;
             participation in the study. In addition, schoolchildren must verbally express their&#xD;
             willingness to participate in the baseline and final physical examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with severe Spanish language learning difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with serious physical or mental disorders identified by parents or teachers&#xD;
             that would impede participation in the programme's activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children diagnoses of chronic disorders, such as heart disease, diabetes or asthma,&#xD;
             which in the opinion of their paediatricians would prevent their participation in the&#xD;
             programme's activities (MOVI-HIIT).&#xD;
