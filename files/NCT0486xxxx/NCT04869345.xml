  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic musculoskeletal condition characterized by&#xD;
      widespread pain and tenderness, and often accompanied by impaired physical functioning,&#xD;
      depressed mood, as well as deficits in positive affect (PA).Standard behavioral therapies&#xD;
      typically focus on minimizing negative thoughts and emotions associated with pain and yield&#xD;
      only modest treatment effects. Efforts are therefore needed to develop more effective&#xD;
      psychological treatments for chronic pain by identifying new targets for intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this Stage I randomized pilot trial are to evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and the impact of a previously developed online positive affect (PA) skills&#xD;
      intervention -LARKSPUR (Lessons in Affect Regulation to Keep Stress and Pain UndeR&#xD;
      control)-in a sample of Hispanic, non-Hispanic other, and non-Hispanic African American&#xD;
      patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To maximize relevance and acceptability of content and delivery of LARKSPUR&#xD;
      intervention among patients with FMS, a chronic pain population with known deficits in PA.&#xD;
      This aim will establish the feasibility (recruitment and retention) and acceptability&#xD;
      (helpfulness, satisfaction, and impact) of the multicomponent LARKSPUR intervention in&#xD;
      Hispanic, non-Hispanic African American and non-Hispanic other patients with FMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To conduct a randomized pilot trial to evaluate the impact of the LARKSPUR&#xD;
      intervention in FMS pain (primary outcome), as well PA, depressive symptoms, physical&#xD;
      functioning, and stress appraisals (secondary outcomes) and Aim 2a: explore racial/ethnic&#xD;
      disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1, the study team will pilot LARKSPUR to examine feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention framework by conducting frequency and descriptive statistics for enrollment&#xD;
      rates, number of sessions completed, number of weeks required to complete the intervention,&#xD;
      and Likert-scale items assessing satisfaction with the intervention and perceived&#xD;
      helpfulness. For Aims 2, FMS patients (target N=90) will be randomized to receive the&#xD;
      LARKSPUR content online or to complete daily emotion reports online (control). The&#xD;
      researchers hypothesize that intervention participants will report more frequent PA,&#xD;
      decreased depressive symptoms, enhanced physical functioning, improved stress appraisals, and&#xD;
      reduced FMS pain (intensity and interference) immediately following the intervention&#xD;
      (approximately 6-8 wks) and at 1-month post-intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 11 (post-intervention); at week 16 (1 month post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured by PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Pain Intensity - Short Form 3a. This 3-item instrument assesses how much a person hurts. The first two items assess pain intensity utilizing a 7-day recall period (items include the phrase &quot;the past 7 days&quot;) while the last item asks patients to rate their pain intensity &quot;right now.&quot; Respondents report their pain on a 5-point scale: 1=Had no pain, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe, and 5=Very severe.</description>

    <description>Pain interference will be measured by PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Pain Interference - Short Form 6b. This 6-item instrument measures the self-reported impact of pain on a person's life and assesses the extent to which pain may interfere with engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities over a 7-day recall period. Pain Interference also incorporates items probing sleep and enjoyment in life, though the item bank only contains one sleep item. Respondents report levels of pain interference on a 5-point scale: 1=Not at all, 2=A little bit, 3=Somewhat, 4=Quite a bit, and 5=Very much.</description>

    <description>The modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES) is a 20-item instrument that measures the extent to which a patient has experienced positive and negative emotions over a chosen time frame; in the version used in this study, we ask for emotions over the past 7 days. Respondents are asked to report the greatest amount of a given emotion on a five-point scale: 0=Not at all, 1=A little bit, 2=Moderately, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Extremely.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 11 (post-intervention); at week 16 (1 month post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-item self-report Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS-GEN) asks participants to describe to what extent they feel different feelings and emotions on average. Respondents answer on a five-point scale: 1=Very slightly or not at all, 2=A little, 3=Moderately, 4=Quite a bit, 5=Extremely.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Functioning as Measured by PROMIS Physical Functioning Short Form 10a (Aim 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 11 (post-intervention); at week 16 (1 month post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Physical Function Short Form 10a is a 10-item instrument that assesses a patient's abilities and limitations with respect to everyday physical activities, such as climbing the stairs, carrying groceries, and being able to sit on and get up from the toilet. Respondents are asked to report limitations on a five-point scale: 5=Not at all, 4=Very little, 3=Somewhat, 2=Quite a lot, 1=Cannot do. They are then asked to report their abilities to perform activities on a five-point scale: 5=Without any difficulty, 4=With a little difficulty, 3=With some difficulty, 2=With much difficulty, 1=Unable to do.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline; at week 11 (post-intervention); at week 16 (1 month post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue - Short Form 6a is a 6-item instrument that assesses a patient's level of fatigue over a 7-day recall period. Respondents are asked to report fatigue on a scale on a five-point scale: 1=Not at all, 2=A little bit, 3=Somewhat, 4=Quite a bit, 5=Very much.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, at week 11 (post-intervention); at week 16 (1 month post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Upon completion of each study assessment, the participant will complete one week of daily surveys, for a total of three 7-day-long periods. These daily surveys will collect data on affective reactivity to stress and will be used in a post-hoc exploratory analysis. The instrument used will be the modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES), a 20-item instrument that measures the extent to which a patient has experienced positive and negative emotions over a chosen time frame; in the version used in this survey, we ask for emotions over the past 24 hours. Respondents are asked to report the greatest amount of a given emotion on a five-point scale: 0=Not at all, 1=A little bit, 2=Moderately, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Extremely.</description>

    <description>Upon completion of each study assessment, the participant will complete one week of daily surveys, for a total of three 7-day-long periods. These daily surveys will collect data on affective reactivity to stress and will be used in a post-hoc exploratory analysis.

NACDA is a repository of survey data on aging that has hundreds of social science research data sets available that are drawn from NIA-funded surveys and data collection efforts. NACDA has established protocols for contributors to reliably de-identify survey participants, regardless of whether they have been assembled as part of national random sample surveys or specialized registry data collection efforts. External users may be asked to provide study aims, variables requested, analytic plans, and targeted journals in their data use requests. They will also be asked to not attempt to re-identify participants, either by merging in administrative, census, medical, or other data, or by using a software program that might re-identify participants.</ipd_description>
