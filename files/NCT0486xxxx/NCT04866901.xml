  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand specific stress-management practices on&#xD;
      mood, sleep, and physiology. Participants will be assigned to one of three interventions&#xD;
      (they all active interventions - none are a &quot;wait-list&quot;). Each intervention asks participants&#xD;
      to engage in a daily practice of 20 minutes per day for 8 weeks. Questionnaires and measures&#xD;
      of heart rate and blood pressure will be collected at the start and end of the 8 weeks,&#xD;
      including a virtual laboratory visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Slow-paced breathing (SPB), mindfulness (M), and their combination (SPB+M) in the form of&#xD;
      yoga, yogic breathing, Tai Chi, Qigong, and other practices are considered distinct forms of&#xD;
      intervention, yet are often considered inextricably linked and overlapping in their effects&#xD;
      on the autonomic nervous system. Although the scientific community continues to build&#xD;
      understanding of autonomic mechanisms that might be unique to SPB, M, and their interaction&#xD;
      (SPB+M), no studies we are aware of have attempted to directly compare these three forms of&#xD;
      intervention in a controlled fashion that enables a 'dismantling' framework of&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this pilot project is to compare the separate and combined effects of SPB and M&#xD;
      on autonomic function. We will test the feasibility of a three-arm intervention trial (N=5&#xD;
      per group), involving 20-min daily practice for 8 weeks, with multimodal ambulatory autonomic&#xD;
      measurement before and after intervention. We will first focus on a healthy young adult&#xD;
      population to then inform translation to hypertension, insomnia, and other clinical groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Distinguish SPB, M, and SPB+M training in terms of breathing rate and subjective&#xD;
      mindfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Obtain pilot data comparing the three interventions in terms of autonomic regulation&#xD;
      using both conventional metrics and non-linear dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Develop methods to examine relationships across domains of autonomic regulation,&#xD;
      stress, and sleep for the three interventions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8-weeks (post-intervention), 15 minute practice session during the virtual laboratory visit</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will wear a Polar H10 chest strap heart rate monitor during training and daily practice, and breathing rate will be derived from the HR interbeat interval series. We expect participants randomized to SPB and SPB+M to show slower breathing rates compared to M during a recorded practice session at 8-weeks.</description>

    <measure>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>8-weeks (post-intervention) completed electronically prior to virtual laboratory visit</time_frame>
    <description>We expect M and SPB+M to more highly report qualities of experience consistent with mindfulness. Primary outcome will focus on total score, summing across the five facets (total score range: 39-195; higher scores reflect higher mindfulness ratings).</description>

    <description>Participants will first be provided with a brief overview of the science of breathing and benefits for autonomic regulation. Then, participants will receive specific practice instruction and guided breathing at a rhythm of 6 breaths/min (4-6 count) via auditory tones. Each participant will be encouraged to breathe as comfortably and effortlessly as possible, while keeping the lungs moving in accordance with the audio guidance. The accompanying training and daily instruction reminder will emphasize the importance of following the specific rhythm of breathing, without regard to thoughts or inner experience. A soft but firm tone of voice will be employed to minimize likelihood of relaxing effects, while maintaining similarity to the tone of voice used in the other conditions.</description>

    <description>Procedures are based on Berghoff et al., providing a brief history of mindfulness practices, definitions, instructions for practice, common challenges, and recommendations. An audio recording will then guide the mindfulness practice. Specific to this study, in order to further distinguish the three conditions, the guided audio recording will emphasize the importance of attending to the quality of experience while not changing or attending to breathing patterns.</description>
