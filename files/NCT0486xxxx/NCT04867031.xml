  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized crossover trial, lasting 12 days in total, which will assess the&#xD;
      difference in iodine bioavailability (as a percentage of iodine consumed that is excreted in&#xD;
      urine) from three iodine-rich foods; semi-skimmed milk, white fish, and dried seaweed sheets.&#xD;
      Each of the three foods will provide approximately 140µg of iodine, and iodine excretion will&#xD;
      be monitored for 36 hours following food ingestion via collection and analysis of urine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iodine insufficiency is one of the three key micronutrient deficiencies highlighted as major&#xD;
      public health issues by the World Health Organisation, and recent evidence indicates that the&#xD;
      UK is now iodine deficient. Iodine deficiency represents a particular threat for women of&#xD;
      child-bearing age, unborn infants and young children, as iodine is essential to synthesise&#xD;
      the thyroid hormones, which are involved in key metabolic function including fetal brain&#xD;
      development. Maternal iodine deficiency and the resulting changes in thyroid function has&#xD;
      been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous miscarriage, fetal&#xD;
      distress and death, preterm delivery, low birth weight and impaired neuropsychological&#xD;
      development, with significant impact on later life development and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no iodine fortification programme in the United Kingdom, and despite worldwide&#xD;
      efforts to tackle iodine deficiency and associated disorders via iodine supplementation and&#xD;
      food-fortification (of salt mainly), consumption of supplements in the UK is virtually&#xD;
      non-existent, with iodised salt used by less than 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, the main dietary sources of iodine are dairy and sea-foods. Our previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that seaweed intake can increase the iodine status of women with diets habitually&#xD;
      low in iodine. However, we have also shown reduced bioavailability of iodine from the seaweed&#xD;
      matrix, which could have implications for dietary recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, we will address the influence of the food matrix on iodine bioavailability,&#xD;
      in the context of food guidelines and assessment of the iodine status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is in collaboration with the British Broadcast Corporation (BBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a crossover randomised trial - to last 9 days, plus three days pre-trial&#xD;
      washout [total 12 days] - with 3 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. fish arm: portion equivalent to 140 µg iodine, approx. 130g.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. milk arm: portion equivalent to 140 µg iodine, approx. 450mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. seaweed arm: portion equivalent to 140 µg iodine, approx. 6g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each arm will be separated by two washout days, and participants will follow a low iodine&#xD;
      diet (avoiding dairy, and all seafood) throughout the study, as well as three days prior to&#xD;
      the first arm. Iodine levels will be monitored in urine collected during the 12 hours&#xD;
      preceding and 36 hours following the meal. Urine will be collected in time fractions&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have shown in a parallel design study that 56% (SD 20%) of a dose of potassium iodide is&#xD;
      excreted after 24hours, compared to 36% (SD 13%) when the same dose comes from seaweed. In&#xD;
      order to detect a similar difference, a sample of at least 13 participants is required (n=19&#xD;
      to allow for 30% attrition).&#xD;
