  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if the study drug (ketoconazole) can enter brain&#xD;
      tumors at a high enough amount to stop the tumor cells from dividing. Ketoconazole is a drug&#xD;
      which doctors already use for fungal infections and is thought to be able to effect tumor&#xD;
      cells. As treatments for this type of brain tumor are limited, it is hoped that the results&#xD;
      of this study will help to determine if the study drug should be studied further as a&#xD;
      possible treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both ketoconazole and posaconazole are FDA-approved anti-fungal agents with a&#xD;
      well-established side effect and safety profile. Ketoconazole and posaconazole have shown&#xD;
      efficacy in reducing tumor cell proliferation in in-vitro studies. Furthermore, both have&#xD;
      also shown efficacy, mediated at least in part through inhibition of hexokinase 2 (HK2)&#xD;
      activity, in animal models with dosing concentration and schedules that are documented as&#xD;
      safe in humans. As a drug, posaconazole has a more predictable half-life than ketoconazole&#xD;
      and has less off-target effects. Therefore, the proposed trial will focus on the role of&#xD;
      posaconazole exclusively. As a first step, demonstration of adequate penetrance of study drug&#xD;
      in brain and tumor tissue (pharmacokinetics) and biological effect (inhibition of glycolysis&#xD;
      and subsequent tumor cell death) is necessary prior to large scale clinical studies. A total&#xD;
      of 5 control participants will be included in this study as the investigator specifically&#xD;
      wants to assess for pharmacodynamic differences too. The addition of a control group to this&#xD;
      study rather to both the studies (ketoconazole study is a separate protocol) is because the&#xD;
      investigator feels posaconazole may be a more promising drug for moving forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma drug concentration measurements are an unreliable method to assess delivery of drugs&#xD;
      across the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, intracerebral microdialysis catheters (MDC)&#xD;
      monitoring allows for approximate measurements within extracellular fluid (ECF) sampling of&#xD;
      the brain. MDC placement within the brain is not a novel technique and has been utilized&#xD;
      routinely in the ICU setting to measure brain metabolism by sampling of ECF of traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDC are now FDA-approved and are being placed routinely with intracranial pressure monitors.&#xD;
      This method allows for continuous measurement of ECF within a tumor or normal tissue. The&#xD;
      dialysis probe has a semipermeable membrane which is less than 1 mm in diameter into which&#xD;
      two sections of microcatheter are fused. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility&#xD;
      of keeping the catheters in place of critically injured patients for up to 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When placed at the time of surgical resection, the microcatheters are stereotactically&#xD;
      implanted, placing the probe within the desired brain and/or tumor region. Externally, the&#xD;
      catheter is connected to a syringe pump, which delivers a low flow rate (μl/min) of&#xD;
      continuous perfusion fluid (Lactated Ringers or artificial CSF) and dialysate is collected in&#xD;
      a microvial from the outlet tube. This sterile, single use catheter is minimally invasive and&#xD;
      developed to achieve optimal diffusing characteristics similar to passive diffusion of a&#xD;
      capillary blood vessel. Just as in the function of brain capillary vessel, water, inorganic&#xD;
      ions and small organic molecules freely diffuse across the membrane of the probe, whereas&#xD;
      proteins and protein bound compounds are impermeable. Additionally, lipophilic compounds are&#xD;
      poorly recovered. Therefore, assessment of pharmacokinetics of drug using MDC provides&#xD;
      valuable insight relevant to its anti-neoplastic properties.&#xD;
