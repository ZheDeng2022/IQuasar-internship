  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fenofibrate accelerates bilirubin conjugation and excretion, decreasing the side effects of&#xD;
      prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates. It also reduces the duration of&#xD;
      phototherapy and thus the duration of stay in the hospital. This research is carried out to&#xD;
      improve standard protocol for the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the local&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

      Complete history and examination will be carried out while patients will be screened for&#xD;
      enrollment. After taking informed consent, eligible patients will be selected and divided&#xD;
      into two groups A and B by lottery method. Demographics like name, age (hours), gender, birth&#xD;
      weight, and gestational age will be noted. Solutions will be prepared in the required&#xD;
      strengths and labeled accordingly. Groups A will receive Solution A i.e. Fenofibrate&#xD;
      suspension is prepared by dissolving 200 mg capsule in 10 ml distilled water and given as a&#xD;
      single dose of 10mg/kg (0.5 ml/kg) and Group B will receive solution B i.e. 0.5ml/ kg normal&#xD;
      saline as a placebo. Both groups will receive LED phototherapy under standard conditions. The&#xD;
      serum bilirubin level will be noted at the time of admission and then at 12hr, 24hr, and 48&#xD;
      hours of treatment. All this information will be recorded on proforma.&#xD;
