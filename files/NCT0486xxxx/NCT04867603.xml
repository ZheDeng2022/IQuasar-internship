    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a radioactive diagnostic study drug, which is called&#xD;
      Gallium-68 Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen ([Ga-68]PSMA) for characterization of prostate&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer and without prior prostate biopsy are&#xD;
      offered abbreviated bi-parametric prostate MRI. As Standard of Care (SOC), MRIs will be&#xD;
      examined and scored for likelihood for malignancy using the PI-RADS version 2.1 criteria.&#xD;
      Those with PI-RADS 3, 4 or 5 lesions or those with PI-RADS 1 or 2 lesions with clinical&#xD;
      suspicion for prostate cancer based on serum PSA level, family history or clinical&#xD;
      examination (positive digital rectal examination) will be included on study. Only those&#xD;
      receiving care at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center will be included into the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to evaluate ([Ga-68]PSMA) for characterization of prostate abnormalities. For&#xD;
      imaging, an FDA approved imaging technology, digital Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT)&#xD;
      will be used. The study team would like to know if digital PET/CT using [Ga-68]PSMA provides&#xD;
      accurate information whether or not a participant has prostate cancer and if there is&#xD;
      potential spread of the disease within the body. [Ga-68]PSMA is an investigational&#xD;
      (experimental) drug that works by binding to Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSA), which&#xD;
      is overexpressed in prostate cancer. [Ga-68]PSMA is experimental because it is not approved&#xD;
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, FDA approval has been obtained for this&#xD;
      study protocol by an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.&#xD;
