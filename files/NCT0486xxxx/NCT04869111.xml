      The BrainHealth Project is a ten-year, longitudinal study focused on identifying determinants&#xD;
      of brain health and performance. Participants will have the opportunity to complete&#xD;
      semi-annual (twice a year) online assessments to track their performance over time. In&#xD;
      between semi-annual assessments, participants will have access to online trainings and&#xD;
      ongoing supplemental content regarding ways to optimize brain health and performance.&#xD;
      Additionally, quarterly online one-on-one coaching sessions will be offered to participants&#xD;
      to answer questions and provide support in applying the information to their daily lives. A&#xD;
      small portion of participants will be invited to participate in the brain imaging portion of&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives are: (i) to characterize lifestyle, cognitive, and behavioral markers&#xD;
      related to an individual's cognitive function from adolescent to elderly ages, (ii) to assess&#xD;
      the neural/biological determinants predictive of maintenance of brain health, and (iii) to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of available cognitive and lifestyle interventions on improving and&#xD;
      maintaining brain health and performance.&#xD;

      Description of Study: For individuals who qualify to participate, they will be asked to&#xD;
      complete online assessments and questionnaires semi-annually (twice a year). The online&#xD;
      assessment will be presented in 3 different sections, which should not require more than 2&#xD;
      hours in total. In between those time points, participants will participate in online&#xD;
      trainings, exercises, and education regarding ways to optimize brain health, as well as&#xD;
      overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments and trainings included in this protocol consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. BrainHealth Index (semi-annually, online) - 2 hours. An online battery of cognitive&#xD;
      measures and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. The Cognitive section looks at complex thinking capacities such as reasoning, flexibility&#xD;
      and strategy - as well as specific capacities such as reaction time, working memory and&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. The Well-Being evaluation taps into an individual's emotional sense of self. The&#xD;
      participant will report on quality of life, level of happiness, levels of stress and sadness,&#xD;
      and on emotional resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. The Social evaluation looks at the complexity and quality of the participant's social&#xD;
      supports. The investigators want to know how the participant feels about their social support&#xD;
      networks and the meaningfulness of social engagements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. The Daily Function evaluation monitors the complexity (depth and breadth) of the&#xD;
      participant's daily responsibilities, habits and challenges. The investigators are interested&#xD;
      in how the participant strives to optimize life circumstances and habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small group of participants who are invited to complete the brain imaging portion of the&#xD;
      study will undergo annual brain imaging and will also complete brain gauge (in-person&#xD;
      computer assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online Trainings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trainings are self-paced, allowing participants to complete them at their discretion. On&#xD;
      average each module takes between 30 minutes to an hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Online SMART - (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training) is a curriculum that&#xD;
           teaches strategies of how to efficiently manage complex information by abstracting its&#xD;
           essential meaning rather than attempting to memorize details, and to prioritize the&#xD;
           information in order to attend to the most relevant parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stress Solutions - provides individuals with practical tools to enhance performance,&#xD;
           reduce stress, build resilience and improve quality of life. Participants will learn and&#xD;
           practice skills in awareness, self-regulation and emotion regulation through attentional&#xD;
           focus exercises grounded in mindfulness meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sleep for BrainHealth with Dr. Russell Foster - provides scientific and practical&#xD;
           information about the importance of sleep on various aspects of health, such as emotion,&#xD;
           cognition and physiology. Modules also provide actionable tips on how to get better&#xD;
           sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BrainHealthy Habit-Building Content&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BrainHealth Challenges - Brief, interactive activities, tips and nudges that reinforce&#xD;
           information learned in online modules and link back with daily life application. These&#xD;
           are designed to take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BrainHealth Literacy - General education and emerging scientific findings to build&#xD;
           awareness of how our daily habits (sleep, nutrition, exercise, social interactions,&#xD;
           etc.) - as well as the ways participants choose to use their thinking abilities - may be&#xD;
           impacting brain health and performance for better or worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BrainHealth Coaching&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Quarterly online coaching sessions will be offered to participants. Participants can elect&#xD;
      to take advantage of this offer to the extent they chose. Sessions are 30 minutes long.&#xD;
