  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim is to conduct a double blind randomized clinical trial, to study the&#xD;
      effects of combined Resveratrol and Myo-Inositol on altered metabolic, endocrine parameters&#xD;
      and perceived stress response in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Women&#xD;
      diagnosed with PCOS, using criteria proposed in November 2015, by the American Association of&#xD;
      Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), American College of Endocrinology (ACE), and Androgen&#xD;
      Excess and PCOS Society (AES) for PCOS should include two of the following three criteria:&#xD;
      chronic an ovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical/biologic), and polycystic ovaries. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that PCOS women may have altered metabolic, endocrine levels and&#xD;
      increased perceived stress response and combination therapy may have beneficial influences on&#xD;
      these parameters in women diagnosed with PCOS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is extremely prevalent and considered to be the most&#xD;
      common heterogeneous endocrine disorder in reproductive age women. This affects up to 10-15%&#xD;
      of women in reproductive age. PCOS is a multifaceted health issue characterized by chronic&#xD;
      anovulation with excess ovarian activity, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. The most&#xD;
      disappointment for women with PCOS is pregnancy loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This endocrine disorder has some long term effects including cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      metabolic and sexual dysfunction, depression and anxiety that effects the overall quality of&#xD;
      life. Women with PCOS have a greater risk of developing hyperinsulinemia and insulin&#xD;
      resistance and this explains the substantially increased prevalence of glucose intolerance in&#xD;
      PCOS. Recent long-term follow up studies of the syndrome have shown that dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia is a very common metabolic abnormality in these women. The key pathophysiology&#xD;
      of PCOS is Insulin resistance, thus dyslipidemia in women may be constant with those found in&#xD;
      an insulin resistant state. Low adiponectin levels in PCOS have been largely associated with&#xD;
      obesity which is common among these patients. Serum adiponectin levels are associated with&#xD;
      PCOS independently and are only explained by IR partly. An independent biomarker, adiponectin&#xD;
      can be used for diagnosing PCOS in young and lean women or women with a family history of&#xD;
      PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resveratrol (3,5,4-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) belongs to polyphenols stilbene group found in&#xD;
      grapes, peanuts, red wine and many medicinal plants. Studies have shown that patients treated&#xD;
      with resveratrol have shown improve glucose homeostasis and reverse insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Treatment with resveratrol improved the elevated number of atretic and secondary follicles&#xD;
      and the decreased number of Graafian follicles in the PCOS group, which indicates the effect&#xD;
      of the treatments on the maintenance of folliculogenesis. It has been reported to interact&#xD;
      with multiple cell targets, but its major effects are brought about by the activation of&#xD;
      SIRT1 (silent information regulator1).The SIRT1 is expressed in oocytes and human granulosa&#xD;
      nuclei cells at multiple developmental stages of the follicles. It is also responsible for&#xD;
      suppressing inflammation. Moreover, SIRT1 is also involved in protecting the oocytes from age&#xD;
      dependent insufficiencies through oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myo-Inositol is a carbocyclic sugar, belongs to Inositol group and is an important component&#xD;
      of structural lipids. Inositol's or its phosphates and the associated lipids are found in&#xD;
      different fruits specially cantaloupe and oranges. It is the precursor of inositol&#xD;
      triphosphate, acting as an intracellular second messenger and regulating a number of hormones&#xD;
      such as thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and insulin. One of&#xD;
      the insulin-sensitizing compounds, Myo-Inositol is capable of restoring spontaneous ovarian&#xD;
      activity, and consequently fertility, in most patients with PCOS. Inositol's improve the&#xD;
      metabolic and endocrine parameters in young, overweight PCOS patients and regulate the&#xD;
      monthly cycles. Treatment with inositol's in obese PCOS patients is also effective in&#xD;
      reducing BMI. The decrease in BMI is without any lifestyle modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCOS is a systemic condition, an endocrinopathy whose etiology is still not understood,&#xD;
      correct treatment regimens of PCOS will not only improve menstrual cycles of the patients but&#xD;
      will also improve the metabolic or endocrinological parameters. PCOS sufferers are also known&#xD;
      to have increased levels of perceived stress which will be considered in the study. Very&#xD;
      little evidence is available on combination therapy for treatment of PCOS patients. In this&#xD;
      study our goal will be to come up with a better treatment option to treat the disease&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of combined Resveratrol and Myo-Inositol treatment after 3 months&#xD;
      on metabolic, endocrine alterations and perceived stress response in patients with PCOS.&#xD;
