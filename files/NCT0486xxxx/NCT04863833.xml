      Breast lesions are observed in about 20% of female patients1. However this percentage is&#xD;
      likely to represent an underestimation of the true incidence of these lesions because breast&#xD;
      imaging (MRI, ultrasound or mammography) was performed in only a small number of the patients&#xD;
      of these series. The lesions are possibly palpable and most of the time asymptomatic2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current clinical practice, mammography is the standard imaging modality for breast cancer&#xD;
      screening and diagnosis.3 The advantages of mammography include a reasonably high&#xD;
      sensitivity, high resolution, and low patient dose. However, a mammogram still suffers from&#xD;
      being a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional object. The resulting overlap of&#xD;
      normal fibro glandular tissue cannot only obscure the detection and characterization of&#xD;
      lesions but also present false alarms leading to unnecessary recall studies.4-6 To address&#xD;
      this key limitation of mammography, 3D x-ray imaging techniques have been developed,&#xD;
      including dedicated breast computed tomography (CT), which takes cone-beam x-ray projection&#xD;
      images of the uncompressed breast in a full 360Â° scan, thus enabling reconstruction of a 3D&#xD;
      breast volume 6-10 Digital x-ray tomosynthesis11,12(often abbreviated as &quot;tomo&quot;) for the&#xD;
      breast is a form of limited-angle cone-beam CT.13-14 A restricted number of projection images&#xD;
      are acquired in an arc in the conventional mammography projection geometry, while the breast&#xD;
      is compressed adjacent to the detector. Although some information is lost due to angular&#xD;
      under sampling, breast tomo still creates a 3D volume at a dose comparable to that of&#xD;
      traditional mammography. Moreover, the tomo device itself is usually based on an existing&#xD;
      full-field digital mammography (FFDM) system. Although compression is required, this ensures&#xD;
      proper posterior tissue coverage, immobilization to minimize motion artifacts, and a low&#xD;
      dose.15The similarity of tomo to FFDM in terms of patient positioning, image acquisition, and&#xD;
      aspects of image display suggests that there is minimal retraining required for the&#xD;
      technologist or radiologist.16 As such, breast tomo synthesis is a 3D breast imaging modality&#xD;
      with the potential to replace mammography17&#xD;
&#xD;
      . DBT offers potential advantages for evaluating masses, areas of architectural distortion,&#xD;
      and asymmetries compared with those of conventional 2D mammographic images 18 In diagnostic&#xD;
      settings, DBT improves work-up efficiency and the selection of patients recommended for&#xD;
      biopsy, thereby reducing associated costs and additional imaging studies including additional&#xD;
      mammographic views and unnecessary biopsies 19&#xD;
