  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increasing success rate in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) control of&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD) remains a significative burden in mortality and morbidity. A&#xD;
      lot of strategies could lower the incidence and gravity of the disease and immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatment as GVHD prophylaxis still represent the main method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although immunosuppressive treatment showed a good effect on GVHD mortality a lot of studies&#xD;
      also highlight an increase of relapse and infection related mortality that jeopardize the&#xD;
      effect on overall survival of HSCT recipient. Using anti thymocyte globulin (ATG) as GVHD&#xD;
      prophylaxis shares the same double-edge effect as other immunosuppressive treatment although&#xD;
      is still unclear how manage dose and timing of the infusion to minimize promoting effect on&#xD;
      infections and maximize protective effect on GVHD. Biological effect of ATG lead to a dose-&#xD;
      related delay in all class of T-cell reconstitution but our data are mostly from adult&#xD;
      studies with high doses between 30 and 60 mg/kg due to the more important burden of GVHD in&#xD;
      HSCT adult population. As for other treatment in HSCT conditioning we would like to study a&#xD;
      personalized approach for ATG treatment: some studies focus on tuning of ATG dose for kilos&#xD;
      but previous evidence showed that the same dose could made too little or too much&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effect for different patients, even though same age and same stem cell&#xD;
      source.&#xD;
