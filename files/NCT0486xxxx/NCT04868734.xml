      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The supportive psychotherapy model can be structured and developed for the&#xD;
           non-pharmacologic therapy of acute coroner syndrome patients in intensive cardiac care&#xD;
           unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The development of the supportive psychotherapy model can provide an improvement in&#xD;
           psychological function in the form of a reduction in symptoms of anxiety, depression,&#xD;
           and an improvement in the quality of life of acute coroner syndrome patients during&#xD;
           treatment at intensive cardiac care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psycho-patho-mechanization of supportive psychotherapy model development in the&#xD;
           improvement of psychosomatic function of acute coroner syndrome patients by assessing&#xD;
           the improvement of serotonin, cortisol, and immunoglobulin-A levels, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Development of the supportive psychotherapy model can provide improvement in somatic&#xD;
           function in the form of decreased complications such as arrhythmias, pericarditis,&#xD;
           chronic heart failure, shock and death of acute coronary syndrome patients during&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Psychosomatic improvements, namely anxiety, depression, and cardiac complications&#xD;
           associated with levels of serotonin, cortisol, immunoglobulin-A and heart rate&#xD;
           variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives 1.1 General Objectives: To develop non-pharmacologic psychotherapy as&#xD;
      part of holistic therapy for acute coronary syndrome patients during their treatment at&#xD;
      intensive cardiac care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a structured supportive psychotherapy model&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proving the role of supportive psychotherapy in the improvement of psychological&#xD;
           symptoms of anxiety, depression and quality of life in acute coronary syndrome patients&#xD;
           during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Proving the psycho-patho-mechanism intervention of the supportive psychotherapy model in&#xD;
           improving psychosomatic function through the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal pathway,&#xD;
           namely by assessing the improvement in levels of serotonin, cortisol, immunoglobulin-A&#xD;
           and heart rate variability&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Proving the role of supportive psychotherapy in the improvement of somatic symptoms of&#xD;
           cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, pericarditis, chronic heart failure, shock&#xD;
           and death in acute coronary syndrome patients during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To prove the supportive psychotherapy model in psychosomatic improvement, namely&#xD;
           anxiety, depression, and cardiac complications associated with improvements in levels of&#xD;
           serotonin, cortisol, immunoglobulin-A and heart rate variability.&#xD;

      Introduction Acute coronary syndrome will have a high impact on who feels it.&#xD;
      Psycho-neuro-immunological imbalance will occur before and after the attack. To date, there&#xD;
      is no evidence regarding the role of supportive psychotherapy as a non-medical treatment in&#xD;
      acute coronary syndromes. The study will also measure cortisol, immunoglobulin-A, serotonin,&#xD;
      and heart rate variability for objective comparisons between intervention and usual cardiac&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This research is an operational research with a mixed method research design, namely&#xD;
      exploratory sequential method with qualitative method research that precedes quantitative&#xD;
      methods. This research is divided into two stages, namely the qualitative research stage by&#xD;
      developing a model of supportive psychotherapy, followed by the stage of applying the model&#xD;
      to clinical trials of acute coronary syndrome patients during treatment at intensive cardiac&#xD;
      care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result Total subject is 80 subject. All will collect blood and saliva sample, heart rate&#xD;
      variability. One arm will do intervention (supportive psychotherapy) and the others will do&#xD;
      usual cardiac care.&#xD;
