      Although soy protein has approved health claims in Canada and the US, and is recognized by&#xD;
      major cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines for the reduction of cholesterol and risk&#xD;
      of coronary heart disease (CHD), these claims are based almost exclusively on evidence from&#xD;
      foods containing isolated soy protein (ISP). The role of other non-ISP food sources of soy&#xD;
      protein (e.g Tofu, tempeh, edamame) in these effects is unclear. The role of food form and&#xD;
      matrix (e.g soy beverage versus meat analogue) on the effects of ISP is also unclear. As&#xD;
      national dietary guidelines and clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy shift from&#xD;
      a focus on single nutrients to a focus on foods and dietary patterns, it is important to&#xD;
      understand whether non-ISP food sources of soy protein and ISP food sources with different&#xD;
      food matrices produce the same reductions in LDL-cholesterol and CHD risk. To strengthen the&#xD;
      evidence-base for health claims and guidelines development, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the effect of ISP and&#xD;
      non-ISP food sources of soy protein on stablished lipid targets in individuals with and&#xD;
      without dyslipidemia.&#xD;

      RATIONALE. Although soy protein has approved health claims in Canada and the US and is&#xD;
      recognized by major cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines for the reduction of&#xD;
      cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), these claims are based almost&#xD;
      exclusively on evidence from foods containing isolated soy protein (ISP). The role of other&#xD;
      non-ISP food sources of soy protein (e.g Tofu, tempeh, edamame) in these effects is unclear.&#xD;
      The role of food form and matrix (e.g soy beverage versus meat analogue) on the effects of&#xD;
      ISP is also unclear. As national dietary guidelines and clinical practice guidelines for&#xD;
      nutrition therapy shift from a focus on single nutrients to a focus on foods and dietary&#xD;
      patterns, it is important to understand whether non-ISP food sources of soy protein and ISP&#xD;
      food sources with different food matrices produce the same reductions in LDL-cholesterol and&#xD;
      CHD risk. The investigators are not aware of any systematic reviews and meta-analyses of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials that have addressed this important question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES. To conduct a systematic review of the effect of soy protein with prespecified&#xD;
      analyses by food source on established lipid targets in individuals with and without&#xD;
      dyslipidemia and assess the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations&#xD;
      Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. A sub-objective is to conduct a&#xD;
      targeted systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of exclusively ISP on established&#xD;
      lipid targets in individuals with and without dyslipidemia for use in the development of&#xD;
      Health Claims submissions in Australia and New Zealand by co-investigator, Dr. Alan Barclay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN. The systematic review and meta-analyses will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SOURCES. Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by&#xD;
      manual searches of references of included studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SELECTION. Randomized controlled trials of ≥3-weeks (based on the FDA minimum follow-up&#xD;
      requirement) assessing the effect of soy protein food sources compared with a suitable&#xD;
      non-soy-containing control on lipids will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA EXTRACTION. Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data. Authors&#xD;
      will be contacted for additional information and any missing data will be computed/imputed&#xD;
      using standard formulae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK OF BIAS. Two or more investigators will independently assess risk of bias using the&#xD;
      Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES. The primary outcome will be LDL-C and secondary outcomes will be other established&#xD;
      therapeutic lipid targets: HDL-C, TG, non-HDL-D and apo B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SYNTHESIS. Data will be pooled using the Generic Inverse Variance method with&#xD;
      prespecified analyses by food source. Separate pooled analyses will be conducted for ISP to&#xD;
      meet the subobjective of assessing the effect of ISP. Random effects models will be used with&#xD;
      paired analyses applied to crossover designs. Heterogeneity will be assessed (Cochran Q&#xD;
      statistic) and quantified (I2 statistic). Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses and a priori subgroup analyses (dose, comparator, follow-up, baseline&#xD;
      levels, design, body weight change, saturated fat intake, and risk of bias). Meta-regression&#xD;
      will assess the significance of subgroup analyses. Linear and nonlinear dose-response&#xD;
      analyses will be assessed by generalized least squares trend (GLST) estimation models and&#xD;
      spline curve modelling (MKSPLINE procedure), respectively. Publication bias will be assessed&#xD;
      by inspection of funnel plots and the Egger and Begg tests. Adjustment for evidence of funnel&#xD;
      plot asymmetry or small study effects will be conducted by the Duval and Tweedie&#xD;
      trim-and-fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GRADE ASSESSMENT. To assess the certainty of the evidence, the investigators will use the&#xD;
      GRADE system, an evidence-based grading system adopted by &gt;100 organizations&#xD;
      (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). It grades the evidence as high, moderate, low or very&#xD;
      low quality based on the study design and a series of downgrades (risk of bias, imprecision,&#xD;
      inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias) and upgrades (large magnitude of the effect,&#xD;
      dose-response gradient, and attenuation by confounding). The investigators will follow the&#xD;
      GRADE handbook (https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) and use the GRADEpro GDT&#xD;
      (gradepro.org) software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION PLAN. The investigators will follow the Ottawa model of Research for&#xD;
      knowledge translation. The results will be disseminated through interactive presentations at&#xD;
      local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact&#xD;
      journals. Target audiences will include public health and clinical communities with an&#xD;
      interest in nutrition and cardiovascular disease. Feedback will be incorporated and used to&#xD;
      improve public health messages and key areas for future research will be defined. The PIs&#xD;
      will network among opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE. The proposed project will reinforce the role of the all soy protein food&#xD;
      sources (not just ISP-containing food sources) for cholesterol and CHD risk reduction,&#xD;
      strengthening the evidence-base for health claims and guidelines development in the U.S.,&#xD;
      Canada, Europe, and beyond and improving health outcomes, by educating healthcare providers&#xD;
      and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
