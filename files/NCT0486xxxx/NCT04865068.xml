  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standards Echocardiographic have been defined mainly on caucasian or Asian populations. In&#xD;
      the EchoNoRMAL study the criteria for African populations were based solely on data from 198&#xD;
      subjects. This study suggests the presence of different standards depending on the ethnic&#xD;
      origin of the subjects. The aims of this study is to describe the proportion of subjects&#xD;
      reclassified (normal-pathological) according to the use of echocardiographic norm differences&#xD;
      showed in TAHES population (Sub Saharian Africans) with those routinely used&#xD;

      Sub-Saharian Africans populations seem to be more vulnerable in the field of health in&#xD;
      general and in cardiovascular pathologies in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The echocardiographic standards were mainly defined for Caucasian or Asian populations&#xD;
           (EchoNoRMAL col. 2014 and 2015). In the EchoNoRMAL study, the criteria for the African&#xD;
           populations were based on a reduced workforce (data from 198 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study suggests the presence of different standards depending on the ethnic origin&#xD;
           of the subjects. The authors noted that the establishment of references according to the&#xD;
           ethnic origin of the subjects is necessary and highlighted the need for additional study&#xD;
           for the underrepresented groups, in particular those including subjects of African&#xD;
           origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for different ECG standards in African subjects, was confirmed in a study in the&#xD;
      general African population (TAHES), represents 16% of immigrants in 2015 (INSEE According to&#xD;
      reports from the health insurance funds, the migrant population,&#xD;
