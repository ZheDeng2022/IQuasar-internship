      Prospective (analysis of retrospective data), multi-center, observational, single-arm study.&#xD;
      This structure was selected as the &quot;worst case&quot; due to the fact that it represents real life&#xD;
      usage of invasive FFR measurement is performed mostly in &quot;gray zone&quot; cases, which are that&#xD;
      their severity cannot be determined intuitively and based on the physician eyeball. By using&#xD;
      real-world historical data of invasive FFR, the analysis of the obtained data can ensure that&#xD;
      the study results are expected to include invasive FFR results that are in the grey zone,&#xD;
      when invasive FFR is used in real life and represent the real expected use of the product.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the analysis of the data obtained in the studies with these similar devices&#xD;
      measuring FFR obtained from angiograms was actually performed in a retrospective manner. That&#xD;
      is, although the angiographic images and pressure wire recordings were obtained in real-time,&#xD;
      due to the need to mark the vessel in real-time and obtain specific projections during the&#xD;
      procedure without which the FFR cannot be calculated, the primary endpoint (sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) and accuracy were determined in all studies by a post-hoc review by a similar&#xD;
      independent QCA core laboratory. The invasive FFR data, as well as the software generated FFR&#xD;
      data were reviewed post-hoc by a core laboratory or even at the company.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to compare MedHub AutocathFFR measurements obtained from&#xD;
      angiograms for the non-invasive determination of the presence of hemodynamically significant&#xD;
      coronary lesions. The software device will run on angiograms generated during cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization and results will be compared to invasive FFR measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective (analysis of retrospective data), multi-center, observational,&#xD;
      single-arm, study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 308 cases will be enrolled in the study. The study population who represent the&#xD;
      target population for this procedure consists of subjects with stable angina, unstable angina&#xD;
      or NSTEM1 who underwent a clinically indicated invasive coronary angiography and for whom&#xD;
      invasive FFR have been measured in vessels with coronary lesions. For each lesion of&#xD;
      interest, a minimum of two 2D angiographic projections, will be obtained. Patients of both&#xD;
      genders, all ethnicities, &gt;18 years of age will be recruited to the study. Study cases will&#xD;
      be sourced from numerous hospitals in the United States and Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will screen cases based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria described below.&#xD;
      General patient demographics, medical history, concomitant medications, C-arm angiography&#xD;
      system used, FFR pressure wire used, etc., will be obtained for each study case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with known or suspected coronary artery disease who were scheduled for clinically&#xD;
      indicated invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and on whom invasive FFR has been measured in&#xD;
      vessels with coronary lesions will comprise the patient population. Coronary angiography will&#xD;
      have been performed in a routine fashion in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      When clinically indicated, invasive FFR will have been measured in vessels with coronary&#xD;
      lesions of varying severity using a coronary pressure wire and hyperemic stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's angiographic images will be sent to an independent Quantitative Coronary&#xD;
      Arteriography (QCA) Core Laboratory, where they will be processed using the MedHub&#xD;
      AutocathFFR device, by independent potential users of the device (i.e., interventional&#xD;
      cardiologists). The users will use the diagnostic angiograms and upload them to the&#xD;
      AutocathFFR device, to generate the AutocathFFR value. The independent users will be blinded&#xD;
      to the software device-generated FFR results and to the invasive FFR measurements. Blinding&#xD;
      will be employed in the study because the primary endpoint, i.e., the scored FFR measurements&#xD;
      per vessel are subject to bias by device users. Observations in patients with more than 1&#xD;
      study vessel will be presumed independent. The AutocathFFR will not be used for diagnostic or&#xD;
      clinical decisions. A detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for AutoCathFFR computation&#xD;
      will be provided to the QCA Core Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AutocathFFR device automatically suggests and marks locations of suspicious narrowing and&#xD;
      computes an FFR value for each detected area. The clinician can also select and mark manually&#xD;
      locations with suspected narrowing for computing of FFR value. The clinical performance of&#xD;
      AutocathFFR device depends only on the uploaded angiograms, on which the AutocathFFR results&#xD;
      are presented alongside the viewed blood vessel. There is no need for user interaction with&#xD;
      the system during the diagnostic angiography procedure. For example, there is no need to take&#xD;
      specific orthogonal projection nor to designate or mark the blood vessels or segments. When&#xD;
      the desired coronary artery is viewed on the Cath Lab monitor, the AutocathFFR measurement is&#xD;
      automatically shown alongside the viewed vessel, if an area of narrowing is identified in the&#xD;
      vessel. Therefore, the use of the AutocathFFR device is seamless with the angiographic&#xD;
      imaging procedure and does not require any additional intervention by the cardiologist.&#xD;
