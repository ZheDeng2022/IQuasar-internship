  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical development plan for T-1201 will begin with a first-in-human (FIH), open label,&#xD;
      multi-center Phase I dose-escalation to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and human&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of T-1201 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) levels in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid cancer. The further Phase II study will then be designed based on the&#xD;
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy results from the FIH Phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial part of the Phase I study is a safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic phase&#xD;
      wherein T-1201 Injection will be intravenous administered to patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      cancers. The study will be an open label, multi-center Phase I dose-escalation study.&#xD;
      Approximately 30-40 patients will be enrolled for the dose-escalation phase. Actual number of&#xD;
      patients will be determined by the number of dose cohorts until maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      is reached. The modified accelerated titration design will be used for dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose regimen will be 18 mg/m 2 of T-1201 Injection once every 4 weeks in 28-day&#xD;
      cycles. Doses will escalate in the following sequence: 18, 36, 71, 119, 178 and 249 mg/m 2 of&#xD;
      T-1201 Injection. Dose escalation will cease when 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience a DLT, or a&#xD;
      dose of 249 mg/m 2 is reached. A DLT must occur within the first cycle (Cycle 1) to determine&#xD;
      dose escalation between cohorts. If 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience DLTs at the initial dose&#xD;
      level of 18 mg/m 2 , 2 more dose levels lower than 18 mg/m 2 will be added to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No human study has been conducted for product T-1201, the benefits/risks of T-1201 is&#xD;
      therefore not available at this stage. Since T-1201 is a prodrug of SN-38 with target&#xD;
      delivery design, the benefits/risks ratio of T-1201 would thus be expected to be more&#xD;
      favorable than irinotecan product (CAMPTOSAR ® , Pfizer).&#xD;
