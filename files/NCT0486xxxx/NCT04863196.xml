    <textblock>
      Gastrostomy is a procedure indicated for children and adolescents with chronic disease such&#xD;
      as intestinal malabsorption, swallowing disorders, neurological diseases, and can progress&#xD;
      with peristomal lesions. Thus, it is essential that health professionals know how to take&#xD;
      care of ostomies. Today there are several treatments for stoma injuries, however low-level&#xD;
      light therapy has been gaining more prominence when we talk about treatment of tissue injury&#xD;
      because it is an atraumatic method that, through its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and tissue&#xD;
      biomodulation effects, reduces the treatment time of ample spectrum, without causing drug&#xD;
      interactions. Therefore, this study seeks to highlight the effect of low-level light therapy&#xD;
      on patients. Objective: To compare the healing time of lesions present in the mucosa of the&#xD;
      gastric stoma of children and adolescents using laser therapy versus conventional treatment&#xD;
      with protective barrier powder. Methodology: randomized, open, comparative clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess the healing time of a lesion present in the gastric stoma mucosa using laser therapy&#xD;
      or protective barrier powder in a sample of 70 patients aged 0 to 19 years attended by the&#xD;
      stoma nurse in the units The work will compare two treatments (two-tailed test), with an&#xD;
      alpha error of 5%, and with the power of the 95% test for a means test&#xD;
      (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney), with an increase of 20% in the sample size, referring to possible&#xD;
      losses during the study. The results will be presented as median (variation) or mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. The&#xD;
      lesions will be evaluated through an initial measurement and during the treatment days,&#xD;
      appearance and number of applications of the laser or protective barrier powder.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment evaluation and follow-up will be done for 15 days. The application of the laser at first will be done three times a week.&#xD;
The application will be by points with continuous or selective technique, which will depend on each patient. The device is a pen type that will be by contact or without contact with the lesion, irradiation and the dose will be according to the calculation for each patient, using power in milliwatt and fluency, where the dose will vary according to area and patient, and may vary from 0.1 to 1J / cm² as calculated.&#xD;
The laser tip will be disinfected before each use with 70% alcohol and later coated with plastic film. Patients, companion and operator will wear specific eye protection glasses and all biosafety rules will be followed during therapy.</description>
