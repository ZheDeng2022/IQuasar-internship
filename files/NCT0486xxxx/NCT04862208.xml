  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercising in the fasted state results in greater fat oxidation during exercise and results&#xD;
      in decreased caloric intake in the meals after exercise. However, the studies that examine&#xD;
      fasted vs. fed exercise utilize a carbohydrate-based breakfast, which can increase blood&#xD;
      glucose and insulin concentrations, which is considered a negative consequence. A protein&#xD;
      breakfast, which can increase satiety and rest of day energy intake could also increase&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure as well as fat oxidation during exercise. However, comparisons&#xD;
      between fasting exercise and pre-exercise breakfast macronutrient intake (i.e., carbohydrate&#xD;
      vs. protein) have not been made. Therefore the purpose of this study is to investigate if&#xD;
      eating breakfast and the composition of this breakfast before exercise has an effect on the&#xD;
      food eaten throughout the rest of the day.&#xD;
