  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial was made to examine the effect of discharge training developed&#xD;
      using Nursing Interventions Classification on surgical recovery in patient who underwent&#xD;
      oncological surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of surgical recovery is defined as &quot;starting activities aimed at maintaining&#xD;
      daily life, health and well-being after surgery&quot; and delay in surgical recovery &quot;increasing&#xD;
      the number of days after surgery required to start activities aimed at maintaining daily&#xD;
      life, health and well-being after surgery&quot;. Problems such as fatigue, pain, incisional&#xD;
      surgical site infection, loss of appetite, which are common in patients in the postoperative&#xD;
      period, are symptoms associated with delayed surgical recovery. In addition to these&#xD;
      symptoms, the presence of conditions such as delayed return to home / work activities need&#xD;
      for self-care, nausea, anorexia, pain, and difficulty in moving indicate that surgical&#xD;
      recovery is interrupted. It has been reported that delay in surgical recovery is common after&#xD;
      surgeries such as gastrostomy, colectomy, and exploratory laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have undergone gastric or colorectal cancer surgery should receive discharge&#xD;
      training before returning to social life and business life. Nurses should determine the&#xD;
      problems they may experience at home in patients who have undergone surgeries such as&#xD;
      gastrostomy, colectomy, and exploratory laparotomy, where delay in surgical recovery is&#xD;
      frequently reported, plan and apply discharge training for these problems, and monitor&#xD;
      patients in terms of surgical recovery processes at home. It has been reported that this way,&#xD;
      the surgical recovery process can be supported and delays in surgical recovery can be&#xD;
      prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted to determine the effect of a discharge training developed using the&#xD;
      Nursing Interventions Classification on surgical recovery in patients undergoing oncologic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was tested the hypotheses that there was no difference between the post-intervention&#xD;
      intervention and control groups in terms of the surgical recovery score averages in patients&#xD;
      who had undergone oncologic surgery were tested.&#xD;

The patient evaluation form was created using the Nursing Outcomes Classification of the five-point Likert-type scale measuring the severity of descriptive features. The expression &quot;severely distressed&quot; was &quot;1 point&quot;; The expression &quot;significantly distressed&quot; was evaluated as &quot;2 points&quot;, &quot;moderately distressed&quot; as &quot;3 points&quot;, &quot;mildly distressed&quot; as &quot;4 points&quot;, and &quot;no</description>

The patient can get a minimum of nine and a maximum of 45 points. As the score for each evaluation question increased, the improvement was evaluated as positive. It was applied by telephone in the second week after discharge.</description>

    <description>In addition to the routine care they received, the patients in the intervention groups were given discharge training developed in the pre-discharge period. Discharge training consisted of a verbal and written information booklet containing instructions for the patient and the patient's caregiver on pain management, nutrition management, incision site care, strengthening self-care, returning to daily life activities, and colostomy care. Discharge training was given in the service after evaluating the surgical recovery status of the patient before discharge. The average duration of each training was 30-45 minutes. The patients were evaluated in terms of surgical recovery by calling by phone 2 weeks after discharge, 4 weeks and 8 weeks later. The developed education booklet was given to the patient and it was ensured that he could benefit from the information at home.</description>
