      This is a phase 2, non-randomized, interventional, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating&#xD;
      the efficacy of VEN-AZA as a bridge-to-transplant therapy in chemotherapy-treated adult&#xD;
      NPM1mut AML patients who experience molecular relapse or progression during treatment or&#xD;
      follow-up. Subjects will receive cycles of venetoclax plus azacitidine. After each cycle, MRD&#xD;
      will be evaluated and at any time of MRD-negativity, AlloSCT will be performed.&#xD;

      This is a phase 2, non-randomized, interventional, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating&#xD;
      the efficacy of VEN-AZA as a bridge-to-transplant therapy in chemotherapy-treated adult&#xD;
      NPM1mut AML patients who experience molecular relapse or progression during treatment or&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive venetoclax 400 mg orally QD on Days 1 - 28 plus azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SC&#xD;
      or IV daily for 7 days. Cycle Length: 28 Days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue treatment until subsequent alloSCT, documented morphological bone&#xD;
      marrow and/or extramedullary disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the&#xD;
      subject meets other protocol criteria for discontinuation (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each cycle, MRD will be evaluated. AlloSCT is recommended at any time of&#xD;
      MRD-negativity. After 6 cycles of treatment, regardless MRD status, patients will proceed to&#xD;
      alloSCT.&#xD;
