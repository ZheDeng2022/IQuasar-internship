  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A hip fracture is a large burden to the patient with increased mortality, pain and increased&#xD;
      need for daily assistance. Trochanteric fractures of the femur (FTF) represents about 35% of&#xD;
      the hip fractures. Today FTFs are mainly treated with internal fixation using sliding hips&#xD;
      screws (SHS) or intramedullary nail (IMN), whilst hip arthroplasty (THA/HA) is rarely used.&#xD;
      Despite advances in the design of the internal fixation implants there is a high failure rate&#xD;
      (35-51%), in particular in cases of FTFs classified as unstable fractures. Since the&#xD;
      introduction of hip arthroplasty in femoral neck fractures there has been a reduction in&#xD;
      complication rates, early mobilization and shorter hospital stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project is to investigate if treatment with hip arthroplasty in&#xD;
      unstable FTFs will increase the postoperative mobility, give a better general health outcome&#xD;
      for the patient, better quality of life and reduce re-operation rate for the patients&#xD;
      compared to those operated with the traditional IMN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proximal femoral fractures also termed &quot;hip&quot; fractures are one of the most common fractures&#xD;
      among adults over 50 years of age. With increase in life expectancy, the incidence of these&#xD;
      fractures is also increasing. By 2040, the number of these fractures are expected to double&#xD;
      in Norway. Trochanteric fractures of the femur (Fractura Trochanterica Femoris, FTF)&#xD;
      represents about 35% of the hip fractures in Norway . There are many classification systems&#xD;
      for FTFs, but The Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) have adopted the system developed by&#xD;
      the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Osteosynthese (AO ) group, and is the most commonly used in addition&#xD;
      to the Evans Jensens classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean age of hip fracture patients is 82 years for women and 78 for men. The comorbidity&#xD;
      in this patient group is high with large amount of dementia, sarcopenia and osteoporosis. The&#xD;
      one-year mortality rate after a hip fractures is 20-35%. According to the Norwegian Hip&#xD;
      Fracture Register 15 % of the hip fractures are unstable trochanteric fractures (AO&#xD;
      31A2.2-A3). The prognosis is poor, in particular for unstable (multi fragmented) fractures,&#xD;
      with reported complications up to 35-51 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantial research has established better understanding and best practice guidelines to&#xD;
      treat the femoral neck fractures, mostly with hip arthroplasty, however no superior method is&#xD;
      established for the unstable trochanteric fractures. 'Getting It Right First Time' is&#xD;
      important for these fragile patients, thus post-operative complications are associated with a&#xD;
      large increase in the mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, most of the FTFs are reduced and fixated with a sliding hip screw (SHS), although the&#xD;
      use of intramedullary nails (IMN) is increasing. RCTs have shown better survival of IMN&#xD;
      compared to SHS for the more distal FTFs and subtrochanteric fracture. Unstable FTFs (AO 31A2&#xD;
      - A3, EVJ III-V) have high reoperation rates (21-35%) when operated either with SHS or IMN.&#xD;
      Unacceptable shortening, external rotation deformity of the limb and long time to&#xD;
      recover/mobilization have been the problems with osteosynthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question is if hip arthroplasty can give a superior treatment outcome for patients&#xD;
      suffering from unstable subtypes of trochanteric hip fractures compared to the traditional&#xD;
      treatment with IMN. A randomized clinical trial is to be conducted comparing these two&#xD;
      treatment methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stavanger University Hospital (SUH) receives over 150 FTFs per year. About 1/3 of the FTFs&#xD;
      are of unstable fracture morphology. The planned study is a randomized clinical trial. The&#xD;
      randomization module will be provided by Klinisk forskningsenhet Midt-Norge (KlinForsk).&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups,&#xD;
      IMN versus hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be treated in accordance to a local operation protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intramedullary nails will be operated by a resident orthopedic surgeon with at least 2 years'&#xD;
      experience in fracture surgery or a consultant orthopedic surgeon (there must always be a&#xD;
      consultant orthopedic surgeon present in the surgical team). A long IMN must always be&#xD;
      utilized. Anatomical reposition or positive anterior and medial cortical support should be&#xD;
      strived to be achieved. If a large antero- or posteromedial fragment is present one should&#xD;
      consider an additional cerclage to fix the fragment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arthroplasty will be operated by a resident orthopedic surgeon with at least 2 years'&#xD;
      experience with hip arthroplasty surgery or by a consultant orthopedic surgeon subspecialized&#xD;
      in arthroplasty surgery, with competency within revision or difficult primary hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty surgery (there must always be a consultant orthopedic surgeon subspecialized in&#xD;
      arthroplasty surgery present in the surgical team). Posterior surgical approach will be used.&#xD;
      If a cup is to be utilized it must be a cemented dual-mobility cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have follow-up appointments at 2-, 6 and 12 months postoperative. Following&#xD;
      data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported outcome measures (HOOS and EQ5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timed up and go test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trendelenburg test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical leg length discrepancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological assessment from hip x-rays (AP and lateral)&#xD;

    <description>Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS).&#xD;
&quot;HOOS is developed as an instrument to assess the patients' opinion about their hip and associated problems. HOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and hip related Quality of life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The result can be plotted as an outcome profile.&#xD;
Above information about HOOS is copied from the authors of www.KOOS.nu&#xD;
Change in HOOS score will be observed from 2-, 6- and 12 months.</description>

    <description>EuroQol EQ-5D.&#xD;
&quot;The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.&quot;&#xD;
Change in EQ-5D score will be observed from 2-, 6- and 12 months.</description>
