      The aim of this study is to detect effect of oral zinc supplementation in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiomyopathies are group of heart diseases that influence cardiac muscles directly and are&#xD;
      not related to hypertension, congenital, valvular and pericardial diseases. The most common&#xD;
      type of cardiomyopathy is dilate cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dilated cardiomyopathy usually manifests as chronic systolic heart failure leading to&#xD;
      arrhythmias and sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trace elements are known to have a key role in myocardial metabolism. The human heart&#xD;
      requires energy from micro and macro nutrients both to regenerate proteins and cells, and to&#xD;
      support cyclic contractions. Heart failure is associated with neuro-hormonal activation&#xD;
      leading to elevated levels of inflammatory markers and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc is an essential micronutrient that impacts the cardiovascular system. There are multiple&#xD;
      potential pathophysiologic causes for zinc deficiency in heart failure as result of impaired&#xD;
      micronutrient consumption, hyper inflammatory state, diminished absorption and hyperzincuria&#xD;
      from heart failure medications. Zinc deficiency may play a role as primary and possible&#xD;
      reversible cause of dilated cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma zinc levels have been reported in multiple observational studies of patients with&#xD;
      heart failure particularly in studies of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, serum zinc levels&#xD;
      have been found to be low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small but growing body of evidence suggesting the role for oral zinc supplementation in the&#xD;
      management of dilated cardiomyopathy however further evaluation of the impact on outcome is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
