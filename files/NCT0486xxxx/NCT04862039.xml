      Labor is widely recognized as one of the most painful experience possible. The standard&#xD;
      analgesic treatment currently consists of pharmacological methods. Adverse effects,&#xD;
      complication risks, psychological effects, limit these techniques as well as high costs.&#xD;
      These limits concurred to the application of these techniques mainly on demand and not&#xD;
      routinely. have not, as of today, met a large scientific consensus, as shown by many recent&#xD;
      Cochrane reviews. A promising perspective for non-pharmacological analgesia seems to be&#xD;
      offered by Virtual Reality (VR) devices, which have been applied to many different medical&#xD;
      areas.&#xD;

      Labor is widely recognized as one of the most painful experience possible. The standard&#xD;
      analgesic treatment currently consists of pharmacological methods. Adverse effects,&#xD;
      complication risks, psychological effects, limit these techniques as well as high costs.&#xD;
      These limits concurred to the application of these techniques mainly on demand and not&#xD;
      routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons, it is not surprising the interest in offering women valid non-invasive&#xD;
      and cheaper options to relieve them from pain. As of today many alternative techniques have&#xD;
      been proposed, many of which have not, as of today, met a large scientific consensus, as&#xD;
      shown by many recent Cochrane reviews. A promising perspective for non-pharmacological&#xD;
      analgesia seems to be offered by Virtual Reality (VR) devices, which have been applied to&#xD;
      many different medical areas. Recently Frey et al. have experimented in a pilot study the&#xD;
      application of this technique to women during labor, obtaining interesting results. The&#xD;
      authors of this study point, in the discussion of the scientific paper, to the necessity of&#xD;
      developing virtual reality experiences more specific to labor and suggest different&#xD;
      implementations, such as specific instructions for women (changes of position, breathing&#xD;
      techniques) greater comfort (it is worth noticing the use on our side of exclusively wireless&#xD;
      devices) and the implementation of the device with biofeedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to learning from these suggestions, we tried to imagine VR in a different way:&#xD;
      firstly as complementary, not alternative to the role of the midwife personnel, who will play&#xD;
      a central role in our experimental treatment enriching the virtual reality scenario with&#xD;
      their instructions, presence and motivational feedback; secondly we tried to imagine VR as a&#xD;
      guide through labor, more than a alienation and distraction tool.&#xD;
