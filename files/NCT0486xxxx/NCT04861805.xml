  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multicenter, multinational two-stage FIH&#xD;
      feasibility followed by pivotal study in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 7 visits spread out across two phases over 1 year. The clinical&#xD;
      investigation will end at 30 days post-implantation. The subsequent 3-month, 6-month and&#xD;
      1-year follow-up (FU) visits will thus be considered post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FIH study will start by evaluating the safety and feasibility of the device and study&#xD;
      design of the Vienna Aortic Valve SE System in 10 patients with SSAS. The FIH patients must&#xD;
      meet all study eligibility criteria. Safety and feasibility assessments for patients in the&#xD;
      FIH period will include implantation success, hemodynamic performance and monitoring of&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs). Early FIH data (i.e. data from the first 10 patients to have completed&#xD;
      visit 3 at hospital discharge) will be provided to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      (DSMB) for review during which study enrollment will be paused. After reviewing the safety&#xD;
      results from the FIH study, the DSMB will make a recommendation on whether the study may&#xD;
      continue as planned. FIH patients will continue to be followed up for 1 year as per protocol.&#xD;
      Data from the 10 FIH patients and the subsequent 75 patients will be analyzed together for&#xD;
      the pivotal study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon a decision from the DSMB to proceed with the study, enrolment of patients will resume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation phase comprises 4 visits (V1 to V4). After implantation of the IMD&#xD;
      at visit 2, early performance and safety assessment of the device will be performed at 30&#xD;
      days (V4). The post-market surveillance phase comprises 3 visits (V5-V7), extending from 3&#xD;
      months to 1 year post-implantation, to evaluate the long-term safety and performance profile&#xD;
      of the device.&#xD;

    <description>The Vienna Aortic Valve SE System (valve sizes: 23, 26, 29 and 31 mm) is a biological valve system intended to be implanted percutaneously in the aortic valve via the transfemoral route. The device is made of bovine pericardium leaflets and a pericardium fabric skirt sutured on a radiopaque nitinol self-expanding stent system, designed for supra-annular positioning to optimize hemodynamic performance. The Vienna Aortic Valve SE System is repositionable and retrievable allowing a more optimal prosthesis positioning to minimize residual paravalvular regurgitation, atrioventricular conduction block/disturbances, and mitral or coronary compromise. The valve comes already pre-mounted on the delivery system, ready to be used, eliminating the need for assembly and crimping of the device prior to valve implantation.</description>
