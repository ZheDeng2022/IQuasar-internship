  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will investigate the utility of Fludeoxyglucose (18F) fluoromisonidazole&#xD;
      (FMISO), in patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (stage II-IV disease), to&#xD;
      monitor and predict the effect of immunotherapy. This is a parallel imaging study to current&#xD;
      treatment strategies and no clinical decisions or outcomes will be based on the imaging. If&#xD;
      promising, this data will be used to design larger trials. A total of 20 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited for this study. This trial will not designate the participant's treatment plan;&#xD;
      they will be eligible based on their treatment plan designated from their oncologist.&#xD;

      Pre-study visit/Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will take about 1 hour. Participants will be asked to sign this consent form&#xD;
      before any study procedures. Once consented, vital signs will be taken, a blood draw to&#xD;
      determine kidney function, and a pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential. Participants will be asked to fill out an MRI questionnaire and they will be given&#xD;
      an additional information sheet on the gadolinium-based contrast agent, Prohance, that the&#xD;
      FDA requires for all patients receiving this type of drug. Because the PET/MRI is smaller&#xD;
      than most MRI scanners, participants will have a PET/MRI fit test to ensure a proper fit. If&#xD;
      eligible for this study, participants will be scheduled for the first PET imaging visit which&#xD;
      will occur before they start immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study participants will be scheduled for up to 3 imaging visits. The first&#xD;
      imaging visit must be performed before participants start immunotherapy and is necessary for&#xD;
      remaining eligible for this study. If, for some reason, the participant misses the following&#xD;
      (i.e, 2nd) scheduled imaging visit, they are still eligible to continue in this study as long&#xD;
      as they can complete a second imaging visit after finishing the 1st cycle of immunotherapy&#xD;
      and before starting the 4th cycle of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Visit #1&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will take about 4 hours and will take place before the participant starts&#xD;
      immunotherapy. No special preparation is required before the study. Upon arrival at the&#xD;
      Advanced Imaging Facility (AIF) participants will have a chance to have any remaining&#xD;
      questions answered about the procedure. Baseline vital signs, including resting blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse rate, and breathing rate, will be measured and recorded. Women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test. An intravenous, plastic catheter will be&#xD;
      placed in the arm and participants will be injected with the investigational radioactive&#xD;
      drug, [18F]FMISO. Afterwards participants will wait 120 minutes to allow the drug to&#xD;
      distribute throughout their body. Participants will then be positioned in the PET/MRI&#xD;
      scanner. Based on the PET/MRI fit test, participants will either be positioned face down on&#xD;
      their stomach or on their back. Once positioned in the PET/MRI, participants will be imaged&#xD;
      for up to 60 minutes during which time they must remain still. During imaging, participants&#xD;
      will receive an injection of FDA approved gadolinium-contrast agent called Prohance&#xD;
      (gadoteridol) to improve the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During any of the imaging visits, if the PET/MRI is unavailable due to scheduling problems or&#xD;
      maintenance, participants may be imaged in the PET/CT scanner located in an adjacent room in&#xD;
      the AIF. Participants will be scanned for up to 60 minutes. Before or after the PET/CT, but&#xD;
      during this visit, participants will receive a separate MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all procedures are complete, the plastic tube will be removed. Unless participants&#xD;
      cannot have children because of surgery or other medical reasons, they must agree to use an&#xD;
      effective form of birth control for 24 hours after taking the study drug. Effective forms of&#xD;
      birth control include birth control pills, patch, intrauterine device (IUD), condom, sponge,&#xD;
      diaphragm with spermicide, or avoiding sexual activity that could cause pregnancy.&#xD;
      Participants may resume normal activities after that 24-hour waiting period. Participants&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone 48 hours after the procedure to make sure they have not had&#xD;
      any type of reaction from the investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Visit #2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second imaging visit will take about 4 hours and will be scheduled after the participant&#xD;
      has finished their 1st cycle of immunotherapy and before they start their 2nd cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No special preparation is required before the study. Upon arrival at the Advanced Imaging&#xD;
      Facility (AIF) participants will have a chance to have any remaining questions answered about&#xD;
      the procedure. Baseline vital signs, including resting blood pressure, pulse rate, and&#xD;
      breathing rate, will be measured and recorded. Women of childbearing potential will have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. An intravenous, plastic catheter will be placed in the arm and participants&#xD;
      will be injected with the investigational radioactive drug, [18F]FMISO. Afterwards&#xD;
      participants will wait 120 minutes to allow the drug to distribute throughout their body.&#xD;
      Participants will then be positioned in the PET/MRI scanner. Based on the PET/MRI fit test,&#xD;
      participants will either be positioned face down on their stomach or on their back. Once&#xD;
      positioned in the PET/MRI, participants will be imaged for up to 60 minutes during which time&#xD;
      they must remain still. During imaging, participants will receive an injection of FDA&#xD;
      approved gadolinium-contrast agent called Prohance (gadoteridol) to improve the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants miss this imaging visit but have completed the 1st imaging visit, they are&#xD;
      still eligible to continue in this study if they can complete Imaging Visit #3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all procedures are complete, the plastic tube will be removed. Unless participants&#xD;
      cannot have children because of surgery or other medical reasons, they must agree to use an&#xD;
      effective form of birth control for 24 hours after taking the study drug. Effective forms of&#xD;
      birth control include birth control pills, patch, IUD, condom, sponge, diaphragm with&#xD;
      spermicide, or avoiding sexual activity that could cause pregnancy. Participants may resume&#xD;
      normal activities after that 24-hour waiting period. Participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone 48 hours after the procedure to make sure they have not had any type of reaction&#xD;
      from the investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Visit #3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third PET imaging visit will take about 4 hours and will be scheduled after participants&#xD;
      finish their 2nd cycle of immunotherapy and before they start their 4th cycle of&#xD;
      immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      No special preparation is required before the study. Upon arrival at the Advanced Imaging&#xD;
      Facility (AIF) participants will have a chance to have any remaining questions answered about&#xD;
      the procedure. Baseline vital signs, including resting blood pressure, pulse rate, and&#xD;
      breathing rate, will be measured and recorded. Women of childbearing potential will have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. An intravenous, plastic catheter will be placed in the arm and participants&#xD;
      will be injected with the investigational radioactive drug, [18F]FMISO. Afterwards&#xD;
      participants will wait 120 minutes to allow the drug to distribute throughout their body.&#xD;
      Participants will then be positioned in the PET/MRI scanner. Based on the PET/MRI fit test,&#xD;
      participants will either be positioned face down on their stomach or on their back. Once&#xD;
      positioned in the PET/MRI, participants will be imaged for up to 60 minutes during which time&#xD;
      they must remain still. During imaging, participants will receive an injection of FDA&#xD;
      approved gadolinium-contrast agent called Prohance (gadoteridol) to improve the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all procedures are complete, the plastic tube will be removed. Unless participants&#xD;
      cannot have children because of surgery or other medical reasons, they must agree to use an&#xD;
      effective form of birth control for 24 hours after taking the study drug. Effective forms of&#xD;
      birth control include birth control pills, patch, IUD, condom, sponge, diaphragm with&#xD;
      spermicide, or avoiding sexual activity that could cause pregnancy. Participants may resume&#xD;
      normal activities after that 24-hour waiting period. Participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone 48 hours after the procedure to make sure they have not had any type of reaction&#xD;
      from the investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will follow participants for up to 5 years or to disease progression by&#xD;
      reviewing their medical records including pathology data obtained from surgery to see how&#xD;
      they are doing.&#xD;

    <description>The patient will have a plastic peripheral intravenous catheter placed in the arm for administration of 10 millicuries (mCi)/10milliliters (mL) [18F]FMISO (≤ 15 µg/injected dose) followed by an uptake of 120 minutes.&#xD;
The injection will be infused nominally over one minute followed by a saline flush. After uptake, the patient will be scanned on the PET/MR for 60 minutes and will receive a contrast injection of gadoteridol during the dynamic sequence of the exam. The patient can be scanned on the PET/CT if the PET/MR is unavailable. During this study patients will be scheduled for up to 3 imaging visits. The first imaging visit will be at baseline prior to starting immunotherapy and is required for study eligibility. If for some reason the patient cannot complete the remaining 2 imaging visits, only one additional imaging visit during the identified times is necessary to remain eligible.</description>
