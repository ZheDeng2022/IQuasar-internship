  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 disease has caused a worldwide pandemic. However, it was necessary to reduce the&#xD;
      transmission of the disease as much as possible. The highest risk of transmission is airway&#xD;
      management. Medical personnel responsible for airway management are at the greatest risk. One&#xD;
      of the most important ways to protect anesthetists from contamination is to use PPE. But, it&#xD;
      should be considered that there is some disadvantage about using PPE. The investigators aimed&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of the use of personal protective equipment and standard uniform&#xD;
      during airway management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Objective: The investigators aimed to compare the effects of the use of personal protective&#xD;
      equipment and standard uniform during airway management using direct laryngoscope, GlideScope&#xD;
      video laryngoscope, C-Mac video laryngoscope, I-gel laryngeal mask airway , ProSeal laryngeal&#xD;
      mask airway and Frova intubation catheter on the manikin that created both difficult airway&#xD;
      and normal airway conditions in the Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation at the&#xD;
      Derince Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The study will carry out with 24 participants in Health Sciences&#xD;
      University Kocaeli Derince Health Education and Research Center. In the study, a simulation&#xD;
      manikin will use to evaluate the effect of personal protective equipment use on airway&#xD;
      management. Anesthesia technicians, anesthesia residents and specialists will include as&#xD;
      participants. As demographic data, the clinical positions of the participants, their&#xD;
      experiences with each airway method and the use of personal protective equipment, age,&#xD;
      gender, height and weight information will be recorded. Each procedure will be explained to&#xD;
      the participants by an anesthesiology specialist and a resident. Then the participants&#xD;
      perform their procedure first with standard uniform and then by wearing personal protective&#xD;
      equipment. Endotracheal intubation with direct laryngoscope, GlideScope video laryngoscope,&#xD;
      C-Mac video laryngoscope and Frova intubation catheter followed by I-gel and ProSeal&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway will be used, respectively. Each procedure will be carried out by&#xD;
      creating normal and difficult airway conditions, respectively. Time, number of attempts and&#xD;
      presence of optimization maneuver will be recorded for each procedure. Modified CLS (Cormack&#xD;
      Lehane Score) and POGO (Percentage Of Glottic Opening) scores will be also recorded during&#xD;
      intubation procedures. Each participant will be asked to give a score between 1 and 100 using&#xD;
      the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in order to evaluate the difficulty of intervention after&#xD;
      each procedure subjectively and it will be recorded. Finally, the other subjective effects of&#xD;
      personal protective equipment using on participants (such as sweating, feeling of warmth)&#xD;
      will be asked.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Percentage of Glottic Opening Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of Glottic Opening describes the percentage of the glottic opening as percentages (0-100). Number 100 describes that the participants see all glottic openings. Number 0 describes that nothing is seen.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale of using personal protective equipment</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale is a scale that converts a subjective property to digital data. It has values between 0-100. Generally it is used for describing pain level. But it is used for describing the difficulty of attempts in this study. Number 0 explains that the attempt is very easy and number 100 is very difficult.</description>
