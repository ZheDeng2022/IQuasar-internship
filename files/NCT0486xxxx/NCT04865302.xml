      This is a prospective observational pilot study investigating if skin-to-skin care (SSC) has&#xD;
      an influence on cerebral oxygenation and perfusion measured with near-infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      (NIRS) compared to incubator care in ventilated preterm neonates on the first day after&#xD;
      birth.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kangaroo mother care (KMC) or skin-to-skin care (SSC) is a routine method of care in preterm&#xD;
      neonates in neonatal intensive care units around the world. SSC is mostly defined as the&#xD;
      skin-to-skin contact of the infant with the mother's or father's chest, which has been proven&#xD;
      to reduce mortality, decrease severe illness, nosocomial infections and the length of&#xD;
      hospital stay as well as to improve growth, breastfeeding and mother-child-relationship.&#xD;
      During the last years several studies were performed showing that SSC provides comparable&#xD;
      neonatal physiological stability compared to routine incubator care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) enables non-invasive, continuous monitoring of oxygenation&#xD;
      and perfusion in different tissues. Several studies have shown that SSC has no negative&#xD;
      influence on cerebral oxygenation saturation and physiological parameters compared to routine&#xD;
      incubator care in preterm infants with respiratory support after the 5th day after birth.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, until now there is no information on cerebral oxygenation and physiological&#xD;
      parameters during SSC compared to routine incubator care in preterm neonates with respiratory&#xD;
      support during the first 24 hours after birth, when transition still takes place and may&#xD;
      cause unstable vital signs in neonates. Cerebral hypoxia as well as hyperoxia can cause&#xD;
      severe brain damage due to perfusion disturbances, especially in ventilated preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To assess, if the burden of cerebral hypoxia (calculated as the area under the&#xD;
      curve outside the tissue oxygenation (cStO2) target range of 55% - 76%) in preterm neonates&#xD;
      with respiratory support is different during SSC compared to routine incubator care on the&#xD;
      first day after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims: To assess, if SSC has an influence on cFTOE (cerebral fractional tissue&#xD;
      oxygen extraction) and routine monitoring parameters (arterial oxygen saturation [SpO2],&#xD;
      heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR], mean arterial blood pressure [MABP], temperature) in&#xD;
      preterm neonates with respiratory support compared to routine incubator care on the first day&#xD;
      after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Preterm neonates &lt;37+0 weeks of gestation with respiratory support admitted&#xD;
      to the Division of Neonatology, Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical&#xD;
      University of Graz after vaginal delivery or caesarean section will be eligible for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Patients and maternal medical history and main diagnoses, as well as routinely&#xD;
      sampled laboratory results, provided therapy and respiratory support will be documented in&#xD;
      each neonate.´&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: For NIRS measurements the OxyPrem 1.4. (OxyPrem AG, Zurich, Switzerland) will&#xD;
      be used. The NIRS measurements will take place once during the first day after birth before /&#xD;
      during / after routine SSC and will last for 180 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After feeding the neonates will be brought in a prone position in the incubator and the NIRS&#xD;
      sensor will be applied on the forehead for continuous cStO2 measurements throughout the study&#xD;
      period. The neonate will rest in this position for 60 minutes. Afterwards the neonate will be&#xD;
      brought on the mother's or father's chest (skin to skin) in a prone position and will stay in&#xD;
      this position for 60 minutes. Finally the neonates will be brought back into the incubator&#xD;
      for another 60 minutes in prone position. After 180 minutes the study period is over and the&#xD;
      NIRS sensor will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, NIRS will be combined with routine monitoring, such as pulse oxymetry (SpO2,&#xD;
      HR), blood pressure measurements and measurements of temperature. Data will be stored in a&#xD;
      polygraphic system (alpha-trace digitalMM, B.E.S.T. Medical Systems, Austria) for further&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
