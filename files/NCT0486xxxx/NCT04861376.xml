  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Maintaining normal levels of lipid indicators can significantly reduce the risk of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and mortality. Empirical evidence suggests that&#xD;
      adherence to Pueraria lobata and Pueraria thomsonii is useful for improving dyslipidemia, but&#xD;
      evidence from randomized controlled trials is lacking. This randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      controlled trial is therefore designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pueraria lobata&#xD;
      and Pueraria thomsonii for dyslipidemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pueraria is an important Chinese herbal medicine. The Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic&#xD;
      of China classifies the Pueraria as Pueraria lobata and Pueraria thomsonii according to the&#xD;
      different sources of the plant, both of them is sweet, pungent and cool in nature, and has&#xD;
      the effects of relieving fever, quenching thirst, penetrating rashes, raising the Yang to&#xD;
      stop diarrhea, activating the meridians and detoxifying alcohol. As early as in the Han&#xD;
      Dynasty, Zhongjing Zhang's &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; described the famous formula&#xD;
      &quot;Pueraria Tang&quot;, which is still an important formula for relieving exterior syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, the preparations of Pueraria lobata and Pueraria thomsonii are widely&#xD;
      used to treat headache, dizziness, hypertension, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and other diseases. For example, the puerarin injection has the effects&#xD;
      of dilating blood vessels, slowing down heart rate, reducing myocardial oxygen consumption&#xD;
      and improving blood circulation in the heart and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the puerarin has been shown to be effective in a variety of cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      as of now, it is unclear whether Pueraria lobata and Pueraria thomsonii can be used as part&#xD;
      of the daily diet to regulate blood lipids and improve dyslipidemia. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      this study is to conduct a randomized, double-blind controlled trial that includes patients&#xD;
      with mildly elevated lipids to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pueraria lobata and&#xD;
      Pueraria thomsonii for dyslipidemia.&#xD;
