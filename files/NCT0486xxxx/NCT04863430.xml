  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is a highly heterogeneous tumor. The most commonly used clinical&#xD;
      classifications of gastric cancer are Lauren classification (intestinal, diffuse, mixed) and&#xD;
      World Health Organization(WHO) classification (papillary adenocarcinoma, tubular&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, mucinous glands cancer and low-adhesion cancer). Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
      the stomach (HAS) is a special and rare type of gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with ordinary gastric cancer, HAS has unique clinicopathological characteristics,&#xD;
      prone to liver metastasis and lymph node metastasis, has a highly aggressive and malignant&#xD;
      biological behavior, a worse prognosis than alpha fetoprotein(AFP) normal gastric cancer, and&#xD;
      is easily confused with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). There is the possibility of&#xD;
      misdiagnosis and mistreatment, so it has gradually attracted people's attention. Most of the&#xD;
      domestic and foreign literature on HAS in the past 30 years are retrospective cases or small&#xD;
      sample reports, and there are few prospective studies. There is no standard treatment plan&#xD;
      for HAS. The main treatment is based on gastric adenocarcinoma. The clinical treatment&#xD;
      principle is a comprehensive treatment plan with surgical resection as the mainstay,&#xD;
      supplemented by systemic chemotherapy and local interventional therapy. This type of gastric&#xD;
      cancer has a relatively high degree of malignancy, rapid progress of the disease, and easy&#xD;
      recurrence after surgery. There is no standard treatment plan in China and other foreign&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib with oxaliplatin&#xD;
      and S-1 treatment advanced hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach.&#xD;
