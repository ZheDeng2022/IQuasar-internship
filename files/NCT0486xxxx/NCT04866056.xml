  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies how well Jaktinib and azacytidine work in treating patients&#xD;
      with myelodysplastic syndromes with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm with myelofibrosis. Giving Jaktinib and azacytidine may&#xD;
      be an effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm with myelofibrosis.&#xD;
