      A phase I, experimental dose finding, open label, clinical infection, safety and viral&#xD;
      detection optimisation in healthy volunteers aged 18-30, previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I dose escalation challenge study in which increasing titres of wild-type&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (1x10^1 TCID_50, 1x10^2TCID_50 and 1x10^3TCID_50) will be administered&#xD;
      intranasally to different groups of volunteers in order to achieve a 50% (+/-10%) attack rate&#xD;
      as determined by quantitative live viral detection and/or qPCR detection in naso-pharyngeal&#xD;
      secretions at two consecutive 12 hourly time points (at least 24 hours after inoculation). A&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and quantitative virology at each dose&#xD;
      level and will recommend continuation, dose escalation or de-escalation based on emergent&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue treatment with a single infusion of 1200mg intravenous monoclonal antibody cocktail&#xD;
      (REGN-COV2) will commence immediately after any warning symptoms or signs of COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      beyond mild disease. Once the optimal dose of wildtype SARS-CoV-2 has been identified,&#xD;
      further challenge infections in group 2 may proceed without REGN-COV2 treatment (following&#xD;
      DSMB review of infection rate, viral load and clinical data). Volunteers will remain in&#xD;
      isolation rooms within the clinical trials unit for a minimum of 14 days post inoculation and&#xD;
      until demonstration of the absence of live virus in two sequential samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be recruited who are able and willing to attend regular screening and&#xD;
      outpatient follow up visits at the Clinical Centre for Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine.&#xD;
      They will be challenged and admitted for a quarantine period within rooms with appropriate&#xD;
      ventilation to prevent spread of infection (negative pressure rooms or positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation lobby) located at Oxford University Hospitals NHS trust or Oxford Clinical&#xD;
      Research Facility (OxCRF) depending on bed availability. It is planned that a total of up to&#xD;
      64 participants (44 with option of an additional 20) will be enrolled across 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be funded by the Wellcome Trust.&#xD;
