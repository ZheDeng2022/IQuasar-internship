      Purpose The purpose of the study is to evaluate if training with oral screen IQoro® improves&#xD;
      swallowing in patients with dysphagia after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Inpatient from a stroke unit in Sweden who have been assessed with fiberoptic&#xD;
      endoscopic evaluation of swallowing(FEES) which proves swallowing difficulties (dysphagia)&#xD;
      were recruited. The participants were randomise to control- or intervention group. Both&#xD;
      groups received usual care. The intervention group were instructed to oral screen (IQoro®)&#xD;
      training for 13 weeks. Follow up with FEES was made 13 weeks post of recruitment. The assess&#xD;
      with FEES was recorded and the recordings are going to be analyzed afterwards to compare the&#xD;
      swallowing ability between baseline and follow up in group and between group.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in swallowing function due to secretion in the pharynx.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to follow up (13 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in swallowing function based on the parameter secretion in the pharynx. Estimates from &quot;Secretion severity rating scale&quot;, 0-3. 0= Normal rating and 3= Secretion in the laryngeal vestibule that are not cleared.&#xD;
Estimates are based on recording from FEES.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in swallowing function due to aspiration and penetration.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to follow up (13 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in swallowing function based on the parameters aspiration and penetration in the pharynx. Estimates from &quot;Penetration aspiration scale&quot;, 0-8. 0= No entry of material into the larynx or trachea, 8= Materials enter the trachea with no attempt to clear.&#xD;
Estimates are based on recording from FEES.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in swallowing function due to residual in the pharynx.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to follow up (13 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in swallowing function due to residual in the pharynx, 0-1. 0= No or a small amount of residual, 1= A pool of residual after the first swallow.&#xD;
Estimates are based on recording from FEES.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The patient's experience of swallowing</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to follow up (13 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The patient estimates its own swallowing ability on the basis of a &quot;Visual analogue scale&quot; (VAS), 0-100. 0= No affected swallowing function and 100= Very affected swallowing function).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in swallowing function due to oral intake.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to follow up (13 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in oral intake estimates from &quot;Functional oral intake scale&quot; (FOIS), 1-7. 1= Nothing by mouth, 7= Total oral diet with no restrictions.&#xD;
Estimates are based on advice the patient received regarding the oral intake.</description>
