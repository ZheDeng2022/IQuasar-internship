      Introduction The trend of flexitarian eating patterns is on the rise, with young adults&#xD;
      amongst the biggest adopters claiming health and environmental reasons to reduce red meat&#xD;
      intake. Nutrient dense meat and animal products are often the lynchpin of these diets, even&#xD;
      when consumed only occasionally and in moderate amounts. Red meat provides forms and&#xD;
      concentrations of essential proteins, lipids, and micronutrients that are scarce in&#xD;
      exclusively vegetarian regimens. The aim of this investigation is to consider the effects of&#xD;
      moderate consumption of lean red meat as part of an otherwise vegetarian balanced diet and&#xD;
      its impact on biomarkers of sustained health and wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analyses A cohort of healthy, young (20-34 years) male and female participants&#xD;
      will take part in two-arm parallel, randomised-controlled trial for a duration of 12 weeks,&#xD;
      with a 3-month post follow-up. The trial will commence with a two-week assessment period&#xD;
      followed by allocation to the intervention arms. The intervention will include the&#xD;
      consumption of red meat or meat-alternatives three times per week for 10 weeks. Blood samples&#xD;
      of the participants will be measured for changes in erythrocyte fatty acid distribution,&#xD;
      circulating amino acids, neurotransmitters, markers of mineral status and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers. Questionnaires to assess wellbeing and mental health will be undertaken every two&#xD;
      weeks. Body composition, physical function test, blood measurements will be assessed at&#xD;
      allocation (t0), week five into the intervention (t5) and post intervention (t10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion To our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating&#xD;
      the overarching health consequences of consuming NZ pasture fed red meat or no meat, as part&#xD;
      of a healthy diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination The trial was approved by the New Zealand Ministry of Health's&#xD;
      Health and Disability Ethics Committees (20/STH/157).&#xD;

      Study Design and Setting The study is a parallel RCT comprising a 2-week pre-intervention&#xD;
      assessment, a 10-week intervention period and a 22-week post follow up. Participants will all&#xD;
      eat a balanced plant-based basal diet and be randomised to also consume either red meat&#xD;
      ('Flexitarian' arm) or a meat substitute ('Vegetarian' arm). The meat will be pasture-raised&#xD;
      beef and lamb butchered and packaged to our specifications in New Zealand, while the meat&#xD;
      substitute will be commercially available plant-based products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognising that there are many interpretations of the terms vegetarian and flexitarian, in&#xD;
      this study we define vegetarian as ovo-lacto vegetarian and flexitarian as 'a vegetarian diet&#xD;
      with moderate amounts of red meat'. Both arms can consume eggs and dairy products, but no&#xD;
      chicken, pork or fish, and no red meat other than that supplied by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed around pairs of young adult consumers who share meals and are therefore&#xD;
      likely to engage over the values and challenges of developing a healthy lifestyle. Each&#xD;
      couple/household unit (see Recruitment) will receive a weekly delivery of a vegetarian meal&#xD;
      kit containing complete ingredients for cooking 3-4 evening meals. Depending on their&#xD;
      allocation, the couple will also receive an allotment of frozen red meat or meat-analogue to&#xD;
      use for preparing 3 additional evening meals. To facilitate cooking and keep the behaviours&#xD;
      of the arms aligned, we will provide recipe cards, shopping guidance and video instructions.&#xD;
      All other meals during the week are self-catered and must adhere to study guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantity of meat will be sufficient to provide 350-500 g cooked weight per person per&#xD;
      week. This conforms to the latest international recommendations for maximum intake 7 and the&#xD;
      reported typical frequencies of red meat consumption. The meat alternative will be similar in&#xD;
      quantity, form and function. It is vegetarian-friendly and serves to balance the total&#xD;
      protein and fat intake of the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in objective and self-assessed subjective health variables over time and between arms&#xD;
      will be investigated. These include physical function, body composition, metabolic health&#xD;
      biomarkers and psychological wellbeing.&#xD;
