  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN) is a safe procedure and rapid wound healing,&#xD;
      affecting the quality of life. The physiology of postoperative pain after LLDN has been&#xD;
      attributed to reasons such as tissue damage, residual pneumoperitoneum, and diaphragm&#xD;
      irritation. In terms of patient comfort after LLDN, pain control is provided by IV&#xD;
      analgesics, local anesthetic injection instead of incision, and regional techniques. Regional&#xD;
      anesthesia techniques for postoperative pain control have become popular in recent years.&#xD;
      Today, many blocks are performed with ultrasonography (USG) to reduce the severity of pain&#xD;
      after laparoscopic and open surgeries. In 2016, Forero et al. erector spinae plane block&#xD;
      (ESPB) had been defined and used successfully in thoracic and abdominal surgeries. In our&#xD;
      clinic, peripheral nerve blocks such as intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and&#xD;
      ESPB are applied for postoperative analgesia. The method of analgesia suitable for the&#xD;
      surgery and the patient is explained to the patients, and the method preferred by the patient&#xD;
      is applied. This study; In LLDN operations, it was aimed to compare the bilateral ESP block&#xD;
      performed with USG in terms of postoperative pain scores and opioid analgesic consumption&#xD;
      compared to patients without any block. Before the operation, the anesthesiologist in charge&#xD;
      of the anesthesia outpatient clinic provides information about both anesthesia and&#xD;
      postoperative pain management methods suitable for surgery. This is the standard practice in&#xD;
      our clinic. Before anesthesia, anesthesia and analgesia methods will be briefly reminded to&#xD;
      the patient who has come for the operation. He/she will be asked if he/she wants to apply&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia. Block procedure will be applied to patients who want ESP block.&#xD;
      Standard analgesia will be applied to all patients. Regardless of the study, patients who&#xD;
      underwent LLDN operation will be interviewed in the postoperative period with or without an&#xD;
      ESP block for postoperative analgesia. The data and postoperative evaluations of the patients&#xD;
      who agreed to participate in the study will be recorded for study purposes. The patient data&#xD;
      will be taken from the hospital registration system.&#xD;
