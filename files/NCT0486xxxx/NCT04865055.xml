  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the photo-protector effect of BC_3 (E212657) formulated in SPF30 compared to&#xD;
      SPF30 alone on real sun exposure induced pigmentation in healthy volunteers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the photo-protective cosmetic products&#xD;
      (758637 10 and 758637 15) and to compare the photo-protection potential of the two products,&#xD;
      after its application for 7 days on healthy female volunteers under the normal conditions of&#xD;
      use planned by the sponsor. The study will also evaluate the tolerance of the two products on&#xD;
      the skin of healthy female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photo-protection is generally concerned with the reduction of exposure to ultra violet&#xD;
      radiations, specifically UV-B and UV-A, primarily from the sun. The harmful radiations from&#xD;
      the sun can cause various skin issues which can be as minor as skin tanning and as major as&#xD;
      skin cancer. The photo-protective products can help in protection of the skin from the&#xD;
      harmful sun radiation either by blocking them or absorbing them and preventing the rays to&#xD;
      damage the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formula number of both the products are 758637 10 and 758637 15. The SPF value of both&#xD;
      the product is 30.&#xD;
