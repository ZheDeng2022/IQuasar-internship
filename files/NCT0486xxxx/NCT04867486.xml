  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, Investigators will observe the reliability and validity of dynamic gait index&#xD;
      in Urdu language in Pakistani geriatric population with balance impairments.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of study is to translate and culturally adapt DGI into Urdu language and secondly to&#xD;
      investigate the reliability and validity of DGI in geriatrics Pakistani population.This study&#xD;
      will be cross sectional survey in which convenience sampling technique will be used to enroll&#xD;
      participants as per pre-defined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of study will help to know the validity and reliability of DGI in Urdu version&#xD;
      with balance impairments in geriatric population.The reliability of the scale will be checked&#xD;
      through internal consistency and test-retest methods. Internal consistency will be analyzed&#xD;
      with Cronbach's alpha value.Test-retest reliability will be assessed using an intraclass&#xD;
      correlation coefficient with 60 patients&#xD;

    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>The Dynamic Gait Index tests the participant's ability to maintain balance while walking under different dynamic conditions and at the same time to react to different task requirements. An order scale with four points in the range from 0 to 3. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest functional level and &quot;3&quot; the highest functional level. The score of 19 predicts falls in the elderly and&gt; 22 out of 24 in safe ambulances</description>

    <description>The Dynamic Gait Index tests the participant's ability to maintain balance while walking under different dynamic conditions and at the same time to react to different task requirements. An order scale with four points in the range from 0 to 3. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest functional level and &quot;3&quot; the highest functional level. The score of 19 predicts falls in the elderly and&gt; 22 out of 24 in safe ambulances falls is the dynamic gait index.Each object is marked at a scale of 0 to 3, 3 with standard and 0 showing led to problems DGI's 24 is the highest result possible</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance scale is an objective assessment of balance performance based on 14 items common to everyday activities. it is a 14-item scale that rates 0 (unable to perform) to 4 (normal performance) for each item. The total score is 56 points. Higher score higher balance ability.</description>

      <textblock>
        Elderly people, especially those of the advanced ages, suffer from coexistent disorders,&#xD;
        many of which are chronically degenerative, falls and gait disorders are common issues.&#xD;
        About one-third of all elderly people aged 65 as well as above fall at least once a year.&#xD;
        Injury, physical impairments, morbidity, cognitive side effects, and even disability are&#xD;
        all linked to fall because equilibrium and postural control are essential for the everyday&#xD;
        work.&#xD;
