      The aim of this study is to check for the presence of COVID 19 antibodies [Covid-19, GAD-65,&#xD;
      IA-2, ICA] in the blood of laboring women who have been exposed to either the virus itself or&#xD;
      to the vaccine during pregnancy . The same test will be done on cord blood. Then the types of&#xD;
      antibodies will be compared, between maternal and neonatal blood. The blood will be taken&#xD;
      along with routine blood tests without additional punctures of Mother or Baby.&#xD;

      T1D is caused by an autoimmune reaction to proteins that cause the destruction of the&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cells. The incidence of childhood Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is continuously&#xD;
      increasing, caused by environmental factors, mainly viruses (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most implicated viruses are coxsackie B4 (2) and rotaviruses (3,4). In the past mumps and&#xD;
      rubella viruses gave been found to cause early childhood T1D and the introduction of mumps&#xD;
      and rubella vaccination have stopped this process (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently we (6) and others (7-9) have shown that Rotavirus vaccination to infants attenuates&#xD;
      the incidence of T1D in children aged 0-5 (in press). Covid-19 has not yet been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study To determine whether anti-Covid-19 antibodies generated by infection and/or&#xD;
      vaccination of pregnant mothers, pass the placenta and affect the fetal beta-cells, by&#xD;
      damaging or protecting these insulin producing cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects 100 pregnant women with Covid-19 infection or vaccination who are followed and&#xD;
      delivered at the Mayanei HaYeshua Medical Center will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood from the pregnant mothers will be taken at delivery (and before if possible) as well as&#xD;
      from the cordblood. The following βcell specific antibodies will be tested in the laboratory&#xD;
      of the Schneider Children's Hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19, GAD-65, IA-2, ICA. (ml blood from the mother and 1ml cordblood) The bloods will&#xD;
      have to be centrifuged within 20-30 minutes and the sera kept at -20ºC until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Whether the Covid-19 epidemic affects childhood T1D is controversial (10).&#xD;
      Flannery et al (11) and Atyeo et al., reported that SARS-Cov-2 infected mothers transmit&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 antibodies via the placenta to the fetus Fernandez reported protective Covid-19&#xD;
      antibodies in breast milk of infected mothers (13). Kamrath et al from Germany (14) and&#xD;
      Rabbone et al from Italy (15) reported a high prevalence of DKA in children diagnosed with&#xD;
      T1D during the recent pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the Covid-19 virus with its various mutations is known to affect several organs and cells&#xD;
      in the human body it is of great interest to know whether it affects also the pancreatic&#xD;
      βcells of the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We assume that unvaccinated mothers transfer the virus antibodies to the fetus,&#xD;
      and which may be the first damage to the βcells endangering future development of future type&#xD;
      1 childhood diabetes. Transfer of Covid protecting antibodies may beneficially affect the&#xD;
      infant at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion and importance of the study To the best of our knowledge, no such study has been&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
