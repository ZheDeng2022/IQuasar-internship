    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an experimental study comparing responses of healthy&#xD;
      participants in two test situations where they are subjected to mild stress. The study design&#xD;
      is a randomised controlled crossover design nested within two groups - one with a dog present&#xD;
      and another without a dog present. The participants will be randomly allocated to two groups&#xD;
      (with dog and without dog) and the participants will receive both test situations on the same&#xD;
      day. During the two test situations the participants will be subjected to a classical stress&#xD;
      test , and exposed to tolerable pain, as well as periods with relaxation.&#xD;

      The study design is a randomised controlled crossover design, nested within two groups - one&#xD;
      with a dog present (Dog) and another without a dog present (No Dog). Both groups will be&#xD;
      subjected to a classical stress test - the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST) and a pain&#xD;
      test with periods of relaxation in between. The participants will be subjected to both test&#xD;
      situations on the same day and in the same order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the test day, background information and baseline measures (baseline period, duration: 40&#xD;
      minutes) will be collected, whereafter the participants rest for 30 minutes (pre-intervention&#xD;
      rest period). After this the participants are subjected to the two test situations, pain test&#xD;
      (60 minutes, including calibration and two separate tests sessions) and MAST (15 minutes,&#xD;
      including 5 min introduction) with 30 minutes of relaxation in between and a 40 min post-rest&#xD;
      period The participants' interaction with the dog is recorded using quantitative behaviour&#xD;
      sampling using predefined behavioural categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most physiological and all behavioural measures are recorded continuously throughout test&#xD;
      situations and relaxation, in order to be able to study the response to the stress situations&#xD;
      and recovery, and the response to contact with dog, and to psychological responses. Some&#xD;
      physiological measures obtained before and after each test situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below the exact time schedule of the test day is shown and these times will be refered to&#xD;
      when the outcome measures are described. The &quot;Baseline period&quot; (40 minutes) and the last 10&#xD;
      minutes where the equipment for physiological measures is removed is not included in the&#xD;
      duration of the test period (174 minutes). All times are given in minutes.&#xD;
