  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate different aspects of mental stress aspects and its role&#xD;
      as a potential risk factor for traumatic knee injury in youth athletes. Approximately 300&#xD;
      athletes (age 16-19) 50% women) who are involved in high risk sports (soccer, handball and&#xD;
      floorball) will be included. The athletes will record his/hers traumatic knee injury together&#xD;
      with information about training regimes and some details on injury mechanism on a web-based&#xD;
      form. The form also includes questions about mental stressors, such as club exchange, changed&#xD;
      game system in addition to conflict within and outside the family, etc, prior to injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will contribute new knowledge on levels of muscle function and different&#xD;
      aspects of mental stress factors that may be related to traumatic knee injury in young&#xD;
      athletes.&#xD;

        Coaches of approximately 1400 athletes, aged 16-19 years, involved in sports related to&#xD;
        high risk of knee injury (soccer, handball and floorball), at 70 high schools in Sweden,&#xD;
        will be contacted and introduced to the study through email. The team coach at each school&#xD;
        will distribute a web-based form to the athletes during their first, second or third year&#xD;
        of the high-school period by email or through the school's intra-net system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We estimate that approximately 300 youth athletes (50% women) will be included. From the&#xD;
        included participants, ahtletes with traumatic knee injury will be included for furhter&#xD;
        analysis.&#xD;
