    <textblock>
      Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in&#xD;
      the elderly. Chronic and progressive, it includes loss of dopamine, a neurotransmitter&#xD;
      involved in the regulation of movement. Thus, functional changes, such as postural disorders,&#xD;
      trunk flexor pattern, muscle activation deficits, impairment of gait, balance, and mobility&#xD;
      are common findings in this population. Once there is dopaminergic depletion, it is important&#xD;
      to identify mechanisms that act in the production and survival of nigral dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurons, like the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Studies describe a correlation&#xD;
      between serum BDNF levels and PD motor dysfunction. Still, it is presumed that physical&#xD;
      therapy can positively regulate substances that act directly on the Central Nervous System,&#xD;
      such as BDNF. Physical exercise, in addition to promoting biochemical modulations in PD, can&#xD;
      provide benefits in motor symptoms that sometimes do not improve with drugs. Conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy performed on dry land is a therapeutic resource used in PD. The conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy is useful for management of functional changes caused by PD due to muscle&#xD;
      strengthening exercises. These exercises can be adapted and performed in water, at different&#xD;
      depths, shallow and deep water. Thus, aquatic physiotherapy has been shown to be able to&#xD;
      interfere in PD motor disorders, with perspective of maximizing the rehabilitation program&#xD;
      effects due to the physical properties of water. These reasons, in addition to the large use&#xD;
      of these interventions in the clinical practice and their likely benefits in the PD&#xD;
      alterations, suggest the importance of studies in this area. Furthermore, the immediate&#xD;
      effects of strengthening interventions with global extensor musculature emphasis on global&#xD;
      extensor musculature, and of high-intensity training protocols, which encompass different&#xD;
      environments and different depths, on functional and biochemical measures of PD are poorly&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To verify the acute effects of a global extensor musculature strength training&#xD;
      protocol, performed on dry land and shallow water, and of a high-intensity training protocol&#xD;
      performed in shallow and deep water on functional and biochemical measurements of individuals&#xD;
      with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be a single-blind crossover, cross-sectional study with a 24-hour&#xD;
      follow-up. The sample will be composed of subjects between 50 and 70 years old, classified&#xD;
      from 1 to 3 in the Hoehn and Yahr scale, with a PD diagnosis rigid-akinetic and/or&#xD;
      tremor-dominant type in the &quot;OFF&quot; period of the medication. In this research there will be an&#xD;
      intervention group (IG) composed of individuals with Parkinson's disease and a control group&#xD;
      (CG) of healthy individuals. Both will be randomly distributed in a randomized way and&#xD;
      submitted to two different training sessions, for 60 minutes, at different times, in order to&#xD;
      analyze the acute effects and follow-up of the following interventions: a strength training&#xD;
      of the global extensor musculature in dry land and shallow water (120 cm deep) and&#xD;
      high-intensity training (Borg Scale), at different depths: shallow water (120 cm deep) and&#xD;
      deep water. To characterize the sample, anamnesis and Motor Examination of Movement Disorder&#xD;
      Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS III) will be performed. The&#xD;
      individuals will be submitted to pre, post and 24h evaluations after the intervention.&#xD;
      Functional measures will be analyzed: postural stability, by stabilometry; strength, by&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometry; spatiotemporal gait variables, with kinematic analysis; balance, with&#xD;
      Berg Balance Scale and functional mobility with Timed Up and Go test and biochemical&#xD;
      analysis: venous blood collection and ELISA test will be performed measuring serum BDNF&#xD;
      levels. In this way, the acute effects of the global extensor musculature strength training&#xD;
      protocol and of high-intensity training on the different variables analyzed, environments,&#xD;
      depths and moments of evaluation will be analyzed and compared.&#xD;

    <description>Stabilometry will be used as a method of evaluating the postural balance of the analyzed subjects by quantifying their oscillations, thus, measurements of the levels of stability will be performed when standing in an upright position, with eyes open and closed. Data will be collected through the AMTI force platform - OR6-6 Force plate with MAS-6 amp. The patient will be positioned in an upright posture on the platform, as relaxed as possible, with barefoot and approximately shoulder width apart as described by Laufer; Ashkenazi and Josman (2008). The subject will be asked to look at a point fixed to a wall in front of him, at eye level. Three attempts will be made with an initial 20 seconds for adaptation that will be discarded followed by 25 seconds of valid collection.</description>

    <description>Isokinetic dynamometry aims to assess an individual's muscle condition, measuring their strength, power and endurance, determining the degree of muscle deficiency they present. The individuals will be submitted to an assessment of the isometric torque in flexion and maximum extension of upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs using the Cybex Norm isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Inc., Ronkonkoma, NY, USA). For familiarization, there will be two submaximal isometric contractions in each position. The evaluation protocol consists of three maximum voluntary isometric contractions, lasting 5 seconds in each position. Participants will be verbally encouraged during contractions, with an interval of 2 minutes between each contraction, to avoid fatigue. An interval of 20 minutes will be made between the assessments of the flexion torque for the extension of the upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs. The contraction with the highest torque value will be applied for data analysis using the Humac software</description>

    <description>For the kinematic analysis, 22 reflective markers will be positioned on both sides of the body in order to use a modified full body model that the program uses. A treadmill will be used for the tests. 3D kinematic data will be collected from image records using a VICON kinematics system, which consists of six synchronized cameras that use a shooting frequency of 100 Hz. After system calibration and placement of markers, the acquisition phase where each participant will be guided and positioned on a force platform and instructed to maintain an orthostatic position with the feet aligned, during a period of 5 seconds for system calibration. Next, gait assessment will be carried out, where the subjects will have to walk independently, as usual, with barefoot, on a specific path on a 8m long and 1.4m wide walkway at a self-selected speed.</description>

    <measure>Balance (Berg's Balance Scale - BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes between pre and post immediate intervention. Changes 24 hours after interventions.</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS will be used to assess the static, dynamic balance and the risk of falls of the analyzed subjects. This scale assesses the performance of functional balance with 14 tests, which are directed to the individual's ability to sit, stand, reach, rotate around himself, look over his shoulders, stand in one-leg support and take steps. It has a maximum score of 56 points and a minimum of 0 points, where 17 each test has five alternatives ranging from 0 to 4 points (MIYAMOTO et al., 2004).</description>

    <description>To assess functional mobility, the TUG will be performed, in which the subject starts sitting in a chair, walks for a distance of 3 meters, goes around a cone, returns and sits down on the chair again. The subject is oriented to perform the test as soon as possible. Free individuals and have less than 10 seconds, since they have reasonable balance and gait speed, while dependents have 30 seconds or more.</description>
