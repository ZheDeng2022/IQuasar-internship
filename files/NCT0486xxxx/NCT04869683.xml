  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are chronic myeloid hemopathies characterized by ineffective&#xD;
      hematopoiesis (with peripheral cytopenias) and which contrast with a marrow of normal&#xD;
      richness. MDS is considered one of the four most common blood diseases. The incidence is&#xD;
      estimated at 4,059 cases / year in 2012 with an average age of 78 years in men and 81 years&#xD;
      in women (INCA report, Cancers in France in 2015). The incidence increases with lengthening&#xD;
      of the lifespan. The main risk of MDS is transformation to acute leukemia in 30 to 40% of&#xD;
      cases. Treatment options depend on clinical, hematologic and chromosomal abnormalities. The&#xD;
      prognosis is considered to be at low or high risk of developing acute leukemia. This&#xD;
      distinction will therefore have an impact on the therapeutic solution (s). MDS exhibit&#xD;
      clinical, morphological and genetic heterogeneity. It is therefore necessary to form&#xD;
      subgroups of patients to better understand the physiopathogenesis of this pathology. The&#xD;
      constitution of a biocollection will make it possible to search for clinical and biological&#xD;
      prognostic markers in order to identify patients progressing to acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      The objective of the biocollection is to respond to 3 scientific projects in MDS :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 1: splicing anomalies in MDS with SF3B1 mutations : About 95% of the coding genes in&#xD;
      humans are subjected to alternative splicing, a complex, highly regulated mechanism that&#xD;
      diversifies the proteome by defining multiple proteins from a single gene. Deregulation of&#xD;
      splicing is observed in many cancers and hemopathies (review Yoshida et al., 2014),&#xD;
      especially in myelodysplastic syndromes More than half of MDS patients present an acquired&#xD;
      mutation in a gene involved in the splicing of pre -RNA messengers. The SF3B1 gene (splice&#xD;
      factor 3B subunit 1), which encodes a protein involved in the recognition of 3 'splice sites&#xD;
      is the most frequently mutated gene in SMDs, at a frequency of 20-28% MDS, and up to 85% of&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes with crowned sideroblasts (Yoshida et al., 2011, Papaemmanuil et&#xD;
      al., 2011). The functional consequences of the splicing abnormalities thus generated on the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of MDS are far from clear. The transcriptome analyzes (by RNA-seq) carried&#xD;
      out recently in various acquired pathologies that the most frequent variants of the SF3B1&#xD;
      gene lead to the formation of aberrant transcripts by the use of a 3 ' cryptic splicing site.&#xD;
      The investigators seek to study the functional implications of SF3B1 mutations found in MDS&#xD;
      patients in particular on the formation of sideroblasts in the crown. The investigators want&#xD;
      to identify, by RNAseq, the aberrant junctions specifically expressed in the cells of MDS&#xD;
      patients with mutated SF3B1, and which would affect transcripts of genes involved in iron&#xD;
      metabolism or its regulation. For this, the investigators will use the cells obtained from&#xD;
      the marrow of SMD SF3B1WT patients versus SF3B1K700E and collected in the Chromosomal&#xD;
      Genetics laboratory, site of the CRB of the CHRU of Brest. The investigators will then&#xD;
      analyze the functional repercussions associated with the presence of these aberrant junctions&#xD;
      on the cells in culture of these same patients (detection of certain proteins, enzymatic&#xD;
      analyzes, etc.). The collection of biological and clinical data from these patients of&#xD;
      interest is essential for the interpretation of the results. This project is part of a more&#xD;
      global approach to the study of the various splicing anomalies in this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 2: splicing abnormalities in MDS with chromosomal abnormalities as 5q deletion :&#xD;
      Chromosome 5 deletions are the most frequent structural abnormalities in MDS and constitute a&#xD;
      good prognostic entity if isolated or associated with an anomaly and poor prognosis if&#xD;
      associated with more than 3 chromosomal abnormalities. Two genes located on chromosomes 5&#xD;
      encode proteins of a complex involved in the splicing of pre-messenger RNAs: the RBM22 gene&#xD;
      (RNA Binding Motif Protein 22) and the SLU7 gene (SLU7 Homolog Splicing Factor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to identify subgroups of patients with loss of these 2 genes or loss&#xD;
      of RBM22 and conservation of SLU7. Does the loss of one or both genes play a role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiogenesis of MDS with chromosome deletions and is it associated with worsening of&#xD;
      the disease? Understanding these mechanisms could also have an impact on the therapeutic&#xD;
      management of this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of these chromosomal abnormalities associated with splicing abnormalities in MDS&#xD;
      for the chromosomal genetics laboratory both from a diagnostic and research perspective.&#xD;
      Several works carried out have given rise to numerous scientific publications with an&#xD;
      international reading committee for several years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 3: Evolution of MDS in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) More than one third of patients&#xD;
      with MDS progress to AML. The investigators want to focus on this group of patients and&#xD;
      understand the clonal architecture of their malignant cells to detect new predictive markers&#xD;
      of indolent or rapid disease progression.&#xD;
