  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will carry out a randomised trial of free face mask distribution in Stovner&#xD;
      District, Oslo, Norway. Ten grocery stores will serve as study sites. Over three weeks the&#xD;
      stores will be randomised daily to having &quot;corona hosts&quot; outside their entrance, handing out&#xD;
      face masks to customers. The investigators will compare the proportion of customers who wear&#xD;
      face masks as they enter the store in stores with or without face mask distribution.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The team members from the Stovner district-administration will send a numbered list to Norwegian Institute of Public Health-team, with the names of the stores. The ordering of the stores will define the numbers used to represent each store in the randomisation process. Using Stata software, we will carry out 13 separate and independent randomisations, each assigning the intervention to half the included stores. An additional randomisation to the treatment or control group will be carried out for a marginal store each day in the event of an odd number of stores.&#xD;
Unless it proves too logistically cumbersome, we will also randomise the corona hosts, i.e. the store they are allocated to will be decided through randomisation.</intervention_model_description>
