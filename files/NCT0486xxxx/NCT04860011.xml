      To assess the effect of dapagliflozin compared with metolazone, added to furosemide, on&#xD;
      diuresis and decongestion in hospitalised heart failure patients with diuretic resistance,&#xD;
      and renal impairment. The primary analysis will be in patients with HFrEF but patients with&#xD;
      HFpEF will also be recruited in an ancillary study and included in supplementary analyses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to assess whether SGLT2i (in addition to IV loop diuretic) results in&#xD;
      greater diuresis and decongestion compared to the standard practice of treatment with the&#xD;
      thiazide-like diuretic metolazone (in addition to IV loop diuretic) in patients hospitalised&#xD;
      for heart failure, with both renal impairment and diuretic resistance. Dapagliflozin has&#xD;
      received National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval as an add-on&#xD;
      option to optimised standard care in patients with HFrEF. The investigators primary focus is&#xD;
      patients with HFrEF as it is in ambulatory patients with this phenotype that SGLT2 inhibition&#xD;
      has already been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality (DAPA-HF).However, the investigators&#xD;
      will also enrol patients with HFpEF in an ancillary study as they present the same management&#xD;
      challenges as patients with HFrEF and the study hypothesis and aims are as clinically&#xD;
      relevant in HFpEF as in HFrEF. HFpEF patients in the ancillary study will undergo the same&#xD;
      protocol as the main study. One recent trial demonstrating benefit of a SGLT1/2 inhibitor,&#xD;
      the Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Post&#xD;
      Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF), included patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF&#xD;
      hospitalised with worsening heart failure (NCT03521934). This trial demonstrated similar&#xD;
      efficacy of sotagliflozin on cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure in patients&#xD;
      with a LVEF &lt;50% and ≥50%.There are other large trials currently underway specifically with&#xD;
      SGLT2i in ambulatory patients with HFpEF underway. These trials are either fully recruited,&#xD;
      or close to full enrolment. Both already have extensive follow-up of several thousand&#xD;
      patients and are due to complete follow up in the next 1-2 years (EMPEROR-Preserved and&#xD;
      DELIVER). Therefore, the findings will be contemporaneous and complementary to the results of&#xD;
      those trials.&#xD;
