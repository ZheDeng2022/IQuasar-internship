  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancer (BTC) accounts for 4% of the malignant tumors of the digestive system,&#xD;
      and the incidence has increased significantly in recent years. For advanced malignant tumors&#xD;
      of the biliary tract, the existing treatment methods are very limited and the effective rate&#xD;
      is low. At present, gemcitabine combined with platinum therapy is the first-line standard&#xD;
      treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has made&#xD;
      huge breakthroughs. There are also research attempts in advanced biliary tract cancer. A&#xD;
      study published in the international top medical journal NEJM in 2015 showed that PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody treatment has mismatch gene repair defects. Patients with advanced&#xD;
      biliary tract tumors have a higher curative effect. It suggests that PD-1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      is worthy of in-depth study in the treatment of biliary tract tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous clinical studies of PD-1 in the treatment of biliary tract tumors conducted&#xD;
      by our center, it was observed that the tumor control of some patients was stable with the&#xD;
      combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy. In view of the observations in the clinical&#xD;
      research of our unit, relevant case reports, and the mechanism of the combination of&#xD;
      radiotherapy and immunotherapy, we speculate that in patients with biliary tract cancer,&#xD;
      radiotherapy and immunotherapy have a certain combined sensitization effect. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      planned to carry out clinical research on the second-line treatment of advanced biliary tract&#xD;
      cancer with radiotherapy and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the effectiveness and safety of tislelizumab combined with&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced biliary malignant tumors (BTC) in&#xD;
      second-line and above, with a view to improving the therapeutic effect of biliary tract&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

      Patient recruitment Research and discussion by the MDT team of the Department of&#xD;
      Hepatobiliary Surgery of our center: Choose pathologically confirmed malignant tumors of the&#xD;
      biliary tract that are inoperable or recurring after surgery, including intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer; patients with&#xD;
      non-extensive metastases, after full communication with the patient, The patients joined the&#xD;
      study after signing the informed consent form voluntarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study Each period of the test period is defined as 3 weeks. After starting&#xD;
      tislelizumab, tumor imaging evaluation will be performed every 6 weeks (±7 days). Until the&#xD;
      disease progresses or treatment ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy We use intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or stereotactic radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) based on comprehensive factors such as the location of the lesion, the irradiation&#xD;
      volume, the volume of the normal liver, liver function, and the general condition of the&#xD;
      patient. The divided dose is within 3-7.5Gy. The number of divisions is between 2-15. Daily&#xD;
      irradiation from Monday to Friday/week, or every other day on Monday, Wednesday, and&#xD;
      Friday/week, strive to achieve a relative biological dose (BED) of more than 40Gy, and the&#xD;
      exposure to organs at risk within the accepted range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      medical treatment On the 7th day (±3 days) after the start of radiotherapy, tislelizumab was&#xD;
      given 200 mg, IVD, q3w, and continued treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxic&#xD;
      radiotherapy, death or meet any discontinuation criteria described in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Safety follow-up Regardless of whether the patient starts a new anti-tumor therapy,&#xD;
      the patient should be contacted 30 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of tislelizumab to&#xD;
      assess irAE and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival follow-up After the study treatment is terminated, the survival status of all&#xD;
      patients and more information on anti-cancer treatment will be followed up, patient medical&#xD;
      records and/or outpatient visits. After the treatment ends, the visit will be conducted&#xD;
      approximately once every 1 month (±7 days) until the patient died, was lost to follow-up,&#xD;
      withdrawn informed consent, or the sponsor completed the study. The situation of each&#xD;
      survival follow-up should be recorded in the follow-up form in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness evaluation Tumor imaging examinations will be performed 28 days before the&#xD;
      first administration of the study drug. During the study period, tumor imaging examinations&#xD;
      were performed every 6 weeks (±7 days) during the treatment cycle of tislelizumab.The&#xD;
      screening evaluation and each follow-up evaluation must include contrast-enhanced computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen,&#xD;
      and pelvis. Other known or suspected lesions must be included in the imaging evaluation.&#xD;
      Assessment of the lesions using the same contrast agent program, but in special&#xD;
      circumstances, if MRI is selected as the tumor assessment for the entire study process, in&#xD;
      the chest imaging assessment, chest non-thoracic imaging should be performed. All known&#xD;
      lesions must be recorded at the time of screening, and the assessment must be repeated for&#xD;
      each subsequent tumor assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first remission (CR or PR), tumor remission should be confirmed ≥ 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      first remission or at the next planned evaluation time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment Adverse events (AE) and Serious adverse event (SAE) AE is defined as any&#xD;
      adverse physical signs (including abnormal laboratory test results), symptoms or diseases&#xD;
      (new or worsening) that are related to the study treatment in time, regardless of whether it&#xD;
      is considered to be related to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an AE or SAE occurs, the investigator is responsible for reviewing all records related to&#xD;
      the AE or SAE (such as hospital history records, laboratory test results, and diagnostic&#xD;
      reports). The investigator will then record all information related to the AE or SAE in the&#xD;
      case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease progression Disease progression is defined as the deterioration of the subject's&#xD;
      condition caused by the primary tumor targeted by the experimental drug.The appearance of new&#xD;
      metastases relative to the original tumor or the progression of the original metastases are&#xD;
      considered to be disease progression. Events that are life-threatening due to symptoms and&#xD;
      signs of disease progression, require hospitalization or prolong hospitalization, or cause&#xD;
      permanent or severe disability/dysfunction/affect work ability, and congenital abnormalities&#xD;
      or birth defects are not reported as SAEs for accelerated reporting. Death due to symptoms&#xD;
      and signs of disease progression is reported as an accelerated SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAE should record in detail the symptoms, severity, correlation with the test drug, time of&#xD;
      occurrence, treatment time, measures taken, time and method of follow-up, and outcome. If the&#xD;
      intensity of an ongoing SAE or its relationship with the test drug changes, a follow-up&#xD;
      report should be submitted immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and data management This study will use the case report form (CRF) to collect&#xD;
      and manage research data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection This research uses CRF table to collect research data. Researchers and CRC&#xD;
      collect relevant data in detail. The clinical research quality control personnel conduct&#xD;
      corresponding quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and quality control In order to ensure the authenticity and reliability of&#xD;
      clinical trial data and improve the quality of clinical data, clinical monitors will follow&#xD;
      standard operating procedures to review the completeness, consistency and accuracy of the&#xD;
      trial data in the clinical database and provide guidance during the trial project. The&#xD;
      personnel of the research institution shall make necessary supplements or corrections to the&#xD;
      problem data. Clinical monitors or data managers will question the questionable data to PI or&#xD;
      CRC in the form of an electronic questioning form. PI or CRC must respond to the questioning&#xD;
      and make corrections or explanations to the questioned data. The person in charge of medicine&#xD;
      and data management personnel conduct regular consistency comparisons of SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the test project, data management personnel and medical personnel will perform&#xD;
      final quality control on all data in the database, summarize all program deviations and&#xD;
      program violations that occurred during the test, and hold a data verification meeting. After&#xD;
      the data in the database meets the quality requirements, the database will be locked and&#xD;
      tested, and the data management staff will export the data for data analysis by the&#xD;
      statistics department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data review and monitoring of research institutions Researchers must keep the original&#xD;
      documents of each patient participating in the trial, including research medical records and&#xD;
      visit records. The researcher must confirm that all relevant original documents can be&#xD;
      monitored to verify that they are consistent with the CRF content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and statistical methods The detailed summary and statistical analysis methods&#xD;
      for the data collected by this research will be included in the statistical analysis plan&#xD;
      (SAP), which will be finalized and filed by the sponsor. Any changes to this research plan,&#xD;
      if determined by the sponsor or the main investigator, have a significant impact on the&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan, SAP needs to be revised to be consistent with the research plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of sample size This study is an exploratory clinical study. It is expected that&#xD;
      20 patients will be enrolled. If objective remission of 5 or more cases can be obtained, the&#xD;
      combined treatment method is considered to have the effect of increasing sensitivity, and&#xD;
      follow-up clinical studies are recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyze the population Full Analysis Set (FAS): An analysis set determined in accordance with&#xD;
      the principle of intentional analysis. All subjects who are enrolled and have at least one&#xD;
      treatment record will be included in this analysis set. The full analysis set is the main&#xD;
      effectiveness analysis set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the plan set (PPS): a subset of the full analysis set. Subjects who have&#xD;
      violated the protocol and judged that the violation has a significant impact on the efficacy&#xD;
      will be excluded from this set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the evaluable population: All subjects who meet the following criteria have&#xD;
      received at least one treatment with tislelizumab and have received one tumor evaluation. If&#xD;
      the curative effect reaches CR or PR, the subject must confirm the curative effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis set (SS): All subjects who have been enrolled and have at least one treatment&#xD;
      record will be included in the safety analysis set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory index analysis set: All subjects who are included in the group and who have used&#xD;
      the trial drug at least once and obtained tumor biopsy samples will be included in this&#xD;
      analysis set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis General analysis Unless otherwise specified, continuous variables in&#xD;
      this study are summarized by mean, standard deviation, median, maximum, and minimum;&#xD;
      categorical variables are summarized by frequency and percentage; time-event data are&#xD;
      estimated by Kaplan-Meier method Survival rate and median survival time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness analysis Tumor evaluation will be made by investigators based on RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
      The evaluation data will be based on the following response indicators: complete remission&#xD;
      (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), disease progression (PD) and non-evaluable&#xD;
      (NE). The survival distribution of OS will be estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier (KM)&#xD;
      method, and the median OS and a bilateral 95% confidence interval will be calculated. In&#xD;
      addition, the KM method is used to estimate the survival probability at different time nodes&#xD;
      (6/9/12 months), and the corresponding 95% confidence interval is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survival distribution of progression-free survival (PFS) will be estimated based on the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, and the median PFS and the two-sided 95% confidence interval will&#xD;
      be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) will use the Clopper-Pearson&#xD;
      method to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the percentage of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Security Analysis The analysis of AEs will be based on the safety analysis set. Data analysis&#xD;
      will include, but not limited to, grouping and calculating the incidence of adverse&#xD;
      reactions; the sub-system will list the frequency and frequency of adverse reactions, the&#xD;
      calculation percentage, and a detailed list of various AE cases. The analysis will be stated&#xD;
      in the statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case shedding All subjects who have filled out the informed consent form and screened&#xD;
      qualified to enter the trial have the right to withdraw from the clinical trial at any time.&#xD;
      Regardless of when and for any reason, as long as the subjects who have not completed one&#xD;
      cycle of the clinical trial and cannot be evaluated for safety and effectiveness, they are&#xD;
      all dropped cases (after being enrolled in the group due to disease progression and clear&#xD;
      medical evidence, they will not be regarded as dropped out. ). When the subject falls off,&#xD;
      the researcher must fill in the reason for the fall off in the CRF, complete the assessment&#xD;
      items that can be completed, and carefully fill in the last visit record in the CRF. Those&#xD;
      who fall off due to adverse reactions and are determined to be related to the test drug after&#xD;
      follow-up should be recorded in the CRF and the investigator should be notified. If the&#xD;
      subject has completed a complete cycle and has a detailed record, statistical analysis should&#xD;
      be made during the safety evaluation.Subjects who withdraw from the study cannot re-enter the&#xD;
      study, and their number cannot be used again.&#xD;
