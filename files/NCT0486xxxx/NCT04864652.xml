      ARCTIC-1 is a safety and dosing study to evaluate procedure tolerability in patients with&#xD;
      clinically diagnosed moderate or severe OSA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a safety and dose titration study to determine the optimum dose of Cryosa CHILLS&#xD;
      cryotherapy in patients with clinically diagnosed moderate or severe OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 subjects are planned to be enrolled and treated with the device at up to 3 clinical&#xD;
      sites in Latin America. Subjects will be followed for 45 days with evaluation intervals at&#xD;
      discharge, 7 days, 30 days and 45 days post procedure.&#xD;
