  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study collects information on pregnant women with ongoing constipation who took&#xD;
      prucalopride and those who did not take prucalopride. The main aim of the study is to learn&#xD;
      if any medical problems in pregnant women or their infants might be related to taking&#xD;
      prucalopride during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are not required to take prucalopride during the study. Participation begins&#xD;
      after a pregnant woman has taken prucalopride. Women and their infants are followed during&#xD;
      pregnancy and for 1 year after pregnancy to collect information on maternal, pregnancy, and&#xD;
      infant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will be asked questions during 3 telephone interviews; 2&#xD;
      during pregnancy and 1 just after their expected delivery date. Participants who took or are&#xD;
      taking prucalopride will be asked more detailed questions about this during these interviews.&#xD;
      All information is collected remotely, and no visits to the study site are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, all participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their baby when their&#xD;
      baby is about 1 year old.&#xD;
