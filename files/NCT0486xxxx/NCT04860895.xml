    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to use the Multi-Spectral method to measure the biomolecular&#xD;
      fingerprint of the virus directly instead of the virus's RNA (RT-PCR) or the body's immune&#xD;
      response (antibody) measurement methods to diagnose the SARS-COV-2 virus, thereby determining&#xD;
      whether COVID-19 can be diagnosed faster, cheaper and without requiring a medical laboratory&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this study is to test whether artificial intelligence (AI) will&#xD;
      identify existing SARS-COV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples using multi-spectral screening&#xD;
      technology..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi spectral screening testing device called AP-23 offers a non-invasive system for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 as a solution. This approach makes multi-spectral diagnostic methods&#xD;
      suitable for use by any end user and allows the establishment of Internet of Things systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 contagion, which began in the northern hemisphere, continues to affect human health&#xD;
      and the world economy in tremendously. Early diagnosis of the disease and, accordingly, the&#xD;
      breaking of the transmission chain through filiation studies is very important for public&#xD;
      health until an effective and safe vaccine is found. PCR tests, which we currently use as the&#xD;
      gold standard to prove the existence of the virus, have not been sufficient to prevent the&#xD;
      pandemic for the following reasons;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PCR tests should be performed in a hospital or clinical setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is a need for a custom kit&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is a need for trained individuals to perform the test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Standardization is not ensured for the receipt of test sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. With at least 30 minutes for receipt of the test results, it takes up to 3-day&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. testing is expensive and is usually applied to people who have symptoms and thus&#xD;
           asymptomatic carriers are missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to test whether SARS-COV-2 can be detected in&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab samples using multi-spectral screening technology. Multi-spectral&#xD;
      techniques are based on phenomena related to absorption, excitation and propagation of&#xD;
      biomolecules. In short, by irradiating the sample with electromagnetic energy, some molecules&#xD;
      absorb and re-emit less energetic radiation. This phenomenon is called radiation, and the&#xD;
      radiated spectrum is a function of certain molecules that combine microorganisms / viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, FableCorp's AP-23 system uses data from a minimally invasive or non-invasive&#xD;
      simple measurement based on multi-spectral screening technology to calculate the presence or&#xD;
      concentration of the desired product in a biological liquid as the solution to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most unique approach of the FableCorp system, is to use the A.I. to detect the desired&#xD;
      biochemical / cell / virus is to scan appropriate multi-spectral inputs. Data mining tools,&#xD;
      where it simultaneously eliminates noise in raw data generated from various multi-spectral&#xD;
      spectroscopy inputs, give very clear results. This approach makes multi-spectral technology&#xD;
      suitable for use as point-of-care systems for any end user, and also leads to the realization&#xD;
      of full automation (Internet of Things) systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.I. the base solution for Pointer signal detection / processing eliminates biochemical&#xD;
      additives (kits) and specialized personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AI's evaluation of data takes place within 15-30 seconds. If the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      application is proven in the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2, many more people will be able to be&#xD;
      screened in a much faster time, much cheaper, and filiation will be applied to the necessary&#xD;
      people much faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Stage 1: Nasopharyngeal samples taken from COVID-19 suspected individuals will&#xD;
      be given to artificial intelligence to learn positive and negative cases, and the learning&#xD;
      results will be calculated as the learning accuracy for negative and positive samples.&#xD;
      (n=4000, 2000 positive and 2000 negative)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1, Output Parameters (Evaluation of Learning Performance of Artificial Intelligence):&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR results and AP-23 results obtained as a result of comparison; PCR Accordance, PCR&#xD;
      Accordance for Negative Samples, PCR Accordance for Positive Samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Based on the Artificial Intelligence Learning accuracy rate second stage of the&#xD;
      study will be initiated. At this stage, Nasopharyngeal swab samples will be tested by PCR,&#xD;
      AP-23, and the results will be tested and be compared and the sensitivity of detection&#xD;
      compared with results obtained by (n=400, 200 positive and 200 negative)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2, Output Parameters (Evaluation of Test Performance of Artificial Intelligence):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal swab obtained by comparison with PCR and AP-23 results in samples;&#xD;
      Sensitivity, Specificity, Negative Prediction Value, Positive Prediction Value.&#xD;
