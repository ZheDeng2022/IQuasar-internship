      Currently there are no proven treatments for COVID-19 and current standard therapy is&#xD;
      supportive care with oxygen supplementation and treatment of symptoms. Several re-purposed&#xD;
      and new drugs have been investigated but none is conclusive for efficacy against COVID-19&#xD;
      .Both Hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) and Chloroquine(CQ) have demonstrated activity against severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have been investigated in small&#xD;
      clinical trials with contradicting reports on their benefits or harm in treatment of COVID-19&#xD;
      .Several authors agree that the use of HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 needs to be assessed in&#xD;
      large randomized controlled trials&#xD;

      Currently there are no proven treatments for COVID-19 and current standard therapy is&#xD;
      supportive care with oxygen supplementation and treatment of symptoms. Several re-purposed&#xD;
      and new drugs have been investigated but none is conclusive for efficacy against&#xD;
      COVID-19.These include the antimalarial drugs- chloroquine(CQ) and hydroxychloroquine(HCQ),&#xD;
      antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir and antiretroviral combination therapies such&#xD;
      as lopinavir/ritonavir. Although hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are readily accessible in&#xD;
      Uganda and could be explore for treatment of COVID-19,current data regarding their efficacy&#xD;
      and safety is scanty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to determine whether HCQ can be useful for treatment of Ugandan patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 for the following reasons : Firstly, the Ugandan population expresses a high level&#xD;
      of variability with a younger population with more than 50% under the age of 15 years.&#xD;
      Secondly, the population with co-morbid conditions like diabetes mellitus ,hypertension and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease is significantly lower compared to higher income countries.&#xD;
      Preliminary data from the first 52 COVID-19 patients in Uganda treated with HCQ demonstrated&#xD;
      faster symptom resolution although this did not reach statistical significance. Lastly, HCQ&#xD;
      has not been tested in mild-moderate disease where hospitalization is not necessary and we&#xD;
      therefore do not know whether it can lead to faster viral clearance, slow disease progression&#xD;
      and reduce time to symptom clearance. Our main aim will be to determine if hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      can lead to faster viral clearance.&#xD;
