  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b multicenter, open-label oncology study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activity of HSK29116 in patients with advanced B-cell&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into 2 parts. Phase 1a is a dose escalation to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of HSK29116 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell&#xD;
      malignancies, who have required and received at least 1 prior systemic therapy and for whom&#xD;
      no other therapies are known to provide clinical benefit. Phase 1b will investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy of HSK29116 at the dose selected in Phase 1a in up to 3 cohorts of patients with R/R&#xD;
      B-cell malignancy indications who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, and at&#xD;
      least half of the subjects must have received covalent BTK inhibitors who must have received&#xD;
      genetic testing to get the mutation status of BTK C481 positive before enrollment：&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)； Mantle Cell Lymphoma&#xD;
      (MCL)； Other B-cell malignancies (they will be selected according to the preliminary results&#xD;
      of Phase Ia)&#xD;
