  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, multicenter, Phase 2 trial&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of trilaciclib on overall survival when administered prior to docetaxel&#xD;
      in patients with mNSCLC treated in the 2nd or 3rd line setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have documented disease progression during or after one or two lines of&#xD;
      systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. Prior treatment must have included,&#xD;
      either in the same line or as separate lines of therapy: 1) a maximum of 1 line of&#xD;
      platinum-containing chemotherapy for recurrent/metastatic disease and 2) a maximum of 1 line&#xD;
      of a locally approved/authorized programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) containing regimen for recurrent/metastatic&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive trilaciclib or placebo intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      prior to docetaxel on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a screening phase, a treatment phase and a survival follow-up phase.&#xD;
      The patient may continue to receive treatment on study until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, discontinuation by Investigator, or the end of&#xD;
      the trial, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
