  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decentralized clinical study designed to collect cough sounds and self-reported symptoms&#xD;
      alongside a COVID-19 realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qPCR) test. The aim&#xD;
      of the data collection is to develop a safe and effective cough based digital screening tool&#xD;
      for COVID-19.&#xD;

        A minimum of 100 participants who test positive for COVID-19 on rt-qPCR will be recruited.&#xD;
        Based on average COVID-19 incidence rates in high incidence US geographies (~8-12%), this&#xD;
        study will enrol a cohort of up to 1500 participants on a rolling basis, to allow for&#xD;
        sufficient cough recordings from COVID-19 positive participants to be collected for&#xD;
        analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be aged 21 years and older and will not be excluded based on gender,&#xD;
        demographic group, or geographic location within the US.&#xD;
