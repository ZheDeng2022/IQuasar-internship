  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II clinical study conducted in China. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive AK104 in combination with standard treatment regimens or AK104 alone. The&#xD;
      primary end points are objective response rate per RECIST1.1 and safety. Secondary end points&#xD;
      are progression-free survival and disease control rate.&#xD;
