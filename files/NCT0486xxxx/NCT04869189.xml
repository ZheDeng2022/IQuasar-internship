    <measure>Visual Analogue Scales (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at approximately 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective comfort and visual fatigue will be assessed using 0 to 100 on VAS at the start of the visit and at the end of each visual task.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear film surface quality</measure>
    <time_frame>at approximately 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Tear film surface quality will be assessed in the left eye (OS) only. The infrared-reflected mires from the tear film will be analyzed using custom image analysis from video recordings. The mean and standard deviation of tear film surface quality metric will be determined across the 5 minutes and at 1-minute increments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear meniscus height</measure>
    <time_frame>at approximately 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The lower tear meniscus in the left eye (OS) only will be analyzed using custom image analysis from video recordings. The mean and SD of tear meniscus height (measured vertically in millimeters) will be determined across the 5 minutes and at 1-minute increments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blink frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>at approximately 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Blink frequency will be analyzed using custom image analysis from video recordings. Three blink rate metrics will be determined:&#xD;
Total blink rate: blinks per minute (all blinks)&#xD;
Complete blink rate: complete blinks per minute. A complete blink will be defined as having a closed palpebral aperture of less than one third of the open palpebral aperture.&#xD;
Incomplete blink rate: incomplete blinks per minute. An incomplete blink will be defined as having a closed palpebral aperture of more than one third of the open palpebral aperture.&#xD;
Each blink frequency metric will be determined across the 5 minutes and at 1-minute increments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Interblink interval</measure>
    <time_frame>at approximately 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of interblink intervals (seconds) over the 5-minute measurement period and at 1-minute increments will be determined in two ways:&#xD;
Total interblink interval: time in seconds between any blinks&#xD;
Complete interblink interval: time in seconds between complete blinks&#xD;
The number of times the interblink interval exceeds the mean + 1SD tear film break up time (assessed over the extended eye opening periods) will be determined for:&#xD;
Total interblink interval distribution&#xD;
Complete interblink interval distribution</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blink completeness</measure>
    <time_frame>at approximately 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The mean and SD of the maximally closed palpebral aperture (in mm) will be summarized for total blinks, complete blinks and incomplete blinks across the 5 minutes. For total blinks, the mean and SD of maximally closed palpebral aperture will also be determined at 1-minute increments.</description>

              13. They have any existing binocular vision anomalies such as strabismus or have been&#xD;
                  prescribed prisms in their spectacles based on self-report, or in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the investigator exhibit signs of suppression during binocular vision testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Any Efron Grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal&#xD;
                  neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival&#xD;
                  injection) which in the investigator's opinion would contraindicate contact lens&#xD;
                  wear.&#xD;
