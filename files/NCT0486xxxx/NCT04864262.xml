  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls is a health crisis that costs health care systems billions of dollars each year. This&#xD;
      crisis is especially relevant for people living with spinal cord injury (SCI) as most of&#xD;
      these people will fall at least once per year. Falls can cause injury and a fear of falling,&#xD;
      which often causes people to restrict their mobility and daily activities. Despite its&#xD;
      importance, fall prevention for people with SCI is understudied, and as a result, there is a&#xD;
      lack of treatments to address their high fall risk. We will evaluate a new treatment for fall&#xD;
      prevention. Photovoice is a method that uses photographs and dialogue to share experiences,&#xD;
      understand an issue and promote positive change. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of photovoice on confidence related to balance and falls, occurrence of falls, participation&#xD;
      in daily activities and quality of life among people living with SCI. We also aim to&#xD;
      understand participants' experiences with photovoice as a fall prevention program. To achieve&#xD;
      these aims, 40 individuals living with SCI will participate in this study. Participants will&#xD;
      complete a six-week photovoice program that involves photo assignments, individual interviews&#xD;
      and group meetings. The program will be led by a person with SCI and a member of the research&#xD;
      team with a background in physical or occupational therapy or kinesiology. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will be used throughout the study to measure confidence, participation and quality of life.&#xD;
      The occurrence of falls will be tracked for 12 weeks before and after the photovoice program.&#xD;
      At the end of the study, each participant's experiences with photovoice will be collected&#xD;
      through interviews. The proposed research will address a critical gap in SCI rehabilitation,&#xD;
      namely effective fall prevention, to improve well-being after SCI. The research findings will&#xD;
      inform the need for, and design of, a larger clinical trial, and has the potential to&#xD;
      transform fall prevention after SCI.&#xD;

    <description>Photovoice is a method that uses photographs and dialogue to share experiences, understand an issue and promote positive change. Group meetings will be held four times throughout the photovoice intervention. The goals of the group meetings are to share knowledge about falls and fall prevention, identify commonalities in the issues raised by the participants, and discuss ways in which these issues could be addressed, both at individual and societal levels. For two photo assignments, participants will be asked to take 4-6 pictures for an assigned question. The question for photo assignment #1 will be 'What decreases your likelihood of falling?' The question for photo assignment #2 will be 'How do you reduce the risk of falling so that you can participate in meaningful activities?' Following each photo assignment, participants will complete an individual semi-structured interview with the peer mentor and the research trainee, who will have a background in physical or occupational therapy.</description>
