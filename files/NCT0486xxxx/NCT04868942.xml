      The aim of this study is to assess whether the protective measures can limit the&#xD;
      contaminations by SARS-CoV-2 during the participation in a concert at a non-inferior level to&#xD;
      a non-concert / current life situation. A randomized, monocentric, open-label,&#xD;
      non-inferiority study comparing, in two phases, a group of volunteers participating in a&#xD;
      concert, protected by established protection measures, to a group with no other constraints&#xD;
      than national recommendations and obligations (2 concerts, one control group at each&#xD;
      concert). Volunteer students, between 18 and 30 years old, at Aix-Marseille University, will&#xD;
      be recruited.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To assess whether the protective measures implemented (individual&#xD;
      protection kit including disposable FFP2 (filtering facepiece) masks, hydro-alcoholic&#xD;
      solution, water bottle, disposable tissues, waste bag, physical distancing, flow management&#xD;
      and health mediation) make it possible to limit contamination by SARS-CoV-2 during&#xD;
      participation in a concert (lasting 2 hours) at a non-inferior level to a non-concert&#xD;
      situation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether the protective measures implemented (individual protection kit&#xD;
           including disposable FFP2 masks, hydro-alcoholic solution, water bottle, disposable&#xD;
           tissues, waste bag, physical distancing, flow management and health mediation) make it&#xD;
           possible to limit contamination by other circulating respiratory viruses during&#xD;
           participation in a concert (lasting 2 hours) at a non-inferior level to a non-concert&#xD;
           situation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether the protection against viral contamination in the absence of a&#xD;
           one-seat gap between 2 volunteers is non-inferior to the protection induced by one-seat&#xD;
           gap (sub-group of volunteers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the level of compliance and adherence to the prevention measures implemented&#xD;
           during the concert&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess SARS-CoV-2 serology prevalence in volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify SARS-CoV-2 variants by sequencing SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology / design A randomized, monocentric, open-label, non-inferiority study comparing,&#xD;
      in two phases, a group of volunteers participating in a concert, protected by established&#xD;
      protection measures (protection kit, distancing, flow management, health mediation), to a&#xD;
      group with no other constraints than national recommendations and obligations (2 concerts,&#xD;
      one control group at each concert).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      4500 participants, in 2 phases: Phase A: Concert A group, n=1125; Control A group, n=1125&#xD;
      Phase B (15 days later): Concert B group, n=1125; Control B group, n=1125&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversion of salivary SARS-CoV-2 carriage detected by molecular biology at Day 6 or 7 after&#xD;
      each event&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conversion of salivary carriage of other respiratory viruses detected by molecular&#xD;
           biology at Day 6 or 7 after each event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of knowledge about COVID-19 and methods of protection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verbatim from the qualitative interview on knowledge, attitudes and practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence score for protective measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of initially positive SARS-CoV-2 serology in the volunteer sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentages of SARS-CoV-2 variants among positive samples (for each variant)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the music concert (2 hours), prevention measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual protection kit: disposable FFP2 masks (3), hydro-alcoholic solution,&#xD;
           disposable tissues, garbage bag, water bottle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health mediation, information on barrier measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical distancing (sitting participation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Person flow management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention effect will be estimated by the difference in SARS-CoV-2 conversion rates&#xD;
      (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main non-inferiority analysis will be performed by interval estimation of the difference&#xD;
      in PCR SARS-CoV-2 conversion rates, in Per Protocol (each volunteer being associated with the&#xD;
      concert or control group according to his or her actual participation), over the 2 concerts&#xD;
      (using a multilevel mixed model, with random period effect). An Intention-to-Treat analysis&#xD;
      will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of individual knowledge and behavior, and adherence to protection measures (Q1-&#xD;
           questionnaire Q1, Q2 and Q3): unsupervised exploratory analyses - classification on&#xD;
           principal component analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of the difference in PCR conversion rates (SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory&#xD;
           viruses) adjusted for the level of knowledge and behavior obtained from the&#xD;
           questionnaires, for the collective level of protection observed during the concert (ad&#xD;
           hoc observations), and for the epidemic situation at the time of the concerts.&#xD;
           Estimations will be provided by using a multilevel multivariate logistic model. This&#xD;
           approach will eventually allow us to introduce a random period effect to consider the&#xD;
           temporality of the measurements. Finally, we analyze the level of the epidemic by IRIS&#xD;
           (smallest french geographical area) each week, in collaboration with the ARS-PACA&#xD;
           (Health Regional Agency - Agence Regionale de Santé - Provence Alpes Cote d'Azur) and&#xD;
           SPF (French National Public Health Agency - Santé Publique France). If necessary, an&#xD;
           adjustment on this possible spatial effect will be made, based on the address of the&#xD;
           volunteers, to estimate the risk of contamination of the control group&#xD;
           (exponential-power variogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serology prevalence will be estimated, and associated behavioral factors will be&#xD;
           assessed by using multilevel multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyses will be performed in Per Protocol and Intent to Treat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A secondary analysis with imputation of missing data will be performed as a sensitivity&#xD;
           analysis (after testing the hypothesis of missing at random)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 5% significance level will be used for decision making, but the probabilities will be&#xD;
      interpreted accordingly.&#xD;
