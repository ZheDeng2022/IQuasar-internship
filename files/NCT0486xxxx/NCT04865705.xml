      This is a prospective, one-arm, phase II study aimed at evaluating tislelizumab combined with&#xD;
      platinum-containing dual-drug chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment, supplemented with&#xD;
      tislelizumab after surgery in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study included a screening period, a treatment period (including neoadjuvant treatment,&#xD;
      surgery and postoperative adjuvant treatment), and a survival follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the admission criteria will receive the following treatments according to&#xD;
      disease stage (IIIA/IIIB) and histology (squamous or non-squamous) Tilelizumab +&#xD;
      platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy, every 3 weeks as a cycle , for 2 cycles,&#xD;
      followed by surgical resection, and postoperative adjuvant Tilelizumab + platinum-containing&#xD;
      dual-agent chemotherapy 2cycles,every 3 weeks as a cycle, and Tilelizumab every 3 weeks up to&#xD;
      15cycles maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of radical resection (R0) was evaluated through the research center of the&#xD;
      investigator, which is expected to be 20% higher compared with historical controls, and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of tislelizumab combined with platinum-containing dual-drug chemotherapy as a&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment was evaluated.&#xD;
