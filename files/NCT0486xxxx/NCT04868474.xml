    <textblock>
      The FIRST cluster randomized trial will evaluate the effect of 1) a training program&#xD;
      encouraging general practitioners to offer smoking cessation treatment as a default choice to&#xD;
      all current smokers consulting a general practitioner (GP), and 2) an interactive, electronic&#xD;
      decision aid to guide smoking cessation treatment, on the proportion of current smokers seen&#xD;
      in primary care who have quit smoking 6 months after a baseline visit to their GP, as&#xD;
      compared to enhanced usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation medications are underused in primary care, likely because general&#xD;
      practitioners (GP) lack detailed knowledge about prescribing and the fact that smokers seen&#xD;
      in primary care must &quot;opt-in&quot; to treatment. Currently GPs only offer treatment to patients&#xD;
      who say they are ready to quit smoking and desire treatment, making the default choice no&#xD;
      treatment. Those who are not ready to quit or are hesitant do not discuss quitting or learn&#xD;
      about options to help them quit. Further, GPs often lack confidence to discuss smoking&#xD;
      cessation medications or do not provide patients with a choice. A decision aid can both help&#xD;
      to present quitting with a medication as the default choice and promote shared decision&#xD;
      making by allowing patients to see the menu of options available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will combine the use of 'default choices' when approaching smokers and&#xD;
      shared decision making with a decision aid for choosing between smoking cessation treatments.&#xD;
      The investigators will train GPs to offer smoking cessation as the default choice while&#xD;
      involving patients in key decisions using a decision aid. This innovative approach has not&#xD;
      been tested in primary care and has the potential to increase the number of current smokers&#xD;
      who make a quit attempt with a proven quit aid, thereby increasing the number of patients who&#xD;
      quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will implement the training as part of the Vivre sans tabac programme for&#xD;
      GPs run by the Swiss Medical Association (FMH).&#xD;

GPs in the control group will likely realize their training is shorter, and GPs in the intervention group will realize their training is different from traditional teachings. Patients will be told that the study compares two training programs. To the extent possible, outcome assessors will be blinded to study arm when performing follow-up. The statistician performing the primary outcome analyses will be blinded to group assignments.</masking_description>

    <description>A refresher training course will be the equivalent of 'enhanced' usual care. Enhanced because the course will likely augment short-term knowledge of smoking cessation treatments, and participation in the study could trigger more discussions about smoking cessation than routine practice. However, it will be impossible to have any blinding between groups without at least some training.</description>

    <description>1) a one-time, in-person, 2.5-hour training program encouraging participating GPs to present quitting smoking with a quit aid as the default choice to their eligible patients, and 2) access to an electronic decision aid that presents available quit aids. The 2.5-hour training program consists of: 1.5 hours of didactic teaching, with information about pharmacologic quit aids, electronic cigarettes, presenting quitting as a default choice, the decision aid, and a video of a model consultation. This is followed by 1 hour of role plays to practice presenting quitting as a default choice using the decision aid.</description>
