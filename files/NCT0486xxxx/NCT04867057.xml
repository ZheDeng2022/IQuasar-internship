  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, randomized, double blind, SAD (with food effect) followed by a MAD&#xD;
      study of Trichomylin® conducted in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and food effect of Trichomylin® in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 56 participants will be enrolled into 1 of 4 SAD cohorts (8 per cohort) and 3 MAD&#xD;
      cohorts (8 per cohort). Participants will undergo a Screening period between 21 days and 28&#xD;
      days prior to randomization/dose administration (for SAD and MAD respectively), admission to&#xD;
      the clinical research unit (CRU), pre-dose assessment, post-dose assessment, and a final end&#xD;
      of study (EOS)/follow-up or early termination (ET) visit (if applicable).&#xD;

             occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) or using an&#xD;
             acceptable, highly effective contraceptive method from Screening until study&#xD;
             completion, including the follow-up period. Acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
             include the use of condoms and the use of an effective contraceptive for the female&#xD;
             partner that includes: OCPs, long-acting implantable hormones, injectable hormones, a&#xD;
             vaginal ring, or an IUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Males who are abstinent from heterosexual intercourse will also be eligible and must&#xD;

             last study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male participants with same-sex partners are eligible when this is their preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle.&#xD;
