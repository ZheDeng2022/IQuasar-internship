  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pre- operative evaluation for the presence of intermediate risk factors prior to surgery&#xD;
      may allow for better patient counselling, modify the course of surgery or select patients to&#xD;
      undergo primary chemo- radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to validate that the presence of histological risk factors in a&#xD;
      pre-operative large loop biopsy highly correlates with post-operative histological evaluation&#xD;
      and the subsequent indication for post-operative chemo-radiation&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cervical cancer who are scheduled for radical hysterectomy and underwent a pre-&#xD;
      operative MRI and PET- CT that have demonstrated a tumor ≥2- 4cm cm and the absence of nodal&#xD;
      metastasis on imaging will be offered to give consent and participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After anesthesia and immediately prior to surgery, the surgeon will perform a large loop&#xD;
      biopsy of depth of 1.5 and a diameter of 1.0 cm from the cervical tumor. Hemostasis can be&#xD;
      achieved by the usual measures or by packing. Surgery will follow immediately as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patient who in the course of the preoperative evaluation underwent large loop biopsy&#xD;
      histologic analysis of this biopsy will be performed similarly. If the large loop specimen is&#xD;
      appropriate (&gt;1.5X1cm) and allows assessment of all the histologic risk factors, no repeat&#xD;
      large loop biopsy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patient that the that the previous large loop biopsy is not be appropriate for complete&#xD;
      histologic analysis and the surgeon asses that a repeat biopsy is technically feasible, a&#xD;
      large loop biopsy will be performed prior to the radical hysterectomy as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All histological evaluation will be carried out as usual in hospital in which the surgery was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, centralized pathological analysis will be performed in Hillel Yaffe Medical&#xD;
      center The histopathological features to be included in the report: type of procedure, tumor&#xD;
      site, histologic type of tumor, histologic grade, depth of stromal invasion, pattern of&#xD;
      invasion (*), horizontal extent of stromal invasion, the distance of tumor from surgical&#xD;
      margins, lymphovascular invasion, LVSI will be assess and reported after D2-40and CD31&#xD;
      immunostatins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive demographic, clinical and pathology data will be noted. The histopathological&#xD;
      features noted above and size of tumor as measured on MRI will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of the presence of both LVSI and invasion greater 10 mm in the pre- operative loop&#xD;
      biopsy will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 52 patients will be included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimal sample size required to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Method B (findings in&#xD;
      LEEP) is 52. Assuming that the proportions of patients with the presence of both LVSI and&#xD;
      tumor invasion greater than 10 mm, method A (standard post- surgery evaluation) and method B&#xD;
      are 25%, with α=0.05, β=0.2, and non-inferiority margin of 15%.&#xD;
