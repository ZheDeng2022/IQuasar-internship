      To compare between small sized tube thoracostomy and large sized tube thoracostomy regarding&#xD;
      the need for another chest tube for the fear of obstruction (in hemomothorax) or ineffective&#xD;
      drainage (in hemothorax, pneumothorax or hemo-pneumothorax) ,pain score or repositioning and&#xD;
      need for thoracotomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evacuate abnormal fluid and air, chest tubes are placed in the pleural space, either&#xD;
      surgically or percutaneously. Therapeutic drainage of pleural conditions such as&#xD;
      pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, chylothorax, and malignant effusions, as well as&#xD;
      prophylaxis drainage of air, blood, and other fluids after chest surgery are the indications&#xD;
      for chest tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed water-seal chest drainage has been described in 1875 by Gotthard Bülau to treat an&#xD;
      empyema, as an alternative to the standard rib resection and open tube drainage in the acute&#xD;
      phase or rib excision (saucerization) in the chronic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bülau emphasized the necessity of negative intrapleural pressure for re-expansion of a&#xD;
      collapsed lung in the setting of thoracic empyema although most surgeons in his time&#xD;
      attributed deaths from thoracic empyema to infection and not superimposed respiratory&#xD;
      compromise due to open pneumothorax .&#xD;
&#xD;
      He understood that closed water seal drainage could facilitate lung re-expansion via the&#xD;
      patient's natural respiratory movements. Unfortunately, until mechanical ventilation was&#xD;
      introduced, application of these principles was limited to the treatment of thoracic empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both the Second World War and the Korean one lung function restoration was the primary&#xD;
      goal of thoracic wound treatment: emergency tube thoracostomy became extremely frequent in&#xD;
      haemothorax and tension pneumothorax treatment. For the first time the drain was connected to&#xD;
      a two-bottle water seal suction system since 1952 , synthetic ones, more flexible and easy to&#xD;
      place, replaced metal tubes and modern three chamber thoracic drain, for a more efficient&#xD;
      suction, were employed. New, flexible and plastic drains were widely used by the 1980s, they&#xD;
      ranged between 6 and 40 French (F) in size. Since it was believed that smaller drains were&#xD;
      less effective in adult medicine, being more prone to the risk of obstruction, the smaller&#xD;
      ones (≤20 F) were commonly used in children, the bigger in adults,. In the last two decades,&#xD;
      small-bore chest tubes (SBCT) have gained increasing popularity In traumatic pneumothorax or&#xD;
      hemothorax the optimal tube size for an emergent thoracostomy is unknown. For the nonemergent&#xD;
      management of patients with traumatic pneumothorax or hemothorax both small catheter tube&#xD;
      thoracostomy and large-bore chest tube thoracostomy have been shown to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stable trauma patients small catheter tube thoracostomy is effective and comparable with&#xD;
      large catheter tube thoracostomy in managing chest trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the available evidence suggests that in resolving traumatic haemothoraces without&#xD;
      additional complications small bore drains may be as effective as large bore drains, there is&#xD;
      insufficient evidence currently available to recommend a change to standard practice (ie,&#xD;
      large bore drains).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inaba K , et al, 2012 concluded that chest tube size did not impact the clinically relevant&#xD;
      outcomes tested for injured patients with chest trauma. There was no difference in the&#xD;
      efficacy of drainage, need for additional tube drainage, or invasive procedures and rate of&#xD;
      complications including retained hemothorax. Pain felt by patients at the site of insertion&#xD;
      was not affected by tube size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most occurrences of traumatic pneumothorax (PTX) and hemothorax (HTX) can be managed&#xD;
      non-operatively by means of chest tube thoracostomy. Although most guidelines for chest&#xD;
      trauma recommend a large-bore chest tube, e.g., the 9th edition of the ATLSTM (Advanced&#xD;
      Trauma Life Support) program recommends a 36 or 40 Fr tube, and the JATECTM (Japan Advanced&#xD;
      Trauma Evaluation and Care) course recommends a 28 Fr or larger tube and choosing the tube&#xD;
      size based on the patient's physique, these recommendations are mainly based on traditional&#xD;
      clinical habits. These large-bore chest tubes may cause pain related to the insertion site&#xD;
      and discomfort, especially in conscious patients. Smaller tubes were reported to reduce the&#xD;
      pain associated with the tube insertion site in patients with pleural infection.&#xD;
