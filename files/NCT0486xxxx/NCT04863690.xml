      In this study, we will examine whether use of the Sleep Intervention protocol marketed by&#xD;
      Interaxon (the 'Muse'), leads to improvements in sleep quality (e.g. decreased latency to&#xD;
      sleep, improved sleep duration), as well as knock-on improvements on measures of mindfulness,&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life scores, reduction in perceived stress levels, anxiety,&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive performance, improvement in markers relevant for safety, and&#xD;
      increased success in the workplace in healthy participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We all sleep, hopefully, every single day. Regular and sufficient sleep helps maintain&#xD;
      numerous aspects of physical and mental health, but countless ordinary life circumstances,&#xD;
      such as parenthood, demanding professions, studying, illness, or lifestyle choices often&#xD;
      prevent people from getting a full night's sleep. In fact, in a recent US health survey of&#xD;
      approximately 250000 people, 29.2% of respondents reported getting less than an average of 6&#xD;
      hours of sleep per night. Individuals who sleep this little on a day-to-day basis are&#xD;
      considered to be experiencing chronic partial sleep deprivation (SD) (also known as sleep&#xD;
      restriction), which, in a laboratory setting, has been associated with impaired physiological&#xD;
      and cognitive functioning. It has been estimated that the productivity lost annually due to&#xD;
      chronic partial SD costs an estimated $21.4 billion in Canada alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interaxon markets a non-invasive head-worn device EEG biofeedback device ('Muse') to&#xD;
      encourage and aid effective meditation and sleep. This device has been previously shown to&#xD;
      improve workplace wellness, fatigue and quality of life, and performance on Stroop Task. It&#xD;
      has also been shown to improve physiological markers associated with improved relaxation and&#xD;
      cognition. Muse has been shown to have EEG signal comparable to a clinical grade EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is not known, is whether use of the Muse device can actually improve sleep quality and&#xD;
      if so, in what ways. Thus far, some reports have suggested that the Muse Meditation device&#xD;
      can improve relaxation, but a comprehensive evaluation of sleep has not been undertaken in a&#xD;
      relatively large sample of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will examine whether use of the Muse Sleep Intervention by healthy&#xD;
      participants, leads to improvements in sleep quality (e.g. decreased latency to sleep,&#xD;
      improved sleep duration), as well as knock-on improvements on measures of mindfulness,&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life scores, reduction in perceived stress levels, anxiety,&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive performance, improvement in markers relevant for safety, and&#xD;
      increased success in the workplace. We will examine whether these changes are associated with&#xD;
      changes in heart rhythm as measured by the Muse on board PPG sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      360 participants working in a large engineering firm, Hatch, will use the Muse Sleep&#xD;
      Intervention to meditate before sleep over the course of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly divided into 4 groups with 90 participants in each group&#xD;
      (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will use the Muse Sleep Intervention system with no coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will use the Muse Sleep Intervention system with digital coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will use the Muse Sleep Intervention system with digital coaching and additional&#xD;
      human group online coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 will be a control group and will not use any of the Muse meditation systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of the Study, all participants will complete the Cambridge Brain Sciences online&#xD;
      cognitive assessment battery, plus a longer questionnaire about stress levels, workplace&#xD;
      wellness, quality of life, mindfulness and sleep quality. They will then begin the 6-week&#xD;
      study according to their following Group assignments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Sleep Intervention System - No Coaching Participants will join a 1.5-hour virtual&#xD;
      onboarding session where they will be trained on how to use the Muse S device and will&#xD;
      complete their first Muse session. Participants will be asked to use either the Muse Mind&#xD;
      Meditation, Muse Sleep Journeys, Go to Sleep Soundscapes or Go to Sleep Guidance each evening&#xD;
      as part of their bedtime routine to help them prepare to sleep. In addition, participants may&#xD;
      use any part of the Muse App (Mind, Heart, Breath, Body, Guided or Go to Sleep meditations),&#xD;
      as often as they like to help them fall asleep, go back to sleep, or as a meditation practice&#xD;
      during the daytime. All Participants will also be asked to do the Muse Mind meditation for a&#xD;
      minimum of 5 minutes per day, a minimum of 5 days per week, for 6 weeks. If they also wish to&#xD;
      use the Muse system more frequently (day or night), they will be encouraged to do so and will&#xD;
      be able to choose between several styles of available meditation (Mind, Heart, Breath, Body,&#xD;
      Guided or Go to Sleep meditations). Participants will be asked to also wear their Muse device&#xD;
      while they sleep, as often as they like in order to track their sleep. Participants will have&#xD;
      unlimited access to Muse Customer Care via phone, email, and video where appropriate during&#xD;
      normal business hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Sleep Intervention System - Plus Digital Coaching The procedure will be identical to&#xD;
      Group 1 above, but in addition, all participants will also work through the content in the&#xD;
      Muse S Sleep Coaching course, and implement the sleep hygiene and habit changes recommended&#xD;
      through the course that they find reasonable and effective for their situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Sleep Intervention System - Plus Digital Coaching plus Human Coaching. The procedure&#xD;
      will be identical to Group 2 above, but in addition, all participants will be asked to join&#xD;
      regular online coaching sessions. Participants will be divided into 9 cohorts of 10 people&#xD;
      per cohort. Each cohort will be offered group coaching once per week. Coaches will be versed&#xD;
      in Mindfulness, and how to use Muse and how to support sleep. Coaching will take place&#xD;
      virtually using Interaxon's Zoom account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: Controls The participants in the control group will receive a Muse Device, which&#xD;
      they will be free to keep at the end of the study. They will be asked not to open and/or use&#xD;
      the Muse device until the entire study is complete. On day 1 of the Study, they will complete&#xD;
      the Cambridge Brain Sciences online cognitive assessment battery, plus a longer questionnaire&#xD;
      about stress levels, workplace wellness, quality of life, mindfulness and (depending on&#xD;
      group), sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Week 6 (at the completion of the main study period), all participants will be&#xD;
      reassessed using the Cambridge Brain Sciences online cognitive assessment battery, and the&#xD;
      longer questionnaire about stress levels, workplace wellness, quality of life, mindfulness&#xD;
      and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also complete a brief debriefing questionnaire at the end of Week 6,&#xD;
      reporting their experiences about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will again be assessed using the Cambridge Brain Sciences online cognitive assessment&#xD;
      battery, and the longer questionnaire about stress levels, workplace wellness, quality of&#xD;
      life, mindfulness and sleep quality at the end of Week 12 (6 weeks after completing the main&#xD;
      study period).&#xD;
