  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advantage of higher protein intake has been pointed for critically ill patients. However,&#xD;
      it is not easy to achieve no overfeeding but adequate protein intakes for critically ill&#xD;
      patients. It is thus important to conduct a strategy to deliver an adequate protein under but&#xD;
      no overfeeding for critically ill patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      association of protein intakes with clinical outcomes by delivering high-protein pre-digested&#xD;
      enteral formula to surgical critically ill patients. We are going to recruit 160 surgical&#xD;
      critically ill patients. Patients would be randomly assigned to either control or&#xD;
      experimental group. Very-high protein pre-digested formula (37% of energy) would be given to&#xD;
      the experimental group, while standard-high protein formula (16% of energy) would be given to&#xD;
      the control group for at least 3 days to up to 7 days. The patients' data were collected or&#xD;
      calculated and included basic characteristics, mean energy and protein intakes, clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (APACHE II score, comorbidities, days in hospital to ICU admission, length of&#xD;
      ventilator dependence, hospital and ICU stays, and survival days). We anticipated that the&#xD;
      results of this study could provide the benefit of high protein delivery on clinical outcomes&#xD;
      for critically ill patients.&#xD;

      Trial Design and Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized controlled trial. This study&#xD;
      is conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all&#xD;
      procedures were reviewed as well as approved by the Regional Hospital Ethics Committee. The&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained before randomization. We will collect subjects'&#xD;
      demographic and clinical characteristics on the first and seventh day of the intervention,&#xD;
      including age, gender, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), Disease diagnosis, disease&#xD;
      severity (The Acute physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, APACHE II), Sequential Organ&#xD;
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, disease history, ventilator parameters, body temperature,&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse rate and breathing frequency. The complications, length of stay in&#xD;
      intensive care unit, total hospitalization Days, hospital mortality, 14-day survival results,&#xD;
      28-day survival results, days of ventilator use will be also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 20 years of age or older will be eligible for inclusion if they have been admitted&#xD;
      to the surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) for 24 hours or more. Subjects with enteral&#xD;
      nutrition to be clinically contraindicated by treating clinician considered will be excluded.&#xD;
      Total of one hundred and sixty patients will be included and randomly assigned into two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric and Biochemical Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' caloric requirement will be calculated based on the guidelines for critically&#xD;
      ill nutrition treatment published by ASPEN/SCCM in 2016, suggesting that critically ill&#xD;
      patients should be given 25 calories per kilogram of ideal body weight. The protein&#xD;
      requirement of patients will be calculated based on the 1.5 g/kg/day recommended by the 2017&#xD;
      ESPEN guidelines for the nutritional care of critically ill surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional intake and digestive tract symptoms of the patient within 7 days after&#xD;
      entering the intensive care unit will be recorded, including nutritional intake (calories,&#xD;
      carbohydrate, protein, fat) of enteral nutrition as well as intravenous nutrition(dosage of&#xD;
      propofol, glucose infusion and glucosaline used...etc.),and digestive symptoms (diarrhea,&#xD;
      bloating, Abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, vomiting... etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biochemical assessments of patients will be measured on the first and seventh days of&#xD;
      admission to the ICU, including blood routine examination, total lymphocyte counts,&#xD;
      creatinine, blood urine nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspirate aminotransferase&#xD;
      (AST), total bilirubin, albumin, prealbumin, total protein, cholesterol, triglyceride, uric&#xD;
      acid, electrolyte, C-reactive protein, blood sugar as well as 24-hour urine urea nitrogen&#xD;
      (UUN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Lymphocyte Count and Nitrogen Balance are calculated by the following formulae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Lymphocyte Count (cells/mm3) = WBC×% lymphocyte Nitrogen Balance (gm/day) = (protein&#xD;
      intake/6.25) - (UUN + 4 g obligatory loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Formula In-kind support will be provided by Nestlé Health Science, which&#xD;
      supplied both of the enteral nutrition formulations, Peptamen® Intense VHP and Peptamen®.&#xD;
      Peptamen® Intense VHP (37% protein of total energy) and Peptamen® (16% protein of total&#xD;
      energy) will be provided to two groups of subjects respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial enteral nutrition was administered for at least 3 days up to 7 days or until the&#xD;
      patient discontinued enteral nutrition, or was discharged from the ICU, whichever occurred&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
