  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern for people on long-term treatments that modify the&#xD;
      immune system function. People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) form a large group who receive&#xD;
      such treatments called disease modifying therapies (DMTs). Several types of DMTs with&#xD;
      different effects on the immune system are being used for multiple sclerosis (MS). In the&#xD;
      absence of large-scale national studies, the risk of COVID-19 among pwMS on various DMTs has&#xD;
      not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few physician-reported registry-based studies have suggested that anti-CD20 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as ocrelizumab and rituximab, used in the treatment of MS can increase the&#xD;
      risk of COVID-19. However, in our community-based COVID-19 study of a large cohort of pwMS as&#xD;
      part of the UK MS Register, we could not demonstrate an association between DMTs and&#xD;
      susceptibility to COVID-19. Other studies have not found any relationship between DMTs and&#xD;
      the outcome of COVID-19 among pwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, UK is the only country in the world that collects national data on DMT use,&#xD;
      providing us with the opportunity to investigate the impact of DMTs on COVID-19&#xD;
      susceptibility and severity in a large population of pwMS. In England, no DMT is being&#xD;
      dispensed without prior approval and specialised commissioning by the national Health&#xD;
      Services (NHS) England &amp; NHS Improvement (NHSE/I). The scheme, currently implemented in over&#xD;
      100 NHS Trusts in England, ensures that treatment decisions are made in line with agreed&#xD;
      commissioning policy and are evidence-based. NHSE/I also has access to Public Health England&#xD;
      (PHE) held data on all people who have had a SARS-CoV-2 test. By identifying all pwMS on DMTs&#xD;
      and all those who have had a test for coronavirus and collecting data on the clinical outcome&#xD;
      of their COVID-19 from their local NHS hospitals, we would be able to establish the risk of&#xD;
      COVID-19 and the risk of contracting the infection associated with different DMTs. The&#xD;
      findings of the study will help MS clinical teams address the concerns of pwMS about taking&#xD;
      DMTs during the COVID-19 pandemic and update their guidelines on the measures pwMS need to&#xD;
      take during these unprecedented times.&#xD;
