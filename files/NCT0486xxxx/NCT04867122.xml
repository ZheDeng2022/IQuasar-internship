      This study is a randomized clinical trial of a problem-solving therapy intervention for&#xD;
      family caregivers of individuals with cancer receiving outpatient palliative care. Study&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive either a three-session problem-solving therapy&#xD;
      intervention in addition to usual care or three sessions of attention-matched control in&#xD;
      addition to usual care.&#xD;

    <description>Each year of the project, the investigators will recruit 6 key stakeholders to participate in individual interviews focused on potential barriers and facilitators to adoption of the PST intervention into clinical practice: 3 from the rural site and 3 from the urban sites, for a total of 30 unique stakeholders who will be interviewed over the duration of this 5-year study.&#xD;

    <description>Over an approximately 3-week period, family caregivers randomized to the intervention study arm will learn and apply a problem-solving approach based on the ADAPT model, which encourages participants to follow five steps when solving caregiving problems: 1) focus on adopting a positive attitude to problem solving, 2) define the problem and set goals, 3) generate a list of alternative solutions to the problem, 4) predict consequences of the alternative solutions, and 5) try implementing the most promising solution from among the list of alternatives. The intervention will be delivered by a trained interventionist over the course of three structured sessions either face-to-face in the cancer center or via videoconferencing technology, depending on the FCG's preference. Session content will be summarized in an intervention manual, which we will provide to all intervention participants. Sessions will last approximately 45-60 minutes.</description>
