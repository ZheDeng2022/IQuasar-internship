  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CombiVacS is a phase 2 randomized, adaptive trial developed to evaluate the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      a dose of COMIRNATY after a previous single dose of VAXZEVRIA. A stratification will be made&#xD;
      based on the following factors: study site, sex and age. This protocol allows to test the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of a heterologous vaccination strategy after a previous single dose&#xD;
      of VAXZEVRIA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, non-blinded, controlled, adaptive, multicenter, Phase II study in&#xD;
      subjects aged ≥18 years and in good health or stable clinical situation that have received a&#xD;
      previous single dose of VAXZEVRIA. Subjects will be randomized to immediately receive or not&#xD;
      a dose of COMIRNATY in a ratio of 2:1. If primary analysis at day 14th confirms the starting&#xD;
      hypothesis, subjects randomized to no vaccination will be considered for administration of&#xD;
      one dose of COMINARTY at day 28th according to Public Health Department of the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health recommendations on heterologous vaccination. In case the primary analysis does not&#xD;
      confirm the starting hypothesis, subjects will be followed at the time points defined in the&#xD;
      flow-chart without administration of COMIRNATY. Other heterologous vaccination strategies&#xD;
      could be incorporated if deemed necessary for public health reasons. This could include the&#xD;
      use of different vaccination strategies including those already marketed vaccines for&#xD;
      comparative assessment of their safety and efficacy on SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.&#xD;
