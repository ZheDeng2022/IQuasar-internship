      Background The CORKA study was developed in response to a commissioned call by the National&#xD;
      Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme for&#xD;
      research into a functional home based rehabilitation programme for patients who may be at&#xD;
      risk of poor outcome after knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The CORKA trial is a prospective individually randomised controlled trial with blinded&#xD;
      outcome assessment at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The study will also include a qualitative&#xD;
      and a health economic analysis. Participants will be randomised to one of two arms,&#xD;
      'home-based rehabilitation' or 'Usual Care'. Those in the usual care arm will receive a&#xD;
      minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6 sessions of physiotherapy as delivered locally, e.g. class,&#xD;
      one to one, etc. Those in the intervention arm will receive 7 sessions of a functional&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme over a 12 week timescale. The intervention will be delivered using&#xD;
      physiotherapists and physiotherapy assistants in the participants' home. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed up at 6 months and 12 months&#xD;
