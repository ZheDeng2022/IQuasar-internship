  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide and is the leading cause&#xD;
      of gynecologic cancer deaths in high-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer consist of cytoreductive&#xD;
      surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy with or without concurrent and maintenance&#xD;
      bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A majority of women with epithelial ovarian cancer respond well to first-line platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy. There is however a high rate of relapse/recurrence (disease progression ranging&#xD;
      from 10 to 26 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), a new class of therapeutic molecules have&#xD;
      recently revolutionized this paradigm, demonstrating progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      advantages in several trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PARPi molecule Niraparib has obtained its market authorization after the NOVA trial as&#xD;
      second maintenance treatment line, irrespectively of patients' BRCA-mutated gene or HR&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, results of the Phase III trial PRIMA, have demonstrated that Niraparib can also&#xD;
      provided a significant PFS increase as first line maintenance treatment, for adult patients&#xD;
      with platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer who are in&#xD;
      response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      irrespectively of their BRCA-mutated gene or HR status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite its high therapeutic potential, Niraparib at standard dose (200 or&#xD;
      300mg/day) is known to lead to hematologic toxicity and/or nephrotoxicity. This was&#xD;
      demonstrated during the NOVA trial (the dose of Niraparib having to be reduced in 80% of the&#xD;
      patients to reduce toxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective study of the NOVA trial indicates that 2 predictive factors leading to&#xD;
      hematologic toxicity were a weight &lt;77kg and an initial platelet count &lt;175 G/L. However, it&#xD;
      seems more complex as 50% of patients with an initial weight between 58 and 77kg have not&#xD;
      reported thrombocytopenia. Same for platelet count. Creatinine clearance below 60ml/min and&#xD;
      an hypoalbuminemia &lt;35 g/l have also been identified in another study as predictive factors&#xD;
      to thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inter-individual heterogeneity in terms of toxicity regarding Niraparib is high and still&#xD;
      not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is therefore to better identify which clinical, biological and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic metrics can be considered as toxicity induction causes when Niraparib is used&#xD;
      as maintenance treatment (200 or 300mg/day) for ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;
