      This study was an experimental, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial that aimed to&#xD;
      compare recovery time between TCI propofol and sevoflurane. After ethical approval from&#xD;
      Research Ethical Committee Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia (879/UN2.F1/ETIK/2017)&#xD;
      and informed consent, patients aged 18-65 years old, body mass index 18 - 30 kg/m2, American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status I-II who were scheduled for vitrectomy surgery&#xD;
      under general anesthesia, at Kirana's Eye Operating Theatre Cipto Mangunkusumo National&#xD;
      Referral Hospital from September until December 2017, were recruited in this study. All&#xD;
      subjects would be recruited with a consecutive sampling method and randomly assigned into two&#xD;
      groups, the TCI propofol group and sevoflurane group. Block random allocation was done for&#xD;
      all subjects by using the random allocator program Winpepi.&#xD;

      This study was an experimental, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial that aimed to&#xD;
      compare recovery time between TCI propofol and sevoflurane. After ethical approval from&#xD;
      Research Ethical Committee Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia (879/UN2.F1/ETIK/2017)&#xD;
      and informed consent, patients aged 18-65 years old, body mass index 18 - 30 kg/m2, American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status I-II who were scheduled for vitrectomy surgery&#xD;
      under general anesthesia, at Kirana's Eye Operating Theatre Cipto Mangunkusumo National&#xD;
      Referral Hospital from September until December 2017, were recruited in this study. Patients&#xD;
      with hemodynamic instability, allergy, raised intracranial pressure, and a history of&#xD;
      hyperthermia malignant, were excluded from this study. Patients who have hearing disturbance,&#xD;
      history of alcohol, opioid, or psychotropic drugs consumption before surgery, suffered from&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disease, and electrolyte imbalance was also excluded from this study.&#xD;
      Patients who experience intraoperative cardiorespiratory disturbance, surgery duration less&#xD;
      than 35 minutes or more than 3 hours and 30 minutes, and patients with temperature&#xD;
      abnormalities before being extubated from LMA would be excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size calculation was performed with the unpaired numerical analytic&#xD;
      equation. At least eighteen subjects for each group should include in this study. With the&#xD;
      ten percent dropout possibility, twenty subjects will be recruited for each group, resulting&#xD;
      in a total sample size of 40 subjects. All subjects would be recruited with a consecutive&#xD;
      sampling method and randomly assigned into two groups, the TCI propofol group and sevoflurane&#xD;
      group. Block random allocation was done for all subjects by using the random allocator&#xD;
      program Winpepi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocols Peripheral venous catheters were placed in all subjects. Subjects in the TCI&#xD;
      propofol group had one specific intravenous catheter for propofol infusion apart from&#xD;
      medication or intravenous fluid line. In comparison, subjects in the sevoflurane group were&#xD;
      cannulated only with one venous catheter. Midazolam 0.05 mg/kg BW and fentanyl 1 mcg/kg BW&#xD;
      were given as premedication. Subjects in the TCI Propofol group received TCI propofol&#xD;
      (Schneider) with targeted Ce 4 -5 mcg/ml for anesthesia induction and maintenance. Subjects&#xD;
      in the sevoflurane group received intravenous propofol 1 - 2 mg/kg BW. BIS scores in both&#xD;
      groups was titrated down to 50. Laryngeal mask no.3 or no.4 was inserted three minutes after&#xD;
      administering atracurium 0.25 mg/kg BW. All subjects were ventilated with tidal volume 8&#xD;
      ml/kg BW, 12 times/minutes, oxygen fraction 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the TCI propofol group received TCI propofol for anesthesia maintenance, Ce value&#xD;
      was titrated until a targeted BIS score of 40-60 achieved. Subjects in the sevoflurane group&#xD;
      received sevoflurane 2 volume%, which were titrated up/down every 5 minutes to get a targeted&#xD;
      BIS score of 40-60. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and BIS score were&#xD;
      monitored every 5 minutes. Fentanyl 1 mcg/ kg BW was added if there was an increase in blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate and or BIS score that couldn't be overcome by increasing the dose of TCI&#xD;
      propofol or sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery was considered done when the palpebral retractor had been removed. After spontaneous&#xD;
      ventilation reverted, neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg BW and atropine 0.04 mg/kg BW as a reversal&#xD;
      agent were given. Laryngeal mask was removed when the anesthesia still deep enough and&#xD;
      subjects were monitored afterward. Time when TCI propofol and sevoflurane were discontinued&#xD;
      was recorded (T0). Time when the patient was fully awake and could follow simple orders such&#xD;
      as raising hands was recorded (Tp). Recovery time was the duration from T0 to Tp. Unwanted&#xD;
      events during recovery, such as agitation and nausea-vomiting were recorded. Total fentanyl&#xD;
      usage during surgery was also recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical&#xD;
      Product for Social Sciences (SPSS) software 21.0 for windows. T-Test or Mann-Whitney analysis&#xD;
      was done depending on the data normality test.&#xD;
