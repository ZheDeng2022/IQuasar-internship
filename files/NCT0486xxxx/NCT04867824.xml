    <textblock>
      Clipping of the tongue-tie is a common procedure that physicians perform in our neonatal unit&#xD;
      to help establish breastfeeding. It is a painful technique where the measures usually&#xD;
      performed to control pain (such as sucking) cannot be done at the time of the clipping&#xD;
      because the technique is performed on the tongue. A previous study conducted at our center&#xD;
      proved the benefits of inhaled lavender essential oil to control pain during frenotomy, for&#xD;
      which inhaled essential oil is now routinely used when clipping a tongue-tie. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to compare the analgesic/soothing effect of inhaled lavender essential oil vs&#xD;
      inhaled vanilla essential oil during the clipping of the tongue-tie. Participants will be&#xD;
      newborns born at our hospital during the study period (expected to be May to December 2021).&#xD;
      Patients will be offered to participate and will be enrolled in the study if their parents&#xD;
      agree to and sign an informed consent. The use of inhaled lavender and vanilla essential oils&#xD;
      is safe. No side effects have been found with their use. The procedure of the frenotomy will&#xD;
      not change for patients who are enrolled in the study. At the moment, inhaled lavender&#xD;
      essential oil is used as complementary analgesia for the clipping of tongue-ties in our&#xD;
      neonatal unit. By demonstrating which of the two oils has better results, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to improve pain management of the patients who undergo a frenotomy. This study will take&#xD;
      place at the neonatal unit of Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial will be conducted with the neonates born at our hospital or less&#xD;
      than 15 days old who undergo a frenotomy for type 3 tongue-ties according to Coryllos&#xD;
      classification and the Hazelbaker tool during the study period (expected to take place from&#xD;
      May to December 2021). Pain will be assessed by means of crying time, the highest Neonatal&#xD;
      Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) score in the five minutes post procedure, increase in heart rate&#xD;
      (HR) and decrease in oxygen saturation (satO2) pre/post-procedure. NIPS evaluates facial&#xD;
      expression, crying, breathing pattern, arm and leg position, and state of arousal on a scale&#xD;
      from 0 to 7, where 0-2 means no pain to mild pain, 3-4 mild to moderate pain, and &gt;4 severe&#xD;
      pain. In an exploratory preliminary study prior to the intervention, a mean (SD) crying time&#xD;
      of 19.80 (21.14) seconds was observed. In order to detect a difference of 10 seconds in&#xD;
      crying time, the investigators calculated that a sample size of 71 patients per group would&#xD;
      be required in order to draw conclusions with a CI 95% and a power of 80%. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled if their parents agree to and sign a written informed consent. Demographic (sex,&#xD;
      gestational age, birth weight, age in hours at the time of frenotomy) and clinical variables&#xD;
      (HR and satO2 before, during, and after the procedure, whether there is crying or not during&#xD;
      the procedure, length of crying time in seconds, presence of side effects during the&#xD;
      procedure (apnea, desaturation, others) and highest NIPS score within the first 5 minutes&#xD;
      after the procedure) will be recorded. The independent variable will be the use of inhaled&#xD;
      lavender essential oil (LEO) or the use of inhaled vanilla essential oil during frenotomy.&#xD;
      The dependent variables will be: HR and satO2 pre and post procedure, presence of crying and&#xD;
      duration, hours of life at the time of the frenotomy, and the NIPS score. The controlled&#xD;
      variables will be: gestational age, sex, and birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare providers assess for the presence of ankyloglossia as part of the routine neonatal&#xD;
      evaluation and offer a frenotomy to all tongue-tied patients. The examiner grades the&#xD;
      ankyloglossia based on Coryllos's criteria and the Hazelbaker tool to assess its impact on&#xD;
      tongue movement and on breastfeeding. A lingual frenulum is symptomatic if it scores 8 points&#xD;
      or less in appearance and/or 11 points or less in function according to Hazelbaker. Advice&#xD;
      and help with positioning and attachment for breastfeeding is provided to all the mothers by&#xD;
      IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) nurses. During the study period,&#xD;
      if a patient with a type 3 tongue-tie is identified, the patient's parents will be offered to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Accepted patients will be allocated into case (vanilla essential&#xD;
      oil) or control (LEO) group by simple random sampling using the program OxMAR (Online&#xD;
      Minimization and Randomization for Clinical Trials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the frenotomy the neonate will be taken to the neonatal unit and monitored with a&#xD;
      pulse-oximeter (COVIDIEN Nellcor Portable SpO2 Patient Monitoring System PM10N, Covidien&#xD;
      Ireland Limited, IDA Business &amp; Technology Park, Tullamore, Ireland) before, during and after&#xD;
      the procedure. For both groups the neonates will de swaddled, administered 1 mL of oral&#xD;
      sucrose, and allowed to suck for 2 minutes prior to the procedure. The control group will&#xD;
      have a 7 x 7 cm gauze pad with 1 drop of 100% pure LEO (Pranarôm España S.L.) placed 2 cm&#xD;
      under their nose for 2 minutes prior to starting the frenotomy and during the procedure. The&#xD;
      case group will have a 7 x 7 cm gauze pad with 1 drop of 100% pure vanilla essential oil&#xD;
      (Pranarôm España S.L.) placed 2 cm under their nose for 2 minutes prior to starting the&#xD;
      frenotomy and during the procedure. The bottle of both essential oils has a dropper that&#xD;
      always dispenses the same amount of oil per drop. The procedure will not start until the&#xD;
      patient is calm and has a NIPS score of 0. Frenotomy will be performed by one of the three&#xD;
      staff neonatologists using Coryllos' technique: placing a sterile groove director under the&#xD;
      tongue straddling the frenulum, holding the frenulum in place with visualization of tongue&#xD;
      base and frenulum, and snipping the frenulum with a scissor along the underside of the tongue&#xD;
      to its base just proximal to the genioglossus muscle, until a full release is achieved. Once&#xD;
      the procedure is completed, the gauze pad will be removed and vital signs recorded, as well&#xD;
      as whether the baby cried or not, the seconds crying lasted, and the post procedure NIPS&#xD;
      score on a data collection sheet. If a neonate cries, calming techniques such as holding,&#xD;
      swaddling, and sucking will be employed. Following the frenotomy, the neonate will be&#xD;
      returned to the mother for breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Quantitative variables (gestational age, birth weight, age at&#xD;
      frenotomy, heart rate pre and post-procedure, increase in heart rate postprocedure, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation pre and post-procedure, decrease in oxygen saturation post-procedure, and duration&#xD;
      of crying) will be described using the mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI); case vs control groups will be compared with a Student's t test. Sex, the presence of&#xD;
      crying, and adverse effects between the two groups will be presented in percentages and will&#xD;
      be compared using Fisher's exact test. NIPS scores between cases and controls will be&#xD;
      compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test. Statistical significance will be set&#xD;
      for a p &lt;0.05. To perform statistical analyses, the investigators will use STATA version 15.1&#xD;
      (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hospital Ethics Committee (CEIm-PSMAR) will approve this study (reference code:&#xD;
      2021/9731/I). Prior to patient enrollment, the investigators will obtain a signed informed&#xD;
      consent from the neonate's parents. This study will be conducted according to the ethics code&#xD;
      of the Barcelona Medical Association and the principles of the Helsinki-Fortaleza Declaration&#xD;
      2013.&#xD;
