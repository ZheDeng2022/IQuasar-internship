  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of a 12-weeks cardiac rehabilitation training (HIIT,&#xD;
      MICT) program on VO2peak and cardiac fibrosis in patients, and evaluate the effects of HIIT&#xD;
      on endothelial function, microvascular obstruction, body fat, inflammation, arrhythmia and&#xD;
      psychology .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Eligible and consenting patients are randomized (block randomization) in a 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      According to the number of 180 samples calculated by the sample size, the random number table&#xD;
      containing 1-180 ( including shedding cases ) was obtained by the computer. Case number will&#xD;
      be assigned to participants in each group according to the order of grouping, and each case&#xD;
      number corresponded to Group1(HIIT), 2(MICT) or 3(Control) according to the random number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIIT sessions include brief, intermittent bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed&#xD;
      with periods of low-intensity exercise (active recovery). HIIT include 20 intervals of&#xD;
      high-intensity (30-60s at rating of perceived exertion (RPE; Borg scale of 6-20) of 15 to 17)&#xD;
      and low-intensity (1min at RPE &lt;10 or totally rest). The whole exercise cycle takes around&#xD;
      40-50 minutes (Figure 2). In MICT Group, patients perform 40-50 minutes at a RPE of 12 to&#xD;
      14(a total of 4 groups, each group 5-8 min, interspersed with 2-minute rest)(Figure 3). HIIT&#xD;
      and MICT are performed only during supervised sessions with non-consecutive 3 days/week. And&#xD;
      all patients are supervised by professional CR team. After assessing by therapists and&#xD;
      doctors, participants also can perform three days of home-based exercises guided by wearing a&#xD;
      sports bracelet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CR program includes 36 sessions supervised exercises, pharmacological counseling, patient&#xD;
      education, catering management, smoking cessation counseling, stress management, and&#xD;
      psychological counseling. A standard 36 sessions of CR usually lasts 12 weeks (three sessions&#xD;
      per week).&#xD;
