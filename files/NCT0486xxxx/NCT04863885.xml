  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well the study drugs called Ipilimumab plus Nivolumab&#xD;
      (IPI-NIVO) work when added to another study drug called Sacituzumab Govitecan for people who&#xD;
      have metastatic bladder cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase I component of this study will evaluate fixed doses of ipilimumab and nivolumab (3&#xD;
      mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively) IV every 3 weeks x 4 cycles combined with a starting dose of&#xD;
      sacituzumab govitecan Level 1 of 8 mg/kg IV days 1,8 every 3 weeks (1 cycle) x 4 cycles. One&#xD;
      dose escalation to 10 mg/kg and one dose reduction to dose level minus 1 of sacituzumab&#xD;
      govitecan 6 mg/kg days 1,8 every 3 weeks is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II component will be conducted as two-stage trial enrolling 34 patients with a&#xD;
      futility interim analysis after stage 1 (13 patients). After 4 cycles, patients will continue&#xD;
      maintenance nivolumab 360 mg IV every Q 21 days along with RP2 dose of SG D1,8 Q21 days till&#xD;
      progression of disease or intolerable toxicities or patient decision. Radiographic imaging is&#xD;
      performed every 12 weeks to assess response.&#xD;

          -  Known active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C (In subjects with a history of HBV, hepatitis&#xD;
             B core antibody (HBcAb) testing is required and if positive, then HB DNA testing will&#xD;
             be performed and if positive the patient will be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's&#xD;
