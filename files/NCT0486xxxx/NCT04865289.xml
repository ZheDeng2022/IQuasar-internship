      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib to&#xD;
      chemotherapy in female participants with Stage III, IV, or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the combination of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib will be superior to&#xD;
      chemotherapy for progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR). It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that the combination of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib will be superior to&#xD;
      chemotherapy for overall survival (OS).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and designated time points up to 27 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to assess the quality of life of patients with cancer. It contains 30 questions (items), 24 of which aggregate into nine multi-item scales representing various aspects, or dimensions, of quality of life (QoL): one global scale, five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, pain), and six additional single-symptom items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhoea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. Individual items are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Raw scores for each scale are standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation; a higher score on the global and functional scales represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning, and a higher score on the symptom scale represents a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>
