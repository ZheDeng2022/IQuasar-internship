    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      MRG003, as well as immunogenicity as defined by the incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) of&#xD;
      MRG003 in patients with advanced solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of head and neck, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts: Phase Ia dose escalation and Phase Ib dose expansion. The&#xD;
      objective of Phase Ia is to determine MTD or RP2D, and Phase Ib is conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      efficacy of MRG003 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
      head and neck (SCCHN), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;
