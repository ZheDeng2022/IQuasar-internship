      The aim of this study is to assess risks and outcomes among COVID-19 patients admitted to&#xD;
      Assiut University Hospitals.&#xD;

      Corona Virus comprises a large group of viruses, that are common in human beings as well&#xD;
      animals. There are seven different strains of corona virus, one of them is SARS-COV-2 (the&#xD;
      novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 11th March 2020. The World Health Organization declared the international spread of&#xD;
      COVID-19 considering it a global pandemic. On 3rd July 2020. WHO declared the total number of&#xD;
      confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients is 10,720,450 and number of deaths is 517,340 cases&#xD;
      worldwide while in Egypt number of confirmed cases is 71,299 and number of deaths is 3,120&#xD;
      [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest disparity found was by age. People who were 80 or older were seventy times more&#xD;
      likely to die than those under 40. Higher in males than females. Higher in those living in&#xD;
      deprived area than those living in the least deprived and higher in Black, Asian and Minority&#xD;
      Ethnic groups than in White ethnic groups [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was found that Demographic Characteristics, underlying health state and clinical&#xD;
      presentation affect outcome of COVID-19 patients. For example, incidence highest among people&#xD;
      aged &gt; 80 years. Hospitalization is six times higher among patients with reported underlying&#xD;
      comorbidity (45.4%) than those without reported underlying comorbidity (7.6%). Deaths were 12&#xD;
      times higher in patients with reported underlying comorbidity (19.5%) compared to those&#xD;
      without underlying comorbidity (1.6%) [4,5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human to human transmission occurs via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces with&#xD;
      Incubation Period 2-14 days after exposure to virus. clinical presentation include: fever,&#xD;
      cough, shortness of breath, new loss of taste and smell, body ache, headache, sore throat and&#xD;
      diarrhea [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real time PCR used as diagnostic tool for COVID-19, other laboratory findings include&#xD;
      leukopenia, lymphopenia, elevated CRP, elevated D-Dimer, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-10, and TNF-α), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 on admission [7][8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (CT Chest) used for assessment severity of lung affection and follow up.&#xD;
      Typical CT findings include Ground Glass Opacities: bilateral, subpleural and peripheral,&#xD;
      crazy paving appearance (GGO and inter-/intra-lobular septal thickening), Air space&#xD;
      consolidation and bronchovascular thickenings [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main therapies used in treatment include Home Isolation, drugs: antibiotic, antiviral,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, multivitamins and anticoagulants, O2 therapy, non invasive intervention&#xD;
      e.g.: CPAP and invasive intervention e.g.: Mechanical Ventilation. Outcome of patients depend&#xD;
      on several factors e.g.: comorbidities, previous lung state, early diagnosis and start of&#xD;
      treatment [10].&#xD;
