      The Expect-it study aims to accompany the development and clinical implementation process of&#xD;
      a new algorithm for the management of expected difficult intubation. The new algorithm is&#xD;
      designed to allocate patients to specific tracheal intubation techniques. After assessing the&#xD;
      status quo (non-algorithm-based decision-making) the new algorithm-based allocation will be&#xD;
      compared with this clinical standard within a confirmatory diagnostic accuracy study&#xD;
      (post-implementation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Difficult tracheal intubation is one of the major reasons for anesthesia-related adverse&#xD;
      events. Patients undergoing ear, nose &amp; throat (ENT) or oral and maxillofacial (OMS) surgery&#xD;
      often require tracheal intubation for general anesthesia but are at increased risk for&#xD;
      difficult tracheal intubation. Currently, existing preoperative tests for the prediction of&#xD;
      difficult intubation show low diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, as the results of these&#xD;
      prediction tests are not coupled with concrete treatment recommendations, they cannot be used&#xD;
      targeted within preventive concepts. An evidence based rational algorithm for the management&#xD;
      of expected difficult intubation has not been developed yet. It is unknown, if an&#xD;
      algorithm-based allocation to an intubation approach might be advantageous compared with a&#xD;
      non-algorithm-based allocation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Expect-it study aims to accompany the development and clinical implementation process of&#xD;
      a new algorithm for the management of expected difficult intubation. This new algorithm is&#xD;
      designed to provide an evidence-based decision-making tool for a rational pre-choice of&#xD;
      tracheal intubation techniques, anesthetized intubation by direct laryngoscopy (DL) or&#xD;
      videolaryngoscopy (VL) or awake tracheal intubation (ATI). In the first study phase the&#xD;
      status quo (clinical standard, non-algorithm-based decision-making) will be assessed&#xD;
      (three-month period with an approximated case number of up to 600 patients). The Expect-it&#xD;
      algorithm will be implemented thereafter. Between both study phases, the algorithm will be&#xD;
      updated (based on the findings of the first phase), sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      clinical standard will be calculated, sample size will critically be appraised and readjusted&#xD;
      (approximately 600 within at least three months), if appropriate. The second study phase is a&#xD;
      confirmatory diagnostic accuracy study for the new algorithm with a single test study design,&#xD;
      that aims to proof non-inferiority of sensitivity and specificity of the Expect-it algorithm&#xD;
      over the clinical standard, with sensitivity and specificity being co-primary endpoints.&#xD;
      Study planning and conduction is in accordance with the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy studies (STARD) statement. The Expect-it study will further include two surveys&#xD;
      among anesthetist in the study center in order to evaluate challenges and obstacles&#xD;
      associated with the implementation process and possible clinical implications of the&#xD;
      algorithm. An additional analysis will be performed to test a core data set for an&#xD;
      'anesthesia alert card'.&#xD;
