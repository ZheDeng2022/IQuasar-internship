      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of understudied drugs&#xD;
      administered to lactating women, receiving antiretroviral drugs per SOC as prescribed by&#xD;
      their healthcare provider, and their co-enrolled infants ≤180 days of age who receive&#xD;
      maternal breastmilk.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-site, open label, PK and safety study. Co-enrollment of lactating women&#xD;
      ≥18 years of age receiving DOIs per SOC, as prescribed by their healthcare providers, and&#xD;
      their infants who receive maternal breastmilk ≤180 days postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand drug transfer into breastmilk and determine subsequent infant exposure,&#xD;
      biological samples will be collected from lactating women (blood and breastmilk) and infants&#xD;
      (blood). The opportunistic design of this study will allow for a minimal risk study, an&#xD;
      expanded enrollment net, evaluation of antiretroviral drugs, and capitalization of procedures&#xD;
      performed per SOC to maximize study efficiency and data collection and minimize potential&#xD;
      risk to participants. The data collected through this initiative will provide valuable PK,&#xD;
      dosing, and safety information for drugs in this vulnerable population in order to inform&#xD;
      public health.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>After the study is completed, information about the study, including de-identified study data, will be submitted to the NIH data repository (https://dash.nichd.nih.gov and referred to below as &quot;DASH&quot;). With NIH approval, the data submitted to DASH may be used by other researchers for future research. The study data submitted to DASH will be de-identified, meaning it will not include any information that can identify the participant. The study team may also share the de-identified study data with other researchers. When the participant's de-identified study data are provided to other researchers for the purposes of future research, it will be done without obtaining additional permission from the participant.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will be uploaded to the repository within 2 years of study completion. Biological samples will be stored indefinitely. If a participant decides to withdraw from the study, they will be instructed per the ICF to contact the site investigator. Study data and samples that have been recorded / collected prior to withdrawal will continue to be used, but no new data or samples will be collected.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>In order to have access, researchers have to complete a Data access request. NICHD will review the request and either approve or deny it. IRB approval must be obtained by the researcher to access the data.</ipd_access_criteria>
