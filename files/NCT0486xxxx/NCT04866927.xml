  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proteins play an important role as structural and functional components for the human body&#xD;
      and prevent stunting. Protein quality has a great importance in meeting the nutritional needs&#xD;
      of populations across the world throughout the life course, particularly during pregnancy and&#xD;
      early childhood. Dietary protein deficiency is mainly due to protein indigestibility limiting&#xD;
      indispensable amino acids (IAAs) bioavailability. In Morocco, as it's the case in many&#xD;
      developing countries, diet is mainly based on a large consumption of cereals, fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables and pulses, and is generally low in meat, which is the main source of protein and&#xD;
      IAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of this study is to evaluate the digestibility of Fava bean proteins&#xD;
      and bioavailability of IAA using a dual-tracer method with stable isotopes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop stable isotope labeled protein of bean cultures that could be used&#xD;
      for other local common foods, to quantify dietary indispensable amino acids from beans made&#xD;
      available to the body for optimal growth, development and function and to participate in the&#xD;
      development of a simple method to assess protein quality in vulnerable populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is divided in two parts: the first part of harvesting and production of deuterium&#xD;
      labeled fava beans. The optimization test done the first year has shown that the best&#xD;
      protocol for labelling was a pulse with 25% D2O followed with subsequent labeling with 2.5%&#xD;
      D2O during 20 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part is the intervention stuy that is going to be conducted on 6 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (3 males, 3 females). Each participant will receive a test meal containing 13C&#xD;
      labelled spirulina, 2H labelled Fava bean and 13C phenylalanine. The test meal will be&#xD;
      divided on 11 subdoses: 3 sub-doses will be administrated at T0 and 1 subdose will be&#xD;
      administrated at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7h. The remaining sub-dose will be kept for measurement&#xD;
      of IAA in the test meal. After eating the test meal, blood, urine and breath samples will be&#xD;
      collected from each participant at the baseline (T0) and after 5-6, 7h and 8h.&#xD;
