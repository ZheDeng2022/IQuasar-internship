  <brief_summary>

      This study aims to investigate whether consumers differ in mouthdrying sensitivity and if&#xD;
      mouthdrying can be modulated.&#xD;

      1. To investigate whether older adults are more sensitive to whey protein derived&#xD;
           mouthdrying compared with younger adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether increasing fat levels in a solid whey protein model influences&#xD;
           mouthdrying perception&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study involves both a crossover design where each participant tastes different protein fortified products with an appropriate break between the tasting. It is also both a within and between groups design as the responses from the older volunteers will be compared with the younger volunteers. The study will be conducted single blind as it not feasible to blind the researcher. Each participant will attend 1 study visits and all products will be presented with random blinding codes.</intervention_model_description>
