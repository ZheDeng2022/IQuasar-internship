  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the relative effects imparted by different medical tapes to skin&#xD;
      when comparing normal skin to skin after ten repeated tape applications and removals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate changes to skin after repeated tape stripping on volar forearm with&#xD;
      various medical tapes. Assessments of effects to skin include corneocytes, total protein&#xD;
      (BCA), Trans-Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL), and cytokine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study will involve the application of eight (8) test articles. In each case, the test&#xD;
      articles will be applied to eight (8) sites on the healthy Subject's left and right volar&#xD;
      forearms (four [4] sites on the left, and four [4] sites on the right) in a randomized&#xD;
      fashion.&#xD;
