  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal disease with great heterogeneity. RP&#xD;
      comprises a large group of genetic disorders causing progressive loss of vision. Despite many&#xD;
      suggested treatments, there is actually no effective therapy for most types of RP at present.&#xD;
      Mutations that cause RP initially lead to rod cell death. After rod photoreceptors' death,&#xD;
      cone photoreceptors also gradually die. There are several hypotheses as to why&#xD;
      mutation-induced rod photoreceptor cell death invariably leads to gradual dysfunction and&#xD;
      death of cone photoreceptors resulting in severe visual acuity loss and blindness. Rods&#xD;
      constitute 95 percent of cells in the outer retina. As they degenerate, oxygen consumption is&#xD;
      reduced and the level of tissue oxygen markedly increases. After rods degeneration, several&#xD;
      markers of oxidative damage appear in cones. This oxidative stress over time may lead to cone&#xD;
      dysfunction and death. Antioxidants reduce markers of oxidative damage and promote cone&#xD;
      function and survival. In RP, cone death occurs as a result of the death of rods, rather than&#xD;
      as the result of the pathogenic mutations and therefore treatment with antioxidants may have&#xD;
      the potential to be applied to all patients with RP irrespective of the disease-causing&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine is a derivative of L cysteine that plays a role in the biosynthesis of&#xD;
      glutathione and neutralizes reactive oxygen species. It also has a direct antioxidant&#xD;
      activity via its reactive sulfhydryl agent. Its systemic use shows an acceptable safety&#xD;
      profile. It has been shown that the use of systemic N-acetylcysteine provides significant&#xD;
      intraocular concentration and antioxidant activity that may lead to the promotion of cone&#xD;
      function and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent phase 1 randomized clinical trial (RCT), it was revealed that oral&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was safe and well-tolerated in patients with moderately advanced RP&#xD;
      and might improve sub-optimally functioning macular cones. The authors concluded that a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed to determine if oral NAC can provide long-term&#xD;
      stabilization and/or improvement in visual function in patients with RP. In this phase 2 RCT,&#xD;
      eligible patients with the diagnosis of moderately advanced RP are randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups; treatment group (N-acetylcysteine tablets) and controls (placebo). Each group will be&#xD;
      treated for 6 months. In this study, we will investigate if the use of oral N- acetylcysteine&#xD;
      as a potent antioxidant agent can slow down or reverse the disease process in RP patients&#xD;
      with prior moderate loss of vision. It may potentially demonstrate a treatment modality&#xD;
      regardless of the genetic type of RP. The primary outcome measure will be the stability or&#xD;
      improvement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The secondary outcome measures will&#xD;
      be changes in color vision, electroretinogram, visual field, structural OCT indices after 6&#xD;
      months. The same parameters will be re-evaluated 3 months after discontinuation of treatment&#xD;
      at month 9.&#xD;
