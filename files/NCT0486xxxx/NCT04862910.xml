  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteopenia is a clinical term to define the declined Bone Mineral Density (BMD) as per the&#xD;
      normal reference values but not low enough to meet osteoporotic diagnostic criteria. A&#xD;
      Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone scan is used to diagnose decreased BMD.&#xD;
      Osteopenia is, as described by the World Health Organization (WHO), a score ranging from -1&#xD;
      to -2.5, whereas Osteoporosis is diagnosed with values less than - 2.5. The risk of a&#xD;
      decrease in BMD doubles as a woman goes into Menopause. The objective of this study will be&#xD;
      to determine the effects of Kinect-based virtual reality training on BMD, fracture risk,&#xD;
      physical function and Quality of life in postmenopausal women with Osteopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a Randomized controlled trial. The study will be conducted at Riphah&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Center, Lahore. Duration of the study will be 18 months. The sample size will&#xD;
      be calculated after the completion of the pilot study. Initial screening of the participants&#xD;
      will be done as per screening protocol and participants fulfilling inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two groups. Group A will receive Kinect based virtual reality&#xD;
      training along with routine diet and routine Medication. Group B will be controlled with&#xD;
      routine diet and routine Medication. Participants of both groups will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      for BMD, risk of fracture, all Objective and subjective parameters of Physical Performance&#xD;
      and Quality of Life. Post-treatment assessment of Physical performance measures and Quality&#xD;
      of life will be done after the 12th and 24th week, while BMD and fracture risk will be&#xD;
      measured only after the 24th week. BMD will be measured by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DEXA) for Lumbar spine (BMD), proximal femur (BMD), T-score and Z-score. Fracture risk will&#xD;
      be calculated by FRAX score, which estimates a fracture's probability within the next ten&#xD;
      years. Physical Performance will be assessed by Time Up and Go Test (TUG), Functional Reach&#xD;
      Test, Five Times Sit to Stand Test, Grip strength, Fall Efficacy Scale International, Borg&#xD;
      revised category-ratio scale (0 to 10 scale) and Dyspnea index. Urdu Version of ECOS-16 will&#xD;
      be used for the evaluation of health-related Quality of life (HRQOL). Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      on SPSS-25.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis in Pakistan is estimated at about 9.9 million people, 7.2 million of whom are&#xD;
      women. Moreover, an estimated 40 million Pakistanis were equally distributed in Osteopenia&#xD;
      between men and women. Osteoporosis prevalence in Pakistan is expected to increase in future&#xD;
      years, projected at 11.3 million in 2020 and 12.9 million in 2050. in Pakistan, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Osteoporosis Foundation surveyed the Pakistani population in 2009. The findings&#xD;
      of this study were based on ultrasound investigations. It was found that 40 million people&#xD;
      ranging between 45 and 70 were Osteopenic, while almost 10 million people were found to be&#xD;
      Osteoporotic. Osteoporosis's overall prevalence was found to be 16%, while that of Osteopenia&#xD;
      was found to be 34%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular exercise involving different functions and subsystems of the human body is beneficial&#xD;
      all life. There is ever-growing evidence that exercise prevents at least some harmful effects&#xD;
      of Menopause, such as bone loss, increased risk of heart disease, or chronic diseases, such&#xD;
      as diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wii Fit effectively balances women with bone loss. The purpose of this study was to estimate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a Wii Fit controlled exergame compared with traditional balancing&#xD;
      exercises, Quality of life, fear of fall and well-being in bone loss women. The Wii group or&#xD;
      control Group comprised thirty-eight female participants aged over 65 years with a bone loss.&#xD;
      A supervised Wii fit equilibrium training may be helpful to improve equilibrium issues among&#xD;
      women with bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone consistency is greatly affected by physical activity. The following guidelines can be&#xD;
      made for physical activity and exercise based on data derived from controlled clinical trials&#xD;
      and meta-analyzes (randomized/nonrandomized). 1. Adolescent and prepubertal girls will&#xD;
      benefit most from bone loading. Education is an efficient way of growing the peak bone mass&#xD;
      of this age group and allows for the prevention of lifelong fractures. 2. Exercises with high&#xD;
      impacts, such as jumping or skipping, or strength training paired with movement with high or&#xD;
      irregular impacts, are the most powerful for bone.3. In order to preserve or strengthen bone,&#xD;
      two to four short workouts (30 mins/day or less) a week for an extended period. 4. Other&#xD;
      weight-bearing activities such as resistance training, unique positions of yoga, aerobics,&#xD;
      low load, or walking can preserve or boost bone density in older women with risk factors that&#xD;
      prevent them from engaging in high impact activities. 5. Additional practices that protect or&#xD;
      increase mobility and strength often benefit, as they reduce risk of falling and thus reduce&#xD;
      fracture risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-Intensity Resistance and Impact Training (HiRIT) Improves BMD and Physical Function in&#xD;
      Postmenopausal Women with Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. A short, controlled, twice-week HiRIT&#xD;
      training procedure was productive and superior to previous bone enhancement programs,&#xD;
      clinically appropriate locations, stature, functional Performance, and falls in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with low to high bone mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of circuit training interventions on bone metabolism markers and bone density of&#xD;
      older women with Osteopenia. The conclusion indicated that the circuit training intervention&#xD;
      showed positive effects on bone metabolism markers and bone density of older women with&#xD;
      Osteopenia, being viewed as an effective intervention program applicable to prevent and&#xD;
      control Osteopenia Osteoporosis in line with bone density decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the psychological findings, VR exercise has benefited mental stress reduction and HRQOL&#xD;
      improvement. Traditional physical therapy can be seen as a repeated and lifeless activity,&#xD;
      which also intimidates people. Physical activity (PA) health benefits have been well&#xD;
      established in recent decades . Despite its well-known advantages, about 25% of adults and&#xD;
      80% of teenagers worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), are physically&#xD;
      inactive, somewhat through a change in culture and lifestyle. In light of psychological&#xD;
      outcomes, VR exercise showed positive impacts on relieving mental tension and improving&#xD;
      HRQOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of 24 weeks of aerobic dancing on the BMD, physical fitness and health-related&#xD;
      Quality of life (HRQOL) in postmenopausal women. The results suggested that 24-week aerobic&#xD;
      dance intervention could lower bone fracture incidence by increasing BMD and decreasing fall&#xD;
      risk for postmenopausal women. The program adherence in the present study was 81%.&#xD;
      Differences were statistically detected in femoral neck BMD, muscle strength and agility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR exercise may positively affect the conventional exercise on individual physiological,&#xD;
      psychological and rehabilitative outcomes. However, existing studies are far from optimal in&#xD;
      terms of consistency, quantity and samples. To confirm these positive effects, therefore,&#xD;
      more laborious studies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of virtual reality training on postmenopausal osteoporotic women. They concluded that&#xD;
      virtual reality training has broad beneficial effects on BMD, bone mineral content and&#xD;
      Quality of life in postmenopausal osteoporotic women, which may further reduce the risk of&#xD;
      osteoporotic fracture. There have been few drawbacks during the whole analysis. The sample&#xD;
      was small, and the second sample did not examine the long-term effects of this training. In&#xD;
      future studies, the association between BMD and the Quality of life in osteoporotic women&#xD;
      after Menopause is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Planned, structured and repetitive exercise program is often perceived as boring and hard,&#xD;
      thereby causing the individuals to be away from Physical Activity-related behaviours after&#xD;
      long days of work. Instead, individuals are more interested in leisure activities, such as&#xD;
      video games, where entertainment can be obtained while relaxing. Thus, virtual reality-based&#xD;
      video games may trigger their interest, motivation and adherence to exercise. To the best of&#xD;
      the researcher's knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of Kinect-based virtual&#xD;
      reality training on BMD, fracture risk, physical function, and Quality of life in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with Osteopenia. Although a study has been done to check its effects on&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with Osteoporosis; however, considering several limitations in this&#xD;
      study, it seemed that more scientific research needs to be done to find out the facts.&#xD;
      Asociation between BMD and Quality of life resulting from Kinect-based virtual reality&#xD;
      training is also recommended for further research in previous literature. Therefore, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study will be to find out the effects of Kinect-based virtual reality&#xD;
      training on BMD, future fracture risk, physical function, and Quality of life in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with Osteopenia and to find out the association between BMD and Quality&#xD;
      of life. It is hypothesized that Kinect-based virtual reality training for 24 weeks will lead&#xD;
      to significant improvements in the outcome measures and will contribute to its role in&#xD;
      delaying the progress of Osteopenia to Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
