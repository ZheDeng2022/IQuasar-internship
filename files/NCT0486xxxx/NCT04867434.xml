  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 135 eligible male or female subjects will be randomized according to a&#xD;
      predetermined randomization scheme (1:1:1 ratio) to receive a single multi-injection&#xD;
      treatment of high dose RZL-012, low dose RZL-012, or placebo on Day 0. They will be monitored&#xD;
      for safety and efficacy over 84 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will be randomized to either active treatment (high or low dose RZL-012) or&#xD;
      placebo at a ratio of 1:1:1 per group and receive one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  low dose (concentration of injected solution 34 mg/mL RZL-012) of 5.1 mg/0.15&#xD;
           mL/injection point that results in a dose/volume of 163.2±20.4 mg/4.8±0.6 mL RZL-012,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high dose (concentration of injected solution 50 mg/mL RZL-012) of 7.5 mg/0.15&#xD;
           mL/injection point that results in a maximum total dose/volume of 240±30 mg/4.8±0.6 mL&#xD;
           RZL-012,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  placebo of 0.15 mL/injection point that results in a total maximum volume of 4.8±0.6 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects treated with RZL-012 will undergo a single treatment session with 32±4 injections.&#xD;
      The maximal number of injections will be 36 with maximal doses of 183.6 mg and 270 mg for the&#xD;
      low and high doses, respectively. Each injection point will be dosed with 5.1 mg RZL-012 for&#xD;
      the low dose or 7.5 mg for the high dose in a volume of 0.15 mL/injection site. Placebo&#xD;
      (vehicle) subjects will be injected with a 0.15 mL vehicle per each injection site. The&#xD;
      maximal injection volume for all groups will be up to 5.4 mL.&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Has any pre-existing medical condition other than increased SMF that, at the&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Has a planned fat reduction procedure of any variety to the submental region for the&#xD;
