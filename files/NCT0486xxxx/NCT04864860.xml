      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes is suggested strategy for glycemic&#xD;
      control particularly in people with prediabetes and diabetes. Polyphenola-rich brown seaweed&#xD;
      extracts, have been proposed to have similar inhibition effect on α-amylases and&#xD;
      α-glucosidases, thus improving diabetic related response. This proposal aims to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of seaweed extract called E. cava on postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) and&#xD;
      postprandial plasma insulin level (PPIL). Likewise, the study will examine any intolerance&#xD;
      symptoms associated with the consumption of the studied seaweed extract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the effectiveness of seaweed (E. cava) in reducing postprandial blood glucose and&#xD;
      plasma insulin level in pre-diabetic patients, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the safeness and potential adverse effect of applying sea weed (E. cava) as a&#xD;
      therapeutic diet composition on patient with pre-diabetes, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind, Randomized-controlled trial that will be conducted from 1st March 2021 to 20th&#xD;
      July 2021 in Saudi Arabia. Participants will be eligible to participate in this study if they&#xD;
      are diagnosed in their medical history as pre-diabetic patient through their medical records&#xD;
      aged between 18 and 65 years with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 100 and 125 mg dL-1 as&#xD;
      a set criterion by American Diabetic Association (ADA), and blood pressure within the normal&#xD;
      range (systolic blood pressure ≤ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg set by World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) having no other health complications. Participants will be excluded&#xD;
      if they are smoker, pregnant or lactation or having liver, thyroid, significant&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders, taking any treatment with either insulin or anti-diabetic drugs&#xD;
      or any other natural health products known to impact blood sugar. The number of individuals&#xD;
      is required to detect differences of 38 units in BG and 2500-unit in plasma insulin&#xD;
      (incremental under the curve (iAUC)) at 0.05 significance level with 80% power of the study.&#xD;
      Study supplements (intervention and placebo) will be encapsulated in identical capsules and&#xD;
      will be labelled with the letter A and B to conceal which supplement is given to participants&#xD;
      each testing occasion. computer-generating randomization, data collection and analysis will&#xD;
      be double-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention product used in this study is a dietary supplement capsules called &quot;Seanol&quot;&#xD;
      that contain 13% pholoratannic polyphenol per capsule as stated by the manufacture company&#xD;
      (seanol inside, 4215 95th St SW Lakewood, WA 98499 USA). Prior carbohydrates consumption, 2&#xD;
      capsule (1000 mg of E. cava), that contain 150 mg of pholorotanic polyphenol containing&#xD;
      polyphenol will be administered at a single occasion for postprandial testing. This dose was&#xD;
      selected to be similar to previous studies that shows no harm or sever adverse effect on&#xD;
      participants (12, 14). placebo will be Similar in composition to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma glucose concentration will be determined immediately by blood finger-prick sample&#xD;
      following standard procedure using HemoCue Glucose 201 RT System (Radiometer Pacific Pty Ltd,&#xD;
      Mount Waverley, VIC, Australia). Whereas, plasma insulin will be measured at the laboratory&#xD;
      department at KKUH using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Statistics Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test will be used to determine differences for symptoms of intolerance between groups.&#xD;
      Incremental area under the curve (iAUC), time to peak and peak blood concentration assessment&#xD;
      will be used to assess postprandial responses of for plasma glucose and insulin level.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) version 20.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind, Randomized-controlled trial that will be conducted from 1st March 2021 to 20th&#xD;
      July 2021 in Saudi Arabia. Application of ethical approval will be applied to Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB) at King Saud University (KSU). Written consent form will be obtained from&#xD;
      all participants' prior the conduction of the study and they will be able to withdraw from&#xD;
      the study any time for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be eligible to participate in this study if they are diagnosed in their&#xD;
      medical history as pre-diabetic patient aged between 18 and 65 years with fasting plasma&#xD;
      glucose (FPG) between 100 and 125 mg dL-1 as a set criterion by American Diabetic Association&#xD;
      (16), and blood pressure within the normal range (systolic blood pressure ≤ 140 mmHg,&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg set by WHO having no other health complications.&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded if they are taking any treatment with either insulin or&#xD;
      anti-diabetic drugs or any other natural health products known to impact blood sugar, or&#xD;
      polyphenol absorption (e.g. fish oil). Also, they will be excluded if they are smoker,&#xD;
      pregnant or lactation or having liver, thyroid, or significant gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited and screened by research team using flyers, snowballing,&#xD;
      personal approach at and from King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) in Riyadh city in the&#xD;
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation and sample size determination was performed based on data reported in&#xD;
      similar studies (12, 14) Which shows that 12 participants are required in each group. The&#xD;
      number of individuals is required to detect differences of 38 units in BG and 2500-unit in&#xD;
      plasma insulin (incremental under the curve (iAUC) at 0.05 significance level with 80% power&#xD;
      of the study. For the purpose of allowing 10% participants withdraw, the target number of&#xD;
      recruitment is 30 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention product used in this study is a dietary supplement called &quot;Seanol&quot; that&#xD;
      contain 13% pholoratannic polyphenol per capsule as stated by the manufacture company (Seanol&#xD;
      inside, 4215 95th St SW Lakewood, WA 98499 USA). Other ingredients are dextrin, magnesium&#xD;
      stearate and silica (in neglected percentage). The intervention supplement is encapsulated in&#xD;
      vegetable cellulose that contains 500 Ecklonia cava extract (Seanol). This dose was selected&#xD;
      to be similar to previous studies that shows no harm or sever adverse effect on participants&#xD;
      (12, 14). The placebo will be dextrin (BETA CYCLODEXTRIN, NF) ordered from a pharmaceutical&#xD;
      company &quot;MEDISCA&quot; (https://www.medisca.co.uk/). Dextrin was selected to account for the&#xD;
      similar complex carbohydrate content of the intervention supplement. Placebo will be&#xD;
      encapsulated in vegetable cellulose capsules that is identical in size and coulure to the&#xD;
      intervention capsules. The empty capsules will be ordered from MEDISCA and will be&#xD;
      encapsulated in by SPIMACO ADDWAIEH (SFDA registered pharmaceutical company)&#xD;
      (http://www.spimaco.com.sa/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study randomization will be administered by encoding participants with numbers and&#xD;
      supplements (intervention &amp; placebo) with letters (A, B). Study supplements (intervention and&#xD;
      placebo) will be encapsulated in identical capsules and will be labelled with the letter A&#xD;
      and B to conceal which supplement is given to participants each testing occasion.&#xD;
      Computer-generating randomization will be used to randomly select participants from eligible&#xD;
      subjects. Then, the sequence that the participants receive their supplements as either study&#xD;
      testing intervention (E. cava) or placebo will be determined using the same procedure. The&#xD;
      identity of the supplement will only be known to an investigator who will not be involved in&#xD;
      data collection and analysis. Participants and investigators who will conduct recruitment,&#xD;
      data collection and data analysis will be blinded to which supplement is consumed each&#xD;
      occasion until data analysis completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study recruitment will be managed by firstly using phone interview for interested&#xD;
      participants. Participants who meet inclusion criteria will be screened at the diet clinic /&#xD;
      clinical nutrition department at KKUH to ensure fasting blood glucose is in the range between&#xD;
      100 and 125 mg dL-1, and blood pressure within the normal range (systolic blood pressure ≤&#xD;
      140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg). Also, participants who are having any health&#xD;
      issues listed in the exclusion criteria will be excluded. Then, recruited participants will&#xD;
      be randomly selected, then they will be randomly assigned to either placebo or E.cava group.&#xD;
      Then, they will be invited to the testing occasions with specific date and time (only one&#xD;
      testing occasion for each participant which will be lasted for 3 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Participants in both groups will be informed to fast 10 hours (except water) with minimum&#xD;
      exercise as possible before coming to the testing room in order to eliminate any expected&#xD;
      confounders. Food will not be provided a day prior the testing occasion, however participants&#xD;
      will be informed to have a standardised evening meal between 7 to 9 p.m. Demographic data&#xD;
      including weight, height, BMI, age, blood pressure, exercise level will be collected from&#xD;
      participants during the testing time using directed questions survey. Also, 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      recall will be collected during testing occasion for dietary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On testing occasion, two fasting (&gt;10 hours) blood samples will be taken at -45 and -35&#xD;
      minute to determine average FBG and insulin level. At time of -30 minute, either study test&#xD;
      (E. cava extract) or placebo capsules will be administered to participants based on the&#xD;
      randomization order. Then, at time 0, participants will consume 110 white bread, that contain&#xD;
      approximately 75 g of carbohydrates. Blood sample will be collected in accordance with&#xD;
      standard oral glucose tolerance test protocol (18) for the following 2 hours at an interval&#xD;
      of 30, 60, 90, 120 for blood glucose and at intervals of 30, 60, 90, 120 for insulin level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      participants will be informed that testing-occasion will be conducted in different dates&#xD;
      based on availability of facilities and investigators and they can choose which time best&#xD;
      suit them. Nonetheless, all testing occasion will be starting at the same time on all&#xD;
      different days. As well as, same study protocol will be followed on all testing occasions for&#xD;
      all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      on the testing occasions, postprandial glucose concentration will be measured immediately&#xD;
      using finger prick blood samples at the predetermined intervals (30, 60, 90, 120). Then, the&#xD;
      result of glucose concentration will be documented in previously-designed sheet for each&#xD;
      participant. 2-3 ml of blood sample will be taken from participants for insulin level&#xD;
      measurement which will be analysed KKUH laboratory. The standard care in placebo group will&#xD;
      be the same standard care used in the clinical nutrition department at KKUH for prediabetes&#xD;
      patients based on American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines: prediabetes individual will&#xD;
      have dietician consultation focusing on lifestyle modification including, but not limited to,&#xD;
      based on individualized goals; facilitating moderate weight loss or at least prevent weight&#xD;
      gain, promoting healthy foods choices that reduce risk of frequent hyperglycemia, and&#xD;
      Encouraging physical activity to improve blood glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess side effects of study intervention, participants will be asked to indicate&#xD;
      whether side effects are absent, mild, moderate or severe by giving scores as 0,1,2,3,&#xD;
      respectively. The side effect questionnaire, will be required to be completed within 24 hours&#xD;
      after intervention or placebo ingestion. The side effect will include headache, energy&#xD;
      levels, appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, unusual pain or sensations, cardiac&#xD;
      palpitations, balance disorders, and anxiety. Measurement of side effects will be obtained by&#xD;
      using an arbitrary scale, similar to that used by Paradis et al (12), that allow participants&#xD;
      to rate symptoms of intolerance by indicating whether each side effect was absent (0), of&#xD;
      mild intensity (1), of moderate intensity (2), or of severe intensity (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma glucose concentration will be determined immediately by blood finger-prick sample&#xD;
      following standard procedure using HemoCue Glucose 201 RT System (Radiometer Pacific Pty Ltd,&#xD;
      Mount Waverley, VIC, Australia). Whereas, plasma insulin will be measured at the laboratory&#xD;
      department at KKUH using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      statistical analysis: firstly, data will be assessed for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
      Therefore, based on normality tests, parametric and non-parametric tests will be used. Mean&#xD;
      (standard deviation) will be reported for normally distributed data, whereas median&#xD;
      (interquartile range) will be reported for not normally distributed data. Either independent&#xD;
      t-test or Mann-Whitney test, based on normality of data, will be used to determine the&#xD;
      difference between the two groups for both PPBG and PIL at a significant level of p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test will be used to determine differences for symptoms of intolerance between&#xD;
      groups. Incremental area under the curve (iAUC), time to peak and peak blood concentration&#xD;
      assessment will be used to assess postprandial responses of for plasma glucose and insulin&#xD;
      level. Statistical analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). BMI will be calculated using the&#xD;
      equation weight in kg / height in m. Data will be interpreted based on the result of data&#xD;
      analysis. Sample size was calculated based in similar study (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study will be recruited at KKUH hospital, extra biological samples will be disposed&#xD;
      following the regulation of the hospital in this matter, however cations will be taken and PI&#xD;
      will make sure at each step of biological samples disposal. Similarly, risky cases will be&#xD;
      dealt with following the hospital regulation and emergency will be called if such cases&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risky cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure that will be used if participants experienced high or low blood sugar levels during&#xD;
      the study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respond: In terms of hypoglycemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be educated about the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia including: shakiness,&#xD;
      anxiety, sweating, pale skin fast, or irregular heartbeat, dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study there will be interval checking for blood sugar. However, if the patient&#xD;
      reported any of these symptoms immediate random blood checking to ensure the if hypoglycemia&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hypoglycemia exists (blood glucose &lt; 70 mg /dl) patient participation will be terminated&#xD;
      and &quot;15-15 Rule will be followed. The 15-15 rule (based on ADA guideline) (1). It is as&#xD;
      follows: patient will have 15 grams of carbohydrate (1 tablespoon of honey) to raise the&#xD;
      blood sugar and blood sugar will be checked it after 15 minutes. If it's still below 70&#xD;
      mg/dL, another 15 g of carbohydrates need to consumed, and repeat till the blood sugar&#xD;
      increase above 70 mg/dl. Then patient will be instructed to have their breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hypoglycemia still exists after 4 times of 15-15 rules emergency at KKUH will be called&#xD;
      for care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of hyperglycemia: similar steps will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be educated about the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia including: polyuria,&#xD;
      polydipsia, Headaches, trouble concentrating, blurred vision, feeling fatigue During the&#xD;
      study there will be interval checking for blood sugar. If the patient report any of these&#xD;
      symptoms a random blood checking to ensure the if hyperglycemia occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hypoglycemia exists (blood glucose &gt; 240 mg /dl) patient participation will be terminated&#xD;
      and emergency care will be called due to potential risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential constraints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment may be challenging particularly in clinical trials that using supplementations.&#xD;
      For that reasons one-time study measuring acute effect was chosen. In addition, different&#xD;
      recruiting procedure will be used in order to recruit more eligible subjects as possible in&#xD;
      one month.&#xD;
