      Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become standard of care in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutations in non-small cell lung cancer and other EGFR-mutated cancers. However, TKIs are&#xD;
      well-known to cause cutaneous adverse events, including acneiform eruptions. Moderate to&#xD;
      severe acneiform eruptions are often associated with severe pruritus and pain. Current&#xD;
      treatment recommendations rely on expert consensus. Moderate and severe reactions requiring&#xD;
      systemic therapy, usually tetracycline antibiotics or isotretinoin. No randomized trial has&#xD;
      compared the relative effectiveness of tetracyclines versus isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this unblinded, randomized trial is to compare tetracyclines to isotretinoin&#xD;
      for treatment of moderate to severe acneiform eruptions in cancer patients on tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors. The primary aim of this clinical trial is to elucidate which systemic treatment&#xD;
      is more effective in clearing acneiform eruptions caused by TKIs. The results of this study&#xD;
      will add to the literature in this field and will aid in developing evidence based clinical&#xD;

      Background and Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have become standard of care in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutations in non-small cell lung cancer and other EGFR-mutated cancers. However, TKIs are&#xD;
      well-known to cause cutaneous adverse events, including acneiform eruptions. Moderate to&#xD;
      severe acneiform eruptions are often associated with severe pruritus and pain. Current&#xD;
      treatment recommendations rely on expert consensus. Moderate and severe reactions requiring&#xD;
      systemic therapy, usually tetracycline antibiotics or isotretinoin. No randomized trial has&#xD;
      compared the relative effectiveness of tetracyclines versus isotretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this unblinded, randomized trial is to compare tetracyclines to isotretinoin&#xD;
      for treatment of moderate to severe acneiform eruptions in cancer patients on tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors. The primary aim of this clinical trial is to elucidate which systemic treatment&#xD;
      is more effective in clearing acneiform eruptions caused by TKIs. The results of this study&#xD;
      will add to the literature in this field and will aid in developing evidence based clinical&#xD;
      guidelines. The study will be held at Jewish General Hospital, Division of Dermatology, G026,&#xD;
      3755 Cote Ste Catherine, Montreal (Quebec) H3T 1E2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who can participate? This study is open to adult patients (&gt;18 years old) at the Jewish&#xD;
      General Hospital who have a histologically- or pathologically-confirmed cancer with a known&#xD;
      sensitizing EGFR mutation. Participants must have started EGFR-TKI treatment, and&#xD;
      subsequently had an acneiform eruption rated moderate or severe per the Leeds scale.&#xD;
      Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score&#xD;
      of 0-2, a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Premenopausal participants must use highly&#xD;
      effective method of contraception. Female participants are neither pregnant nor breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      What does the study involve?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be referred to dermatology by their&#xD;
      treating oncologist. Participants will meet with dermatology to confirm their diagnosis,&#xD;
      review the study protocol and ensure no exclusion criteria are met. If the participant agrees&#xD;
      to participate in the trial, signed consent will be obtained and the participant will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the doxycycline or isotretinoin group. Participants will receive&#xD;
      a prescription for their prescribed medication and will get the medication from their&#xD;
      preferred pharmacy. Participants will continue regular follow up with their oncologists as&#xD;
      per standard of care. Dermatologic study visits coincide with the follow up visit by the&#xD;
      treating Oncologist. During these dermatology visits the following will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Global assessment of response to skin therapy: The study dermatologist will grade the&#xD;
           skin rash using a standardized grading system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DLQI, a dermatology quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participant reported new or worsening of symptoms and compliance to both the cancer&#xD;
           medicine (TKI) and the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If participant consented to be photographed, follow up photographs will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Routine blood tests to ensure no adverse events related to the study therapy will be&#xD;
           reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No extra blood tests will be ordered for the study, but the blood tests already ordered by&#xD;
      oncology will be reviewed to ensure that there are no adverse effects from the study&#xD;
      medication. The total study duration is six months. At the end of six months, participants&#xD;
      can choose to continue to be followed by dermatology and may continue treatment. If a&#xD;
      participant withdraws from the study prior to six months, they will still have access to a&#xD;
      dermatologist for treatment of the acneiform eruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? The investigators cannot guarantee&#xD;
      that participants will receive any benefits from this study. However, this study will make an&#xD;
      important contribution to the field of cancer care and clinical research by providing&#xD;
      essential information on the effective treatment of common skin side effects of TKI treatment&#xD;
      of cancer patients in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have side effects from the drugs used in this study. Side effects can vary&#xD;
      from mild to serious and may vary from person to person. Everyone taking part in the study&#xD;
      will be watched carefully for any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be counselled on the usual adverse effects of the study medicines. In&#xD;
      addition, specific counselling, and special emphasis, will be made for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pregnancy &amp; breastfeeding. Both study medications are contra-indicated in pregnancy and&#xD;
           breastfeeding. Pre-menopausal women will be required to use highly-effect birth control,&#xD;
           and b-HCG will be checked with other blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Photosensitivity. Both study medications have a risk of photosensitivity. All patients&#xD;
           will be counselled, and advised to use a CDA (Canadian Dermatology Association) approved&#xD;
           sunscreen of â‰¥ SPF 50 at least twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Esthetic procedures. Patients on isotretinoin will be counselled to avoid any full-depth&#xD;
           esthetic procedures for the duration of taking the medication, plus 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Extreme physical exercise. Patients on isotretinoin will be counselled to avoid extreme&#xD;
           physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mental health problems and suicide. Some patients, while taking, or soon after stopping,&#xD;
           isotretinoin, have become depressed or developed other serious mental health problems.&#xD;
           Signs of these problems include feelings of sadness, irritability, unusual tiredness,&#xD;
           trouble concentrating, and loss of appetite, or even had thoughts about ending their own&#xD;
           lives (suicidal thoughts), tried to end their own lives, and some people have ended&#xD;
           their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed.&#xD;
           There have been reports of patients on isotretinoin becoming aggressive or violent.&#xD;
           Patients will be counselled on the importance of bringing any of the symptoms above to&#xD;
           the attention of the study dermatologist should they arrive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Neurologic (brain) problems. Patients will be asked to report symptoms of headaches,&#xD;
           nausea, vomiting and visual disturbances given the association between isotretinoin use&#xD;
           and benign intracranial hypertension, especially if also taking certain antibiotics&#xD;
           (doxycycline or other tetracyclines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxycycline may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, exaggerated sunburn reactions, skin rash,&#xD;
      low blood counts, liver problems, elevated intracranial pressure (which may cause changes in&#xD;
      vision, nausea/vomiting or headaches). Some patients may develop an allergic reaction to the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin may lead to an increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels, liver problems,&#xD;
      muscle pains elevated intracranial pressure (which may cause changes in vision,&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting or headaches), abnormal development of a fetus for women who become pregnant&#xD;
      on the medication, eye changes (dryness, decreased night vision), joint pains, pancreatitis&#xD;
      (in patients with high blood triglyceride levels). Rarely, patients can develop a severe&#xD;
      allergic reaction to the medication. Isotretinoin may also cause depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored, including with regular bloodwork to ensure that they&#xD;
      do not have any serious side effects to the study medications. At each visit, the study&#xD;
      dermatologist will ask about any new symptoms that may suggest an adverse reaction to the&#xD;
      medication. If a severe side effect develops, the study medication will be stopped and&#xD;
      participants will be closely monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where is the study run from? The study will take place at the Jewish General Hospital in&#xD;
      Montreal QC, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? The aim is to start the&#xD;
      study as soon as ethics approval is obtained. The estimated start and stop dates of the trial&#xD;
      are 01/06/2021 to 01/06/2022. The total study duration for each participant is 6 months.&#xD;
