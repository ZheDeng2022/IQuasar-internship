  <brief_summary>

      This study will evaluate and analyze prescribing behaviors of physicians and determine&#xD;
      whether Intuniv was correctly prescribed in Australia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a drug utilization study using retrospective database analysis where study will&#xD;
      combine data from two sources of patient-level drug utilization data for Intuniv:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) NostraData database: longitudinal participant level prescription database ii) Physician&#xD;
      survey: de-identified participant data provided by representative physicians in Australia&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the NostraData database, actual prescription data are collected, which allows generation&#xD;
      of information on drug usage. However, these prescription data do not contain patient&#xD;
      variables such as age and indication needed to monitor potential off-label use. Therefore,&#xD;
      these data must be supplemented with another data source. The physician survey will provide&#xD;
      the data not included in the NostraData database.&#xD;
