      Prospective and randomized evaluate efficiency and safety of different treatment strategies&#xD;
      for hypothalamus-invading pituitary adenomas (HIPA)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are various treatment strategies for hypothalamus-invading pituitary adenomas (HIPA),&#xD;
      such as total resection (TR), subtotal resection with radiosurgery (STR+RS), etc. However,the&#xD;
      optimal treatment of HIPA is still controversial. In this study, we want to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficiency and safety of different treatment strategies in adults with HIPA.&#xD;
