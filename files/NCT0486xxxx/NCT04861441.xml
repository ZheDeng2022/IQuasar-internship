  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective study to test if cooling therapies decrease narcotic pain&#xD;
      medication use in patients following total shoulder replacement surgery (total shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty, TSA). Postoperative standard care involves use of ice packs placed on the&#xD;
      surgical site for periods of approximately 20 minutes every 2 hours, but they do not provide&#xD;
      consistent temperature and can become uncomfortably cold. Continuous cryotherapy (CC)&#xD;
      machines provide flow of continuous cooled water (45-55° F) via a cuff placed on the affected&#xD;
      sight for several hours. There are mixed results as to whether CC is more beneficial than&#xD;
      standard ice pack therapy. This study will address whether CC decreases pain and narcotic&#xD;
      pain medication use compared to ice pack therapy in TSA patients. The investigators will&#xD;
      monitor both patient-reported pain scores and actual narcotic use to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      use of CC reduces postoperative pain and the need for narcotic pain medication. The results&#xD;
      of this study may help establish parameters for non-pharmacologic intervention to reduce&#xD;
      patient reliance on narcotic medications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prior to the surgical procedure, the patients will be met by one of the coinvestigators or&#xD;
      Dr. Williams in the preoperative holding area. At this time, the patients will be&#xD;
      administered a questionnaire about their current pain level using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      of 0-10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worse pain imaginable. The questionnaire will be&#xD;
      the same questionnaire used after surgery, so questions referencing ice use will be&#xD;
      disregarded for this initial interview. After all questions have been answered, patients will&#xD;
      receive an interscalene block by the anesthesiology team prior to being brought to the&#xD;
      operative suit. Interscalene block routinely performed prior to shoulder arthroplasty at our&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the surgery, a randomly assigned envelope indicating the arm of the&#xD;
      study will be opened. At that time, the indicated therapy (ice pack or CC) will be initiated.&#xD;
      Ice packs and CC machines will be available and readily accessible for nursing staff to&#xD;
      assist study participants. The CC group will use the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CC will be initiated immediately after surgery, with application of the CC cuff in the&#xD;
      OR. Temperature will be set to between 45-55°F. The machine will be worn continuously for the&#xD;
      first 72 hours postoperatively. The machine is portable and can be taken with the patients as&#xD;
      they move about the hospital/home. After the first 72 hours CC will be used as needed.&#xD;
      Patients will be encouraged to use the CC whenever their pain is rated 4-5 on the VAS. Prior&#xD;
      to discharge, the patient will be instructed on machine use and the at home protocol. The&#xD;
      protocol includes when to wear the machine and how to record CC and narcotic use. Written&#xD;
      instructions for the protocol and a diary for recording usage will be provided to the&#xD;
      patient. The patients will document the time and duration the machine is in use, along with&#xD;
      their pain prior to and after use. The protocol will continue through postoperative day 28.&#xD;
      Data collection will end a postoperative day 28, though patients may continue to use the&#xD;
      machine longer if they choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard ice therapy group will use the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard ice therapy will be initiated immediately post-operatively. While in the&#xD;
      hospital, ice will be applied for 20 minutes every 2 hours. Upon discharge, ice pack therapy&#xD;
      will be applied for 20 minutes every 2 hours while awake. (Patient do not need to wake up&#xD;
      every 2 hours to apply ice at night.) After 72 hours post-operative, patient may apply ice&#xD;
      therapy for 20 minutes as needed, in 2 hour time increments. Patients will be encouraged to&#xD;
      use the ice whenever their pain is rated 4-5 on the VAS. Prior to discharge, the patient will&#xD;
      be instructed about ice pack use and the at home protocol. The protocol includes when to use&#xD;
      ice and how to record ice usage and narcotic use. Written instructions for the protocol along&#xD;
      with a diary will be provided to the patient. Subjects will document the time and duration&#xD;
      the standard ice therapy is in use along with their pain prior to and after usage. This will&#xD;
      be continued until postoperative day 28, when data will stop being collected. The patient may&#xD;
      continue to use icepacks after postoperative day 28 if they choose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative pain regimen will begin in the hospital. Both groups will have scheduled&#xD;
      Tylenol, 650 mg every 6 hours. Patients will also receive 3 doses of 15 mg of Toradol&#xD;
      starting on postoperative day 1. They will also have oxycodone available, with 5 mg for VAS&#xD;
      of 1-3, 10 mg for VAS of 4-6, and 15 mg for VAS of 7-10. If patients do not tolerate&#xD;
      oxycodone, or require additional narcotics for pain, these will be adjusted. This adjustment&#xD;
      will be offset by using a conversion to morphine equivalents for data analysis purposes.&#xD;
      Throughout the hospital stay, narcotic use will be recorded in terms of morphine equivalents&#xD;
      by using the Medication Administration Record (MAR) tab within PowerChart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective VAS pain scores will be obtained by nursing every 4 to 8 hours as this is required&#xD;
      for the administration of oxycodone per protocol. Along with having nursing obtain the pain&#xD;
      score, one of the co-investigators will conduct postoperative interviews with patients at 24&#xD;
      and 48 hours using the same questionnaire that was used preoperatively with ice use questions&#xD;
      included. The same questions will be asked to both groups. As most patients discharge on&#xD;
      postoperative day 2, the investigators will defer further interview until postoperative day&#xD;
      7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon discharge, patients will be provided the following pain regimen protocol: Tylenol 650 mg&#xD;
      every 6 hours for VAS 1-3, Tylenol 650 mg plus 600 mg Ibuprofen every 6 hours for VAS 4-6,&#xD;
      and Tylenol 650 mg plus 5 mg Oxycodone every 6 hours. Prior to the patient taking medication,&#xD;
      they will asked to record the following information on provided diary: current VAS score,&#xD;
      pain medication taken, and therapy usage (either cryo or ice packs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On postoperative day 7, a phone interview will be conducted to again evaluate the patient's&#xD;
      pain and document narcotic use during the first postoperative week. For patient's pain score,&#xD;
      the investigators will ask what they felt was their average score throughout the week. For&#xD;
      the narcotic use the investigators will ask them how many pills they have taken while at&#xD;
      home. Conversion will be used to standardize all values to morphine equivalents. Ice pack or&#xD;
      CC machine usage will be reviewed and documented. Medication and ice use will also be&#xD;
      recorded on the patient diary to monitor consistency of responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in-person interview using the same format as phone interviews will occur at their&#xD;
      postoperative visit approximately 14 days after surgery. This is the standard follow-up&#xD;
      appointment for patients. Patients will turn in their written logs and narcotic use will be&#xD;
      monitored by counting the remaining pills in the patient's prescription bottle. At this time,&#xD;
      another diary sheet will be provided for the patient along with a prepaid envelope to OSME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second phone interview will occur on postoperative day 28, when the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate ice have ceased. Pain scores, narcotic use, and the date(s) of cessation, if&#xD;
      applicable, will be recorded. At this time, patients will be instructed to mail in their&#xD;
      diaries using the prepaid envelope. Patient can continue using the respective therapy as&#xD;
      needed at this point. If patients are still taking narcotics at day 28 postoperatively, this&#xD;
      will be noted, and the investigators will continue to help control their pain.&#xD;
