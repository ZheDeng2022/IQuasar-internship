  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to INSEE, in 2016, in France, there were 785,000 births. According to the latest&#xD;
      national perinatal survey in 2016, 80.4% of women gave birth by vaginal delivery. Of these,&#xD;
      52.1% had perineal tears and 0.8% had 3rd and 4th degree tears. Of these 3rd and 4th degree&#xD;
      tears, 2.2% occurred during instrumental delivery and 0.5% during spontaneous delivery. In&#xD;
      recent years, there has been an increase in the prevalence of obstetric anal sphincter&#xD;
      injuries. Mc Pherson et al. found a prevalence of LOSA (Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injury) of&#xD;
      2% in 2004 versus 4.6% in 2008. Gurol-Urganci et al. also found an increase in prevalence&#xD;
      from 1.8% in 2000 to 5.9% in 2012. This increase is probably due to improved diagnosis by&#xD;
      obstetrical teams. Indeed, a large number of LOSAs remained undiagnosed at birth and these&#xD;
      occult lesions were subsequently found by endoanal ultrasound. In the Andrews et al. study,&#xD;
      when women were reexamined, the prevalence of LOSA increased from 11% to 24.5%. As&#xD;
      practitioner training improved, the prevalence of LOSA at birth became increasingly accurate.&#xD;
      Obstetric anal sphincter injuries are responsible for significant physical and psychological&#xD;
      morbidity. These obstetrical lesions of the anal sphincter can generate functional&#xD;
      consequences (including anal incontinence in the first rank), which will have harmful effects&#xD;
      on the quality of life of the women, they can involve a social isolation passing by the&#xD;
      limitation of displacements and physical and social activities. The daily life of these women&#xD;
      can remain impacted by the consequences of LOSA until more than 10 years after delivery. In&#xD;
      addition, a loss of self-esteem as well as feelings of guilt, shame and frustration are&#xD;
      reported in these women. Thus, some will speak of a LOSA syndrome, which includes emotional,&#xD;
      social and psychological consequences, including the ability to assume one's role as a&#xD;
      mother. LOSA are perineal tears corresponding to the 3rd and 4th degree, formerly and&#xD;
      respectively called complete perineum and complicated complete perineum. The Sultan&#xD;
      classification for perineal tears proposed in 1999 was adopted by the Royal College of&#xD;
      Obstretricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) and is the most widely used in the scientific&#xD;
      literature worldwide. It defines the 3rd degree as a perineal injury involving the anal&#xD;
      sphincter complex alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anal continence is a balance between several factors such as rectal sensitivity, stool&#xD;
      quality, the smooth and striated muscles of the anal sphincter, the pubo-rectal muscle&#xD;
      webbing and the innervation of these structures. Obstetrical trauma of the stretching and&#xD;
      compression type affects all these structures. All of these lesions can contribute to the&#xD;
      development of anal incontinence. However, these structures are not routinely evaluated in&#xD;
      women who have had an obstetric anal sphincter injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic-perineal pain was studied in 2 studies and involved 24.7% to 35% of women with&#xD;
      obstetric anal sphincter injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to women without LOSA, women with LOSA had a later return to sexual intercourse,&#xD;
      with more severe anal incontinence during the first week after LOSA. Indeed, at 12 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum, the rate of women who resumed sexual intercourse was lower in the group of women&#xD;
      with LOSA than in the group without LOSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pelvic-perineal disorders faced by women with LOSA affect their quality of life, their&#xD;
      sexuality, and their health. Thus, early identification of all pelvic-perineal disorders&#xD;
      appears to be a priority in this population.&#xD;
