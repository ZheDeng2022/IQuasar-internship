      Outline: This study is a single-arm, open, exploratory clinical trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects receive: gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV Day1 and Day8 every 21 days repeated for 4 cycles;&#xD;
      cisplatin 35mg/m2 IV Day1 and Day2 every 21 days, repeated for 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toripalimab at recommended phase II dose is given every 3 weeks for 4 doses starting with&#xD;
      Cycle1 Day1(C1D1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then have surgery to remove their primary tumor within 6 weeks after their last&#xD;
      dose of neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
