      The aim of this study is to compare the single point stimulation (P6) and double point&#xD;
      stimulation (P6+ST36) performed before anesthesia induction with standard treatment in terms&#xD;
      of PONV development and postoperative anti-emetic requirement in patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is encountered in 20-30% of patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery. PONV is a costly medical condition in financial and emotional aspects by causing&#xD;
      serious complications like elongation of hospital stay, postoperative bleeding, aspiration&#xD;
      pneumonia and electrolyte imbalances. In high risk individuals and operations, it can be&#xD;
      encountered in up to 80% of patients. The risk factors for PONV development in adults are&#xD;
      female gender, previous PONV and/or motion sickness, non-smoking and younger age.&#xD;
      Additionally, it has been reported that some surgery types, especially, laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy and gynecologic surgeries along with the anesthetic agent, the duration of&#xD;
      anesthesia and postoperative opioid use also have direct effects on PONV development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the 4th consensus guidelines for the management of PONV updated in 2020, in&#xD;
      patients with one or more risk factors, a multimodal prophylaxis using a combination of at&#xD;
      least 2 of the following methods; 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids,&#xD;
      anti-histaminics, dopamine antagonists, propofol anesthesia, NK-1 receptor antagonists,&#xD;
      anti-cholinergics and acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the declaration of acupuncture as an effective treatment option for PONV in 1999&#xD;
      NIH Consensus Conference, studies about this topic gained speed and many high quality&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinic studies were performed. In one of the most comprehensive reviews&#xD;
      published in 2015, it is stated that stimulation of P6 acupuncture point remarkably reduce&#xD;
      the risk of PONV development, significantly decrease the amount of postoperative anti-emetic&#xD;
      requirement, provide similar PONV prophylaxis with different pharmacoprophylactic agents&#xD;
      (metoclopramide, cyclizine, prochlorperazine, droperidol, ondansetron and dexamethasone) and&#xD;
      have similar post-operative anti-emetic requirement with pharmacologic agents. In the same&#xD;
      Cochrane analysis, it is clearly stated that studies enrolling groups of sham acupuncture for&#xD;
      P6 are redundant and would not go any further than duplicating the available well-established&#xD;
      information. In this aspect, the proposed study design is comparison between treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PONV has a multifactorial ethology. It has been postulated that it occurs as a result of&#xD;
      activation of emetic center in the brain stem by stimulation of various peripheral receptors&#xD;
      as well as central receptors including the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the postrema region.&#xD;
      Following activation, the response of emetic center for anti-emetic agents is rather weak and&#xD;
      consequently this complicates PONV treatment. Acupuncture is a kind of periphery sensory&#xD;
      stimulus and has modulatory effects on the emetic center in the brain stem via neuronal&#xD;
      pathways. This neural modulation is thought to be the result of communication between&#xD;
      cerebellum and insula. As a result of these mechanisms of action, performing acupuncture&#xD;
      before the induction of anesthesia provides more effective PONV prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacologic anti-emetic agents increase treatment costs as well as bear some adverse&#xD;
      effects. The clinical condition created by PONV and increasing dissatisfaction due to the&#xD;
      adverse effects of the pharmacologic agents urge both patients and clinicians pursuing&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic modalities with proven efficiency, like acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is essential to develop a standard, simple, effective prophylaxis protocol with&#xD;
      high patient compliance and without ad verse effects, especially in patients with high risk&#xD;
      for PONV. In the literature various different technique and materials were used for&#xD;
      acupuncture stimulation. Unfortunately, a standard is not present for the metal of the&#xD;
      needle, the length of the needle, the depth of immersion, the technique of stimulation and in&#xD;
      most of the studies these features are not specified at all. Meanwhile, although P6 is the&#xD;
      most studied point for PONV, there are encouraging evidence that some other points, like ST36&#xD;
      or LI4, might be incorporated into the PONV protocol. ST36 have potential effects in&#xD;
      balancing gastrointestinal motility by modulating gastric motility via vagovagal and&#xD;
      sympathetic reflex arches. Moreover, P6 in combination with ST36 has been successful in&#xD;
      treatment of hiccups, recently.&#xD;
