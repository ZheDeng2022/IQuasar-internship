    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a very complex and coordinated physiological process.The physiological changes&#xD;
      are closely related to the physiological function of Zang-fu organs, which leads to the&#xD;
      change of slippery pulse. By touching different levels of depth and the part of the radial&#xD;
      artery, it is found that the formation mechanism of pulse information, especially unsmooth&#xD;
      pulse, is similar to the principle of sonar emission and reception: the heart is equivalent&#xD;
      to the transmitting device of sonar wave. Each contraction of the heart produces a cluster of&#xD;
      powerful sound waves, which are rapidly transmitted to the whole body along the arterial wall&#xD;
      and the blood in it as a medium. More than 90% of the arterial blood flow of normal organs&#xD;
      and tissues is a steady laminar flow, which does not produce turbulence, so there is abnormal&#xD;
      vibration when a certain organ and tissue has pathological changes. The arterial blood flow&#xD;
      is squeezed and deformed which causing turbulence and abnormal vibrations, which are fused&#xD;
      with a larger cluster of sound waves transmitted by the heart and then transmitted to the&#xD;
      whole body. The investigators can feel this kind of sound waves which combine abnormal&#xD;
      vibration waves by touching different levels of arteries close to the body surface, including&#xD;
      the radial artery. At the same time, Professor Lucheng Song's team has conducted in-depth&#xD;
      research on the characteristic unsmooth pulse of stable coronary heart disease, liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, gastritis and other diseases.During pregnancy, due to the significant increase in&#xD;
      blood flow and maternal changes , the shape of sound waves transmitted to the radial artery&#xD;
      in the artery will be changed. Professor Lucheng Song found in clinical practice that the&#xD;
      pregnant pulse will have different sensations of smoothness and penetration in different&#xD;
      parts of the finger, by touching different levels of depth and the part of the radial artery.&#xD;
      It was found that the pulse condition of normal pregnant women in the middle and third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy was different from that of normal non-pregnant women in different&#xD;
      level and part of radial artery.This study will verify the efficacy of pulse diagnosis of&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine in the diagnosis of pregnancy and lay a foundation for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a special physiological stage for women, and the changes of Qi and blood in the&#xD;
      body can be reflected in time by the dynamic changes of pulse, which provides an important&#xD;
      basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy is a very complex and coordinated&#xD;
      physiological process, in which the physiological changes related to pulse changes include:&#xD;
      1. Changes in blood pressure. Relatively speaking, in the middle trimester, the blood&#xD;
      pressure is low; at the end of the pregnancy, the blood pressure increases slightly, the&#xD;
      general systolic blood pressure does not change, the diastolic blood pressure decreases&#xD;
      slightly due to peripheral vasodilation, hemodilution and placental arteriovenous short&#xD;
      circuit, and the pulse pressure increases slightly. 2.The change of cardiac output. Cardiac&#xD;
      output increases gradually from 8-10 weeks of gestation and reaches the peak at 32-34 weeks&#xD;
      of pregnancy until delivery. 3.The change of blood volume. The maternal blood volume begins&#xD;
      to increase from 6-8 weeks of pregnancy and reaches the peak at 32-34 weeks of pregnancy&#xD;
      until delivery. The above physiological changes are closely related to the physiological&#xD;
      function of Zang-fu organs, which leads to the change of slippery pulse. With the continuous&#xD;
      development of modern pulsology, Professor Lucheng Song has been studying the knowledge of&#xD;
      modern physics such as hemodynamics, hydrodynamics and acoustics based on his long-term&#xD;
      clinical practice. By touching different levels of depth and the part of radial artery, it is&#xD;
      found that the formation mechanism of pulse information, especially unsmooth pulse, is&#xD;
      similar to the principle of sonar emission and reception: the heart is equivalent to the&#xD;
      transmitting device of sonar wave. Each contraction of the heart produces a cluster of&#xD;
      powerful sound waves, which are rapidly transmitted to the whole body along the arterial wall&#xD;
      and the blood in it as a medium.More than 90% of the arterial blood flow of normal organs and&#xD;
      tissues is a steady laminar flow, which does not produce turbulence, so there is abnormal&#xD;
      vibration when a certain organ and tissue has pathological changes. The arterial blood flow&#xD;
      is squeezed and deformed which causing turbulence and produces abnormal vibrations, which are&#xD;
      fused with a larger cluster of sound waves transmitted by the heart and then transmitted to&#xD;
      the whole body. The investigators can feel this kind of sound waves which combine abnormal&#xD;
      vibration waves by touching different levels of arteries close to the body surface, including&#xD;
      the radial artery. At the same time, Professor Lucheng Song's team has conducted in-depth&#xD;
      research on the characteristic unsmooth pulse of stable coronary heart disease, liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, gastritis and other diseases.Different pulse sound waves were collected by using&#xD;
      Pulse Detection System of Sound Waves(PDSSW),and ideal results were obtained through&#xD;
      analysis. During pregnancy, due to the significant increase in blood flow and maternal&#xD;
      changes,the shape of sound waves transmitted to the radial artery in the artery will be&#xD;
      changed. Professor Lucheng Song found in clinical practice that the pregnant pulse will have&#xD;
      different sensations of smoothness and penetration in different parts of the finger, by&#xD;
      touching different levels of depth and the part of the radial artery. It was found that the&#xD;
      pulse condition of normal pregnant women in the middle and third trimester of pregnancy was&#xD;
      different from that of normal non-pregnant women in different level and part of radial&#xD;
      artery.Based on the above analysis, this study will use PDSSW to collect the pulse waves of&#xD;
      76 the Middle and Third Trimester of Pregnancy and 76 relatively healthy women.Fourier&#xD;
      transform, wavelet analysis, Hilbert-Huang transform and other methods will be used to&#xD;
      identify the different characteristics of the sound wave signals, and observe the&#xD;
      time-frequency domain characteristics of the trial group and the control group. Then&#xD;
      diagnostic tests will be performed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of PDSSW in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of the middle and third trimester of pregnancy women.This trial will further&#xD;
      verify the effectiveness of pulse diagnosis and lay a foundation for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      complication of pregnancy by pulse diagnosis instruments.&#xD;
