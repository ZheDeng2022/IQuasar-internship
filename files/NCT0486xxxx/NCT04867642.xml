    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the drug treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the drug treatment.</description>
