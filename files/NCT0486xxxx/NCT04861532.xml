  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) protocols and&#xD;
      methods for image processing and enhancement. Different setting of acquisition parameters&#xD;
      used in conventional clinical MRI protocols will be defined, to create &quot;New Protocols&quot;. Then&#xD;
      post-processing will be applied on new protocols to enhance the image quality. Finally a&#xD;
      comparison of image quality will be performed to compare the image quality of images obtained&#xD;
      by conventional protocols with those obtained with the New Protocols.&#xD;

        Total number of subjects expected to participate in this study is up to 100. This study&#xD;
        will be performed at multiple sites and data will be collected from different MRI scanners&#xD;
        of variable field strength using several MRI protocols. To provide sufficient statistical&#xD;
        power for the investigation of each subgroup, we need a large sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children, pregnant women and prisoners that are considered vulnerable population by federal&#xD;
        regulation will not be included in this study. In addition, decisional incapacity subject&#xD;
        will be excluded.&#xD;
