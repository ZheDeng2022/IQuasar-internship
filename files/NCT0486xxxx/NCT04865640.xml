  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ADI At-Home CPM (Cardiopulmonary Management) System is a non-invasive device that&#xD;
      measures and trends a variety of biological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a prospective non-randomized study with two study&#xD;
      arms/cohorts - one of healthy adult patients, one of pathologic patients who fit into the&#xD;
      intended use population of the CPM System.&#xD;
