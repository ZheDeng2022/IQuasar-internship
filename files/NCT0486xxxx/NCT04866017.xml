      The primary objectives of this study is to compare progression free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
      complete response rate (CRR) between participants treated with Ociperlimab plus tislelizumab&#xD;
      plus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) followed by Ociperlimab plus tislelizumab versus&#xD;
      participants treated with tislelizumab plus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) followed by&#xD;
      tislelizumab versus participants treated with cCRT followed by durvalumab in previously&#xD;
      untreated, locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC) The secondary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to compare overall survival (OS) and PFS in programmed cell death&#xD;
      protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) positive population between Arm A and C.&#xD;

For the raw score, less points are considered to have a better outcome.&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for the questions 29 and 30 a 7-points scale. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 6. First of all, raw score has to be calculated with mean values. Afterwards linear transformation is performed to be comparable.

    <description>EQ-5D-5L - Is the EuroQol 5D-5L a descriptive system that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
