      This is a retrospective, observational, descriptive study which will include patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and treated with ticagrelor at discharge.&#xD;
      Participants will come from the follow-up program of ACS patients taking ticagrelor 90 mg&#xD;
      twice a day as part of the dual antiplatelet therapy at discharge. The primary objectives&#xD;
      were to describe the ticagrelor treatment patterns-Ticagrelor persistence, discontinuation,&#xD;
      switching, interruption and reasons in Chinese ACS patients; and also to describe 1-year&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (Composite of any cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) of&#xD;
      Chinese ACS patients in real-life practice based on ACS patient follow-up program database.&#xD;

      Background： There are at least 2.5 million acute coronary syndromes (ACS) patients in China&#xD;
      per year. Limited data about long term ticagrelor treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      Chinese ACS patients due to the lack of large high quality follow up database. This study is&#xD;
      based on real-life practice and ticagrelor is prescribed according to the Chinese guideline&#xD;
      and it takes place in real life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the ticagrelor treatment patterns-Ticagrelor persistence, discontinuation,&#xD;
           switching, interruption and reasons for discontinuation/switching/interruption in&#xD;
           Chinese ACS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe 1-year clinical outcomes (Composite of any cause death, myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, and stroke) of Chinese ACS patients in real-life practice based on ACS&#xD;
           patient follow-up program database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the impact of ticagrelor treatment pattern on clinical outcomes. (No&#xD;
           confirmed conclusions regarding the efficacy or impact of ticagrelor treatment patterns&#xD;
           will be drawn because of descriptive analysis.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze influence factors (age, region, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney&#xD;
           disease (CKD), smoking, education, insurance etc) related to clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the influence factors (age, region, education, insurance, event, etc.) with&#xD;
      ticagrelor treatment pattern; Analysis of other possible factors (such as smoke, low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-chlesterol [LDL-C]) affecting the prognosis of patients with ACS; Analysis of&#xD;
      possible interactions and their influences between different factors associated with the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with ACS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective, observational, descriptive study which will include patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for ACS and treated with ticagrelor at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data source：&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants： Participants will come from the follow-up program of ACS patients taking&#xD;
      ticagrelor 90 mg twice a day as part of the dual antiplatelet therapy at discharge. During&#xD;
      the follow-up period for 12 months after discharge. Telephone follow-up will be done 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
      12 months after discharge according to a structured questionnaire assessing the primary and&#xD;
      secondary objectives of this study. Telephone interviews will be performed by the local ACS&#xD;
      patient follow-up program assistants (nurses who enters information in the websites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Ticagrelor treatment patterns-Ticagrelor persistence, discontinuation, switch,&#xD;
      interruption and reasons for switching/discontinuation/interruption&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ticagrelor persistence: Proportion of patients who is on ticagrelor treatment every&#xD;
           month after discharge; Duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proportion of patients with ticagrelor discontinuation, switching and interruption and&#xD;
           related reasons; Discontinuation of medications was defined as a break for P2Y12 at&#xD;
           least three months; Switching means from Ticagrelor/Clopidogrel to another P2Y12&#xD;
           inhibitor (Clopidogrel to ticagrelor means re-switching if they were recorded).&#xD;
           Interruption was defined as Ticagrelor discontinuation for more than 1 day and less than&#xD;
           3 months) 2. Time to first occurrence of any of the following clinical events (Composite&#xD;
           of any cause death, myocardial infarction, Stroke) within one year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time to the first occurrence of each component of primary clinical events (any cause&#xD;
           death, myocardial infarction, Stroke) in the first year after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proportion of ticagrelor treatment patterns with different clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlation between risk factors (age, region, education, insurance, hypertension,&#xD;
           diabetes, CKD, smoking, etc.) and clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Association between ticagrelor persistence and risk factors (regions, education,&#xD;
      reimbursement, etc.); Analysis of other possible factors (such as smoke, LDL-C, etc)&#xD;
      affecting the prognosis of patients with ACS; Analysis of possible interactions and their&#xD;
      influences between different factors associated with the prognosis of patients with ACS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures of Interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ticagrelor 90 mg used twice a day as part of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) during first&#xD;
      year after ACS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of Interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ticagrelor treatment patterns -Persistence, discontinuation rate, switching and&#xD;
           interruption in Chinese ACS patients after hospital discharge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time of first occurrence of any of the end-point events (any cause death, myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, Stroke) within one year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects are patients under ticagrelor treatment at discharge in China, which&#xD;
      limits the generalization of the study results. The criteria for patients treated with&#xD;
      ticagrelor might lead to patient selection bias. As some risk factors of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) were not randomized, there might be unmeasured confounding.&#xD;
