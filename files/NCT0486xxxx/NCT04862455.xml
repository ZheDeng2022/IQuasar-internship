  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of NBTXR3, radiation therapy, and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in treating patients with head and neck squamous cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). NBTXR3 may help make tumor cells more&#xD;
      sensitive to the radiation therapy. Radiation therapy, such as stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy, uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with&#xD;
      high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and&#xD;
      cause less damage to normal tissue. And hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher&#xD;
      doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and&#xD;
      have fewer side effects. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Giving NBTXR3, radiation therapy, and pembrolizumab may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate tumor response of hafnium oxide-containing nanoparticles NBTXR3 (NBTXR3)&#xD;
      activated by radiation therapy (RT) in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess unacceptable treatment-related toxicity of NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in patients with R/M HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety profile of NBTXR3 activated RT in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with R/M HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate time-to-event outcomes of NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with R/M HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To associate radiomic measurements with outcomes of treatment with NBTXR3 activated by RT&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate biomarkers of response in subjects treated with NBTXR3 activated by RT in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive hafnium oxide-containing nanoparticles NBTXR3 via injection intratumorally&#xD;
      or intranodally on day 1. Beginning as early as day 3 and within 8 days of NBTXR3 injection,&#xD;
      patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) every other day (QOD) or&#xD;
      hypofractionated RT once daily (QD) over 1-2 weeks at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      radiation oncologist. Starting on the same day as radiation therapy, patients also receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 24 months in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 2 years.&#xD;
