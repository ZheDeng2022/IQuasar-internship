      In this study, clinical impacts of shared decision making between physicians and patients in&#xD;
      strategy of surveillance for asymptomatic patients who ended the primary treatments on&#xD;
      quality of life would be investigated&#xD;

      [Background]&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Shared decision making between patients and physicians when breast cancer patients&#xD;
           encounter decision making in the initial treatment process has already been included in&#xD;
           the recommendations for breast cancer treatment in each country. However, in the&#xD;
           follow-up stage using various imaging tests after the initial breast cancer treatment,&#xD;
           the evidence of decision making is very poor and the patient who understands this well&#xD;
           and actively participates in the process of deciding the follow-up strategy are almost&#xD;
           none.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Major guidelines including NCCN, ASCO and ESMO recommend surveillance with routine&#xD;
           imaging such as sonography and mammography, and does not recommend advanced imaging&#xD;
           tests for asymptomatic patients. These guidelines are based on two prospective&#xD;
           randomized trials conducted in 1994. Despite many international medical recommendations,&#xD;
           many institutions around the world are increasingly using distant metastasis tests in&#xD;
           belief of improving the survival rate through early detection of distant metastasis and&#xD;
           of improving the emotional stability of doctors and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In this study, clinical impacts of shared decision making in strategy of surveillance&#xD;
           for asymptomatic patients on quality of life would be investigated by prospective&#xD;
           randomized pragmatic trial. Additionally, oncological results would be analyzed and real&#xD;
           world data of patients preference would be gathered&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Study design] Prospective, single-institutional, randomized pragmatic trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Statistical considerations] With 5% significance level and 90% power, 132 patients are&#xD;
      needed in each group. Assuming a 28% drop out rate, 368 patients need to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Randomizations] Web-based randomization would be conducted stratified to subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Objectives]&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           - QoL (when enrollment, after 1 and 2 year - FACT-B score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Depression - anxiety scale (HADS score)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recurrence-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients' preference for surveillance in SDM group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cross over rate in SDM group&#xD;
