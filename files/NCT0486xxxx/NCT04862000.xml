  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis and adenomyosis are chronic difficult diseases affecting a significant&#xD;
      proportion of reproductive age women. Not only the disease can lead to chronic pelvic pain,&#xD;
      dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea, it is also associated with impaired reproductive health,&#xD;
      infertility and tubal-peritoneal disease. Adenomyosis can also result in anaemia due to the&#xD;
      increased uterine volume and menstrual blood loss. Different treatment options are available&#xD;
      for this group of participants, ranging from simple medical treatment to control symptoms,&#xD;
      such as analgesics for pain control, transexemic acid to reduce menstrual blood loss, to&#xD;
      hormonal treatment and the more radical surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a tertiary gynaecology referral centre, the investigators encounter a large volume of&#xD;
      patients suffering from endometriosis and adenomyosis of different disease severity. Through&#xD;
      this prospective observational study, it is hoped that the investigators can collect the&#xD;
      health profile of participants using structured questionnaires on their quality of life,&#xD;
      reproductive health, collect the sonographic characteristics, identify the risks factors of&#xD;
      patients suffering from severe disease, and to propose the best treatment modality for&#xD;
      different participant groups, both with and without fertility wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending the pelvic mass clinic/ endometriosis clinic with the histologically&#xD;
      confirmed or sonographic evidence of endometriosis/ adenomyosis will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the prospective study. Their demographic data will be collected.&#xD;
      Symptomatology and health profile will be collected via questionnaires (e.g.EHP-30, SF 36,&#xD;
      FSFI) to evaluate the physical, psychological, sexual and social aspects of patients&#xD;
      affecting by the disease. Menstrual chart with be recorded. Physical examination including&#xD;
      abdominal and pelvic examination will be performed. Pelvic sonography will be offered and&#xD;
      recorded systematically. Different medical/ surgical treatments will be offered based on&#xD;
      patient's clinical condition in an evidence-based approach and clinical guidance. Their&#xD;
      treatment outcome will be assessed during the follow-up. Surgical findings will be recorded&#xD;
      and disease severity graded by use of AFS scores. Pathological findings will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>The Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30) is a disease-specific questionnaire to measure the health-related quality of life in patients with endometriosis. EHP-30 score is ranging from 0 (best health status) to 100 (worst health status). EHP-30 questionnaire score before and after medical and surgical treatment will be evaluated.</description>

    <time_frame>from enrollment to end of treatment at five years.</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by participant making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot; Mean change in pain score on VAS before and after medical and surgical treatment will be evaluated.</description>
