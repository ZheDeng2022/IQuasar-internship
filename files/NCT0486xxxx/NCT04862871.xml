    <textblock>
      Background: Current pain management strategies for pediatric patients are not integrating the&#xD;
      analgesic potential of movement-based therapies. To date, experiencing a painful stimulus has&#xD;
      been known to disrupt motor activity in an attempt to minimize injury. However, physical&#xD;
      activity, even when it increases ongoing pain initially, has been shown to significantly&#xD;
      reduce pain symptoms eventually through neuromodulation. In both acute and chronic pain&#xD;
      cohorts, exercise protocols and neuromodulation paradigms have produced exercise-related&#xD;
      analgesia. Problem: It is not currently understood which brain regions are implicated in&#xD;
      exercise-based analgesia and what brain regions moderate this response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: The investigators intend to provide a physical activity intervention designed to&#xD;
      promote exercise-induced analgesia. This intervention will be performed in a group of&#xD;
      pediatric subjects with Chronic Widespread Pain Disorder. An exercise (n=10), no exercise&#xD;
      (n=10) and healthy control (n=10) group will be recruited. Aims: This study has three aims:&#xD;
      (1) To understand how thermal pain sensitivity, pain symptoms and motor performance are&#xD;
      impacted in patients with chronic pain after an exercise-based intervention. (2) To evaluate&#xD;
      the brain regions involved in a simple motor task as well as how motor activity influences&#xD;
      activity in pain regions of the brain. (3) To evaluate the network structure of the brain,&#xD;
      with special emphasis on motor and pain regions, in youth with a pain disorder who have&#xD;
      undergone an exercise-based intervention. Exercise-based therapy in pediatric subjects with a&#xD;
      chronic pain condition is predicted to reduce pain symptom reporting through biasing activity&#xD;
      in pain regions during motor performance. Significance: Findings from this investigation will&#xD;
      address the clinical side of pain management strategies and provide potential therapeutic&#xD;
      targets and feasibility data. The investigators anticipate that findings will show how pain&#xD;
      and motor regions of the brain interact at the network level and if this interaction can be&#xD;
      modulated through exercise. Findings will also evaluate the brain regions that mediate the&#xD;
      analgesic properties of an exercise-based pain therapy and provide future therapeutic&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;

      This investigation is aimed at understanding how an exercise program currently performed at&#xD;
      the Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center (PPRC) at Boston Children's Hospital, designed for&#xD;
      individuals with chronic widespread pain is associated with pain relief and how this pain&#xD;
      relief relates to changes in the brain. The specific aims/objectives are to explore the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - Pain and sensorimotor behavior: To understand how thermal pain sensitivity, pain&#xD;
      symptoms and motor performance are impacted in children with chronic pain after an&#xD;
      exercise-based intervention. Sensory testing (for Hot &amp; Cold) will be collected using&#xD;
      Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) to establish pain thresholds. To address motor&#xD;
      performance, we will perform the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test (BOT) 1 of motor proficiency&#xD;
      (examining muscle power, strength, endurance). Pain symptom levels will be evaluated using&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires that address fear of pain, pain catastrophizing, and pain symptom&#xD;
      load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Defining hierarchies during motor performance: To evaluate the brain regions involved&#xD;
      in a simple motor task as well as how motor activity influences activity in pain regions.&#xD;
      Participants will perform a tapping task within the MRI scanner to evaluate the brain regions&#xD;
      that are active during motor control. 2 Functional magnetic resonance images will be&#xD;
      processed using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to evaluate effective connectivity (Figure 2)&#xD;
      during task performance. Brain regions evaluated in DCM will be defined by the healthy&#xD;
      control cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 - Network structure: To evaluate the network structure of the brain, with emphasis on&#xD;
      motor and pain regions, in persons with a pain disorder who have undergone an exercise&#xD;
      intervention. Graph theory analyses implemented using resting-state functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging will be performed to extract metrics reflecting network efficiency, nodal&#xD;
      degree, and nodal centrality. Structural metrics (e.g., cortical thickness and white matter&#xD;
      connectivity) will be collected as nuisance variables. Correlation analyses will be performed&#xD;
      between network metrics and behavior (fear of pain, pain catastrophizing, motor performance)&#xD;
      to evaluate their influence over network reorganization observed from the exercise&#xD;
      intervention. Brain regions that define canonical pain and motor networks will be indexed&#xD;
      from the healthy control group.&#xD;

    <description>While admitted to the Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center program, patients receive 1-3 hours of individual and group physical therapy 5 times per week and completed a 30-60 minute home exercise program 9 times per week. The median length of stay for the program is 5 weeks. The amount of aerobic exercise prescribed is individualized to each patient and ranged from 10-20 minutes per session. The duration of aerobic exercise prescribed progressed by 5-10 min weekly until the child reached 20-30 minutes. Patients are instructed to reach a moderate to vigorous intensity of exercise (defined at 5-7/10 rate of perceived exertion). The mode of exercise varied dependent on patient ability and interest. Typical modes of exercise included: walking, running, stationary biking, swimming, sports (i.e., soccer, dance), and online aerobic workouts. Patients were prescribed an individualized 30-60 minute discharge home program using the same structure upon completing the program.</description>
