  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbid obesity is the first non-traumatic cause of death in the western population and it is&#xD;
      also progressively beginning to affect the developing countries. Bariatric surgery provides&#xD;
      better results than pharmacological treatments and lifestyle changes, granting a better&#xD;
      control of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duodenal switch (DS) has proben to be the most effective surgical treatment for grade IV&#xD;
      morbid obesity and its comorbidities. However, it is not widely used due to its technical&#xD;
      complexity and the risk of long-term complications. Single Anastomosis Duodenum-Ileal bypass&#xD;
      with Sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) was concieved in 2007 as a one-anastomosis simplification of&#xD;
      DS, intended to diminish the surgical time and postoperative risks. Recently, another&#xD;
      simplified hypo-absorptive technique has started to be widely used: the one anastomosis&#xD;
      gastric bypass (OAGBP), also called mini-gastric gypass. It consists of a gastric pouch&#xD;
      associated with a gastro-jejunal anastomosis in omega (Billroth II). Despite the potential&#xD;
      advantages of these emerging surgical techniques (SADI-S and OAGBP), there is no solid&#xD;
      evidence on its efficacy for the treatment of grade IV obesity in comparison with DS.&#xD;
      Besides, there is also there is a lack of studies reporting on prospective acid and bile&#xD;
      reflux after omega digestive reconstructions, suche as &quot;Billroth II-like&quot; (SADI-S) and&#xD;
      &quot;Billroth II&quot; (OAGBP). Bile reflux is potentially premalignant condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized study aims to compare conventional DS with SADI-S and OAGBP. We&#xD;
      include all morbidly obese patients with BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2 aged 18 years or more. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are patients who do not fulfill our preoperative bariatric assessment for surgery&#xD;
      and those with contraindications for hypo absorptive or mixed surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare the percentage of excess weight lost at 2 and 5&#xD;
      years after the three different surgical procedures. As a secondary objective,&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) will be compared before and 2 years after surgery, based on&#xD;
      GERD symptoms test, gastroscopy and a esophageal pH-impedanciometry in selected patients.&#xD;
      Other secondary objectives are comparison of short-term complications, metabolic&#xD;
      comorbidities, depositional habit, quality of life and metabolic and nutritional deficiencies&#xD;
      at two years of surgery.&#xD;

      Morbid obesity is the first non-traumatic cause of death in the western population and it is&#xD;
      also progressively beginning to affect the developing countries. Bariatric surgery provides&#xD;
      better results than pharmacological treatments and lifestyle changes, granting a better&#xD;
      control of comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duodenal switch (DS) has shown to be the most effective surgical treatment for morbid obesity&#xD;
      and its comorbidities. However, it is not widely used due to its technical complexity and the&#xD;
      risk of long-term complications. In 2007 Drs. Sánchez-Pernaute and Torres introduced a&#xD;
      simplified version of the DS technique: Single Anastomosis Duodenum-Ileal bypass with Sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy (SADI-S). SADI-S consists of a vertical gastrectomy (VG) and a duodenum-ileal&#xD;
      anastomosis preserving the pylorus with jejunal exclusion and a total common-alimentary loop&#xD;
      originally of 200 cm and later standardized to 300 cm to reduce the risk of nutritional&#xD;
      deficits. In order to diminish the surgical time and postoperative risks an omega&#xD;
      reconstruction is performed without an ileo-ileal anastomosis. SADI-S can be performed either&#xD;
      directly as primary surgery, planned in two stages, or as revisional surgery in case of&#xD;
      insufficient weight loss or weight regain after VG. In terms of weight loss and comorbidity&#xD;
      resolution, SADI-S' reported results are similar to those reported in historical DS series,&#xD;
      but no prospective comparative studies have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, another simplified hypo-absorptive technique has started to be widely used: the one&#xD;
      anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGBP), also called mini-gastric gypass. It consists of a gastric&#xD;
      pouch associated with a gastro-jejunal anastomosis (Billroth II). It was initially described&#xD;
      by R. Rutledge in 1997 and despite its first publication was in 2001, only lately it has been&#xD;
      approved as a standard bariatric technique. OAGBP with a 200 cm biliopancreatic limb has&#xD;
      shown good results in weight loss and control of comorbidities, higher than those achieved by&#xD;
      VG and proximal Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) with 50 cm biliopancreatic limb and 150 cm&#xD;
      alimentary limb, as it has been demonstrated in two prospective randomized studies and a&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis. However, the OAGB results have not been compared with other hypo&#xD;
      absorptive surgical techniques, such as DS or SADI-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparison to the DS, which has a Y-Roux reconstruction, SADI-s and OAGBP have a &quot;Billroth&#xD;
      II-like&quot; or omega reconstruction. Despite the potential advantages of these emerging surgical&#xD;
      techniques, bile reflux is the main issue of omega reconstructions. In our most recently&#xD;
      published series including 440 consecutive patients, we reported that 1.7% of patients&#xD;
      required conversion to DS due to symptomatic bile reflux. It would be reasonable to expect&#xD;
      higher incidence of bile reflux in techniques with omega reconstruction that do not preserve&#xD;
      the pyloric barrier, such as OAGBP. However, some authors claim that with a 200 cm&#xD;
      biliopancreatic limb most of the bile is reabsorbed by the intestine before it reaches the&#xD;
      gastro-jejunal anastomosis. This would minimize bile reflux in comparison to the historical&#xD;
      series of Billroth II reconstruction after gastrectomy for oncological or peptic disease (in&#xD;
      which the biliopancreatic loop is much shorter, generally around 50 cm). Reported incidences&#xD;
      of symptomatic bile reflux after OAGBP vary between 0.5% and 1.5%, comparable to our SAID-S&#xD;
      results. It is worth mentioning that not all bile refluxes are symptomatic and that biliary&#xD;
      gastritis is a premalignant condition. At present, there is a lack of literature on acid and&#xD;
      bile reflux after bariatric surgery comparing the 3 digestive reconstruction techniques: (i)&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y with pyloric preservation (DS), (ii) omega reconstruction with pyloric preservation&#xD;
      or &quot;Billroth II-like&quot; (SADI-S) and (iii) omega reconstruction without pyloric preservations&#xD;
      or Billroth II (OAGBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized study aims to compare conventional DS with SADI-S and OAGBP. We&#xD;
      include all morbidly obese patients with BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2 and candidates to a directly DS&#xD;
      following our treatment algorithm. Exclusion criteria are patients who do not fulfill our&#xD;
      preoperative bariatric assessment for surgery and those with contraindications for hypo&#xD;
      absorptive or mixed surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the investigation is to compare the percentage of excess weight lost at&#xD;
      2 and 5 years after the three different surgical procedures. For the study of weight&#xD;
      evolution, both Dietetics' and General Surgery's postoperative standardized routine controls&#xD;
      at our outpatient centre will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective, gastroesophageal reflux (GER) will be compared before and 2 years&#xD;
      after surgery. A GER's symptoms test, gastroscopy and a esophageal pH-impedance analysis in&#xD;
      selected patients will be employed. Other secondary objectives include the comparison of&#xD;
      short-term complications, metabolic comorbidities, bowel habit and quality of life two years&#xD;
      after the surgical procedure. Furthermore, a medium and long term follow up on metabolic and&#xD;
      nutritional deficiency will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the morbidity and mortality analysis, the patients' electronic medical history records&#xD;
      will be revised. Short postoperative complications (up to 30th postoperative day) will be&#xD;
      classified according to Clavien-Dindo classification. Comorbidities' evolution will be&#xD;
      evaluated following our centre follow-up protocol before and annually after the surgery. Data&#xD;
      will be collected in a prospective database. The quality-of-life study will be carried out&#xD;
      with the SF-12 test. The metabolic and nutritional deficit analysis will be carried out&#xD;
      through the annual analytical data collected during the follow-up of the patients according&#xD;
      to common clinical practice.&#xD;
