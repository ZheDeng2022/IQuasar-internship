      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiome is made up microorganisms. These include the good and bad bacteria that&#xD;
      live in the digestive tract. Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked to the&#xD;
      development of cancer. Researchers want to learn more about the effects of modulating the&#xD;
      microbiome with diet and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if nutritional intake and physical activity change the gut microbiome in people with&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older with previously untreated melanoma who will be getting immunotherapy&#xD;
      treatment for their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not have visits at NIH. They will have phone calls or videocalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give stool samples. They will fill out surveys about their health,&#xD;
      feelings, diet, and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be put in 1 of 2 groups. They will follow their group s plan for 4 months.&#xD;
      They will be contacted throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group participants will follow a plant-based, high-fiber diet. They will do at&#xD;
      least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise per week. They will&#xD;
      have sessions with psychology staff to help them make positive lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group participants will be taught healthy eating and exercise guidelines. But they&#xD;
      will not be asked to change their diet or exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will record what they eat in the MyFitnessPal app. They will get a scale to&#xD;
      measure their weight each week. They will wear a Garmin(R) physical activity tracker at all&#xD;
      times. They can take the tracker off to bathe or shower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 6 months....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human gut microbiome is a topic of growing research interest because it modulates many&#xD;
      systems, including immune function; and, alterations of the microbiome have been associated&#xD;
      with the development of many diseases, including cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimization of the gut microbiome can increase the probability of responding to immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy with responders exhibiting a higher level of gut microbial&#xD;
      diversity than non-responders. Therefore, efforts are underway to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      modulating the microbiome on response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet is a major modulator of the gut microbiome. In particular, a high-fiber, plant-based&#xD;
      diet promotes greater gut microbial diversity while diets high in animal fats and protein are&#xD;
      associated with lower gut microbial diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise has been shown to increase gut microbial diversity independent of diet in both mice&#xD;
      and humans. In addition, exercise has long been known to lower cancer risk and improve&#xD;
      outcomes in cancer patients, possibly through its ability to enhance immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although diet and exercise prescriptions are cost-effective and implementable on a large&#xD;
      scale, poor compliance is a major issue. Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) can help&#xD;
      improve participant engagement and compliance with lifestyle change recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previously untreated, unresectable melanoma participants, we hypothesize that the&#xD;
      combination of a high-fiber, plant-based diet and exercise will increase gut microbial&#xD;
      diversity and potentially increase the probability of responding to immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the feasibility of conducting a decentralized clinical trial involving diet and&#xD;
      exercise prescriptions with stool sample collections in previously untreated, unresectable&#xD;
      melanoma participants who will be undergoing anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with previously untreated and unresectable melanoma who will be undergoing&#xD;
      anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function as defined by the liver, kidney, and hematologic laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have recently used antibiotics, probiotics, fiber supplements, or any other&#xD;
      products/medications that can significantly alter the gut microbiome will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility trial wherein participants will be randomized in a 1-to-1 fashion to the&#xD;
      following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm: 30 participants will be instructed to adopt a high-fiber, plant-based diet&#xD;
      and to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity&#xD;
      exercise per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm: 30 participants will be educated on general healthy eating and exercise&#xD;
      guidelines, but they will not be instructed to change their behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to periodically record dietary intake (in the MyFitnessPal app&#xD;
      or other logs, if needed), to wear a Garmin (trademark) physical activity tracker, and to&#xD;
      collect stool samples periodically. Feasibility will be determined by assessing whether&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 60% of participants in each arm adhere to their respective&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
