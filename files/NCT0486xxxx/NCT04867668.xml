    <textblock>
      There is little published data on exposure to and evaluations of large-scale, online tobacco&#xD;
      control campaigns. This project addresses the gap. Under 2 specific aims, the investigators&#xD;
      will identify the independent effects of varying levels of digital message exposure to&#xD;
      promote anti-tobacco attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors among youth and young adults, first&#xD;
      through a randomized experiment online, and second through a field-based evaluation. These&#xD;
      studies will advance the science of digital health and have wide application to future&#xD;
      campaigns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco remains the single leading preventable cause of death in the US and annual&#xD;
      tobacco-related health care costs are estimated at $170 billion. In 2016, 20% of high school&#xD;
      students (3.05 million youth) reported recent use of tobacco products and estimated 5.6&#xD;
      million youth under the age of 18 will die early due to smoking-related illness demonstrating&#xD;
      a need for prevention interventions. According to the Center for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention, some 13.1% of adults aged 18-24 were smokers, and over 5 million of these young&#xD;
      adults will die early due to smoking-related illness. Moreover, the significant declines in&#xD;
      youth cigarette smoking may be eclipsed by other tobacco products and use of JUUL, a&#xD;
      highly-effective nicotine delivery product. Given their widespread use, there is a need to&#xD;
      leverage digital media to influence health outcomes and public education campaigns are&#xD;
      increasingly using them. Recent studies show that social media can be effective in countering&#xD;
      tobacco industry product promotion online and as a tobacco control campaign platform.&#xD;
      However, there is little published data on exposure to and evaluations of large-scale, online&#xD;
      tobacco control campaigns. The proposed R01 project addresses this gap and builds on over 16&#xD;
      years of collaboration among the research team in evaluating the national Truth campaign.&#xD;
      This application is significant for several reasons. First, tobacco use prevention and other&#xD;
      health behavior change campaigns are increasingly delivered through digital channels, yet few&#xD;
      studies have focused on rigorous measurement of digital message exposure and response.&#xD;
      Exposure measures are a critical component since analyses either compare those exposed to the&#xD;
      unexposed, or examine a dose-response curve among varying levels of campaign exposure. This&#xD;
      research will use pixel tracking (HTML codes embedded in digital ads) to measure campaign&#xD;
      dose-response effects. While the predictive value of self-report and exogenous mass media&#xD;
      measures of exposure (e.g., Gross Rating Points) has been well studied, there is little&#xD;
      evidence on the effects of digital exposure. Finally, little is known about the independent&#xD;
      effects of varying levels of digital message exposure to promote anti-tobacco attitudes,&#xD;
      beliefs, or behaviors among youth and young adults. In aim 1, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a 6-month controlled, online, randomized study to compare the effects of varying levels of&#xD;
      digital media exposure, measured by pixel tracking, on campaign-targeted tobacco-related&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behavioral outcomes. In aim 2, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a field-based randomized trial to evaluate a truth digital campaign to confirm the&#xD;
      relationship between digital media exposure, message awareness, and tobacco-related outcomes&#xD;
      over 36 months. The result of these studies will be benchmark methods and measures of digital&#xD;
      ad exposure that have wide application to future digital health campaigns.&#xD;
