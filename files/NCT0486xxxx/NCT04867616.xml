    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 80 in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>From from Baseline to Week 80</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging system that tracks the progression of cognitive impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). Each category is scored on a 5-point scale in which None=0, Questionable=0.5, Mild=1, Moderate=2, and Severe=3. The global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules and has values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5, (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is obtained by adding the ratings in each of the 6 categories and ranges from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in suicidal ideation and behavior as assessed by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From from Baseline to Week 80</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a measure used to identify and assess individuals at risk for suicide. The C-SSRS is made up of ten categories, all of which maintain binary responses (yes/no) to indicate a presence or absence of the behavior. The ten categories included in the C-SSRS are as follows: Category 1 - Wish to be Dead; Category 2 - Non-specific Active Suicidal Thoughts; Category 3 - Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act; Category 4 - Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan; Category 5 - Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent; Category 6 - Preparatory Acts or Behavior; Category 7 - Aborted Attempt; Category 8 - Interrupted Attempt; Category 9 - Actual Attempt (non-fatal); Category 10 - Completed Suicide.</description>

    <description>[18F]Genentech tau probe 1 (GTP1) positron emission tomography (PET) will be used to assess the brain aggregated tau burden during the study.

    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14) is a composite scale (neuropsychological test battery and clinician reported outcome) that evaluates memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and constructional praxis. Higher scores indicate greater impairment, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 90.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 56 and Week 80 in Amsterdam-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (A-iADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>From from Baseline to Week 56 and Week 80</time_frame>
    <description>The Amsterdam-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-iADL) is an adaptive and computerized observer-reported outcome measure designed to assess impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (iADL) in early dementia. The questionnaire is administered to an informant such as a relative or friend, with every effort made to use the same informant for a particular study participant throughout the study. The questionnaire consists of 70 items in 7 categories, which takes approximately 20 to 25 minutes to complete. The A-iADL assesses impairments in a broad range of daily activities including household activities, household appliances, finances, work, computer, appliances, leisure activities. The scoring range is 20 to 80 using an item response theory algorithm, with higher scores indicating better functioning (Sikkes et al, 2013).</description>

    <time_frame>From from Baseline to Week 56 and Week 80</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is an 11-item neuropsychological test that is used to assess cognitive status in adults, and can be used to screen for cognitive impairment and to estimate severity of cognitive impairment. It assesses orientation, memory, attention, ability to name, ability to follow verbal and written commands, ability to write a sentence and to copy a drawing. The test takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. The score ranges from 0 to 30. Lower scores are indicative of poorer cognitive performance.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of reidentifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
