  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether augmentation of subscapularis repair with&#xD;
      the Regeneten implant after anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) can improve rates of&#xD;
      subscapularis healing and improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subscapularis management is an area of controversy in the literature for total shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TSA). Regeneten has been suggested as a bioinductive implant to aid in rotator&#xD;
      cuff healing. We hypothesize that applying this technology could aid in obtaining higher&#xD;
      rates of subscapularis healing for TSA when utilizing SP or ST, which in turn could lead to&#xD;
      improved outcomes.The 50 randomized subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the&#xD;
      standard subscapularis repair group or the standard repair with Regeneten augmentation group.&#xD;
      Subjects will be blinded to their treatment assignment until they complete all study visits.&#xD;
      Upon withdraw from the study, termination from the study, or new or recurrent symptoms&#xD;
      requiring a subsequent surgical procedure, the blinded assignment will be revealed to the&#xD;
      subject. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively and return post-operatively at Week 2,&#xD;
      Weeks 6, Month 3, Month 6, and Year 1. The primary outcome will evaluate subscapularis repair&#xD;
      integrity and healing at one year post-op.&#xD;
