  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to the evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and&#xD;
      efficacy of AZD0466 as monotherapy in partciapants with advanced haematological malignancies&#xD;
      and also to assess drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential between AZD0466 and the azole&#xD;
      antifungal voriconazole.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 individual modules as: Module 1 (AZD0466 monotherapy), and Module 2&#xD;
      (DDI study of AZD0466 with voriconazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be assigned to study treatments across Modules 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Module 1: AZD0466 monotherapy will include 2 parts- Part A dose escalation cohorts and&#xD;
           Part B dose expansion cohorts. Initiation of Part B will depend on the evaluation of&#xD;
           safety, tolerability, and PK in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Module 2: AZD0466 and voriconazole DDI study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive AZD0466, and administration will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression, initiation of alternative anticancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent, or other reasons to discontinue study treatment.&#xD;
