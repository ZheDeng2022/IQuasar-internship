      Vertebral compression fracture is a common disorder in elderly patients. Vertebroplasty or&#xD;
      surgical fixation are therefore commonly performed, in which bone cement is injected and help&#xD;
      to provide additional support for unstable fracture to ease the pain. Cement leakage to&#xD;
      paraspinal vein is very common and often taken as indicator of endpoint of the procedure.&#xD;
      However, the leaked cement entering venous system can go to right heart and cause pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism sometimes. The prevalence and pattern of this problem is largely unknown, especially&#xD;
      subclinical condition. In this project, we intend to perform in vivo investigation of the&#xD;
      cement distribution under different injection conditions. We also plan to conduct a clinical&#xD;
      study to investigate the pattern, prevalence, and risk factor of cement venous leakage and&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism. The study is a prospective cohort design, in which we plan to recruit 60&#xD;
      patients who receive vertebroplasty or cemented pedicle screws fixation for vertebral&#xD;
      compression fracture. Plain X ray and computed tomography (CT) will be performed after&#xD;
      operation. For CT, plain CT for operated site and dual energy acquisition for pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature will be performed, in which the pulmonary perfusion will be detected precisely.&#xD;
      The different modalities can help delineate of radiological pattern of cement leakage. Spine&#xD;
      surgeon, interventional radiologist, neuroradiologist, and thoracic radiologist will&#xD;
      participate in this project. Experience on the optimal technique for cement use under&#xD;
      fluoroscope is expected. The knowledge obtained in this study can be used in clinical ground&#xD;
      and translate into academic outcome and clinical patient care.&#xD;

      Background Vertebral compression fracture is a common disease. Most of them are osteoporotic&#xD;
      and minority of them are pathological. It cause severe pain and compression to neuronal&#xD;
      tissue, leading to debilitating symptom and deficits. The quality of life can be reduced;&#xD;
      long-term bed ridden can also cause morbidity and mortality. It is thus a major public health&#xD;
      issue. Vertebroplasty and related procedure is an invasive procedure to restore vertebral&#xD;
      stability by injection bone cement, usually under minimal percutaneous approach. Because of&#xD;
      its immediate efficacy of pain relief, it is very popular and common procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the cement is liquid before it become solid in the vertebrae. It can spread into&#xD;
      venous system sometime, and even going into pulmonary circulation system. The latter cause&#xD;
      pulmonary thromboembolism. Operators usually try their best to avoid such complication.&#xD;
      Practically, severe complication is rare. According to prior literature, the cement leakage&#xD;
      range from 2.1 to 26%. It indicate the problem is actually common. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      cement can not be lysed by usual anticoagulant treatment. Detection of this condition can be&#xD;
      of clinical importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the clinical epidemiology of cement leakage after vertebroplasty is not well&#xD;
      studied. Many factors can contribute its occurrence, including technical, material, and&#xD;
      patient-specific reasons. Although operators have their approach to avoid such conditions,&#xD;
      there are little evidence to support the efficacy of individual preventive method. Actually,&#xD;
      some operator tolerate minor paraspinal leakage because they believe it can achieve optimal&#xD;
      cement filling in the vertebrae. However, it is unclear the relationship between paraspinal&#xD;
      leakage and pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In detection of pulmonary thromboembolism, imaging method is mainstream. Currently, dual&#xD;
      energy CT scan can provide optimal diagnosis of leaked cement and pulmonary perfusion status.&#xD;
      The iodine map derived from material decomposition provide an easy way to detect perfusion&#xD;
      defect. It can be used to detect and classify cement pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to evaluate the clinical epidemiology of cement leakage in&#xD;
      vertebroplasty and related surgery, focusing on the prevalence, severity, and risk factors.&#xD;
      Based on the reference dual energy CT, we also want to investigate its imaging&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study designs This is a prospectively hospital-based cohort study. We tend to enroll 60&#xD;
      patients in one year, in whom receive vertebroplasty or cemented screws for&#xD;
      osteoporotic-related vertebral compression fracture. The postoperative spinal and thoracic&#xD;
      imaging will be used to detect paraspinal and pulmonary embolism.&#xD;

      operation. After operation, the plain radiograph of thorax and spine will be performed after&#xD;
      regain ambulation ability. The thoracic and vertebral CT scan will be performed within one&#xD;
      month. The demongraphic data will be record. The surgical details, including methods,&#xD;
      location, material used, cement amount and component, will be recorded. Any surgical&#xD;
      complication within one month will be recorded.&#xD;
