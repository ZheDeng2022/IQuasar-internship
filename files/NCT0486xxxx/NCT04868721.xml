      The aim of the present clinical study was directed to evaluate the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      approaches of micro-osteoperforations (MOPs) during orthodontic canine retraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted on a total sample of 36 canines of 18 patients, 15-22 years old who&#xD;
      required therapeutic extraction of maxillary 1st premolars and canine retraction. They were&#xD;
      selected randomly from the Outpatient Clinic, Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dental&#xD;
      Medicine (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      they were randamly dived into two groups:as follows: Group I: include 9 patients , MOPs were&#xD;
      performed for one time only on one side before retraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: include 9 patients , MOPs were performed on repeated basis on one side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both maxillary canines, in each patient, were randomly assigned to either an experimental&#xD;
      side or the control side in a simple split-mouth design. In the experimental side,&#xD;
      micro-osteoperforations was performed distal to the maxillary canine at equal distance&#xD;
      between maxillary canine and 2nd premolar before starting retraction, while the canines in&#xD;
      the contralateral control side were retracted without micro-osteoperforations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extraction was done at the start of the treatment, and before fitting of the orthodontic&#xD;
      appliance. Then upper dental arches were leveled and aligned using conventional sequences of&#xD;
      wires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three flapless micro-osteoperforations was performed by using orthodontic miniscrews distal&#xD;
      to the maxillary canines in the experimental side before starting retraction. Each&#xD;
      perforation was 1.6 mm in diameter and 3-4 mm depth into the bone. Canines were completely&#xD;
      retracted on 0.016 × 0.022 ̋ stainless steel wires by using closed coil spring delivered 150&#xD;
      gm force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed up every 28 days for 4 months of canine retraction. Routine&#xD;
      orthodontic records were obtained for each patient before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a full skull CBCT images were taken before treatment and immediately after&#xD;
      canine retraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of canine retraction was assessed clinically; in addition, cone beam CT (CBCT) scans&#xD;
      were used to assess the amount of canine retraction root length changes. Also anchorage loss&#xD;
      of first permanent molars were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment results were compared clinically and radiographically (CBCT).&#xD;
