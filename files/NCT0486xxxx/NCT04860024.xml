  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders in children and adolescents. ADHD's nosology is largely based on clinical&#xD;
      phenomenology that includes such symptoms as inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.&#xD;
      However, a reliable ADHD biomarker has still not been determined either for differential&#xD;
      diagnosis or for monitoring treatment effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA&#xD;
      molecules that function in the process of RNA silencing and the post-transcriptional&#xD;
      regulation of gene expression. MiRNAs are found in abundance throughout the nervous system&#xD;
      and play a vital role in the transcriptional networks with regards to human brain&#xD;
      development. Currently, miRNAs' involvement in the pathogenesis of ADHD continues to be&#xD;
      unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the prospective role of miRNAs in ADHD and&#xD;
      to determine whether miRNA levels in peripheral blood can serve as a biomarker and a&#xD;
      diagnosis panel for ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preliminary study, blood samples were collected from five patients with ADHD and five&#xD;
      healthy control subjects. The use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques has&#xD;
      identified 23 miRNAs as potential biomarkers for ADHD. During this three-year proposal, we&#xD;
      intend to recruit 100 drug-naïve patients with ADHD and 100 age- and gender-matched control&#xD;
      subjects (Training Set). Blood will be obtained through direct puncture of the vein from each&#xD;
      participant to analyze the miRNAs by using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The behavior and neuropsychology of each participant will be&#xD;
      assessed. This research will construct a miRNAs diagnosis panel using the Support Vector&#xD;
      Machine (SVM) classification model to discriminate ADHD from non-ADHD. The validity of the&#xD;
      miRNA diagnosis panel will then be re-examined using an independent validation sample&#xD;
      composed of 50 patients with ADHD and 50 control subjects (Testing Set). All of the 150&#xD;
      patients with ADHD will receive treatment in a traditional clinical practice and then will be&#xD;
      followed up with for 12 months. At the twelfth month, the same procedures as those performed&#xD;
      at the baseline will be replicated to examine the influence of ADHD medications on miRNAs, as&#xD;
      well as determine whether miRNAs can serve as a biomarker to portray the condition of ADHD&#xD;
      under treatment. MiRNA target gene prediction and functional annotation analysis will also be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will develop a potential diagnostic panel for ADHD through the use of combinations&#xD;
      of multiple miRNA expressions. We will provide proof of the relationships of miRNAs profiles&#xD;
      and ADHD manifestations in clinical samples and further explain the molecular pathogenesis of&#xD;
      ADHD. Such information may become an important reference for future research and clinical&#xD;
      treatments for patients with ADHD.&#xD;

      Year 1: Recruiting 100 ADHD patients and 100 healthy control subjects (Training Set) to&#xD;
      develop a miRNA diagnosis panel for ADHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. One hundred eligible ADHD patients that are being treated in the Outpatient Department of&#xD;
      Child Psychiatry at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan will be recruited for&#xD;
      this study. One hundred age- and gender-matched control subjects will be found in the same&#xD;
      catchment area as that of the patients. After obtaining informed consent from their parents&#xD;
      or guardians, research psychiatrists shall interview the participants using the K-SADS-E to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis. The participants will also undergo WISC-IV assessment to exclude&#xD;
      intellectual disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. For both the ADHD patients and the healthy control subjects, experienced child&#xD;
      psychologists will administer Conners CPT and Conners CATA testing in a room designed to&#xD;
      reduce inconsistent testing conditions. Parents or guardians will be required to complete the&#xD;
      SNAP-IV parent form and the SAICA; patients' teachers will be required to fill out the&#xD;
      SNAP-IV teacher form; and the ADHD-RS and the CGI will be completed and rated, respectively,&#xD;
      by a child psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Venous blood will be collected from each participant in an EDTA anticoagulant tube. The&#xD;
      blood samples will be further processed with the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Life&#xD;
      technology) to extract total RNAs. Based on the preliminary findings, the ΔCt values of the&#xD;
      22 candidate miRNAs will be determined for the 100 ADHD samples and 100 control samples. Then&#xD;
      the 10 miRNAs with the smallest p-value will be chosen to develop a miRNAs diagnosis panel&#xD;
      for ADHD in the second year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. The ADHD patients and healthy control subjects will have 12 months of follow-up. The&#xD;
      treatment procedures during that time for patients with ADHD will be determined by the&#xD;
      patients' psychiatrists' traditional practice and the agreement of patients and their&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ADHD patients who decide to receive medical treatment will be prescribed oral&#xD;
           short-acting MPH (MPH-IR) two or three times daily, with each dose ranging between 0.3&#xD;
           and 1.0 mg/kg, which shall be determined based on the severity of their clinical&#xD;
           symptoms, as well as their age, height, and body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The dosage will be adjusted every two weeks to properly improve ADHD symptoms. Changes&#xD;
           to long-acting MPH (Ritalin-LA) or extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta) are&#xD;
           permitted depending on clinical requirements. The maximum doses of MPH-IR and Ritalin-LA&#xD;
           per day are 60 mg and of Concerta is 54 mg, as these are the maximum daily doses&#xD;
           approved in Taiwan. The dose will be decreased should any clinically intolerable adverse&#xD;
           conditions arise. The final titration dose of MPH with an acceptable response will be&#xD;
           maintained through the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Concomitant medications are prohibited. Compliance with the drug regimen will be&#xD;
           verified at each visit based on reports by the patients' parents and how much of the&#xD;
           prescription remains. Patients that start a new medication between the different&#xD;
           time-points of the study will be considered dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The ADHD Patients that decide not to receive medical treatment are usually reassessed by&#xD;
           a child psychiatrist in the outpatient department once a month and may receive&#xD;
           behavioral therapy or re-educative psychotherapy for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The healthy control subjects will be assessed only once, at the baseline. 5. Patients&#xD;
           with ADHD will be reassessed at the twelfth month after baseline. The assessment&#xD;
           procedures, including miRNAs analysis and ADHD measures, that were administered at&#xD;
           baseline will be replicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 2: Developing a SVM classification model and enrolling an independent validation group&#xD;
      with 50 ADHD patients and 50 healthy control subjects (Testing Set)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Based on the samples already gathered, the 10 most differentially expressed miRNAs&#xD;
           between the ADHD group and control group can be determined. Those 10 values can be used&#xD;
           to derive the SVM classification model and create a dependable and strong miRNA&#xD;
           diagnosis panel for ADHD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be applied&#xD;
           to evaluate the validity of this miRNA diagnosis panel. Both the specificity and&#xD;
           sensitivity of this panel are expected to reach 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For the independent validation group (Testing Set), 50 eligible patients with ADHD and&#xD;
           50 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects will be recruited. Research&#xD;
           psychiatrists will interview the participants using the K-SADS-E to confirm the&#xD;
           diagnosis, and the participants will also undergo WISC-IV assessment to exclude&#xD;
           intellectual disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All ADHD patients and healthy control subjects will have experienced child psychologists&#xD;
           administer Conners' CPT and Conners' CATA testing. The parents or guardians of the&#xD;
           participants are required to complete the SNAP-IV parent form and the SAICA; the&#xD;
           patient' teachers are required to complete the SNAP-IV teacher form; and the ADHD-RS and&#xD;
           the CGI will be completed and rated, respectively, by a child psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Venous blood will be collected from each participant using an EDTA anticoagulant tube.&#xD;
           The blood samples will be further processed with the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Life&#xD;
           technology) to extract total RNAs. The levels of the 10 miRNAs elected for the SVM&#xD;
           classification model will be determined by qRT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To verify the results of the Training Set, the miRNAs data of the Testing Set (both the&#xD;
           50 ADHD patients and the 50 healthy control subjects) will be used for blind testing by&#xD;
           the miRNA diagnosis panel. The discrimination validity expects both the sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity to reach 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The treatment and follow-up procedure for ADHD patients will be the same as in the first&#xD;
           year. The 100 ADHD patients recruited in the first year will be followed and reevaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 3: Completion of the 12-month follow-up of ADHD patients and performing analysis of&#xD;
      target genes and enrichment pathways of the miRNAs&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No new participants will be recruited in the third year. The 12-month follow-up of all&#xD;
           150 patients with ADHD will be completed during this year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second assessment of patients with ADHD will be carried out to conclude this study&#xD;
           (twelfth month after baseline). The same assessment procedures that were administered at&#xD;
           baseline will be replicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Blood samples will be collected and be processed again to extract miRNAs-. (2) A research&#xD;
      psychiatrist will interview the ADHD patients using the K-SADS-E in order to confirm that the&#xD;
      patients still meet the diagnostic criteria of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Patients with ADHD will undergo neuropsychological testing (WISC-IV, Conners CPT and&#xD;
      Conners CATA) and have their behavioral symptoms rated (SNAP-IV, SAICA, ADHD-RS and CGI) by&#xD;
      the same rater at baseline. To avoid any bias derived from medication, ADHD patients will be&#xD;
      told not to take their medication on the day of the neuropsychological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The trends of the miRNA levels during the 12-month follow-up will be identified. The&#xD;
      differential miRNA levels between patients with versus without MPH treatment and between&#xD;
      patients who continue versus those who remit from the ADHD diagnosis will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Whether miRNAs can function as a biomarker that portrays the ADHD condition after treatment&#xD;
      will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. The predicted target genes and their enrichment pathways of the differentially expressed&#xD;
      miRNAs will be obtained using TargetScan v6.2, miRWalk, and DIANA-microT. The search will&#xD;
      focus exclusively on the 3'-UTR regions of the target miRNAs with a p-value of 0.05 defining&#xD;
      the probability distribution of random matches set in the software with a minimum miRNA seed&#xD;
      length of 7.&#xD;
