  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a disorder of gastric function characterized by delay in gastric emptying,&#xD;
      frequently associated with chronic nausea and vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness,&#xD;
      abdominal pain, and malnutrition that may require nutritional support. There are few&#xD;
      effective treatments available; more recently, a procedure called gastric peroral endoscopic&#xD;
      myotomy (G-POEM) has been advocated to relieve symptoms by improving gastric emptying.&#xD;
      However, it is not clear whether this is safe or effective. The primary aim of this pilot and&#xD;
      feasibility, hypothesis-generating study therefore is to evaluate the effect of G-POEM vs.&#xD;
      sham endoscopic surgery on symptoms in patients with diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The endoscopy report and medical record will not state whether a GPOEM was performed, but instead state the following: &quot;This patient was enrolled in a study protocol in which he/she was randomized to undergo upper endoscopy with GPOEM or no GPOEM&quot;. The endoscopist will document the actual procedure in a separate note that will be secured in his or her records for the study. After the sham or GPOEM procedure all patients will be admitted to the hospital for two days and follow the same protocol. Their care will be provided by members of the GI team who will be unaware of the assignment of the patient. If medical events necessitate knowledge of the nature of the intervention by care providers, a mechanism will be provided for urgent unmasking of the providers caring for the patient through the Scientific Data Research Center (SDRC). All facility and professional charges associated with the randomization procedure and interventions will be billed to the research study.</masking_description>

    <description>The effect of GPOEM on nausea, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and upper abdominal pain as per changes in patient scoring in The American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (ANMS GCSI-DD) which has been designed to assess symptoms associated with gastroparesis. Symptoms are rated as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), very severe (4) scale of the worst severity of the symptom over the last 24 hours.</description>

    <description>The effect of GPOEM on quality of life assessed by the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Quality of Life (PAGI-QoL). The PAGI-QOL instrument consists of 30 items, each with response options based on a 6-point scale and with a recall period of the previous 2 weeks. The items are grouped into 5 dimensions: Daily Activities, Clothing, Diet and Food Habits, Relationship and Psychological Well-being and Distress. A score per dimension as well as a total score can be calculated. The PAGI-QOL scores range from 0 (lowest QoL) to 5 (highest QoL).</description>

    <description>Under propofol anesthesia, EndoFLIP will be used to assess pyloric diameter and distensibility, prior to and after G-POEM, performed by an endoscopist skilled in this technique. After the procedure, the patient will be observed in the hospital for 2 days. Patients will undergo an upper GI series the next day to rule out perforation. If the patient develops a complication from the procedure, he or she will be managed per standard clinical practice by the treating (unblinded) endoscopist.</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to the sham procedure will be treated identically as above, except for the performance of the G-POEM. Endoscopy and EndoFLIP will be performed and sedation will be stopped when the upper endoscopy is completed. Since sham endoscopy is expected to take less time than G-POEM, the patient should remain in the endoscopy procedure room for a minimum of 30 minutes (including the time required to complete the upper endoscopy). After the procedure, the patient will be observed in the hospital for 2 days. All patients will undergo an upper GI series radiographic examination the next day to rule out perforation in order to maintain study blind.</description>
