      This is a prospective one-year cohort study of hospital-based health workers in Georgia to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection and COVID-19 disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many critical questions remain about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in real-world&#xD;
      settings. These questions can only be answered in post-introduction vaccine effectiveness&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective one-year cohort study of hospital-based health workers in Georgia to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection and COVID-19 disease. Health Workers (HWs) are the target population in this study&#xD;
      because they have been prioritized to be the first group to receive the vaccine in Georgia&#xD;
      and offer an early opportunity to evaluate the vaccine in a population in which it is&#xD;
      critical that an effective vaccine be deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HWs should be enrolled after the study protocol is approved by the local ethical review&#xD;
      committee. All HWs eligible to be vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine can be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study, including those who intend to get vaccinated, those who do not plan on getting&#xD;
      vaccinated, and those who are not sure. For HWs who have already been vaccinated at&#xD;
      enrolment, priority will be given to those who have received their first COVID vaccine no&#xD;
      more than 4 days prior to the date of enrolment. The target enrolment is 1600 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrolment, study participants will complete a baseline enrolment survey about&#xD;
      demographics, clinical comorbidities, and work and community-related behaviors related to&#xD;
      infection risk, and recent symptoms. In addition, a baseline serology will be collected from&#xD;
      participants at enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For study participants who have not received their first COVID-19 vaccine at enrolment but&#xD;
      receive their first vaccine 14 days or more after enrolment, an additional blood sample will&#xD;
      be collected. In addition, a brief symptom questionnaire about recent symptoms will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, participants will be actively followed for suspected COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. Participants will be asked to complete weekly symptom questionnaires to screen for&#xD;
      clinically significant COVID-19. Participants who meet a suspected case definition, defined&#xD;
      according to the Georgian national case definition should provide a respiratory sample which&#xD;
      will be collected by trained HW. Respiratory specimens will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 by&#xD;
      RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All or subset of positive samples from study participants will undergo genetic sequencing,&#xD;
      resources permitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of the study, as resources permit, serology will be&#xD;
      collected from participants. Serology will be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by tests&#xD;
      for vaccine-induced antibodies and antibodies that result from natural infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine effectiveness should be analysed as described in the analysis section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the final analysis at the end of the one-year period, interim quarterly (every&#xD;
      three months) analyses will be undertaken.&#xD;

        The study population will be composed of health workers in the above hospitals, eligible&#xD;
        for vaccination, with no contraindication to receive COVID-19 vaccine. HWs include all&#xD;
        categories of staff working in the hospitals, including clinical and&#xD;
        non-clinical/administrative staff and staff with direct patient interaction and those&#xD;
        without direct patient interaction. All HWs at the above hospitals who are eligible for&#xD;
        vaccination, according to Ministry of Health guidelines, will be eligible for enrolment,&#xD;
        regardless of their intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
