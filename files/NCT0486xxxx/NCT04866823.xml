  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test whether delivery of medically tailored meals&#xD;
      (meals designed specifically to be healthy) can be used to help reduce high blood sugar after&#xD;
      delivery of a baby. Participants will be recruited and consented during the third trimester&#xD;
      of pregnancy but will begin study activities after delivery. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      series of questionnaires on demographics, health history, home environment, overall and&#xD;
      financial stress, plans for weight loss and infant feeding, and food insecurity. Participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to wear continuous glucose monitors for two separate 14-day periods&#xD;
      (within 2 weeks of delivery and at 3 months). All participants will receive weekly emails&#xD;
      with educational videos and 3 virtual visits with a member of the study team and will also be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to an intervention or comparison group. In the intervention, participants&#xD;
      will receive weekly meal deliveries of 10 pre-prepared meals from Providence Community&#xD;
      Kitchen (local company in Winston-Salem, NC) that are calorically restricted and appropriate&#xD;
      for post-partum women with a history of gestational diabetes and who may be breast-feeding.&#xD;
      Women in the control condition will receive written resources on self-care, nutrition, and&#xD;
      physical activity appropriate for post-partum women who had gestational diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and delivery can function as a &quot;stress test&quot; for future development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders, with gestational diabetes and excessive&#xD;
      weight gain during pregnancy leading to worse outcomes later in a mother's life. The&#xD;
      prevalence of both conditions continues to increase with the obesity epidemic, highlighting&#xD;
      the urgent need for successful interventions to reverse maternal weight gain and promote&#xD;
      normal blood sugars. The early postpartum period provides a critical opportunity to address&#xD;
      diet behaviors that are related to both weight and diabetes. Postpartum medically-tailored&#xD;
      meal delivery is a novel approach that may allow for improved blood sugar control and weight&#xD;
      loss in a traditionally hard-to-engage patient population. There is currently no available&#xD;
      data on the cost, feasibility, or effectiveness of providing medically-tailored meals to&#xD;
      postpartum women. This is a pilot study of medically-tailored meals for new mothers whose&#xD;
      pregnancies were complicated by gestational diabetes, and whose total gestational weight gain&#xD;
      exceeded recommendations. Study will enroll 30 women with gestational diabetes and excessive&#xD;
      gestational weight gain late in the third trimester of a singleton pregnancy. Data collection&#xD;
      and intervention activities will begin after delivery. All participants will wear a&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor for baseline (first 2 weeks after delivery) and at follow up&#xD;
      (after 3 months). Participants will also completed self-administered questionnaires, receive&#xD;
      weekly informational videos by email, and have 3 monthly in-person check-ins with a member of&#xD;
      the study team. Twenty participants will be randomly assigned to a medically-tailored meals&#xD;
      intervention and 10 to a usual-care comparison group. A local community-based program will&#xD;
      prepare and deliver 10 medically-tailored meals per week to intervention participants for&#xD;
      their first 3 months postpartum.&#xD;

    <description>A series of medically tailored meals appropriate for women with gestational diabetes will be developed in partnership with chefs from a local community kitchen and catering company. Meals will create a slight caloric deficit in order to promote gradual weight loss, but with sufficient energy intake and macronutrient balance to allow breastfeeding. These meals will be roughly 40% carbohydrate, 30% protein, and 30% fat in composition. Study Team will plan up to 20 unique lunch and dinner meals for the series. Each meal will be prepared to be between 450-600 kcal and to contain 6 ounces of protein, 4 ounces of vegetable and I cup of whole grain (at a minimum). Participants will receive detailed recipe cards and nutrition information with each meal. In addition to receiving the medically tailored meals, participants will be advised to supplement their own breakfast +/- snacks to reach a total daily calorie goal determined by starting BMI category.</description>
