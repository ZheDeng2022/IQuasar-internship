  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of choice in advanced ovarian cancer is a cytoreductive surgery combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic treatment. This complex and aggressive surgery is associated with high&#xD;
      postoperative complication rates that may result in a strong negative impact on the clinical&#xD;
      results due to the delay with the start of adjuvant chemotherapy as well as the costs from&#xD;
      the surgical process. Multimodal prehabilitation has emerged as an innovative intervention&#xD;
      that focuses on optimizing physiological and psychological resilience to withstand the&#xD;
      upcoming stress of surgery. It has been shown to reduce postoperative complications in major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, but has not been assessed yet in abdominal onco-gynecological surgery.&#xD;

      Main objective: To determine the efficacy of multimodal prehabilitation in decreasing&#xD;
      postoperative complications in patients undergoing gynecological cancer surgery of high&#xD;
      complexity by laparotomy (primary cytoreductive surgery, interval surgery and secondary&#xD;
      cytoreductive surgery in advanced ovarian cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial. Subjects: 146 patients: 73 in the&#xD;
      intervention group and 73 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: PreHAB intervention consists on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High-intensity endurance exercise training program and physical activity promotion&#xD;
           remotely controlled with ICT (information and communications technologies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutritional counselling to achieve protein intake of 1.5-1.8 g/kg and whey protein&#xD;
           supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psychological coping. Control group will receive standard preoperative care. Both groups&#xD;
           will receive perioperative care in accordance with the enhanced recovery after surgery&#xD;
           (ERAS) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: Aerobic capacity (incremental stress test), physical activity, operative&#xD;
      complications and hospital length and associated costs.&#xD;

    <description>Any deviation from the normal postoperative course and according its severity to the Clavien-Dindo classification, will be considered a complication.&#xD;
A comprehensive complication index (CCI) scale will be used which assigns a value to each Clavein-Dindo level so a weighted average of the severity of complications can be calculated not only in a qualitatively way, but also numerically.</description>

Key aspects of this protocol include prevention of prolonged fasting allowing oral intake of clear fluids up to 2 hours before induction of anaesthesia, carbohydrate loading, avoidance of mechanical bowel preparation except if a bowel resection is scheduled, thromboprophylaxis; pre-, intra-, and post-operative euvolemia via goal directed fluid therapy, maintenance of normothermia, intraoperative and postoperative opioid-sparing multi-modal analgesia, avoidance the use of surgical drains, early removal of the urine catheter, and an emphasis on early ambulation and feeding.</description>
