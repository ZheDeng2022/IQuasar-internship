  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to undertake a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      investigate whether mHealth technology, allowing biometric informed feedback and coaching on&#xD;
      exercise and PA, can be effective in children with diabetes. The overall objective is to have&#xD;
      an evidence-based exercise and PA intervention ready to evaluate in a future RCT.&#xD;

      Staff from the Children's Diabetes team at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust&#xD;
      will identify patients during routine multidisciplinary team (MDT) clinics. 30 young people&#xD;
      with diabetes will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two groups (Active control&#xD;
      n=15, Intervention n=15). Following baseline measures all patients will then complete the 12&#xD;
      week Here for Health (HfH) Healthy lifestyle programme designed by the Diabetes team at&#xD;
      Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Following the initial HfH intervention&#xD;
      period assessments will be repeated (T2) before a second 12 week intervention period is&#xD;
      completed. Active control patients will receive no further input. The intervention group will&#xD;
      be provided with exercise counselling and to support this they will also be provide with a&#xD;
      wristwatch that can monitor everyday activity and their heart rate, a smartphone app and&#xD;
      access to a website. The intervention group will also participate in 5 consultations with an&#xD;
      exercise specialist to plan their exercise programme and be updated on their progress towards&#xD;
      physical activity targets. Weekly text message updates will also provide feedback to the&#xD;
      intervention group with participants able to respond to these updates. Following the second&#xD;
      intervention period assessments will be repeated for a final time (T3). Testing at baseline&#xD;
      and following the 2 interventions will include changes in physical activity, blood pressure,&#xD;
      glycaemia control, body composition and diet.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will complete the Here for Health Healthy Lifestyle intervention before completing a 12 week mHealth technology assisted exercise counselling intervention. Participants will co-develop a 3-month structured exercise and PA programme, with support from an exercise specialist. All participants will have 5 exercise consultations with their exercise specialist. The intervention will be supported by 3 mHealth elements; 1) a wrist worn fitness watch, 2) a smartphone app for patients, and 3) a coaching website for the exercise specialist. The 3 elements will be synced, allowing data to be transferred between platforms.</description>
