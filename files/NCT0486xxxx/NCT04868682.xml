      Sleep apnea is a common problem in middle-aged and older Veterans that is associated with&#xD;
      poor nighttime sleep, more daytime sleepiness, poor functioning and worse quality of life.&#xD;
      The recommended therapy for most patients with sleep apnea is positive airway pressure (PAP)&#xD;
      therapy; however, over time many patients prescribed PAP therapy no longer use it regularly.&#xD;
      This study will test the effects of an education program specifically designed for&#xD;
      middle-aged and older Veterans who have stopped using their PAP device, or are not using it&#xD;
      regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible Veterans who are enrolled into the study will receive a baseline assessment that&#xD;
      includes questionnaires about sleep, health, and quality of life. After completing the&#xD;
      baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two education groups.&#xD;
      Both groups will meet individually with a &quot;sleep coach&quot; for 5 session over 8 weeks, then they&#xD;
      will be contacted monthly by telephone for up to 6 months. Participants will complete&#xD;
      follow-up assessments immediately after the fifth education session and again at 6-months and&#xD;
      12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this approach has the potential to improve sleep, function and quality of life&#xD;
      in middle-aged and older Veterans.&#xD;

      Background: The most frequently diagnosed sleep disorder among middle-aged and older Veterans&#xD;
      is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is associated with serious adverse effects on health,&#xD;
      quality of life and survival. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is recommended as first-line&#xD;
      treatment (particularly for moderate to severe OSA), but sustained use is difficult to&#xD;
      achieve, including among middle-aged and older Veterans, and nearly half of patients with OSA&#xD;
      who begin PAP therapy discontinue use within a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: Although OSA is a chronic condition, research to date has primarily&#xD;
      focused on increasing initial PAP use in patients with newly diagnosed OSA. In addition, most&#xD;
      research has not addressed PAP use in older adults, which is unfortunate given the high&#xD;
      prevalence and important adverse effects of OSA on their health and well-being. Prior work&#xD;
      suggests that behavioral interventions are effective in improving initial PAP use, but little&#xD;
      is known of how to address insufficient PAP use over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: To address this problem, the investigators developed and pilot-tested a&#xD;
      structured, manual-based approach to address insufficient PAP use among middle-aged and older&#xD;
      adults with previously diagnosed OSA. The intervention (5 sessions over 8 weeks, then monthly&#xD;
      contact for up to 6 months) is designed so it can be provided by individuals (&quot;sleep&#xD;
      coaches&quot;) from various disciplines (supervised remotely by a psychologist) in a variety of&#xD;
      settings for maximal implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Primary Aim 1 will test the efficacy of this intervention for improving PAP&#xD;
      usage among middle-aged and older Veterans with previously diagnosed OSA who have&#xD;
      insufficient PAP use. The hypotheses are that the intervention will increase objectively&#xD;
      measured PAP use at 6-months follow-up, with effects sustained at 12 months. Secondary Aim 2&#xD;
      will test for effects on sleep quality, daytime sleepiness and sleep-related function; and&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 3 will test for effects on health-related quality of life. The hypotheses are&#xD;
      that these outcomes will also improve at 6 months, and effects will be sustained at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The investigators are conducting a randomized, controlled trial to test this new&#xD;
      intervention in middle-aged and older Veterans (N=90) with previously diagnosed OSA (moderate&#xD;
      to severe) who were prescribed PAP, but have insufficient PAP use (defined as no PAP use over&#xD;
      the prior 30 days). Participants will be randomized to one of two groups. Structured&#xD;
      assessments at baseline, post-treatment (after session 5) and 6- and 12-months follow-up&#xD;
      include objectively measured PAP use (via remote telemonitoring), sleep quality, daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness, sleep-related function and health-related quality of life. The investigators will&#xD;
      also collect participant experiences and attitudes related to the intervention, and&#xD;
      implementation outcome measures (acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity and staff time as&#xD;
      an estimate of cost) to inform future implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation/Next Steps: The long-term goal of this work is to effectively address&#xD;
      insufficient PAP use among middle-aged and older Veterans with OSA to improve their sleep and&#xD;
      quality of life. If successful, the investigators will implement the intervention at the&#xD;
      investigators' institution, and develop and disseminate an implementation package with actual&#xD;
      tools needed to promote wider implementation of this model of care into clinical practice.&#xD;
