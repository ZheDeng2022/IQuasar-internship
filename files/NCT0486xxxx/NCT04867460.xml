  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients scheduled for transvenous pacemaker- or implantable&#xD;
      defibrillator surgery, where venous access is necessary for lead implantation. A 1:1&#xD;
      randomization will be performed to either standard access (at the discretion of the surgeon)&#xD;
      or ultrasound-guided using a wireless vascular transducer (Siemens Freestyle). Primary&#xD;
      outcome is mean time to vascular access. In addition, success rate, complication rate and&#xD;
      total procedure time will be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pacemaker- and defibrillator lead implants typically involve vascular access via the left&#xD;
      cephalic, axillar or subclavian vein. Gaining access is usually straight forward for an&#xD;
      experienced surgeon/implanter, but can be difficult in a minority of cases, or for implanters&#xD;
      with less experience. Complications include arterial puncture, pneumothorax and local&#xD;
      bleeding or hematoma. Traditionally cephalic vein cut-down is the first choice, but is only&#xD;
      available in 70% of cases, and for more complex procedures involving three electrodes, an&#xD;
      additional access is always required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guidance is very common in other vascular access areas such as femoral artery,&#xD;
      radial artery and internal jugular vein, but has not gained widespread acceptance in&#xD;
      pacemaker procedures. High quality studies, demonstrating superiority or non-inferiority over&#xD;
      other access methods are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will include all comer patients scheduled for transvenous pacemaker- or&#xD;
      implantable defibrillator surgery, where venous access is necessary for lead implantation. A&#xD;
      1:1 randomization will be performed to either standard access (at the discretion of the&#xD;
      surgeon) or ultrasound-guided using a wireless vascular transducer (Siemens Freestyle).&#xD;
      Implanters with various degrees of ultrasound experience and pacemaker surgery experience&#xD;
      will participate in the study. All implanters will receive a 2-hour training lecture and&#xD;
      additional hands-on training for the first 3 cases, by an ultrasound-experienced&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access time and success rate will be recorded, and all acute complications will be recorded.&#xD;
      Primary outcome is mean time to vascular access. In addition, success rate, complication rate&#xD;
      and total procedure time will be measured. Outcome data will be analyzed for the entire&#xD;
      cohort, but also stratified for implanter and excluding the first 10 cases for each&#xD;
      implanter, to compensate for various experience and individual learning curve.&#xD;
