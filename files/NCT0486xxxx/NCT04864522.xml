  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the safety and estimate the efficacy of combining&#xD;
      anti-CD3 x anti-SLAMF7 bispecific antibody armed activated T cells (SLAMF7 BATs/CS1 BATs) for&#xD;
      patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. Patients receive 4 weekly doses&#xD;
      and then 4 more doses every 2 weeks of SLAMF7 BATs by intravenous infusion. If patients have&#xD;
      at least stable disease after these infusions, then they may receive additional infusions&#xD;
      every 4 weeks up to a maximum of 21 infusions (including the initial 8 infusions).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once subjects are determined eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via&#xD;
      leukapheresis procedure at approximately 3 to 4 weeks prior to the first SLAMF7 BATs&#xD;
      infusion. The white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with two proteins, OKT3&#xD;
      and IL-2, which activate the cells to multiply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approximately 14 days in culture, the activated T cells are coated with the OKT3 and&#xD;
      elotuzumab (an anti-SLAMF7 drug) to produce bispecific antibody armed T cells (BATs). Cells&#xD;
      are then frozen and stored until scheduled to be infused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 weeks after the leukapheresis procedure, SLAMF7 BATs infusions will start. At week 10&#xD;
      of SLAMF7 BATs infusions, disease status will be checked and patients who have stable disease&#xD;
      or better may be eligible for additional SLAMF7 BATs infusions about every 4 weeks. Before,&#xD;
      throughout and following SLAMF7 BATs, research blood will be collected to better understand&#xD;
      immune response. Disease status will be checked regularly during and after study treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo apheresis to collect cells to make SLAMF7 BATs. These cells will be allowed to grow in the lab and a drug will be added to them to make them activated against multiple myeloma. About 4 weeks after apheresis, participants will start receiving SLAMF7 BATs. Throughout treatment, participants will have blood taken for labs, to check disease status and also to look at immune response. Study treatment will stop if the participant has disease progression.</description>
