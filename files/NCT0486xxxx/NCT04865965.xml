    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a single bout of exercise on changes&#xD;
      in the genes and small molecules in blood and fat tissue, before and after a bout of&#xD;
      exercise. This research may contribute to a better understanding of the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      exercise on the body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The national and international prevalence of both obesity and type 2 diabetes has risen&#xD;
      dramatically over the last few decades, increasing the need for new therapies to treat these&#xD;
      conditions. An established treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity are regular physical&#xD;
      activity and exercise. It has been shown that one single session of exercise can lead to&#xD;
      adaptations in the blood and in tissues that improve systemic homeostasis overtime; while&#xD;
      acute changes in skeletal muscle also play a critical role in these effects, changes in the&#xD;
      adipose tissue and in the peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that may also contribute to&#xD;
      this improvement. However, the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism through these&#xD;
      other tissues have not been intensively investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a single session of exercise will result in changes to&#xD;
      white adipose tissue, including changes in metabolites and gene expression, as well as&#xD;
      changes in PBMCs, and that these adaptations may play an important role to improve metabolic&#xD;
      homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis stems from the investigator's animal-based studies, which have led to the&#xD;
      exciting discoveries that 1) exercise training-induced adaptations to subcutaneous white&#xD;
      adipose tissue (scWAT) result in significant improvements in whole-body glucose tolerance and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity (1), and 2) the mechanism for this effect may be due to auto-, para-, or&#xD;
      endocrine effects of novel exercise-induced circulating factors coming from adipose tissue.&#xD;
      Thus, being able to further understand, and potentially mimick, these exercise-induced&#xD;
      changes to scWAT could lead to novel therapies for obesity and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the great interest in exercise mimetics as treatments for diabetes and obesity, it is&#xD;
      essential to determine if a single session of exercise alters metabolites as well as gene&#xD;
      expression in the scWAT in human subjects with obesity. To determine if a single session of&#xD;
      exercise leads to changes in PBMCs, PBMC transcriptomics will be analyzed. This analysis will&#xD;
      determine how exercise affects the number of specific cell types in the blood that can&#xD;
      regulate metabolic health.&#xD;
