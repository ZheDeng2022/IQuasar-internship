      This study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an adapted&#xD;
      positive psychology-motivational interviewing (PP-MI) intervention for physical activity&#xD;
      among patients who have recently undergone bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a positive psychology-motivational interviewing (PP-MI) intervention for&#xD;
      physical activity promotion in patients who have had bariatric surgery within the past 6-12&#xD;
      months. The investigators will enroll 12 participants. Study participation includes attending&#xD;
      three study visits (two at baseline, one after the intervention) and receiving a 10-week&#xD;
      physical activity intervention that includes once-weekly phone calls, a written manual, and a&#xD;
      Fitbit activity tracker. Primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention and study procedures. Secondary outcomes include pre-post changes in physical&#xD;
      activity and other psychological, behavioral, and physiological outcomes.&#xD;
