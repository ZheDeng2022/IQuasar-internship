  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effects of single therapeutic and supratherapeutic oral doses&#xD;
      of ACP-196 on the heart rate-corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and&#xD;
      positive-controlled, 4-period, balanced crossover study under fasting conditions.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences: ABCD, BDAC, CADB, or DCBA. On&#xD;
      4 different occasions (4 periods), each participant will receive Treatment A (a single&#xD;
      therapeutic oral dose of 100 mg ACP-196), Treatment B (a single supratherapeutic oral dose of&#xD;
      400 mg ACP-196), Treatment C (a single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin) or Treatment D (a&#xD;
      single oral dose of ACP-196 and moxifloxacin matching placebos) according to a randomization&#xD;
      scheme. The washout period will be &gt;= 5 days between each dose. The clinic attempted to&#xD;
      contact participants using their standard procedures approximately 14 days after the last&#xD;
      study drug (or placebo) administration to determine if any adverse events (AEs) had occurred&#xD;
      since the last dose of study drug(s). An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in&#xD;
      a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship.&#xD;
