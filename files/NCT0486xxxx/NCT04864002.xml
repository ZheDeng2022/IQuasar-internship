  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residents and interns are prone to emotional and physical exhaustion, also known as burnout.&#xD;
      Burnout has not been studied much in physicians working in lower-middle income countries. We&#xD;
      conducted this cross-sectional study at two institutes to determine the burden of burnout&#xD;
      among internal medicine residents and to identify triggering and protective factors&#xD;
      associated with burnout. An abbreviated version of the Maslach Burnout scale was used to&#xD;
      measure burnout, and protective and triggering factors were recorded according to known&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
