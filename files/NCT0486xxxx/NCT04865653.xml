  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used as recreational substance and as a research&#xD;
      substance to study the mind. Recreationally, LSD is typically used in the form of &quot;blotters&quot;&#xD;
      containing LSD tartrate. In research, both LSD base (LSD alone) or LSD salt in the form of&#xD;
      LSD tartrate are used. The oral bioavailability of LSD is not known and LSD alone and LSD as&#xD;
      salt have never been directly compared regarding their equivalence of plasma concentrations&#xD;
      and effects. Because different forms of LSD are used in research it is important to know&#xD;
      their difference or equivalence for correct dosing of LSD. The present study will compare&#xD;
      equivalent doses of LSD base in ethanol orally, LSD tartrate in water administered orally,&#xD;
      LSD base in an orodispersible film administered orally and LSD tartrate in water administered&#xD;
      intravenously, as well as a placebo using a double-blind, randomized, counterballanced&#xD;
      cross-over design in healthy participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LSD is widely used for recreational and spiritual purposes. Additionally LSD is currently&#xD;
      reused in experimental studies with healthy subjects and in studies investigating its effects&#xD;
      on patients suffering from anxiety, depression, addiction personality disorders, cluster&#xD;
      headache, migraine, and other pathological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When LSD is used recreationally, it is administered mostly in the form of LSD tartrate on&#xD;
      filter paper (blotter) or as a liquid. In experimental research over the past years, LSD has&#xD;
      mostly been used in the form of LSD base, which is lipophilic and therefore has typically&#xD;
      been administered as a solution in ethanol. However, some researchers have also use LSD&#xD;
      tartrate orally or LSD base intravenously. Currently, it is not clear how these different&#xD;
      forms of LSD compare regarding their bioequivalence and effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study therefore compares four different formulations of LSD and placebo: (1) An&#xD;
      oral drinking solution of LSD base currently used in many research studies (100 μg LSD in 96%&#xD;
      ethanol), (2) A solid orodispersible film containing LSD base (100 μg LSD), (3) LSD tartrate&#xD;
      used in research and recreationally (100 μg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), (4) an&#xD;
      intravenous administration of LSD tartrate (100 μg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water),&#xD;
      and (5) placebo for all formulations (quadruple-dummy). The primary goals are to document the&#xD;
      bioequivalence of LSD base (1) and tartrate (3) and to define the oral bioavailability of LSD&#xD;
      using an additional intravenous LSD administration.&#xD;
