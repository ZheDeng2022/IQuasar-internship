  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett Esophagus is a common pathology, with an estimated prevalence of 1.6% at risk of&#xD;
      progression to precancerous mucosa (low to high grade dysplasia). The incidence of&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma on BE is 0.5% per year. In the event of dysplasia or cancer in situ, it is&#xD;
      currently recommended at international and particularly European level to eradicate BE. The&#xD;
      treatment techniques used to date carry out thermal destruction of the BE, in particular by&#xD;
      radiofrequency. Eradication of dysplasia is achieved in 81% to 100% and disappearance of BE&#xD;
      in 73% to 87% of cases. It requires an average of 3 destruction sessions. RF does not allow&#xD;
      histological analysis after destruction of BE, but the risk of progression to neoplasia is&#xD;
      estimated at 7.8/1000 persons per year. This risk could be due to the presence of glands&#xD;
      buried in the esophageal mucosa. Indeed, these glands are not destroyed by thermal ablation&#xD;
      methods, and remain invisible during endoscopic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new treatment technique using the Endorotor® system allows mechanical resection of the&#xD;
      entire mucosa in one session of treatment. In addition, the cost of these thermal destruction&#xD;
      techniques currently limits their wider diffusion. It is therefore legitimate to propose a&#xD;
      less expensive and probably more effective alternative technique.&#xD;

    <description>The ENDOROTOR is a new system for the resection of superficial lesions within the digestive tract and composed of a reusable generator, a single-use probe and additional accessories.&#xD;
The device is used in the resection of mucosa in the digestive tract: flat or slightly raised lesions in the digestive mucosa, or treatment of the lateral margins following a resection carried out using another technique.&#xD;
Resected tissue is aspirated away through a rotating catheter: the cutting and removal of tissue as well as the collection of specimens are combined into one act.</description>

    <description>Endoscopic treatment using the HALO® 360 or 90 system is a thermal ablation system for superficial mucosa. First and foremost, the examination includes an endoscopy to locate the upper limits of the BE and its distribution, so as to choose the most appropriate type of probe. An initial debridement of the mucosal deposits is carried out by application of acetylcysteine in spray form with a spray catheter on the entire mucosal surface to be treated and then rinsed with water after a minute of application time.</description>

    <description>The treatment itself is preceded by a sub-mucosa saline and adrenalin solution injection administered by an endoscopic sclerotherapy needle lifting the submucosa and thus reducing the risk of perforation and hemorrhage.&#xD;
The interventional tool is then applied tangentially to be brought into contact with the lifted mucosa, visual monitored by endoscope. The aspiration and sectioning system is activated by use of a pedal and a generator specially made for the system, used in every procedure. The entire surface area of the targeted mucosa must be covered by the probe. The residual tissue is then removed via the aspiration system and caught by a filter. The specimens are then easily retrievable at the end of the procedure and can be stored in formalin fixing solution for histological analysis.</description>

    <description>Endoscopic treatment using the HALO® 360 or 90 system is a thermal method for destroying the superficial mucosa. An initial debridement of the mucosal deposits is carried out by application of acetylcysteine in spray form with a spray catheter on the entire mucosal surface to be treated and then rinsed with water after a minute of application time.&#xD;
For circumferential BEs, a single-use 360 Express® probe is used to make it possible to size the diameter of the esophagus and the treatment used. The length of the treatment area is 5 cm and several points of impact can be achieved by overlapping the catheter at two consecutive heights, with the zone spanned measuring one centimeter, in order to cover the entire pathological area requiring treatment.&#xD;
For non-circumferential lesions a &quot;palette&quot; applicator is used in a variety of sizes, and in this context no sizing of the esophagus is required.</description>
