  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment personalization could ensure better outcome than standard procedures. It is&#xD;
      particularly important in intensive care units where patients received many drugs and&#xD;
      procedures. Their health status can change very fast. The oncologic patients treated in&#xD;
      intensive care units are a special group of patients. Factors related to cancer influence&#xD;
      extra their health status. The aim of this study is population&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis drugs that are routinely used during an&#xD;
      analgosedation in ICU oncologic patients. Analgosedation is monitored by drugs plasma&#xD;
      concentration, the depth of sedation (bispectral index) and vital parameters like: systolic&#xD;
      and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate. Moreover, the TNM Staging&#xD;
      System, biochemical parameters, The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical&#xD;
      status classification will be checked like potential factors influencing on pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics drugs used in the study.&#xD;

      The oncologic patients are qualified to head and neck tumor resection in general anesthesia.&#xD;
      The anesthesia introduction is performed with single dose of midazolam, fentanyl, rocuronium&#xD;
      and propofol/etomidate. Sevoflurane is used in anesthesia maintenance. Patients are&#xD;
      transported to ICU after operation. Then they are kept for several hours in analgosedation.&#xD;
      All used drugs are given by intravenous continuous infusion. Oxycodone is an analgesic&#xD;
      component of analgosedation. Midazolam, dexmedetomidine and/or propofol are used as sedatives&#xD;
      (2-3 drugs in every patient). Whole blood samples (2.0 ml) are collected during the study to&#xD;
      measure drugs concentrations - 3-4 times during infusion, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 minutes and 2, 4,&#xD;
      6 hours after the infusion cessation. Vital parameters and bispectral index are monitored&#xD;
      during analgosedation and 6 hours after the infusion cessation and noted every 15-60 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>Head and neck tumor resections were performed in general anesthesia. Midazolam and etomidate or propofol were used in introduction and then anesthesia was maintenance with sevoflurane.
