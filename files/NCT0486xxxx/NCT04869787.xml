  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SCD PED-02 trial is examining the safety and efficacy of the Selective Cytopheretic&#xD;
      Device (SCD) in treating pediatric acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI promotes a systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which results in systemic microvascular damage and, if&#xD;
      severe, multi-organ dysfunction. Activated circulating leukocytes play a central role in this&#xD;
      process. The SCD is a synthetic membrane with the ability to bind activated leukocytes and,&#xD;
      when used in a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) extracorporeal circuit in the&#xD;
      presence of regional citrate anticoagulation, modulates inflammation. The SCD PED-02 study&#xD;
      will test the primary hypothesis that up to ten sequential 24-hour SCD treatments in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with AKI will be completed safely and improve survival compared to&#xD;
      historical controls who received CRRT alone.&#xD;

      The SCD PED-02 trial is examining the safety and efficacy of the Selective Cytopheretic&#xD;
      Device (SCD) in treating pediatric acute kidney injury (AKI). Importantly, acute kidney&#xD;
      injury is a highly lethal condition in critically ill patients. Despite improvements in acute&#xD;
      medical care and advances in dialysis therapies, the mortality rate during the past four&#xD;
      decades of this condition has not improved. Critically ill patients with AKI in hospital ICU&#xD;
      settings have mortality rates of approximately 50%, including pediatric patients. AKI&#xD;
      promotes a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which results in systemic&#xD;
      microvascular damage and, if severe, multi-organ dysfunction. Activated circulating&#xD;
      leukocytes play a central role in this process. Leukocytes, especially neutrophils, are major&#xD;
      contributors to the pathogenesis and progression of many inflammatory disorders, including&#xD;
      SIRS, sepsis, ischemia reperfusion injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
      Many therapeutic approaches are under investigation to limit the activation and tissue&#xD;
      accumulation of leukocytes at sites of inflammation to minimize tissue destruction and&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCD is comprised of tubing, connectors, and a synthetic membrane cartridge. The device is&#xD;
      connected in series to a commercially available Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT)&#xD;
      device. Blood from the CRRT circuit is diverted after the CRRT hemofilter through to the&#xD;
      extra capillary space (ECS) of the SCD. Blood circulates through this space and it is&#xD;
      returned to the patient via the venous return line of the CRRT circuit. Regional citrate&#xD;
      anticoagulation is used for the entire CRRT and SCD blood circuits. The SCD is a synthetic&#xD;
      membrane with the ability to bind activated leukocytes and, when used in a continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy (CRRT) extracorporeal circuit in the presence of regional citrate&#xD;
      anticoagulation, modulates inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCD PED-02 study will test the primary hypothesis that up to ten sequential 24-hour SCD&#xD;
      treatments in pediatric patients with AKI will be completed safely and improve survival&#xD;
      compared to historical controls who received CRRT alone.&#xD;
