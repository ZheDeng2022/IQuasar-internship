  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study on the effectiveness of a training program in Advance Care Planning (ACP) with&#xD;
      primary care professionals has been designed as a cluster-randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To measure the effectiveness of a training program on ACP in Primary healthcare&#xD;
      professionals in a population area of Catalonia. Design: Cluster Randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      with a measure of pre-post effectiveness between groups of intervention based on the&#xD;
      measurement of self-efficacy in advance care planning. Scope: Barcelona Nord and Maresme&#xD;
      (BNM). Population: Primary care doctors and nurses. Sample: doctors and nurses from the&#xD;
      Primary Care Service (SAP) of the BNM. The study is divided into 3 phases: 1) Planning:&#xD;
      training design, randomization and parallel assignment in 2 arms, online training versus&#xD;
      online and face-to-face training; 2) Implementation: data collection pre-intervention and&#xD;
      training; 3) Evaluation: post data collection (1 follow-up 4 months after recruitment/ after&#xD;
      training) and data analysis. Intervention: both arms (A and B) will carry out the online&#xD;
      training which consists of a 10 hours course. Arm B will also do the 6-hour face-to-face&#xD;
      workshop, divided into two sessions of 3 hours. Primary outcome: ACP Self-efficacy (using a&#xD;
      validated scale Advance Care Planning-Self Efficacy Spanish (ACP_SEs). Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
      Socio-demographic: age, gender, years of professional experience and in the professional&#xD;
      field, previous knowledge in ACP, previous training in ACP; training Satisfaction; ACP&#xD;
      Registration Variables in the medical records of patients identified as chronic advanced&#xD;
      patients:% clinical records with ACP processes registration, identification of the surrogate&#xD;
      decision-maker, values, preferences, and specific decisions records, identification of the&#xD;
      place of care and of death preferred, adequacy of the place of death in case of death.&#xD;
      Analysis: calculation of the sample applying correction values for the cluster effect; mean,&#xD;
      median, range, confidence interval, and standard deviation of quantitative variables and&#xD;
      absolute and relative frequency of qualitative variables. Pre- and post-comparison for the&#xD;
      measurement of variance (ANOVA) resulting between the intervention groups from the chi-square&#xD;
      test; multivariate logistic regression model and 5% significance level&#xD;

    <description>Self-efficacy on Advance care planing was measured through a recently validated scale into spanish. This scale includes 19 items and it is a 5-point likert scale (1 not at all capable/ 5 completely capable). Due to self-efficacy is a subjective item, no worse o better score is considered. Measurements were collected before training and immediately after training</description>
