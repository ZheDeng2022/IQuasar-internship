  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walking difficulties, mobility decline and falls are prevalent among older adults. The&#xD;
      incidence of each of these increases with age and the presence of each can negatively affect&#xD;
      the quality of life in older adults. The purpose of this prospective clinical trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the Power Centering for Seniors multimodal, twice weekly, 12-week&#xD;
      group intervention program to improve the mobility and quality of life in older,&#xD;
      community-dwelling adults.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This delayed intervention trial begins as a parallel group design with the Delayed Intervention (Dl) group serving as a control arm comparison for the Immediate Intervention (II) group. There is no control intervention. The ll and the Dl groups will be assessed pre-intervention. After the 12-week intervention for the II group, resp. the waiting period for the DI group, the lI group will undergo their post-intervention assessment. At that time, the Dl group will undergo their 2nd pre-intervention assessment to document any change in baseline measures that may have occurred. No significant changes are expected, so that at the end of the trial, data from the ll and the Dl groups can be pooled to provide results on the overall changes in outcome measures for all participants post- versus pre-intervention. After the 2nd pre-intervention assessment, the Dl group will have their intervention, post-intervention assessment, follow-up period and final assessment, as with the II group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Standardized, self-report questionnaire to measure physical activity levels in older people as well as to assess the effectiveness of exercise interventions. From a list of 12 types of activities and referring to the previous week, participants report how many days per week and for how many hours per day they performed each activity. Scores are calculated by multiplying the weight (activity weights are provided in a table for PASE scoring) by the frequency values for each of 12 types of activities. Scores may range from zero to 400 or more. Higher scores reflect higher levels of physical activity.</description>

    <description>This self-report questionnaire is a reliable and valid tool for measuring health-related quality of life. It consists of 36 questions (acute recall = previous week) reflecting eight domains of health and provides eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in each respective domain. Each scale is directly transformed into a score of 0 to 100 points on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. Lower scores are associated with greater disability and lower quality of life.</description>

    <description>During the 12 weeks that the Immediate Intervention (II) group participates in the PCS intervention, the Delayed Intervention (DI) group waits (there is no control intervention) and serves as a control arm comparison for the II group during this time. After the 12 weeks, the DI group will undergo a second pre-intervention assessment to document any change in baseline measures that may have occurred in those 12 weeks. No significant changes are expected. The DI group then begins the same exercise intervention (75-minute group class, twice weekly for 12 weeks; home practice of exercises recommended but not required) that the II group underwent, given by the same instructors. Post-intervention clinical assessments, 12-week follow-up period, and final clinical assessments after the follow-up period as described for the II group. After the trial, pooled data from both groups will provide results on the overall changes in outcome measures post- versus pre-intervention.</description>

    <intervention_name>Power Centering for Seniors intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Power Centering for Seniors is an innovative East-meets-West intervention (75-minute, twice weekly, supervised group classes over 12 weeks) that integrates Western best practice muscle strength and balance training components with Chinese Tai Chi/Qi Gong to improve mobility and quality of life in older, community-dwelling adults. Home practice is recommended (approximately 30 minutes three times per week on non-course days). The modularly designed course consists of four cycles with six themes repeated in each cycle. Course exercises increase in intensity throughout the twelve-week intervention period. Repetition of cycles and themes prepares participants for continuing their individualized version of the program after the group course intervention is complete. This should lead to long-term practice of the exercises learned in the intervention and to sustained positive effects of the training.</description>
