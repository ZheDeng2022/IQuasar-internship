  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is associated with recurrent intractable abdominal pain, pancreatic&#xD;
      exocrine insufficiency and endocrine dysfunction. Very few studies had evaluated the quality&#xD;
      of life in CP, and even a fewer have assessed the mental status in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we proposed to evaluate the the relationship between pain, quality of&#xD;
      life and depression status in two large independent cohorts of patients with CP. We also&#xD;
      proposed to evaluate the brain metabolites in the right and left anterior cingulate cortex,&#xD;
      basal ganglia, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We&#xD;
      further proposed to evaluate the pasta metabolites and look for associations with the mental&#xD;
      state. Finally, we proposed to evaluate how CP related education of the patients could impact&#xD;
      on their mental status and response to interventions on pain.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the second cohort were educated about their disease phenotype in a structured and personalised manner that included their disease course, symptoms, imaging, treatment option and possible long-term outcomes and prognosis. This was followed by answering all the queries of the patient and their caregivers.&#xD;
The patients were advised to visit the Pancreas clinic after 3-months for re-evaluation of the clinical, psychological and metabolic parameters.</description>

        The study population constitutes of patients with chronic pancreatic of at least 3 years&#xD;
        duration. They are a composite with or without depression. Rationale for taking a lag time&#xD;
        of at least 3 years was to allow development of the complications of the disease.&#xD;
