    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity profile&#xD;
      after 1 and 2 dose administrations of investigational SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine CVnCoV, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the humoral immune responses 14 days after 2 dose administrations of CVnCoV.&#xD;

      Study participants with the following mild to moderate per protocol defined co-morbidities&#xD;
      will be recruited: chronic kidney disease (CKD); cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type-2-diabetes. After safety data review, recruitment&#xD;
      for severe cases will be opened. No severity classification will be done for study&#xD;
      participants with chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with stable viremia 12&#xD;
      months prior enrollment, for renal transplant patients if stable under medication for at&#xD;
      least 6 months prior enrollment, and for study participants with a body mass index &gt; 32&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Receipt of any investigational, authorized or licensed SARS-CoV-2, other coronavirus&#xD;
             vaccine or any other lipid nanoparticles (LNP)-containing messenger ribonucleic acid&#xD;
             vaccine prior to the administration of the trial vaccine. For authorized or licensed&#xD;
             SARS-CoV-2: planned administration during the trial up to 6 weeks after the foreseen&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled neurological disorders or Guillain-Barré syndrome or history of&#xD;

             with anticoagulants (e.g., vitamin K antagonists, novel oral anticoagulants, and&#xD;
             heparin). Use of platelet aggregation inhibitors is not exclusionary. However, use of&#xD;
             anticoagulants is accepted in certain co-morbidities according to the clinical&#xD;
             Investigator's judgment and if the international normalized ratio (INR) remains ≤3.&#xD;
