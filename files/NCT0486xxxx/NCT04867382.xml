  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid-related deaths has risen dramatically&#xD;
      in recent years. Effective treatments, including medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs;&#xD;
      e.g., buprenorphine-naloxone and methadone) are under-utilized. There are few evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions for changing attitudes toward Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) in the general public&#xD;
      and especially among healthcare clinicians. This study proposes an innovative intervention to&#xD;
      change attitudes of Primary Care Clinicians (PCCs) toward persons with OUD. Study&#xD;
      participants will be stratified into one of two online learning courses: the intervention&#xD;
      training will be compared with an attention-control training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary care offers an ideal setting in which to treat OUD; however, few clinicians are&#xD;
      waivered to prescribe buprenorphine and of those who are waivered, less than one-third do&#xD;
      prescribe. One potential barrier to increasing access to MOUDs are primary care clinician&#xD;
      (PCC) attitudes towards people with OUD. This study will use a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      design to examine a novel intervention to change attitudes towards people with OUD among&#xD;
      PCCs. PCCs in clinics randomized in COMPUTE 2.0 to the intervention (in 15 of the 30 clinics&#xD;
      randomized in the parent study) will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention or comparison&#xD;
      training, stratified by clinic and waiver status. Training will be conducted via MyLearning,&#xD;
      an online learning software. PCCs will be asked to complete a brief training on the clinical&#xD;
      decision support (CDS) tool, Opioid Wizard. PCCs in the intervention arm will hear patient&#xD;
      narratives designed to shift attitudes about patients with OUD. PCCs in the comparison&#xD;
      training will have training on using the clinical decision support tool. Immediately&#xD;
      following the training, the PCCs will complete a survey of attitudes and intentions to get&#xD;
      waivered to prescribe buprenorphine. Use of the CDS will be monitored in both groups for 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
