  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When choosing outcomes to assess rehabilitation's effect or progress, it is essential to&#xD;
      consider the constructs being measured and their value to the patient and the psychometric&#xD;
      properties. Choosing an outcome that reflects all aspects of International Classification&#xD;
      levels of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is challenging, especially in&#xD;
      heterogeneous groups. However, it is important to know the psychometric properties as this&#xD;
      gives important knowledge on how to interpret results and, consequently, how this can inform&#xD;
      the patient's care. The Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) questionnaire can&#xD;
      reflect differences in patients' functional status with a broad range of disorders, like for&#xD;
      elderly citizens undergoing municipality-based rehabilitation. Nevertheless, since there is&#xD;
      no golden standard to measure rehabilitation outcomes, construct validity needs to be&#xD;
      established to investigate how scores of SMFA can be related to measures on all levels of&#xD;
      ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study has three main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate how scores of the SMFA questionnaire are related to measures on different&#xD;
           ICF levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the characteristics of older citizens starting municipality-based&#xD;
           rehabilitation on all ICF levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate predictor variables of upper- and lower extremity strength&#xD;

        Participants from Slagelse municipality's community-based health centre will be recruited&#xD;
        in the period January 2021- June 2021 or until 115 men and woman have been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To detect a correlation coefficient of minimum r=+/-0.3 with a significance level of 0.05&#xD;
        and power of 0.8 between the primary outcome SMFA and the generic health-related quality of&#xD;
        life questionnaire SF36 a minimum of 85 participants are needed based on the Fisher's z&#xD;
        test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Some studies have shown a response rate for the SMFA to be approximately 65% in&#xD;
        cross-sectional studies, we, therefore add another 35% extra participants to the calculated&#xD;
        sample size, resulting in a target of 115 participants to be initially included in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
