    <textblock>
      This is a post-market study to evaluate the revision rate of femoral fractures, treated with&#xD;
      INTERTAN 10S Nails at one-year post-operation. The study will enroll Approximately 180&#xD;
      subjects with femoral fractures, Approximately 7 sites are involved. The study duration will&#xD;
      be Approximately 36 months (6 months start-up, 1 year enrollment, 1 year follow-up, 6 months&#xD;
      closeout/study report).&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INTERTAN nail was designed to improve upon existing intramedullary nail systems. INTERTAN&#xD;
      nails utilize two interlocking screws, thereby improving controlled intertochanteric fracture&#xD;
      compression and post-surgical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the revision rate of femoral fractures, treated with INTERTAN 10S Nails at one-year&#xD;
      post-operation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective: To evaluate the revision rate for any reason of femoral fractures,&#xD;
           treated with INTERTAN 10S Nails at one year post-operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objective: To generate safety and effectiveness evidence for INTERTAN 10S&#xD;
           Nails via the collection of functional outcomes, quality of life, and safety data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants / locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll Approximately 180 subjects with femoral fractures, Approximately 7&#xD;
      sites in China are involved.&#xD;

    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, &amp; 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score is a joint specific score that consists of 10 items covering domains of pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), functional activities, absence of deformity (1 item, 0 or 4 points), and hip range of motion (2 items, 0-5 points). Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

    <measure>EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, &amp; 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measurement of health outcome. It consists of a descriptive system with 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), which are each assigned five levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems), as well as, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where subjects indicate a numerical value from 1-100 where 0 is the worst imaginable health state and 100 is the best imaginable health state.&#xD;
The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the dimensions. This decision results in a 1- digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state.</description>
