    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled single-center&#xD;
      clinical research study in which 600 mg of gabapentin or placebo will be administered 2 hours&#xD;
      preoperatively to 49 patients each undergoing wisdom teeth extraction. We will measure&#xD;
      intraoperative opioid use, severity of pain, the number of analgesics taken, and side effect&#xD;
      profiles (e.g. nausea/vomiting, dizziness) at the following intervals, 4 hour, 8 hour, 12&#xD;
      hour, 24, and 72 hour post-procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the 1990s, the amount of prescribed opioids has begun growing. According to the Center&#xD;
      for Disease Control, more than 130 people die every day due to opioid overdose. Many medical&#xD;
      and surgical specialities have devised various methods to decrease opioid use with adequate&#xD;
      pain control. One notable method is preoperative administration of gabapentin. Gabapentin, a&#xD;
      prescribed medication, is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat partial seizures,&#xD;
      neuropathic pain (e.g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain), hot flashes, and&#xD;
      restless legs syndrome . Various surgical specialties such as otolaryngology, plastics,&#xD;
      general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology have tested the efficacy of gabapentin in reducing&#xD;
      postoperative opioid usage without compromising pain control and the result is promising.&#xD;
      However, this study has not been done in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The objectives of&#xD;
      the study is to determine if preoperative administration of gabapentin can decrease&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative use of opioid and provide adequate pain control when used&#xD;
      with non-opioid pain regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of consultation visit, subjects will be screened and evaluated by oral and&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgery residents. Those who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. They will then be randomly divided into following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1a: 49 subjects undergoing wisdom teeth extraction will be receiving 600mg&#xD;
           gabapentin PO preoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1b: 49 subjects undergoing wisdom teeth extraction will be receiving placebo PO&#xD;
           preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject then will be given a small bag that contains either a gabapentin pill or a placebo&#xD;
      pill depending on which group that he or she is assigned to. The subject will be asked to&#xD;
      take 600mg of gabapentin or a placebo pill 2 hours prior to their procedure (vs. current&#xD;
      standard of care is no pre-medication). On the day of the procedure, they will be accompanied&#xD;
      by a guardian or a family member to the clinic. The Procedure will be done by a senior or a&#xD;
      chief level resident with supervision of an attending surgeon. Intraoperative opioid use will&#xD;
      be recorded on a standardized anesthesia sheet. All cases will include IV sedation that&#xD;
      involves a concoction of fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, ketamine, and dexamethasone. The&#xD;
      medications will be given in boluses depending on their weight but not necessarily strictly&#xD;
      kg-based. For example, fentanyl will be given between 25 -50mcg, midazolam 2.5-5mg, propofol&#xD;
      10-40mg and ketamine 10-50mg. Local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine&#xD;
      will also be given after sedation. Additional doses of local anesthetic can be given if the&#xD;
      patient experiences sharp pain. Additional doses of propofol and/or fentanyl can be given if&#xD;
      the patient's systolic blood pressure increases by 10 mmHg or heart rate increases by 20 bpm&#xD;
      acutely. All used anesthetics will be recorded. After the procedure, standard postoperative&#xD;
      pain regimen will be prescribed including 28 tablets of ibuprofen 600mg PO q6h prn pain and&#xD;
      12 tablets of Norco 5/325mg PO q6h prn pain with an instruction to take Norco only when a&#xD;
      subject is in severe pain (pain level greater than 7 out of 10). To assess the severity of&#xD;
      pain and its impact on functioning, scientists developed Brief Pain Inventory from which&#xD;
      Modified Brief pain inventory (MBPI) was created to better fit the need for our research;&#xD;
      MBPI will not only ask the severity of pain but also the number of analgesics taken and side&#xD;
      effect profiles (e.g. nausea/vomiting, dizziness) at the following intervals, 4 hour, 8 hour,&#xD;
      12 hour, 24, and 72 hour post-procedure. The patient is to turn in the MBPI form during their&#xD;
      1 week postoperative follow up visit. If for any reason, the patient misses the follow up&#xD;
      appointment, we will try to reschedule their visit within 5 days. If the patient does not&#xD;
      show up at all, our members will find out the reason for the no show and record it for the&#xD;
      publication purpose.&#xD;

Gabapentin and placebo pills will be formulated by an investigational pharmacist to ensure both pills are identical in shape and form to further reduce bias.</masking_description>
