  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will involve adolescent (17-24 years old) men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (described as YMSM hereafter) who meet eligibility criteria to participate in each study.&#xD;
      Prospective study candidates will receive a copy of the IRB-approved informed consent forms&#xD;
      and, if they choose to participate, will provide consent before enrollment into this study.&#xD;
      Involvement of human subjects is detailed in the Research Strategy portion of this proposal,&#xD;
      Recruitment and Retention Plan, and Protection of Human Subjects sections. Briefly, we will&#xD;
      develop and pilot a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to support HIV self-testing (HIVST) and&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake. Intervention content will be focused on constructs of&#xD;
      the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model. To reduce cost and increase&#xD;
      feasibility, we plan to incorporate previously developed content as much as possible-we see&#xD;
      integration of this content as a major strength. We will include professionally produced&#xD;
      videos about HIV testing and PrEP and other resources including the geo-targeted directories&#xD;
      to find clinic settings that offer HIV testing and PrEP, all of which are publicly available.&#xD;
      We believe our approach of guiding YMSM through intervention modules based on theory will&#xD;
      help improve content retention/use and ultimately influence constructs posited to result in&#xD;
      behavior change. We foresee using multiple forms of attention-matched material, media, and&#xD;
      programming to engage (and retain engagement) of YMSM throughout the brief single-session&#xD;
      intervention (45-60 minutes). Intervention content is subject to change depending on feedback&#xD;
      from focus groups, survey results, YAB feedback, and usability testing. Primary endpoints of&#xD;
      this study include HIVST and PrEP uptake, including stage of change towards HIVST and PrEP&#xD;
      uptake. Secondary outcomes include changes in IMB model indicators (e.g., HIV prevention&#xD;
      knowledge).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research activity designated as a clinical trial is our pilot RCT where we will then&#xD;
      enroll 120 YMSM and randomly assign individuals to one of four experimental groups: (1)&#xD;
      information-only (I), (2) information + motivation (IM), (3) information + behavioral skills&#xD;
      (IB), and (4) full IMB model (IMB). Randomization will be blinded using Qualtrics, and&#xD;
      randomization will occur in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 between the four groups. Individuals assigned&#xD;
      to groups 1-3 will receive attention-matched information-only filler content (e.g.,&#xD;
      information about physical activity and diet), but note that group (1) information-only will&#xD;
      still receive HIVST and PrEP related information; attention-matched filler content will cover&#xD;
      the one or two theoretical sections excluded from that condition arm. Intervention content&#xD;
      will be based upon the formative research, but preliminary content is identified in Table 4&#xD;
      of the Research Strategy. After completion of the baseline survey, randomization, and&#xD;
      intervention, participants will be followed for a period of three months. Individuals will be&#xD;
      surveyed at 1- and 3-months post intervention to assess our primary endpoints of HIVST and&#xD;
      PrEP uptake. Preliminary impact will be assessed using within- and between-subjects analyses.&#xD;
      First, we will test the performance of randomization by chi-squared comparisons and ANOVAs&#xD;
      for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Second, we will test for differential&#xD;
      attrition by treatment group at 1- and 3-month follow-up assessments. Third, we will assess&#xD;
      post-intervention HIV testing and PrEP uptake using factorial logistic regressions to&#xD;
      determine between-group differences, adjusting for any breakdowns in randomization or&#xD;
      differential attrition. Fourth, we will test for changes in stage of change indicators by&#xD;
      randomized group, time, and group*time interaction, with similar adjustment procedures, using&#xD;
      GEE; this analysis will help us determine a trend towards HIVST or PrEP uptake were we to&#xD;
      extend the length of follow-up. Power: Our study has 80% power to detect a ½ stage average&#xD;
      difference (d = 0.68; α = 0.05) on the PrEP cascade comparing the three experimental groups&#xD;
      combined to the information-only control assuming 80% retention. As the purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to pilot the RCT, we have not powered this study to determine differences by each&#xD;
      experimental group compared to the control group (which is planned for the full RCT in a&#xD;
      future R01). Finally, we will conduct within-subjects tests comparing baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      IMB construct scale scores stratified by group as an evaluation of internal validity (i.e.,&#xD;
      did the interventions have an effect on the targeted constructs?).&#xD;
