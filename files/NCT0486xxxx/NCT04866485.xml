    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center phase 1 study. The trial, consisting of Part 1a dose&#xD;
      confirmation and Part 1b dose expansion, is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      PK/PD and preliminary efficacy of HBM4003 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC and other solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      subjects will be treated with HBM4003 in combination with pembrolizumab for up to 2 years or&#xD;
      until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable tolerability or treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      through withdrawal of consent occurs, whichever happens first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial consists of :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period: 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part 1a dose confirmation study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part 1b dose expansion study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A post-treatment follow-up period, including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A safety follow-up period: 28 days after the last dose of study drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-treatment follow-up visit: day 84 after the last dose of study drug;&#xD;
