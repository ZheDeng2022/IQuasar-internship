      This is a safety and efficacy study of STYLAGE® Lin Chinese adults with Nasolabial Folds.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, parallel-group, subject and evaluator-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the study device, STYLAGE®&#xD;
      L, when compared to an active comparator for the correction of moderate and severe NLFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will randomly receive STYLAGE® L or the active comparator (ratio 1:1) injection in&#xD;
      the NLFs at first visit on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of subjects having a NLFs severity improvement (blinded evaluation), 6 months&#xD;
      after treatment initiation will be assessed and compared between the two groups. This will&#xD;
      also be done during the other visits (1, 3, 9 and 12 months after treatment initiation).&#xD;
      Global aesthetic improvement according to blinded independent evaluator and subject,&#xD;
      subjects' satisfaction, and safety parameters will also be assessed during the study period.&#xD;
