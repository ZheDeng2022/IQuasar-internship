  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the anesthesiologists are involved in the&#xD;
      riskiest interventions e.g. airway management, endotracheal intubation, and resuscitation.&#xD;
      So, they are subjected to a higher risk of infection compared to many other medical&#xD;
      specialties. As a result, they are more subjected to psychological stresses. This study aimed&#xD;
      to assess the level of stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among anesthesiologists.&#xD;

      This is a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey conducted using an online questionnaire&#xD;
      after getting IRB approval. The primary outcomes are to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among anesthesiologists working in&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia. The secondary outcomes include the association of the socio-demographic and&#xD;
      occupational characteristics with mental health in the study sample. The survey sent to the&#xD;
      target participants using a web-based software platform&#xD;
      (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZJ98BTJ) though the Saudi Society of Anesthesia. The study&#xD;
      sample included anesthetists and their allied health care providers (nurses and technicians)&#xD;
      involved in the management of COVID-19 patients. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses were conducted, and the ranked data for each level for symptoms of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and PTSD were presented as numbers and percentages. Multi-variable&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis was used to explore potential influence factors on the outcomes.&#xD;
      P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.&#xD;
