  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this study is to make it easier for parents of children with&#xD;
      medical complexity (CMC) to take care of their children after discharge home from the&#xD;
      hospital and reduce the chance of post-hospitalization morbidity (meaning bad outcomes such&#xD;
      as readmissions) after discharge. CMC, or those with multiple chronic conditions, progressive&#xD;
      conditions, or technology dependence, are at high risk for post-hospitalization morbidity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will take place in 3 phases at 2 sites: Bellevue Hospital Center (BHC) and&#xD;
      Hassenfeld Children's Hospital (HCH). Parents of CMC with a prior or current admission will&#xD;
      be recruited at these two sites, as well as pediatricians who care for these children in the&#xD;
      inpatient setting for the following 3 aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Aim 1, parents of CMC and pediatricians will be interviewed to understand their views&#xD;
           on what makes it challenging, and what can make it easier, for parents to understand and&#xD;
           follow the instructions they get from the hospital about how to take care of their CMC&#xD;
           after leaving the hospital. The study team will also ask pediatricians what may make it&#xD;
           difficult to provide relevant education to families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Aim 2, a tool will be designed to make it easier for parents to understand and follow&#xD;
           the discharge instructions for their CMC. The study team will use structure of existing&#xD;
           tool, findings from Aim 1, and extensive interviews and testing of the tool with parents&#xD;
           and pediatricians as the new tool is designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Aim 3, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to study the impact of&#xD;
           the tool on parent comprehension and adherence (or how well they can follow) their&#xD;
           child's discharge instructions, as well as its impact on post-discharge morbidity (such&#xD;
           as readmissions and emergency department visits). Parents will be randomized to either&#xD;
           receive usual hospital care and instructions or the intervention/tool (in addition to&#xD;
           the usual care and instructions). The study team will also ask parents who receive the&#xD;
           intervention about its usability.&#xD;

    <measure>Parent Comprehension of Discharge Instructions</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Day 0-1)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of parents making errors in comprehension of their child's discharge instructions will be assessed. The visit will consist of a structured survey. Parents will be asked open-ended questions about their child's discharge instructions for their medications, appointments , return precautions , restrictions , equipment. Parents will be encouraged to use their written instructions when answering survey questions. The total proportion of parents making comprehension errors in an individual domain and across domains will be calculated. Errors in domains are defined by parent report of not following instructions properly. Comprehension in a given domain will be dichotomized into no errors vs. ≥1 error</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Adherence to Discharge Instructions</measure>
    <time_frame>Visits 3-4 (Days 1-45)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of parents making errors in adherence to their child's discharge instructions will be assessed with a structured survey. Parents will be asked open ended questions about their child's discharge instructions for their medications, appointments attended, return precautions, restrictions being followed, and equipment. Parents will be encouraged to use their written instructions when answering questions. Parents will be asked to measure out any liquid medications using a standard medication bottle as they would measure them at home.The total proportion of parents making adherence errors in an individual domain and across domains will be calculated.Medication dosing errors will be defined by &gt;20% deviation from the prescribed dose for ≥1 medication as assessed by visual inspection as part of in-person dosing assessment. Appointment attendance errors will be defined by missing ≥1 scheduled appointment after discharge.</description>

    <measure>Number of CMC with any type of post-discharge morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 4 (Day 30-45)</time_frame>
    <description>The total proportion of children with medical complexity (CMC) with any type of post-discharge morbidity (30-day readmissions, ED visits, outpatient visits, adverse drug events, surgical complications, infections) within 30 days of discharge will be calculated. Subjects will be dichotomized into those with no post-discharge morbidity vs. ≥1 type of postdischarge morbidity.</description>
