  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether people who have had thyroid cancer develop&#xD;
      resistance to treatment with thyroid hormones after having received high doses of thyroid&#xD;
      drugs for many years.&#xD;

    <description>Study subjects will be given 200mcg of TRH as a single intravenous (IV) bolus in endocrine clinic on Day 1 and Day 5.

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to a diagnosis of thyroid cancer based on pathology patient underwent a total&#xD;
             thyroidectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of active disease based on routine surveillance testing showing no&#xD;
             suspicious findings on neck ultrasound and low thyroglobulin levels (&lt;1.0 ng/ml) with&#xD;
             negative thyroglobulin antibodies within one year of study enrollment. For the study&#xD;
             patients, this response can be evaluated after five years of TSH suppression. For&#xD;
             control subjects, this response can be evaluated after two years of surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  8 patients with a history of thyroid hormone suppression (TSH&lt;0.5 mU/L) for at&#xD;
                  least 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  8 patients with no history of TSH suppression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal TSH level based on the laboratory reference range for at least 6 months at the&#xD;
             time of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure range of &gt;90/60 and &lt;180/100. Patients may be included in the study if&#xD;
             blood pressure has been treated with medication and normalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             fibrillation, atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular&#xD;
             fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient reported history of uncontrolled hypotension (&lt;90/60) or hypertension&#xD;
             (&gt;180/100).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of renal dysfunction with creatinine more than 1.5 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal based on recent laboratory testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of seizures or brain damage&#xD;

             (i.e. hypophysectomy, hypopituitarism, pituitary tumor/surgery, head irradiation, or&#xD;
             head trauma).&#xD;
