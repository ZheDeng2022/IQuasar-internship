  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to evaluate a culturally grounded program among&#xD;
      American Indian (AI) female adolescents and their female caregivers. Specifically,&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate the impact of &quot;Asdzaan Be'eena'&quot; or Female Pathways in English&#xD;
      (henceforth referred to as AB) on risk and protective factors for early substance use and&#xD;
      sexual debut through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in partnership with the Navajo&#xD;
      Nation. The program was developed and pilot tested through an extensive formative phase&#xD;
      conducted by our tribal-academic partnership (IRB protocols: #00006569 and #00009117).&#xD;
      Investigators will examine the efficacy of the AB program for reducing risk factors and&#xD;
      improving protective factors associated with early substance use and sexual debut, with long&#xD;
      term goals of reducing teen pregnancy and teen substance use.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      American Indian/Alaska Native(AI/AN) communities contend with high rates of poverty and&#xD;
      unemployment, as well as historical trauma and adverse events resulting in poor health&#xD;
      outcomes and health disparities across their life course. AI youth adolescents are&#xD;
      particularly impacted by these health disparities. They are more likely to be sexually&#xD;
      active, have their first sexual intercourse at a young age and have higher rates of teen&#xD;
      pregnancy and repeat teen pregnancy than other racial/ethnic groups. In 2016, the birth rate&#xD;
      for AI/AN teen girls (age 15-19) was 35 per 1,000, well above the national birth rate of 20.3&#xD;
      per 1,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teen pregnancy may lead to lower educational attainment and is associated with a lower annual&#xD;
      income for the mother. Nationally, only about 63% of teen mothers obtain a high school&#xD;
      diploma and just 2% earn a college degree. Furthermore, studies have found that decades after&#xD;
      becoming a parent, teen mothers have lower annual incomes than women who wait to become&#xD;
      mothers. The consequences of teen pregnancy continue generations later. Babies born as result&#xD;
      of a teen pregnancy are more likely to be premature and of low birth weight, raising their&#xD;
      risk for other health problems including blindness, deafness, chronic respiratory problems,&#xD;
      mental illness and mental retardation. Children of teen parents are more likely to live in&#xD;
      poverty, drop out of high school and themselves become teen parents. The poverty rate for&#xD;
      children born to teenage mothers who never married and who did not graduate from high school&#xD;
      is 78% (compared to 9% of children born to women over age 20 who are currently married and&#xD;
      did graduate from high school).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compounding teen pregnancy, AI/ANs have the highest substance use and related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of any U.S. racial group and are more likely to initiate drug and alcohol use&#xD;
      before the age of 13. In AI communities, girls and boys have distinct patterns and processes&#xD;
      for underage substance use that leads to early initiation of sex and sexual risk-taking.&#xD;
      Among AIs, girls are more likely than boys to use substances during adolescence due to poor&#xD;
      self-esteem or self-identity. Girls are also more likely than boys to be offered substances&#xD;
      in private settings by female relatives. Additionally, poor attachment to parents is a&#xD;
      stronger risk factor for substance use among girls than boys. Thus, gender-specific&#xD;
      approaches are needed for optimal prevention of adolescent substance use in AI communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention that works with AI females together with their female caregivers and&#xD;
      incorporates AI cultural strengths and traditions, while also helping girls grow their ethnic&#xD;
      identity and self-esteem may prove efficacious in preventing teen pregnancy, reducing early&#xD;
      initiation of substance use and progression to misuse, and improving the health and well&#xD;
      being of AI girls and families. The Navajo Nation and Johns Hopkins (JHU) have a&#xD;
      long-standing history of addressing AI health disparities through culturally tailored and&#xD;
      community-engaged programming and are poised to conduct the RCT described herein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate the intervention: &quot;Asdzaan Be'eena: Female Pathways&quot; (AB). The&#xD;
      program consists of 11 weekly sessions conducted with girls ages 10-14 and their female&#xD;
      caregivers. Five of the 11 sessions will be taught to groups of 9-13 girls and their female&#xD;
      caregivers, and 6 of the sessions will be taught to individual girl/female caregiver dyads.&#xD;
      The choice to use a mix of group- and individual sessions is based on findings from the&#xD;
      formative phase indicating certain topics should be taught in groups (e.g. Navajo history and&#xD;
      reproductive health 101), and certain topics be taught in individual dyads (e.g. family&#xD;
      values and the clan system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the sessions (group and individual) will be 60-90 minutes in duration and delivered&#xD;
      by a trained Family Health Coach (FHC). Group sessions will take place at a local community&#xD;
      center in a private room. Individual dyad sessions will take place in the girls'/female&#xD;
      caregivers' home or another private place of their choosing, such as our local Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      offices. Transportation to the group sessions will be provided upon request. The program will&#xD;
      be conducted over 2.5-3 months with one session occurring every week for 11 weeks. The total&#xD;
      program duration is 660-990 minutes. The control condition was selected by community members&#xD;
      and allows for minimal contamination and/or overlap between the AB curriculum and control&#xD;
      group&#xD;
