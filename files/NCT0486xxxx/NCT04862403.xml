  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial was conducted to test the effect of umbilical cord clamping&#xD;
      distance on cord separation time and umbilical cord microbial colonization in neonates.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the indicators of a country's level of development is the neonatal mortality rate. This&#xD;
      rate reveals the extent of a country's economic development and how this affects health. One&#xD;
      of the main causes of neonatal mortality is infection-related fatalities. Every year,&#xD;
      approximately 700,000 neonatal deaths occur from bacterial infections.Navel cord infections&#xD;
      comprise a large part of neonatal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The umbilical cord is clamped and cut off at a distance of 2-3 cm from the newborn's&#xD;
      abdominal wall after birth, after which its function is terminated. The necrotic tissue&#xD;
      remaining in the newborn's umbilical cord provides an ideal environment for bacterial growth.&#xD;
      The umbilical cord dries out and falls in the interval between postpartum 5-15 day. The&#xD;
      prolongation of the umbilical cord falling time increases the possibility of developing&#xD;
      bacterial infection. The umbilical cord microbial colonization was usually detected on 5th&#xD;
      and 7th days after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the time the umbilical cord falls off directly affects the health of the newborn, it is&#xD;
      important to understand the factors that can affect this time. The literature reveals studies&#xD;
      on umbilical cord separation times, most of which are devoted to comparing various techniques&#xD;
      of caring for the cord. No study however has been discovered that has examined the effect of&#xD;
      the distance between the abdominal wall of the newborn and the cord clamping site. It is&#xD;
      believed that the clamping distance of the umbilical cord may be among the factors that have&#xD;
      an impact on the separation time of the cord. Also, although midwives are responsible for the&#xD;
      clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord, it is observed that there is no measuring&#xD;
      instrument that is used in this procedure and the cord is clamped by eyeball estimation.&#xD;
      There is no standard practice and there are also differences between the practices of&#xD;
      midwives. This situation and the lack of adequate information in the literature on cord&#xD;
      clamping distance pointed to the need for conducting a study in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was intended to determine the effect of umbilical cord clamping distance on the&#xD;
      cord separation time and on microbial colonization in the umbilical cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was tested the hypotheses that there is no difference between the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups of newborns after the umbilical cord clambing distance intervention, the cord&#xD;
      separation time and on microbial colonization outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>assessed using the Umbilical Cord Follow-Up on Twentieth Day Form. This form consists of 17 questions prepared to investigate the umbilical cord separation time on the postpartum 20th day of the newborns in the intervention I, II, and control group. On the 20th day after birth, the mothers were called by mobile phone and information was obtained.</description>

    <time_frame>7th day after the birth</time_frame>
    <description>assessed with swab was taken from the umbilical cord on the 7th day. At home visits on the 7th postnatal day, a swab was taken from the umbilical cords of all newborns for microbial colonization. If the newborn's umbilical cord fell off on the 7th day postpartum visit, a swab was still taken. Umbilical swabs collected using transport swabs were transported to laboratory for culture. The result of the swab sample was taken 48 hours after the laboratory and it was determined whether there was colonization or not.</description>

    <description>In intervention group I - clamped at a distance of 2 cm - umbilical cord was measured 2 cm from the abdominal wall in the delivery room and clamped. This procedure was carried out by a single researcher using a 2 cm standard measuring tool (cut-to-size ruler) prepared before hand. In order to ensure standardization, this tool was cleaned with a disinfectant and used to measure the umbilical clamp distance of all newborns in the intervention group I.</description>

In order to ensure standardization, this tool was cleaned with a disinfectant and used to measure the umbilical clamp distance of all newborns in the intervention group II.</description>

    <description>Control group - clamped without measuring - no intervention was made in defining the distance at which the umbilical cord of the newborn would be clamped. Another healthcare workers measured the distance at which the umbilical cord had been clamped. The same researcher used a standard measuring tape to measure the distance between the umbilical cord to the clamping point.</description>
