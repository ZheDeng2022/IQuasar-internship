      This open-label study will evaluate EMB-001, comprised of metyrapone, a cortisol synthesis&#xD;
      inhibitor marketed as a diagnostic drug for testing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis&#xD;
      function, combined with oxazepam, an anxiolytic and sedative/hypnotic benzodiazepine, to help&#xD;
      smokers abstain from smoking during a 12-week trial period.&#xD;
