  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common pelvic gynecological cancer in France, ranking 5th&#xD;
      among cancers in women in terms of incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequent symptom is post-menopausal bleeding and is one of the primary reasons for&#xD;
      consultation in gynecological emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of endometrial cancer is made by histological analysis of endometrial tissue&#xD;
      taken during a surgical intervention. The latter is mostly reassuring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These interventions are often performed in mild situations and there is currently no element&#xD;
      to be sufficiently reassuring to avoid surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is no biological marker used in current practice. In the population of&#xD;
      patients with post-menopausal bleeding requiring surgical exploration for diagnosis, the&#xD;
      pathology results are often reassuring. These procedures could have been avoided, especially&#xD;
      as these patients often have numerous co-morbidities and these surgeries are therefore more&#xD;
      risky. The appearance of a new tumour marker could be useful in the management of these&#xD;
      patients and avoid many unnecessary and risky surgeries&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the sensitivity of an innovative marker, HE4, in the diagnosis&#xD;
      approach of endometrial cancer in case of postmenopausal bleedings.&#xD;

    <description>The HE4 assays will be performed using the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technique on Cobas Pro module E801, Roche Diagnostics. The HE4 assay is based on a sandwich-type electrochemiluminescence method. The HE4 assay with the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys reagent has been standardized against the Fujirebo Diagnostics HE4 EIA method.&#xD;
Positive/negative HE4 result for the estimation of the sensitivity of HE4 in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.&#xD;
The commonly accepted threshold for ovarian cancer management of 140pmol/l in postmenopausal patients should be used.&#xD;
The gold standard for endometrial cancer is the pathological result (absence/presence of cancer) of the sample taken.</description>

    <description>Any patient presenting post-menopausal bleeding who is to undergo hysteroscopy or hysterectomy will have an additional blood tube taken during her pre-operative blood work-up for the determination of the serum markers HE4 and CA125, after having obtained her non-opposition to participate in the study.&#xD;
The blood tube collected for the research will be sent to the biochemistry laboratory of the Nantes University Hospital for a centralized analysis.&#xD;
This analysis will be done sequentially and the results will not be transmitted to the investigator.&#xD;
At D0, the day of surgery, the operative report will be retrieved as well as the quality of life questionnaires SF12 and PGI-I and the acceptability questionnaire completed before surgery.&#xD;
At 1 month after surgery, the anatomopathological results will be retrieved as well as the value of the tumour markers CA125 and HE4.</description>

    <description>Blood was collected in a standard heparinized vial. Samples were sent to a central laboratory unit (biochemistry laboratory at the Nantes university hospital), centrifuged and plasmas were stored at -20°C until analysis. Plasma CA125 and HE4 concentrations were determined by run in single measurements using an electrochemiluminescence Elecsys immunoassay (ECLIA) on a Roche Diagnostics Cobas 8000® e602 analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).</description>
