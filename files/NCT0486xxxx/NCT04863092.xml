  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal aims to leverage ongoing community outreach efforts and the Cancer Center's&#xD;
      aims to improve recruitment to clinical trials by educating the catchment and making&#xD;
      referrals to engage current UCCC patients not taking advantage of available CTs at this&#xD;
      institution and affiliated hospitals. The Cancer Prevention and Control Program within UCCC&#xD;
      works to develop and evaluate novel approaches to primary prevention, disseminate&#xD;
      preventative interventions in population-based settings, and to improve health services&#xD;
      delivery and outcomes for cancer patients and survivors. A primary emphasis is placed on&#xD;
      those from underrepresented populations, including Hispanics, residents of outlying rural&#xD;
      areas, and those in areas of poverty. Efforts to meet the Cancer Center's priorities include&#xD;
      interventions to promote awareness and recruitment of eligible patients to available CTs in&#xD;
      the catchment area (the state of Colorado).&#xD;

      Clinical Trial Education Intervention: The educational intervention will be delivered to&#xD;
      approximately 200 participants by the Community Health Educators (CHEs) who will conduct&#xD;
      workshops to deliver content and educational materials to patients about the importance of&#xD;
      participating in cancer clinical trials. The workshops will last approximately 60 minutes,&#xD;
      with 20 minutes to educate participants and 10 minutes to discuss the materials and answer&#xD;
      any questions. Prior to and after the presentation, the CHE will administer the pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention survey to participants. Group sizes will be capped to 25 individuals per&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the CHE and/or Patient Navigators (PNs) will set up pathways for communication&#xD;
      with key personnel (i.e. nurse navigators, clinical research coordinators, investigators)&#xD;
      from partnering hospitals and clinics to facilitate patient referrals and evaluation for&#xD;
      eligibility for clinical trials. The CHE and/or PN will keep track of those individuals that&#xD;
      are referred by the partner hospital and clinics to track if the PN referral resulted in&#xD;
      enrollment and participation in a clinical trial. The CHE and/or PN will also record and&#xD;
      report quarterly the number of: (a) persons referred to therapeutic/intervention CTs at the&#xD;
      UCCC and partnering hospitals; (b) referred persons screened for therapeutic/intervention CTs&#xD;
      at the UCCC and partnering hospitals; (c)referred persons enrolled in therapeutic/&#xD;
      intervention CTs at the UCCC and partnering hospitals.&#xD;
