  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common complication of obesity which can&#xD;
      progress to deadly complications like end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
      In the wake of the obesity epidemic, NAFLD is becoming the main etiology of liver&#xD;
      transplantation in the United States. Currently, there are no Federal Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) approved pharmacological treatments for NAFLD. Weight loss through lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications, pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery can be effective strategies for the&#xD;
      management of NAFLD. Even though substantial weight loss and improvement in NAFLD can be&#xD;
      achieved with bariatric surgery, only a small proportion of patients with obesity undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Very-low calorie diets (VLCD) are replacement meals manufactured to substitute&#xD;
      natural foods and limited total intake of 800-960 kcal in divided meals. Very low-calorie&#xD;
      diets can produce substantial weight loss of 10% over 2 to 3 months. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      VLCD reduce liver steatosis and fibrosis measured non-invasively with transient elastography.&#xD;
      The main aim is #1 to assess the effect of VLCD on liver fatty infiltration and fibrosis.&#xD;
      There are also two exploratory aims exploring novel pathogenic factors that mediate the&#xD;
      improvement of NAFLD by VLCD: #2 assess the effect of VLCD on micro RNAs (miRs) associated&#xD;
      with pathophysiology of NAFLD and #3 assess the effect of VLCD on changes of salivary and&#xD;
      fecal microbiome in the setting of NAFLD. This pilot project will produce preliminary data&#xD;
      for the development of a larger grant application to study the efficacy of VLCD and a&#xD;
      physical activity intervention in the management of NAFLD. Furthermore, it will potentially&#xD;
      identify factors that mediate improvement of NAFLD after VLCD. Twenty to 25 subjects with&#xD;
      obesity and NAFLD will be treated for 8 weeks with a physical activity intervention and VLCD&#xD;
      and obtain transient elastography before and after the interventions along with other&#xD;
      measurements of interest. Of note, there will not be a control parallel group because of&#xD;
      funding limitation. This project may have significant impact by establishing VLCD as a&#xD;
      clinically effective option for the improvement of liver steatosis and fibrosis in patients&#xD;
      with obesity and NAFLD ineligible or without access to bariatric surgery.&#xD;

      Study design: The investigators plan to perform a non-controlled, non-randomized, open-label,&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial to evaluate the effect of an 8-week VLCD intervention on NAFLD. The main&#xD;
      variable of this study is the magnitude of liver steatosis and fibrosis assessed&#xD;
      non-invasively by elastography. The investigators will compare these variables before and&#xD;
      after the VLCD intervention. The investigators do not plan to include a parallel control&#xD;
      group because the main objective of this budget-limited pilot clinical trial is to collect&#xD;
      preliminary data for a larger grant proposal. Data prior to VLCD intervention will serve as&#xD;
      control for each subject. Hereby, it is hypothesized that VLCD reduces liver steatosis and&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects: Potential adult participants with obesity [age ≥ 21 years old; body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 and ≤ 50 kg/m2] will be recruited at the Weight Management Clinic, at&#xD;
      the Diabetes Center and at the Digestive Health Center, all at University of Iowa Health Care&#xD;
      (UIHC). The investigators will invite potential participants with sex-specific abnormal&#xD;
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (female ≥ 32 U/L; male ≥ 41 U/L), but less than 100 U/L, with&#xD;
      negative tests for viral hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis, and elastography results&#xD;
      positive for fibrosis grade F2 through F4 [that is, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) between&#xD;
      6 and 124 kPa] and/or steatosis grade S1 through S3 [that is, controlled attenuation&#xD;
      parameter (CAP) ≥ 248 dB/m] within the last 6 months. The above tests, along with complete&#xD;
      blood count (CBC), basic metabolic profile (BMP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with&#xD;
      reflex free thyroxine (free T4) and hemoglobin A1c are routinely obtained as part of the&#xD;
      standard of care at the recruitment clinics. Oral health status of these patients will be&#xD;
      obtained from the available dental charts, if not, a dental examination will be performed.&#xD;
      With Institutional Board Review (IRB) authorization, the investigators will interrogate the&#xD;
      charts to verify whether subjects meet criteria for participation. Case managers will contact&#xD;
      potential participants by telephone, electronic mail or letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #1 (enrolment visit): Subjects who meet the above criteria will be invited for visit #1&#xD;
      at UIHC Clinical Research Unit. Subjects will fast for 12 hours for visit #1. After signing&#xD;
      informed consent, the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed again. Clinical history&#xD;
      and physical exam will be charted from the last clinical note. Subjects will fill the AUDIT&#xD;
      C, a screening questionnaire for alcohol consumption. Vitals signs (that is, seated and&#xD;
      standing blood pressure and heart rate, ambient air pulse saturation of oxygen, weight,&#xD;
      height, and neck and waist circumferences). Blood samples for sodium, potassium, creatinine,&#xD;
      cell blood count (CBC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),&#xD;
      triglycerides, glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c (table 1) and micro ribonucleic acid (micro&#xD;
      RNA) will also be drawn during visit #1. Female participants at reproductive age will be&#xD;
      asked to provide urine sample for pregnancy test. Unstimulated saliva will be collected from&#xD;
      the participants by asking them to spit into a collection tube. Supplies for stool collection&#xD;
      with instructions for sample return will be provided for assessment of baseline fecal&#xD;
      microbiome testing. Stools samples should be returned to the research center before VLCD&#xD;
      initiation. The participant will also meet the research manager for education about the VLCD&#xD;
      and physical activity interventions during visit #1. The research manager will dispense&#xD;
      2-week worth of Optifast® replacement meals, a Fitbit® device and a wireless scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #2: At the end of week #3, the participant will return to the UIHC Clinical Research&#xD;
      Unit, when vital signs will be assessed and blood samples for laboratory tests will be drawn&#xD;
      (table 1). On visit #2, sodium, potassium and creatinine will be assessed. Participants will&#xD;
      complete of an adverse event questionnaire. Very low-calorie diets will be dispensed at visit&#xD;
      #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #3: At the end of week #5, the participant will return to the UIHC Clinical Research&#xD;
      Unit, when vital signs will be assessed and blood samples for laboratory tests will be drawn&#xD;
      (table 1). On visit #3, sodium, potassium, creatinine, ALT, AST, and uric acid will be&#xD;
      assessed. Participants will complete of an adverse event questionnaire. Very low-calorie&#xD;
      diets will be dispensed at visit #3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #4 (closing visit): At the end of week #9, the participant will return to the UIHC&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit for visit #4. Subjects will fast 12 hours for visit #4 when saliva and&#xD;
      blood samples for sodium, potassium, creatinine, CBC, ALT, AST, triglycerides, glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, A1c (table 1) and miR will be collected. The participant will be instructed to bring&#xD;
      a stool sample for microbiome analysis using collection supplies dispensed beforehand. The&#xD;
      post-VLCD elastography will be performed during the final visit. Participants will complete&#xD;
      of an adverse event questionnaire. The participant will also meet the research manager and&#xD;
      receive education about transitioning from VLCD to a low calorie, low fat diet during the&#xD;
      closure visit. The participants will be instructed to weight themselves weekly after the VLCD&#xD;
      intervention. The research manager will contact the participant by telephone or video-call to&#xD;
      assess adherence to low calorie, low fat diet and to review the weight trajectory 1 and 2&#xD;
      months after termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone and/or video-call contacts: Between visits #1 and #4, the research manager will&#xD;
      contact the participant by telephone or video-call on a weekly basis for diet and physical&#xD;
      activity compliance, and assessment of adherence, response and adverse events of VLCD for 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very low-calorie diet treatment: The VLCD program will last 8 weeks and then will be followed&#xD;
      by a gradual re-introduction of food through the next 2 months. The only sources of nutrition&#xD;
      during this phase are the Optifast® products providing up to 800 kcal per day. Two liters&#xD;
      (67.63 fl oz) of water should also be consumed each day. Participants will receive Optifast®&#xD;
      replacement meals at no cost. The replacement meals will be dispensed at the UIHC Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit on weeks #1, #2, and #4. Participants will be instructed to use 5 replacement&#xD;
      meals per day (800 kcal total) with 40% of calories as protein, 40% as carbohydrate, and 20%&#xD;
      as fat (Ard, Lewis et al. 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise intervention: Participants will be provided a Fitbit® activity monitor (Inspire 2®)&#xD;
      to wear on the wrist each day throughout the 8-week VLCD intervention. Participants will also&#xD;
      receive access to the Fitbit® mobile app. Participants will be encouraged to wear their&#xD;
      Fitbit® 24 hours/day for a 7-day period (baseline). Participants will then connect with a&#xD;
      health coach via Zoom®. During this conversation, participants will: 1) establish a daily&#xD;
      walking goal with the intent of meeting the physical activity guidelines (150 minutes/week of&#xD;
      moderate intensity physical activity); 2) identify and problem solve barriers that are&#xD;
      preventing them from being active; 3) establish an action plan for meeting their walking&#xD;
      goal. Participants will be encouraged to self-monitor their progress towards their daily&#xD;
      goals by accessing the dashboard on the Fitbit® app each day. Participants will also be&#xD;
      invited to a private social network through the Fitbit® app. In the social group,&#xD;
      participants will receive educational/motivational on the benefits of physical activity and&#xD;
      tips for becoming more active. Finally, participants will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      regular walking games and challenges through the Fitbit® app to help them meet their walking&#xD;
      goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will objectively measure physical activity (steps, time spent engaged in&#xD;
      sedentary, light-intensity, moderate-intensity, and vigorous-intensity activity) on a daily&#xD;
      frequency. The Fitbit® Inspire 2® is a small tri-axial accelerometer-based activity monitor.&#xD;
      Fitbits® have been demonstrated as an accurate measure of daily steps (overall mean error =&#xD;
      -9%), time spent sedentary (overall mean error = &lt;10%), energy expenditure (overall mean&#xD;
      error = +4%) in free living conditions when compared to accelerometers which are considered&#xD;
      gold standard field measures of physical activity. The investigators will track user's daily&#xD;
      physical activity throughout the 8 weeks through the Fitbit® website. Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to wear the Fitbit® monitor 24 hours/day throughout the 8-week intervention&#xD;
      including sleep time. Participants should remove the monitor only to charge it and during&#xD;
      swimming/bathing when the monitor will be submerged in water. Participants will need to&#xD;
      create a Fitbit® profile and share their user name and password with the research team so&#xD;
      that the investigators can download their physical activity data through the Fitbit® website.&#xD;
      Compliance with the intervention (days met walking goal) will also be measured with the&#xD;
      Fitbit® activity monitor.&#xD;
