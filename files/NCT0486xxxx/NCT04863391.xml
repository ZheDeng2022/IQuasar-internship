  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate a system for the automated early detection of Age-Related&#xD;
      Macular Degeneration (AMD). AMD is a condition in which there is breakdown of the macula of&#xD;
      the eye, the part of the retina that is responsible for sharp, central vision. We will take&#xD;
      pictures of subjects' eyes using an automated camera. These photographs will be securely&#xD;
      transmitted and and then analyzed by a computer program which has been developed in other&#xD;
      studies. The outcome of the computer program analysis will be compared with human analysis of&#xD;
      these same pictures. If the computer analysis is has good enough accuracy, then this computer&#xD;
      system could be used for wide-scale screening for AMD.&#xD;

      iPredict,an AI and telemedicine based software which used individual's color fundus image for&#xD;
      early diagnosis of AMD and predict if an individual is at risk of progression to late AMD.&#xD;
      iPredict platform integrates the server-side programs (the image analysis and deep-learning&#xD;
      modules for AMD severity screening and prediction) and local remote computer/mobile devices&#xD;
      (for collecting patient data and images). DRS plus camera will be used in the doctor's&#xD;
      office. The remote devices will upload images and data to the server to analyze and screen&#xD;
      AMD automatically. The telemedicine platform has been developed for web-based platform. The&#xD;
      automatic analysis will be performed on the server, and a report will be sent to the&#xD;
      patient/remote devices with an individual's AMD stage as referable or non-referable AMD, and&#xD;
      a risk prediction score of developing late AMD (within a minute), and further recommendations&#xD;
      to visit a nearby ophthalmologist.&#xD;

    <description>Using the gold standard (i.e., the ophthalmologist's grading), the sensitivity and specificity are calculated as: Sens=TP/(TP+FN) Spec=TN/(TN+FP) Where TP is the number of true positives (referable AMD subjects correctly classified), FN is the number of false negatives (referable AMD subjects incorrectly classified as non-referable), TN is the number of true negatives (non-referable subjects correctly classified), and FP is the number of false positives (non-referable AMD subjects incorrectly classified as referable AMD).</description>
