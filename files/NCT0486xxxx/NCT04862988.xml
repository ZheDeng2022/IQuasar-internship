    <textblock>
      The GPAQ questionnaire is used to measure the physical activity. In this study, Investigators&#xD;
      will observe the reliability and validity of global physical activity questionnaire in Urdu&#xD;
      language in Pakistan among students to assess physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of study is to translate and culturally adapt Global physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
      (GPAQ) into Urdu language and secondly to investigate the reliability and validity of GPAQ in&#xD;
      Pakistan among university students. This study will be cross sectional survey study in which&#xD;
      convenience sampling technique will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of study will help to know the validity and reliability of GPAQ in Urdu version&#xD;
      among students in Pakistan. The reliability of the questionnaire will be checked through&#xD;
      internal consistency and test-retest methods. Internal consistency will be analyzed with&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha value. Test-retest reliability will be assessed using an intra-class&#xD;
      correlation coefficient with 100 patients&#xD;

    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>A measuring instrument to evaluate the duration of vigorous and moderate physical activities that are performed in daily living routine. Each object has a specific code starting from P1 to P16 and then activity is calculated in MET value. For Work and Recreational domains, Moderate MET value is 4.0 and Vigorous MET value is 8.0 while for Transport domains MET value is 4.0</description>
