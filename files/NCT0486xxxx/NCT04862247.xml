  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect preliminary data on the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of the randomization of two relapse-prevention treatment conditions after discharge from&#xD;
      intensive eating disorder (ED) treatment: an imaginal exposure therapy and a writing and&#xD;
      thinking intervention. The second aim to test for (a) differences between the two treatments&#xD;
      for the prevention of relapse and (b) preliminary change on clinical ED outcomes (e.g., ED&#xD;
      symptoms, fears). The investigators further aim to examine the two treatments target fear&#xD;
      extinction and if fear extinction is associated with ED outcomes. The investigators also plan&#xD;
      to test if baseline differences in fear conditioning relate to change in ED outcomes across&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Rate of Eating Disorder Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>6-Month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>First, the investigators will define relapse as moving from one stage of remission to another (e.g., remission to partial remission or partial remission to currently ill). Second, the investigators will define relapse as re-entry into a more intensive treatment setting (e.g., moving from outpatient to partial hospitalization).</description>

    <measure>Change in Eating Disorder Symptoms using the EDE-Q</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6-Month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ), a self-reported measure, is assessed at multiple time points throughout the duration of the study and is used to examine the attitudes and behaviors in individuals with eating disorder symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Re-admission Percentage</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month Follow Up and 6 Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Treatment Interview, we will assess all current and past treatment experiences, dates of treatment, and primary type of treatment. Re-admission will be assessed at follow up timepoints and defined as re-entry into a more intensive treatment setting.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment Session 1 through 5</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Units of Distress(SUDS) is a valid and reliable behavioral measure of state anxiety used during each treatment session to measure anxiety and distress and will be collected before, during, and after each session. Additionally, the Brief State Anxiety Measure is a 6-item measure with acceptable reliability and validity and sensitivity to fluctuations in state anxiety levels and will be collected at the beginning and end of each session.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State Fear of Food</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment Session 2 through 5</time_frame>
    <description>State Fear of Food Measure will be used to assess food anxiety, food avoidance, and feared concerns and will be collected at the beginning and end of each session.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment Session 2 through 5</time_frame>
    <description>State Positive and Negative Affect Schedule will be used to assess positive and negative affect at the beginning and end of each session.</description>

    <measure>Change in Eating Disorder Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment Session 2 through 5</time_frame>
    <description>Eating Disorder-15 is a 15-item measure of eating disorder cognitions and behaviors, which will be collected at the beginning of each treatment session.</description>
