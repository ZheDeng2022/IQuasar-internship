      This study is divided into two stages: the first stage is a dose verification trial, with a&#xD;
      multicenter, open, single arm trial design, which is planned to enroll 10 children with&#xD;
      general anesthesia surgery (all using HR020602 injection); the second stage is designed as a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel control trial with positive drugs, which is&#xD;
      planned to include 20 children with general anesthesia surgery in the test group and 20&#xD;
      children in the control group. There should be at least 15 patients in each of [2,12] and&#xD;
      [12,18）age groups.&#xD;
