    <intervention_name>BIOTRONIK ICDs with DX Technology</intervention_name>
    <description>The BIOTRONIK DX system offers a single chamber ICD that enables sensing of atrial signals through floating atrial dipoles, using a single ventricular lead. This technology enables enhanced arrhythmia diagnosis based on atrial and ventricular electrograms and, in addition, early diagnosis and automatic transmission of AF and heart failure (HF) diagnostic data. The DX technology provides several features in a single chamber device that are usually only found in dual chamber devices, including atrial diagnostics and SVT discrimination - early detection of SAF, increased diagnostics accuracy, dual-chamber discrimination. Nevertheless, the benefits of a single chamber device are preserved: reduced lead complications, reduced procedure complexity, elimination of costs for atrial lead. The DX system also integrates with BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring, allowing physicians to remotely follow their patients' clinical and device statuses with daily updates.</description>
