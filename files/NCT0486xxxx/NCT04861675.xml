      evaluation of the impact of dental treatment under GA on oral health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (OHRQoL) in children with SHCN with severe dental caries with Assessment in change in oral&#xD;
      health status and the impact on children's weight (Wt), height (Ht), Body Mass Index (BMI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of clinical dental examinations performed at the time of DGA and at the&#xD;
      six-month recall, along with OHRQoL questionnaires and data drawn from the patients' files.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. OHRQoL will be assessed with the early childhood oral health impact scale (ECHOIS) that&#xD;
           is composed of items which assess the effect of oral health condition on different&#xD;
           aspects of life of the patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children with Mental special health care needs will be recruited from G.A unit in&#xD;
           department of pediatric dentistry , faculty of oral and dental medicine cairo&#xD;
           university.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data will be collected for each of the study participants included age, gender ,Medical&#xD;
           (type of disability and history of disability) , dental histories and clinical findings&#xD;
           were correlated accordingly together with determining the type of disability,&#xD;
           anthropometric measures (HT, WT,BMI) that will be measured at baseline and after 3 to 6&#xD;
           months from dental treatment under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The parent or the care giver will be taken as a surrogate measure that will&#xD;
           self-complete (ECOHIS) Before and after treatment with follow up after 3 &amp; 6 months to&#xD;
           assess and evaluate children's OHRQoL and anthropometric measures update.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Each GA session included a comprehensive clinical dental examination and full dental&#xD;
           rehabilitation. The Silness-Loe plaque index (PI) was used to assess oral hygiene&#xD;
           status. That was measured in the four levels of distal facial, mesial-facial, facial,&#xD;
           and lingual of first molars, first premolar and central in each quadrant using mirror&#xD;
           and probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The plaque index was obtained by adding the figures of the four above-mentioned areas of&#xD;
           each teeth and dividing it by 4 before recording it in the examination form&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Parents/ caregiver will be asked to consider the last 6 months when responding the&#xD;
           questions After ttt , Examine effect of oral rehabilitation under GA and its effect on&#xD;
           improving quality of life ( pain , eating problems, sleeping problems ,growth parameters&#xD;
           as (Wt, Ht, BMI) and any postoperative complications as postoperative pain and pharynx&#xD;
           discomfort or fever&#xD;
