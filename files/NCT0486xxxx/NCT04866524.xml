  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the physical, mental and motor development of babies born from pregnancy using&#xD;
      ICSI technique and and conventional IVF in non-male factor infertile couples. Based on our&#xD;
      previous RCT (NCT03428919), the non-male factor couples were randomly assigned to IVF or&#xD;
      ICSI, which leads to the similarity in characteristics of these two groups. Hence, the result&#xD;
      of analyzing these offsprings would be preciously valuable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) indications have been&#xD;
      extended and routinely applied to all cases of assisted reproductive techniques: unexplained&#xD;
      infertility, poor-quality oocytes, low oocyte yeild, advanced marternal age, prior failed&#xD;
      fertilization with conventional insemination, after in-vitro maturation of oocytes and for&#xD;
      cases of cryopreserved oocytes (Practice Committees of the American Society for Reproductive&#xD;
      Medicine, 2020). In 2004, fertilization using ICSI accounted for nearly 60% of all&#xD;
      aspirations globally. In the Middle East, the number of ICSI cycles increased rapidly from&#xD;
      2000 (47.6%) to 2007 (65.2%), and reached 97.8% in the Middle East in 2007 (Ishihara et al,&#xD;
      2015). Another survey recorded in Europe in 2011, out of a total of 437,510 cycles of fresh&#xD;
      embryo transfer, 68% of cycles were performed using ICSI techniques. In male infertility&#xD;
      cases, the rate of implementation of ICSI increased from 76.3% to 93.3%. In particular, in&#xD;
      cases of non-male-factor infertility, the incidence of ICSI also increased from 15.4% to&#xD;
      66.9%. From 2008-2012, of 494 907 treatment cycles, 74.6% used ICSI. In which, ICSI accounts&#xD;
      for 92.9% of the cycle of male infertility and 64.5% of the cycle of non-male-factor&#xD;
      infertility (Boulet, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, ICSI is an invasive technique that bypasses the natural barriers of fertilization.&#xD;
      This has led to concern about an increase in the incidence of anomalies in ICSI-born babies&#xD;
      as this technique is increasingly being used in all cases of contraception. In contrast,&#xD;
      there are studies that have also compared IVF with ICSI and show that in the ICSI cycle, the&#xD;
      incidence of multiple pregnancies and low birth weight infants is lower than that of IVF,&#xD;
      although there is no difference in infant survival between the two groups (Boulet et al,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the short-term outcomes, the investigators also have to consider the long-term&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal outcomes. There is still not much evidence comparing the effects of the&#xD;
      above methods, if any, on the psychomotor development in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators decide to conduct a study to compare the physical, mental and&#xD;
      motor development of babies born from pregnancy using ICSI technique and and conventional IVF&#xD;
      in non-male factor infertile couples.&#xD;
