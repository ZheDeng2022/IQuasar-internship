  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a part of a project on perinatal clinical pharmacology, the primary aim of the present&#xD;
      project is to study amikacin pharmacokinetics (PK) and physiology in asphyxiated neonates&#xD;
      treated with therapeutic hypothermia and to provide amikacin dosing recommendations, which&#xD;
      will be validated prospectively. For this purpose, we aim to first collect retrospective data&#xD;
      on amikacin available in neonates treated with hypothermia in the neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit (NICU)s in Leuven and Amsterdam, and consequently to propose the dosing regimen to be&#xD;
      used in the prospective amikacin PK study at our NICU in University Clinical Center (UCC)&#xD;
      Sarajevo. At our NICU we aim to collect amikacin PK observations and other covariates in at&#xD;
      least 40 neonates while treated with hypothermia and after re-warming period (a paired&#xD;
      analysis), and in asphyxiated neonates not treated with hypothermia (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hereby will use a stepwise approach, as initially used to develop and to validate an&#xD;
      amikacin dosing regimen in preterm and term neonates (De Cock RFW et al., 2012, Smits A et&#xD;
      al, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3-step approach will be used, of which different parts will be conducted in different&#xD;
      contributing hospitals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retrospective evaluation of amikacin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in asphyxiated&#xD;
           neonates treated with hypothermia (University hospital Leuven, VUmc Amsterdam)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development of population PK model derived amikacin dosing recommendation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prospective PK study with validation of the new dosing regimen (UCC Sarajevo, UCC Tuzla)&#xD;

      Step 1: Retrospective evaluation of amikacin TDM in asphyxiated neonates treated with&#xD;
      hypothermia (University hospital Leuven, VUmc Amsterdam)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Study patients All neonates admitted to the NICUs of the VUmc Amsterdam and University&#xD;
      hospital Leuven who underwent treatment with hypothermia for perinatal asphyxia and who&#xD;
      received amikacin during routine care were considered for inclusion in this retrospective&#xD;
      analysis if TDM observations were available. Patients hospitalized between January 2010 and&#xD;
      December 2015 were eligible for inclusion. Neonates already included in the Pharmacool trial&#xD;
      (de Haan et al BMC Pediatrics 2012), were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics at birth [gestational age (GA, weeks), birth bodyweight (grams),&#xD;
      Apgar score at 1, 5 and 10 minutes after birth, as well as characteristics at the moment of&#xD;
      amikacin TDM [postmenstrual age (PMA, weeks), postnatal age (PNA, days), current bodyweight&#xD;
      (grams), concurrent ibuprofen (yes/no) or inotropic drugs (yes/no), respiratory support (i.e.&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation, yes/no), mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation (conventional or high-frequency, yes/no) were retrospectively extracted from the&#xD;
      patient files. Additionally, blood culture results at the start of amikacin therapy were&#xD;
      collected from the individual laboratory reports. The daily nursing progress reports were&#xD;
      used to collect amikacin prescription (dose and interval) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Amikacin dosing regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  University hospital Leuven: Up to July 2011, amikacin dosing was based on Langendries JP&#xD;
           et al, 1998. Since July 2011, the simplified model-based dosing regimen published by De&#xD;
           Cock RFM et al, 2012) was used. Since July 2014, an adapted dosing regimen based on&#xD;
           prospective validation is applied (Smits A et al, 2015). In both regimens, the dosing&#xD;
           interval was prolonged with 10 hours when ibuprofen was co-administered or when asphyxia&#xD;
           was diagnosed/considered by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vumc Amsterdam: Up to 24 March 2015 amikacin dosing was 12 mg/kg/dose. Interval (24&#xD;
           hours or 36 hours) was determined based on TDM value and subsequent clearance&#xD;
           calculation (see below). From 24 March 2015 amikacin dosing was 15 mg/kg/dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Drug administration and TDM sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  University hospital Leuven: amikacine (Bristol-Myers Squibb) is administered&#xD;
           intravenously over 20 minutes. As part of routine clinical care, blood samples for&#xD;
           amikacin TDM are collected just before (trough) administration of the second dose. In a&#xD;
           case of unexpected results or after dosing adaptation, additional TDM samples are&#xD;
           collected, based on the decision of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vumc: Amikacine (Bristol-Meyers Squib, and recently amikacine Hospira) is administered&#xD;
           intravenously over 60 minutes. As part of routine clinical care, the first amikacin TDM&#xD;
           sample is taken at least 6 h - but preferably 12-18 h - after the first amikacin&#xD;
           administration. This blood sampling is preferably performed during fixed moments at the&#xD;
           neonatal department. Based on the amikacin dosing and TDM plasma concentration of the&#xD;
           patient, a dosing adaptation is suggested by the pharmacy department, according to the&#xD;
           maximum a posteriori Bayesian fitting method, using the MW/Pharm computer program&#xD;
           version 3.6 (Mediware, Groningen, the Netherlands). This approach allows variability in&#xD;
           TDM sampling time, between and within patients. The predicted target trough level is &lt; 5&#xD;
           mg/L (http://tdm-monografie.org/monografie/amikacine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Amikacin assay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  University hospital Leuven: Until 31 May 2012, amikacin concentrations were measured&#xD;
           with fluorescence polarization immunoassay (Abbott TDx kit, Abbott Laboratories,&#xD;
           Diagnostics Division, Abbott Park, IL, USA). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ)&#xD;
           was 0.8 mg/L. The coefficient of variation (CV) was &lt; 5% (assessed at 5, 15, and&#xD;
           30mg/L). From 31 May 2012, amikacin quantification was based on a kinetic interaction of&#xD;
           microparticles in solution (KIMS) immunoassay (Roche/Hitachi Cobas c systems, Roche&#xD;
           Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Also in this essay, the LLOQ was 0.8 mg/L. The CV&#xD;
           was &lt; 4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vumc: Until September 2011, amikacin plasma concentrations were measured with&#xD;
           fluorescence polarization immunoassay (Abbott TDx-FLx, Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park,&#xD;
           IL, USA). The LLOQ was 0.8 mg/L. The CV was &lt; 5% (assessed at 5, 15 and 30m g/L). From&#xD;
           September 2011, amikacin quantification was based on a particle-enhanced turbidimetric&#xD;
           inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) (ARCHITECT cSystems, Abbott, Abbott Laboratories Inc,&#xD;
           Abbott Park, IL, USA). The limit of quantification for this amikacin assay was 2.0&#xD;
           µg/mL. The coefficient of variation was &lt; 4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Pharmacokinetic analysis The retrospectively collected amikacin TDM values of University&#xD;
      hospital Leuven and VUmc Amsterdam will be added to a previously collected dataset of&#xD;
      (near)term neonates receiving amikacin but not underwent hypothermia treatment (Smits A et&#xD;
      al, 2015). All data will be implemented in the previously developed amikacin population PK&#xD;
      model (De Cock R et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Development of population PK model derived amikacin dosing recommendation Since a&#xD;
      relevant number of neonates treated with hypothermia will be included, we hereby aim to&#xD;
      compare pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, CL, volume of distribution, Vd) of this&#xD;
      subgroup of neonates with those of term cases not treated with hypothermia (Smits A et al,&#xD;
      2015). Subsequently, we aim to derive an appropriate model-based dosing regimen to be&#xD;
      considered during hypothermia in (near) term cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3. Prospective PK study with validation of the new dosing regimen (UCC Sarajevo and UCC&#xD;
      Tuzla)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational cohort study conducted in NICU with the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to collect amikacin PK observations, renal elimination characteristics and other&#xD;
           covariates in at least 40 asphyxiated neonates while treated with hypothermia and after&#xD;
           the re-warming period (a paired analysis) (UCC Sarajevo) and in 40 asphyxiated neonates&#xD;
           treated with amikacin but not treated with hypothermia (control group, UCC Tuzla)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  validation of the new dosing regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this prospective study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate amikacin pharmacodynamics (PD) characteristics (minimal inhibitory&#xD;
           concentration, MIC90)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to document the adverse effects of hypothermia (UCC Sarajevo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Study patients Asphyxiated neonates routinely treated with IV amikacin and therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia (NICU UCC Sarajevo) and asphyxiated neonates treated with IV amikacin but not&#xD;
      treated with hypothermia (control group, NICU UCC Tuzla) will be included in the study after&#xD;
      parental informed written consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Amikacin dosing regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amikacin dosing regimen that is routinely used in our unit is based on NeoFax® (2009&#xD;
      version) and depends on PMA as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • PMA of equal or more than 35 weeks, 15 mg/kg/24 h with an additional dosing interval&#xD;
      increase of 6 h for all ages if ibuprofen was co-administered or in the setting of perinatal&#xD;
      asphyxia The dosing regimen (current dosing interval +12 h, 15 mg/kg/36h) derived from&#xD;
      asphyxiated neonates treated with hypothermia in Leuven and Amsterdam (step 1-2) will be used&#xD;
      in the prospective part of this study (step 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Drug administration and blood sampling Amikacin (Likacin®; 500 mg/2mL vial; Lisapharma&#xD;
      S.p.A., Erba, Italy) is given to the neonate, as an IV infusion via umbilical vein over 20&#xD;
      min by use of a syringe-pump (Braun; B. Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem, PA USA). Infusion is&#xD;
      followed by slow 0.5 mL Sodium chloride 0.9% flush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of samples will be obtained to the current clinical and nursing standard&#xD;
      procedures at both NICUs. Blood samples for amikacin TDM and corresponding creatinine&#xD;
      concentrations will be collected by venous line via umbilical catheter while collecting the&#xD;
      sample for other laboratory findings according to the protocol, 6 minutes before (&quot;trough&quot;,&#xD;
      the Ctrough) the second, third, fourth and fifth dose of amikacin, than 1h after the&#xD;
      initiation of administration (&quot;near peak&quot;, the maximal concentration, Cmax) of the second,&#xD;
      third and fourth dose of amikacin, approximately 40 min after the 20-min IV infusion&#xD;
      (Allegaert K, 2004; Langhendries JP, 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (&lt;0.5 mL) will be collected in heparinized tubes. The recommendations for the&#xD;
      maximum predefined total amount of blood available for research purposes in a single neonate&#xD;
      is 1.0 mL/kg and will be respected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be centrifuged immediately after collection and subsequently stored at&#xD;
      -80°C until analysis. Paired amikacin and creatinine concentrations will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Amikacin and creatinine assays Amikacin serum will be determined based on a&#xD;
      particle-enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) (ARCHITECT cSystems, Abbott,&#xD;
      Abbott Laboratories Inc, Abbott Park, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma/serum creatinin concentration will be quantified either by using the &quot;Jaffa method&quot; in&#xD;
      Sarajevo or by using the &quot;corrected Jaffa method&quot; in Tuzla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIC90 for amikacin will be determined in each Sarajevo and Tuzla NICU before the dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 Pharmacokinetic analysis A compartmental pharmacokinetics approach will be performed at&#xD;
      the Department of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical faculty,&#xD;
      University of Sarajevo, B&amp;H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population pharmacokinetics approach, comparing the data on PK already reported in&#xD;
      neonates will be performed at Leiden Academic Centre for drug research, Leiden University,&#xD;
      The Netherlands.&#xD;
