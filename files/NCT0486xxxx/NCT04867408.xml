  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To develop and train a Convolutional Neural Network to detect and characterize disease&#xD;
      severity in inflammatory bowel disease during endoscopy. This initiative will inevitably&#xD;
      establish a high-quality large image database. Our secondary study aims are therefore to use&#xD;
      the images we collect to advance the field of deep learning and computer aided diagnosis in&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease by establishing an image database. This will involve developing a&#xD;
      framework combining deep learning and computer vision algorithms. The ultimate aim is to use&#xD;
      the image database to produce high impact research outcomes and training resources leading to&#xD;
      an improvement in the quality of endoscopy performed, reduce inter-observer variability in&#xD;
      disease assessment and a reduction in missed bowel cancer rates and associated mortality.&#xD;
