  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Philips 3T imager installed on the Pavillon Baudot site is an imager dedicated solely to&#xD;
      research. It is not located in hospital premises but in INSERM premises for which an&#xD;
      authorization for biomedical research has been granted. This equipment is part of the&#xD;
      Technical Platform of the UMR 1214 ToNIC whose main objective is the study of the human brain&#xD;
      and the main pathologies that affect it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is an evolving technique, which is used in many research projects. Our technical platform&#xD;
      must follow these developments and remain at the cutting edge. One of the essential services&#xD;
      of our technical platform is to help set up research protocols and validate acquisition&#xD;
      sequences. This development activity is therefore located upstream of research projects&#xD;
      involving clinical or fundamental applications. The fact that we can provide our users with a&#xD;
      regulatory framework to carry out these development tests for their Research Involving Human&#xD;
      Subjects project is a necessity for our research support activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide a generic framework to test the feasibility of MRI sequences&#xD;
      requested within the framework of protocols, but also to optimize MRI acquisition sequences&#xD;
      already in place, to improve image quality and reduce artifacts that can degrade the quality&#xD;
      of the images obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, there are just over 35 centers with MRI dedicated to research and therefore with a&#xD;
      validation protocol allowing them to validate their sequences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective monocentric research on major participants (healthy and patients). The&#xD;
      optimization of the sequences will be carried out in an incremental way from one control to&#xD;
      the other: for each control, several sequences will be carried out for an acquisition time&#xD;
      not exceeding one hour of cumulated acquisition (i.e. one hour and a half including the&#xD;
      installation and the delays between the sequences). Each sequence lasts between 5 and 20&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the examination, the images obtained will be evaluated jointly by an expert&#xD;
      neuroradiologist and a research engineer specialized in image analysis according to the&#xD;
      criteria mentioned above. This analysis will make it possible to determine the parameters to&#xD;
      be modified to improve image quality and to define the acquisition parameters for the next&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as a sequence is considered optimal, it will be tested on a small number of healthy&#xD;
      controls (≈ 5) to ensure interindividual reproducibility of image quality parameters, and&#xD;
      then if necessary in the presence of pathology in a few patients (≈ 5).&#xD;
