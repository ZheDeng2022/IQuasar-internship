    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blinded, group-sequential,&#xD;
      parallel-group, adaptive design, phase 3 study to demonstrate the haemostatic efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, OCTAPLEX, in patients with acute major&#xD;
      bleeding on DOAC therapy with factor Xa inhibitor. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either&#xD;
      of two study groups: low-dose vs. high-dose OCTAPLEX.&#xD;

             PCC (aPCC), recombinant factor VIIa, or recombinant factor Xa inactivated-zhzo&#xD;
             (andexanet alfa), for the current bleeding event prior to enrolment (antifibrinolytic&#xD;
             drugs and local haemostatic agents are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received clopidogrel within 5 days or prasugrel within 7 days or&#xD;
             ticagrelor within the 48 hours preceding the bleeding event&#xD;
