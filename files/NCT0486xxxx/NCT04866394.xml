  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced technology has enabled radiation oncologists to more accurately and precisely target&#xD;
      radiation to areas at risk while maximally sparing healthy tissue. A secondary result of&#xD;
      these technologic advances has been the increased utilization of hypofractionationed&#xD;
      treatment protocols, since the combined ability to better visualize and precisely deliver&#xD;
      radiation to target volumes has allowed radiation oncologists to leverage the therapeutic&#xD;
      ratio toward higher target doses whilst maintaining safe doses to the pertinent&#xD;
      organs-at-risk. The spectrum of hypofractionation ranges from what are considered moderate&#xD;
      (ie. 2- 5 Gy / fraction) into the realm of what is more commonly referred to as stereotactic&#xD;
      body (SBRT), generally &gt;5 Gy / fraction. There is growing evidence demonstrating both safety&#xD;
      and efficacy for SBRT. The investigators propose that these advantages are translatable to&#xD;
      the adjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators submit that a prescription dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions. Through precision&#xD;
      delivery and careful dosimetry the treatment should be safe and well tolerated with minimal&#xD;
      impact on patient quality of life.&#xD;
