  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose optimisation study in healthy adults aged 18-30 who will be experimentally&#xD;
      inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to cause PCR-confirmed upper respiratory infection in&#xD;
      the majority of challenged individuals with minimal or no illness, providing data on the&#xD;
      course of COVID-19 and the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This will establish an&#xD;
      optimised dose and study design that will then be used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment&#xD;
      and vaccine candidates plus level and duration of immune protection in follow-on trials.&#xD;

             inoculation (unless using a contraceptive method that suppressed menstruation as&#xD;
             indicated in the study protocol) and willing and able to use contraception as&#xD;
             described in the study protocol from 2 weeks before the scheduled date of viral&#xD;
             challenge until 90 days after receipt of the final dose of rescue medication. Negative&#xD;
             urine pregnancy tests will be required at screening and on day 0 prior to inoculation.&#xD;
             On admission to the quarantine unit a Negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             (β-hCG) is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraceptive requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Established use of hormonal methods of contraception described below (for 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
        the first study visit). When hormonal methods of contraception are used, male partners are&#xD;
        required to use a condom with a spermicide:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
             inhibition of ovulation: i. oral ii. intravaginal iii. transdermal&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. . progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: i.&#xD;
             oral ii. injectable iii. implantable&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. . Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. . Bilateral tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. . Male sterilisation (with the appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the absence&#xD;
             of sperm in the ejaculate) where the vasectomised male is the sole partner for that&#xD;
             woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. . True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if&#xD;
             defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk&#xD;
             associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be&#xD;
             evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5 Men who are willing to use one of the contraception methods described in the study&#xD;
        protocol, from the time of the date of viral challenge, until 90 days after receipt of the&#xD;
        final dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraceptive requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use a condom with a spermicide to prevent pregnancy in a female partner or to prevent&#xD;
             exposure of any partner (male and female) to the study virus or Remdesivir.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male sterilisation with the appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the absence of&#xD;
             sperm in the ejaculate (please note that the use of condom with spermicide will still&#xD;
             be required to prevent partner exposure). This applies only to males participating in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In addition, for female partners of child bearing potential, that partner must use&#xD;
             another form of contraception such as one of the highly effective methods mentioned&#xD;
             above for female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if&#xD;
             defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk&#xD;
             associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be&#xD;
             evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In addition to the contraceptive requirements above, male subjects must agree not to&#xD;
             donate sperm following discharge from quarantine until 90 days after the date of study&#xD;
             virus or Remdesivir. (whichever occurs last).&#xD;

&#xD;
             7 Subjects will have a documented medical history either prior to entering the study&#xD;
             and/or following medical history review with the study physician at screening 8 Using&#xD;
