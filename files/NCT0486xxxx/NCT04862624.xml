  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in help seeking intention and action</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in help seeking intentions will be assessed by the number of participants who expressed interest in, expressed intentions to take action, or reported actually taking help-seeking action (used a resource, called a clinic, made an appointment with a mental health professional, signed up for a support group, or actually attended a group or 1:1 mental health session).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change attitudes towards seeking psychological services.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in individuals' attitudes with respect to seeking psychological services will be assessed with the Inventory of Attitudes toward Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMAS). It is a 24 item scale that measures psychological openness to seeking mental health services, help seeking propensity (ability and motivation to seek help), and indifference to stigma (a person's lack of concern of what others might think of their attitude toward seeking professional help). Total scores range from 0 to 96, and higher scores indicate more positive attitudes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attitudes in mental help seeking.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in attitudes about seeking help from a mental health professional will be assessed with the Mental Help Seeking Attitudes Scale (MHSAS) which is a 9-item instrument designed to measure respondents' overall evaluation (unfavorable vs. favorable) of their seeking help from a mental health professional if they found themselves to be dealing with a mental health concern. Total scale scores range from 0 to 63, and higher scores indicate more positive attitudes toward seeking help.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Anxiety will be assessed by the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7) which is a self-report screening and severity measure for generalized anxiety disorder. The seven items correspond to symptoms of anxiety and are summed for a range from 0-21; a score of 10-14 indicates moderate anxiety and scores at or above 15 indicate severe anxiety</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Depression will be assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) which is a self-report assessment of depression. It has been established as a valid diagnostic and severity measure. The eight items correspond to symptom-based diagnostic criteria in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV and are summed for a range from 0-24; a score of 10-14 indicates moderate depression and scores at or above 15 indicate severe depression.</description>
