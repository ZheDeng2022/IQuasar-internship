  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyze Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the breath of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and&#xD;
      controls in SARS-CoV-2 breath specimens.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective cohort study, which enrol patients presenting to hospital and are&#xD;
      tested for SARS-CoV-2. There will be two cohorts, COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative,&#xD;
      who will have exhaled breath collection and analysis by infrared spectroscopy to characterize&#xD;
      the composition of VOCs and identify differences in VOC profiles between the two groups.&#xD;
