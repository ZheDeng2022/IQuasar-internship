  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The unjust social, economic, and environmental conditions that African Americans face&#xD;
      throughout their lives lead to pervasive health disparities. These disparities are driven by&#xD;
      healthcare differences. They are driven by economic differences. Those with less financial&#xD;
      wealth have poorer health as compared to those with higher socioeconomic status. And yet,&#xD;
      even when controlling for these two important social determinants of health, race still&#xD;
      predicts morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What can account for this? Stress. African Americans experience more stress than their White&#xD;
      peers. The story is even more dire for African American women who simultaneously face both&#xD;
      racial discrimination and sexism. Indeed, gendered racial discrimination is nearly ubiquitous&#xD;
      for Black women at all socioeconomic levels. It is also a distinct form of stress, with&#xD;
      unique outcomes compared to other non-race-or-gender-related stressors. Finally, stress has&#xD;
      clear downstream negative effects on health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is no mobile cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention (m-CBSMi)&#xD;
      designed to help African American women manage racial and nonracial daily stress. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to fill this void. Using proven CBSMi techniques, participants will&#xD;
      learn how to manage their stress through text messages and integrated mobile web content.&#xD;
      Supportive texts will inspire, motivate, and affirm the life experiences of participants.&#xD;
      Educational texts will increase knowledge, develop skills, and reduce barriers to adaptive&#xD;
      coping. A library of individually tailored videos will be delivered to each participant. All&#xD;
      mobile web content will be accessible only through touch-based links embedded within text&#xD;
      messages, making it easy and effortless to view this material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase II the investigators will complete development of the m-CBSMi. Then, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the effectiveness of the m-CBSMi to reduce stress among African&#xD;
      American female participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      intervention condition or to a matched control condition. Secondary measures will assess&#xD;
      coping, well-being, subjective health, gendered racial identity, and knowledge.&#xD;

    <description>All 11 modules will include the following elements: introduction to the topic; two types of assessments (1) adherence to at-home relaxation training practice (following week 2) and (2) 3-5 topic-specific questions to tailor video-based content; a cognitive component; a relaxation component; and a wrap up that includes a brief assessment of module comprehension. Each user will view 5-7 videos per module. Videos will be tailored to user and will last between 2 and 4 minutes. Total time per module will be 20 to 30 minutes. Between modules, users will receive (based on their timing preferences) supportive texts intended to motivate continued engagement or to affirm the life experiences of African American women</description>

    <description>Two mobile courses: Introduction to Stress Management and Techniques for Coping with Stress. Users will be informed that the courses will be completed on their phone, that they are video-based, and that they should spend between 20 and 30 minutes each week, for the next 11 weeks, learning the material. The introductory course defines stress, describes the different sources of stress, and the influence of personality on stress. The coping module includes training in cognitive coping skills, guided imagery, progressive relaxation, autogenic training, and the importance of physical activity to manage stress. All lessons include course assessments. During the intervention period, controls will receive weekly text messages encouraging completion of material.</description>

    <description>Each weekly module will consist of a cognitive component and a relaxation component. The cognitive component during the first 3 weeks will educate users about the Transactional Model of Stress, that discrimination is a type of stressor, and the impact of stress on health. Building on this information, users will then learn how to match coping responses to the changeability of stressors during weeks 4 and 5. The cognitive component will conclude by focusing on the four most common coping strategies used by African American women in response to stress. Modules 2 through 4 will teach progressive muscle relaxation through a series of tension and relaxation cycles. Modules 5 through 8 will train users in diaphragmatic breathing. Finally, users will be trained in three types of mindfulness mediations.</description>
