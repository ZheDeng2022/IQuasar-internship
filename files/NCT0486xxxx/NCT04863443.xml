  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed technique, called &quot;Nonlinear Elasticity Mapping (NEM)&quot;, is an innovative&#xD;
      approach to estimate (i.e., linear and nonlinear) elasticity to provide complementary and&#xD;
      relevant information for identification and characterization of breast masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed technique includes imaging the (nonlinear) elasticity parameter in a&#xD;
      quantitative manner and measuring two new and relevant parameters. These parameters, together&#xD;
      with linear elasticity, are used to differentiate breast masses. The first parameter is the&#xD;
      nonlinearity of the elasticity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Measuring the nonlinearity of elasticity is obtained by recording ultrasound scans of object&#xD;
      under different values of externally applied compression, and processing the resulting data.&#xD;
      The central element of the proposed method is the solution of an inverse problem by which the&#xD;
      linear and nonlinear parameters are estimated and a map of tissue nonlinearity is produced,&#xD;
      in which the malignant masses can be identified. In addition to estimating the elasticity,&#xD;
      will also evaluate the heterogeneity of the (linear) elasticity parameter distribution within&#xD;
      the mass as an indicator of malignancy. In a previously performed pilot study, tested the&#xD;
      proposed method on a small group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to take the next logical step, which is to test this method in a&#xD;
      clinical study on a larger population of patients to obtain statistically meaningful results.&#xD;
      Assuming that the proposed method continues to demonstrate high specificity, this technique&#xD;
      can have a significant impact on breast cancer diagnosis and management.&#xD;
