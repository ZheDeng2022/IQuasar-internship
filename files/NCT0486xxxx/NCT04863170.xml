  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to develop a Spanish version of the Orthognathic Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (OQLQ) that is conceptually equivalent to the original questionnaire, as well&#xD;
      as acceptable, reliable, valid, and responsive for use in Chilean patients with dentofacial&#xD;
      deformities.The cross cultural adaptation process was carried out according to the&#xD;
      recommended standard methodology with direct and back-translation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective longitudinal multicenter study of adult patients diagnosed with dentofacial&#xD;
      deformity was carried out, self-administrating OQLQ, OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile),&#xD;
      and SF-36 (Short Form 36 Health Survey) during the presurgery visit in order to examine&#xD;
      construct validity. To evaluate reproducibility, questionnaires were re-administered 4 weeks&#xD;
      later to subjects with a stable dental condition. Responsiveness was assessed among subjects&#xD;
      followed up until 3 months after surgery and finally changes in health-related quality of&#xD;
      life was assessed comparing baseline pre-surgery to 3 and 6 months post-surgery.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To measure this metric property, internal consistency and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The orthognathic quality of life questionnaire (OQLQ) was applied twice, with four weeks between tests.&#xD;
To assess reliability, the internal consistency was estimated by the Cronbach alpha coefficient, and the test-retest reproducibility was estimated by the intraclass correlation coefficient.&#xD;

    <description>Validity refers to the degree to which the instrument measures what it purports to measure.&#xD;
Construct validity was evaluated analyzing the hypothesized relationships between scores by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients.&#xD;

    <description>Responsiveness refers to an instrument's ability to detect change. To evaluate responsiveness of the orthognathic quality of life questionnaire (OQLQ) we applied twice: first one week before surgery (T1), and then three months after surgery (T2) To evaluate responsiveness, a paired t-test was used to assess the score changes in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. The magnitude of the change was evaluated calculating the standardized response mean.&#xD;

A paired t-test was used to assess the mean (SD) changes in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. The magnitude of the change was evaluated calculating the standardized response mean (SRM).&#xD;
The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a generic health-related quality of life questionnaire 36 ítems in addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.&#xD;
higher scores mean a better outcome</description>
