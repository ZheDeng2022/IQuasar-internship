    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for bladder or bowel resection will receive assessments at three time&#xD;
      points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperatively up to 30 days prior to scheduled surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperatively in hospital up to 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperatively up to 30 days following scheduled surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all time points the subjects will have blood samples drawn for mitochonrial function&#xD;
      analysis and a muscle ultrasound (MuscleSound) performed. In addition, a cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test (CPET or 'VO2 max') will be performed at the 30 day pre/post evaluation time&#xD;
      points.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a measure of the efficiency to use oxygen. One method used&#xD;
      to measure CRF is the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), otherwise known as 'VO2 max'.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that individuals assessed with CPET-derived parameters, such as&#xD;
      VO2 max or anaerobic threshold (AT), below specific thresholds are at greater risk of&#xD;
      post-operative complications, which can occur in up to 40% of surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study wants to determine if other methods of fitness or well-being, such as&#xD;
      mitochondrial oxygen consumption and muscle ultrasound to determine muscle characteristics,&#xD;
      can be combined with CPET assessment to improve the ability to identify surgical patients who&#xD;
      develop postoperative complications, as measured by the validated tool, POMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to create a method to identify the metabolic and mitochondrial&#xD;
      phenotype of the perioperative patient, termed the POM-MP.&#xD;
