      Interventional therapies for Trigeminal Neuralgia are of variable efficacy and safety, and&#xD;
      have different results for different periods of time before the recurrence of symptoms.&#xD;
      Interventional therapy for TN is either destructive with trigeminal nerve sensory function&#xD;
      destroyed intentionally or non-destructive with decompression of the trigeminal nerve and&#xD;
      preservation of its regular function. The most common procedures in treating TN pain are the&#xD;
      use of radiofrequency (RF). the aim of this study is to assess the possible value of motor&#xD;
      index as a prediction of success of radiofrequency lesioning of the Gasserian ganglion during&#xD;
      treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is defined by the International Headache Society (IHS) as&#xD;
      &quot;unilateral disorder characterized by brief electric shock-like pains, abrupt in onset and&#xD;
      termination, and limited to the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal&#xD;
      nerve&quot;. It is considered the worst type of facial pain and described as intense, sharp,&#xD;
      stabbing, and shooting like electric shock pain. It can be triggered by touch, chewing,&#xD;
      laughing, shaving or face wash .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IHS suggests a classification of TN as either classic (essential or idiopathic) TN (CTN)&#xD;
      or symptomatic TN (STN; pain indistinguishable from that of CTN, but caused by a demonstrable&#xD;
      structural lesion other than vascular compression).Treatment of TN is conservative, surgical&#xD;
      or interventional. Pharmacotherapy with carbamazepine is tried early in cases of TN but has&#xD;
      many side effects .Other medications can be used in the treatment of TN, include&#xD;
      oxycarbazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, baclofen, valproate, clonazepam, phenytoin, and&#xD;
      lamotrigime .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most clinically appropriate treatment includes surgical microvascular decompression&#xD;
      (MVD), stereotactic radiation therapy, gamma knife (SGK), percutaneous balloon decompression,&#xD;
      percutaneous glycerol rhizolysis, percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) of the Gasserian ganglion&#xD;
      (GG), and GG stimulation and neuromodulation. Interventional therapies for TN are of variable&#xD;
      efficacy and safety, and have different results for different periods of time before the&#xD;
      recurrence of symptoms. Interventional therapy for TN is either destructive with trigeminal&#xD;
      nerve sensory function destroyed intentionally or non-destructive with decompression of the&#xD;
      trigeminalnerve and preservation of its regular function. The most common procedures in&#xD;
      treating TN pain are the use of radiofrequency (RF) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency thermos-coagulation of the GG is thought to selectively destroy the pain&#xD;
      fibers by thermos-coagulation at &gt; 65°C , that helps reduce pain and prevent triggering, but&#xD;
      can cause bothersome dysesthesia. Another method, pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) which defined&#xD;
      as the delivery of short pulses of RF via a needle tip, thereby a short exposure at the same&#xD;
      temperature will result in less thermal tissue destruction (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined conventional and pulsed radiofrequency (CCPRF) achieved comparable pain relief to&#xD;
      PRF treatment alone in patients with chronic pain, the combination of PRF and CRF would&#xD;
      increase the effect of CRF and reduce the need for long-duration CRF (LCRF) and its attendant&#xD;
      side effects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the possible value of motor index as a&#xD;
      prediction of success of radiofrequency lesioning of the Gasserian ganglion during treatment&#xD;
      of trigeminal neuralgia.&#xD;

    <description>The technique of the CCPRF is described as follows;&#xD;
the classic Hartle technique is used to reach the Gasserian ganglion&#xD;
Sensory stimulation with the RF equipment is conducted and parathesia of the affected branch is achieved at 0.1-0.2 V (50 Hz), keeping in mind that the mandibular part of the Gasserian ganglion is ventrolateral and the ophthalmic rootlets are postrolateral. Motor pre-stimulation (2 Hz) is achieved with masseter contraction at 0.1-0.3 V .&#xD;
After sensory and motor stimulation, RF therapy is conducted by use of the RF generator , in the sequence:&#xD;
Conventional RF 1st lesion at 60 °C for 60 s then 2nd lesion at 65°C for 60 seconds then 3rd lesion at 70°C for 60 seconds&#xD;
Finally, PRF is applied for 360 second repeated at 45 V, with a pulse width of 10 ms and a pulse frequency of 4 Hz. The cut-off needle tip temperature is set at 42 °C.&#xD;
Before withdrawal of needle 1 cc xylocaine 1% + 0.5 cc dexamethasone 4mg to be given .</description>
