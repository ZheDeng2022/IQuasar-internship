  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schools are in great need of service delivery systems that can improve school climate and&#xD;
      also attend to students' mental health. One effective approach is Positive Behavioral&#xD;
      Interventions and Supports (PBIS), a multitiered framework for defining and organizing&#xD;
      practices and interventions (including mental health practices). Investigators will use a&#xD;
      modified version of the Team-initiated Problem Solving approach (TIPS) to address the need in&#xD;
      PBIS programs for a mechanism to link PBIS and mental health supports at Tier 2.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity to Tier 2 Interventions Checklists</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fidelity will be measured every time a student receives a Tier 2 intervention. All Tier 2 team meetings and child group Tier 2 sessions will be audio-recorded. These recordings will be used to determine content fidelity using the Coping Power, CATS and Check-In/Check-Out Content Fidelity Checklists.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Penetration of Evidence-Based Practices (EBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess EBP penetration at the school provider level (behavioral health staff involved in the implementation of EBPs), and at the student service level (students receiving EBPs at Tier 2) during Years 2 and 3 of the study compared to Year 1.This information will be obtained from questionnaires completed by school therapists and their coaches.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) from Baseline to Post Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 weeks (post -intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Student Mental Health Symptoms will be measured by comparing parental and child scores pre-intervention and post-intervention.The BASC-3 is a 138-item, 4-point, Likert-type rating scale (N=Never, S=Sometimes, O=Often, A=Almost Always) for assessing parental report of child mental health functioning, standardized for ages 2.5 to 18 years.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Engagement versus Disaffection with Learning from Baseline to Post Intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Student Academic Engagement will be measured by comparing teacher and student scores pre-intervention and post-intervention.This is a 20-item, four-point instrument (1 = Not At All True, 2 = Not Very True, 3 = Sort Of True, 4 = Very True) with four sub-scales. Investigators will use the average score for each of the four scales at pre- and post-participation in group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Check-in/Check-out (CICO).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A Cost Benefit Analysis will be conducted across both sustainment conditions, comparing material expenses, personnel effort, agency and school district salaries, etc. Cost-effective will be measured using qualitative interviews with staff participants.</description>

    <description>In Year 1 of participation, schools in both arms will receive support for Tier 2 interventions provided by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) research consultants. In Year 2, schools in Sustainment 1 will receive reduced support for Tier 2 interventions provided by school district coaches. The coaches will in turn receive diminished support from research consultants. In Year 3, schools in both conditions will implement Tier 2 interventions with support from school district coaches; coaches will not receive direct assistance from research consultants.</description>
