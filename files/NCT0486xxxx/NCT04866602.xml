  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to characterise the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and estimate drug exposure&#xD;
      from Atoguanil in comparison to Malarone®.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all adult participants giving&#xD;
      written informed consent will be screened within 30 days prior to entering the trial on Day&#xD;
      -1 to determine eligibility for study entry. The trial will establish whether the PK profile&#xD;
      of both atovaquone (ATV), proguanil (PG) and cycloguanil (CG) from Atoguanil is similar to&#xD;
      Malarone® and whether exposure of ATV from Atoguanil indicates that at least a 2-fold&#xD;
      reduction in ATV dose compared with Malarone® is feasible (i.e. that the bioavailability of&#xD;
      ATV in Atoguanil is approximately double that of ATV in Malarone®).&#xD;
