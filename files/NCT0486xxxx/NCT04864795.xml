  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CARE-HK in HF is a registry study based on the hypothesis that adherence to guidelines is&#xD;
      associated with improved real-world outcomes for heart failure (HF) patients. For the purpose&#xD;
      of this study, adherence to guidelines is defined as 1) adherence to potassium (sK+)&#xD;
      monitoring recommendations, and 2) adherence to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system&#xD;
      inhibitor (RAASi) treatment recommendations, according to the most current local guidelines&#xD;
      at the time of assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate real-world RAASi treatment patterns in clinical practice compared&#xD;
      with the guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) recommendations. Factors associated with&#xD;
      patients achieving GDMT will be evaluated to identify potential barriers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have a 24-month enrolment period, followed by a 24-month follow-up period,&#xD;
      resulting in a total study duration of 48 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrolment, relevant patient data will be retrospectively extracted from medical records&#xD;
      for the 24 months prior to enrolment or since the time of HF diagnosis, as appropriate. After&#xD;
      enrollment all patients will have between 24 months and 48 months of prospective follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no visits or procedures associated with the study, patients will follow routine&#xD;
      clinical care, which may include in-person and/or virtual visits. The study protocol does not&#xD;
      recommend the use of any specific treatments and no study medication is provided as part of&#xD;
      participation. The nature and heterogeneity of HF means patients will be treated with&#xD;
      different treatments over the course of the study, and at the discretion of their treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be collected from patient records and/or during a routine clinical visit.&#xD;
      This will include treatments prescribed, routine assessments and measurements collected at&#xD;
      routine clinical visits, as well as hospitalisations and other relevant patient data.&#xD;

        To the extent possible, representative sites (e.g., cardiologists and nephrologists)&#xD;
        reflective of the treatment patterns within each country will be recruited. All patients&#xD;
        treated for chronic HF during the enrolment period will be assessed for eligibility, and&#xD;
        all eligible patients will be consecutively proposed to enrol in the study as they present&#xD;
        for a routine clinical visit (in-person or virtual visits) in order to avoid potential&#xD;
        selection bias.&#xD;
