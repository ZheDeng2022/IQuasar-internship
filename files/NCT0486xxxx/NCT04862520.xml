      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between chronic widespread pain (CWP) and disability is well-established.&#xD;
      Although research support large inter-individual differences in functional outcomes, limited&#xD;
      studies are available on the socio-economic consequences of offering stratified treatment&#xD;
      based on prognostic factors. Identification of predictors of long-term functional outcomes&#xD;
      such as work disability as a critical consequence, could assist early and targeted&#xD;
      personalised interventions. The primary objective of this cohort study is to identify&#xD;
      prognostic factors for the primary endpoint work status (employed and working vs not working)&#xD;
      in patients with CWP assessed 3- years from baseline, i.e. at referral for specialist care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are collected at the diagnostic unit at Department of Rheumatology, Frederiksberg&#xD;
      Hospital. The first 1,000 patients &gt;=18 years of age registered in a clinical research&#xD;
      database (DANFIB registry) with CWP either &quot;employed and working&quot; or &quot;not working&quot; will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Participants must meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 definition&#xD;
      of CWP, i.e. pain in all four body quadrants and axially for more than three months and are&#xD;
      additionally screened for fulfilment of criteria for FM. Clinical data and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes are collected at referral (baseline) through clinical assessment and electronic&#xD;
      questionnaires. Data on the primary endpoint work status at baseline and 3- years from&#xD;
      baseline will be extracted from the Integrated Labour Market Database, Statistics Denmark and&#xD;
      the nationwide Danish DREAM database. Prognostic factor analysis will be based on&#xD;
      multivariable logistic regression modelling with the dichotomous work status as dependent&#xD;
      variable.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      By using prognostic factor research, the purpose is to understand and improve future outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with CWP. Identification of prognostic factors for long-term functional outcomes,&#xD;
      including work disability, could assist tailoring and timing the therapeutic decision for&#xD;
      specific patients and potentially optimise functional outcomes compared with offering&#xD;
      standardised (i.e. ignorant) intervention programs to patients with CWP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this cohort study are anticipated to contribute with relevant knowledge that&#xD;
      may be used to guide future intervention matching and delivery of stratified interventions&#xD;
      based on prognostic classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a clinical cohort study enabling multivariable logistic regression&#xD;
      modelling of data from the large Danish DANFIB cohort of CWP patients with the primary aim&#xD;
      assessed after 3- years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection takes place in a specialised clinical care setting at the diagnostic unit at&#xD;
      Department of Rheumatology, Frederiksberg Hospital. Here patients presenting with CWP, either&#xD;
      as their primary pain problem or secondary to other established rheumatic disease, have been&#xD;
      offered clinical assessment and screening for CWP since 1st of January 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electronic data collection is accessed via touchscreens and data are exported to a&#xD;
      designated clinical research database (the DANFIB registry). Data extracted from electronic&#xD;
      patient files, including findings at clinical examination (manual TP count), are also&#xD;
      integrated into the DANFIB registry. A protocol outlining the content and objectives of the&#xD;
      DANFIB registry can be accessed online.The DANFIB registry will serve as point of departure&#xD;
      for the current cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 1,000 patients consecutively registered in the DANFIB registry with CWP independent&#xD;
      of working status. Participant inclusion is expected to be completed by December 2021.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained for all participants when registered in the DANFIB&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and individual labour market status assessed&#xD;
      at baseline will be extracted from the DANFIB registry. Data on the primary endpoint work&#xD;
      status (&quot;employed and working&quot; or &quot;not working&quot;) at baseline and again 3- years from baseline&#xD;
      will be extracted from the Integrated Laboure Market Database at Statistics Denmark and the&#xD;
      nationwide Danish DREAM database.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is prevalent in the background population with an estimated&#xD;
        prevalence of about 10% and represents a major clinical challenge due to the complexity of&#xD;
        the disease. Apart from pain and other centrally mediated symptoms, CWP is strongly&#xD;
        associated with disability affecting activities of daily living (ADL), incapacity for&#xD;
        normal employment and poor social participation. Fibromyalgia (FM) is the best&#xD;
        characterised subset of patients presenting with CWP and is by many considered to represent&#xD;
        the upper end of a pain severity spectrum, i.e. associated with greater disease burden and&#xD;
        higher levels of disability, in comparison to patients with CWP not fulfilling FM disease&#xD;
        criteria or more localized pain conditions.&#xD;
