  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This community-based cluster randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of time-limited, community-wide mass drug administration (MDA) with&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) and single low-dose primaquine (SLD-PQ) on&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum transmission compared to standard-of-care seasonal malaria&#xD;
      chemoprevention (SMC). The study will be conducted in a moderate-to-low malaria transmission&#xD;
      setting of Senegal with optimized malaria control measures (e.g., proactive community case&#xD;
      management and piperonyl butoxide pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets (PBO LLINS)).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades in Senegal, the scale-up of malaria control measures [e.g., access&#xD;
      to prompt testing and case management, LLINs, and SMC] has led to a 78% reduction in malaria&#xD;
      incidence. However, gains have not been uniform, with lower transmission areas in the north&#xD;
      implementing pre-elimination activities and higher transmission areas in the south&#xD;
      implementing control interventions (including SMC). The purpose of this study is determine&#xD;
      whether MDA will be able to rapidly reduce malaria incidence in areas of moderate-to-low&#xD;
      malaria transmission of southern Senegal (where control activities are ongoing) so that the&#xD;
      program can reorient their malaria strategy to implement elimination interventions in these&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to deliver three rounds of community-wide MDA with DHA-PPQ + SLD-PQ. MDA drugs&#xD;
      will be administered over the course of three days. All three doses of DHA-PPQ will be given&#xD;
      via supervised DOT (as per administration of SMC by national malaria guidelines) through a&#xD;
      door-to-door approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of three rounds of MDA with DHA-PPQ and SLD-PQ on village-level&#xD;
           confirmed malaria case incidence, malaria prevalence, and on reaching a target malaria&#xD;
           incidence of &lt;5 cases per 1000 person-years compared to standard-of-care SMC when&#xD;
           provided in the context of optimized control (proactive community case management + PBO&#xD;
           LLINs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the cost, coverage, operational feasibility, and acceptability of three&#xD;
           rounds of MDA with DHA-PPQ and SLD-PQ compared to standard-of-care SMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the impact of three rounds of MDA with DHA-PPQ and SLD-PQ compared to&#xD;
           standard-of-care SMC on parasite population dynamics and drug resistance.&#xD;
