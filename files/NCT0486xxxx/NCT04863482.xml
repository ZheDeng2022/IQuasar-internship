  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) gained popularity among general surgeons in 1990s and&#xD;
      rapidly become one of the most commonly performed procedures in digestive surgery, with more&#xD;
      than one million cholecystectomies being performed in the United States per year. LC remains&#xD;
      also one of the most commonly performed procedure by general surgeons during the training&#xD;
      period. Even if previous report LC cases performed by surgical trainees (ST) are not&#xD;
      associated with higher operative morbidity, the length of operative time is significantly&#xD;
      increased when compared with that of LC cases performed by attending surgeons, due, most of&#xD;
      all, to difficulties in identifying the anatomical structure, and this sometimes leads to an&#xD;
      attending surgeon taking away the case from the trainee. Furthermore, despite the fact that&#xD;
      LC has proven to be a safe procedure, the rate of common bile duct (BDI) injury still remains&#xD;
      unacceptably high even in the hands of minimally invasive trained surgeons ranging from 0.2&#xD;
      to 1.5% in individual reports, much higher than initial reports, associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, lower quality of life and increased costs, related to additional&#xD;
      health care measures, loss of work days, and insurance claims. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      address which of the techniques now available could be addressed as the best option in a&#xD;
      training setting to enhance the learning curve, to ideally build a safe cholecystectomy&#xD;
      training program and virtually eliminate the risk of BDI due to anatomic misinterpretation&#xD;
      during the training period.&#xD;

      Study design The study will be a multicentre prospective observational study. Members of the&#xD;
      Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery [SICE] will be invited to participate. All&#xD;
      participating centers will be required to register the study according to local regulations.&#xD;
      Evidence of successful registration should be sent to your national network committee prior&#xD;
      to beginning of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Study Design Since to date there is no consensus on which is the best technique&#xD;
      to correctly identify the anatomy of the Calot's triangle during LC performed by ST, this&#xD;
      trial would aim to propose a standard technique to be used in this peculiar setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefit for Patients In teaching hospitals and, more generally in a training&#xD;
      setting, overcoming the problem of providing high surgical quality while educating ST can be&#xD;
      challenging. This may change in the future if residents are able to better identify the&#xD;
      anatomy with Intra-operative fluorescent cholangiography (IOIFC), shortening the learning&#xD;
      curve and improving the safety profile of LC, that, in a clinical point of view, would&#xD;
      translate into a shorter operative times and reduction of the potential risk of BDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Risk There are no additional risks on the participation of this study as no&#xD;
      additional procedures are being performed to clinical guidance. In accordance with standard&#xD;
      care, patients shall receive written information regarding the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluated parameters i) Age ii) Sex iii) ASA scores iv) Preoperative work up v) Type of&#xD;
      procedure (CVS-WL, NIFC, IOC) vi) Operative parameters (operative time, intraoperative&#xD;
      complications) vii) BDI (according to the ATOM classification) viii) How the BDI was&#xD;
      diagnosed intraoperatively ix) Duration of cholangiography x) Time needed to obtain a CVS xi)&#xD;
      Post-operative outcomes (post-operative complications, late complications, need of&#xD;
      readmission, length of hospital stay) xii) Surgeons' ease at performing the procedure&#xD;
      (questionnaire on identification of anatomical structures, NASA task load test) xiii)&#xD;
      Surgeons' satisfaction (visual analog scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Subjects Consecutive eligible patients will be recruited at the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic in the participating center by the involved physician (surgeon). All patients&#xD;
      fulfilling the above-mentioned criteria will be informed about the study by the physician.&#xD;
      After consent is given, central data acquisition will take place web-based and patients will&#xD;
      treated according to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Potential participants will be counselled by a member of the research team directly&#xD;
      involved with the study and who hold good clinical practice certification. Patients will be&#xD;
      provided with written information and the consent form at the time of counselling with an&#xD;
      opportunity to ask any questions. All patients participating in the study must hold capacity-&#xD;
      this is an inclusion criteria and the absence of it an exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures Critical view of Safety(CVS) The CVS has 3 requirements. First, the triangle&#xD;
      of Calot must be cleared of fat and fibrous tissue. It does not require that the common bile&#xD;
      duct be exposed. The second requirement is that the lowest part of the gallbladder be&#xD;
      separated from the cystic plate, the flat fibrous surface to which the non peritonealized&#xD;
      side of the gallbladder is attached. The cystic plate, which is sometimes referred to as the&#xD;
      liver bed of the gallbladder, is part of the plate/sheath system of the liver. The third&#xD;
      requirement is that 2 structures, and only 2, should be seen entering the gallbladder. Once&#xD;
      these 3 criteria have been fulfilled, CVS has been attained). The rationale of CVS is based&#xD;
      on a 2-step method for ductal identification that was and continues to be used in open&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. First, by dissection in the triangle of Calot, the cystic duct and artery&#xD;
      are putatively identified and looped with ligatures. Next, the gallbladder is completely&#xD;
      dissected off the cystic plate, demonstrating that the 2 structures are the only structures&#xD;
      still attached to the gallbladder. Time consumption and includes the period from the initial&#xD;
      dissection and the obtaining of an acceptable view according to the previously described&#xD;
      criteria in order to safely transect the cystic duct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOC is performed after dissection of the cystic duct in a standardised manner, by cannulation&#xD;
      of the cystic duct with a catheter using either a Kumar or Olsen grasper. Leakage is&#xD;
      controlled by injecting saline prior to injection of iodine contrast means, according to the&#xD;
      centre usual habits. A mobile X-ray C-arm system is used, and the monochrome X-ray image is&#xD;
      shown on a separate screen. After satisfactory identification of the extra-hepatic biliary&#xD;
      ducts, the intraoperative cholangiography is discontinued and the gallbladder is removed in a&#xD;
      standardised manner. Time consumption includes the period from application of the Kumar/Olsen&#xD;
      grasper until it is removed again after obtaining a satisfactory cholangiogram and the cystic&#xD;
      duct is transected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near infrared cholangiography (NIR-C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIFC is performed injecting intravenously, 2.5-7.5 mg of indocyanine green (0.2 mg/kg) at the&#xD;
      admission of the patients into the hospital, in patients admitted he same day of surgery, and&#xD;
      at least 45 mins before the acquisition of the images. Indocyanine green rapidly binds to&#xD;
      plasma proteins and is exclusively and entirely excreted by the hepatic parenchymal cells&#xD;
      into the bile, starting within a few minutes after injection. During dissection, the&#xD;
      fluorescence imaging mode is used when needed until critical view of safety is obtained.&#xD;
      Before division of any tubular structure, the fluorescence imaging mode is routinely used&#xD;
      again, and fluorescent angiography is performed by re-injecting the same dose of indocyanine&#xD;
      green as initially used. After division of the cystic duct and artery, the fluorescence&#xD;
      imaging mode is applied again to check for bile leakage. Time consumption and includes the&#xD;
      period from the initial dissection and the obtaining of an acceptable CVS and transect the&#xD;
      cystic duct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics will be provided for all discrete variables in&#xD;
      the form of rates and proportions with 95% confidence intervals. Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      described by mean, standard deviation, median and range. Overall survival, disease free&#xD;
      survival, local recurrence rate and metastasis rate will be estimated using the method of&#xD;
      Kaplan Meier. Exploratory comparisons of discrete variables will be performed using a&#xD;
      Chi-squared test, using continuity correction or Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables&#xD;
      will be compared using a Student's t-test, or a non-parametric equivalent (Wilcoxon). All&#xD;
      tests will be two sided with a p-value of less than 0.05 considered to indicate statistical&#xD;
      significance. Data will be analysed according to intention-to treat principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size was estimated using simulations for a superiority design. Assuming a&#xD;
      success rate of 80% for the conventional intraoperative cholangiography, 90 % for the&#xD;
      intraoperative fluorescent cholangiography and . This was done for a range of sample sizes.&#xD;
      We then analysed each dataset to test whether intraoperative fluorescent cholangiography was&#xD;
      no more than 10% inferior to conventional intraoperative cholangiography in a one-sided test&#xD;
      applying a 5% level of significance. In conclusion, 60 patients in each group would yield a&#xD;
      power of 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to data collection, assuming a baseline structure detection rate of 20%, 300 subjects&#xD;
      per group was the estimated sample size needed to detect a 10% absolute increase (from 20 to&#xD;
      30%) in extrahepatic biliary structure visualization rates, with 95% confidence and 80%&#xD;
      power. In addition to comparing structure detection rates between the 2 study arms,&#xD;
      exploratory analysis was performed to identify potential effect modifiers like age, sex, body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI), liver&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on power calculations to demonstrate superiority of NBI over WLE for the endoscopic&#xD;
      diagnosis of coeliac disease, 328 patients would be required in total (44 in each group):&#xD;
      calculated using a significance level (alpha) 5%, power 1 (beta) 95%, %success in control&#xD;
      (WLE) group 60% [25] and % success in experimental group (NBI) 91%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has been considered with reference to (1) recruitment (2) adequately powered&#xD;
      calculations to be conducted to address the outcomes including inter-observer variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Duration of Trial The trial is expected to run for 6 months (time from first patient&#xD;
      recruitment to last patient evaluation). Data analysis will take a maximum of 3 months after&#xD;
      this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Ethics &amp; Regulatory Approvals The trial will be conducted in compliance with the&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996), the principles of GCP and in accordance&#xD;
      with all applicable regulatory requirements including but not limited to the Research&#xD;
      Governance Framework and the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trial) Regulations 2004, as&#xD;
      amended in 2006 and any subsequent amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
