      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system is the part of the body that fights infection. Some people have immune&#xD;
      deficiencies that cause skin rashes, make them get sick often with infections, or make it&#xD;
      difficult for their skin to heal. Researchers want to learn more to better treat conditions&#xD;
      that affect immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about how the immune system and skin healing are related to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-75 with primary immune deficiency, eczema, or psoriasis. Healthy volunteers&#xD;
      are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical and medicine history and a physical exam. They&#xD;
      may take a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will discuss the medicines or supplements they take as well as skin products&#xD;
      they use, such as soaps and lotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 4 skin biopsies taken from the forearm. A needle will inject an&#xD;
      anesthetic into the skin where the biopsy will be done. A sharp tool that looks like a tiny&#xD;
      cookie cutter will be used to remove a round plug of skin a bit smaller than the tip of a&#xD;
      pencil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give at least 1 blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have optional skin swab collection. A cotton swab will be used to swab the&#xD;
      skin on the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have optional skin tape collection. A sticky strip of tape will be placed on&#xD;
      the arm and then removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give leftover samples taken as part of their regular medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for about 4 days. Participants will have 2 visits that each last&#xD;
      about 1 hour. They may be asked to repeat the study in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to perform in vivo assessment of the metabolic&#xD;
      signatures associated with immunity, with particular focus on the immune modulators of wound&#xD;
      healing and tissue repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perhaps the most demonstrative example of immune dysfunction resulting from metabolic&#xD;
      disorder is that of adenosine deaminase (ADA) severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). While&#xD;
      several other metabolic disruptions can also lead to SCID, ADA deficiency causes an&#xD;
      intracellular accumulation of deoxyadenosine, which, among other actions, interferes with the&#xD;
      VDJ rearrangement needed for proper lymphocyte function and contributes to cell apoptosis.&#xD;
      Additional immune phenotypes have been described for monogenic or digenic disorders of&#xD;
      glycerophospholipid metabolism, amino acid transport, glycosylation, and oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation. Metabolic processes are also known to influence the function of T cells,&#xD;
      dendritic cells, and macrophages. More recent work has also suggested that metabolic&#xD;
      reprograming offers innate immune cells a form of memory, previously thought to be exclusive&#xD;
      to the adaptive immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to metabolic signatures associated with immune defects, this protocol will&#xD;
      provide insights into how these immune defects impact wound healing and tissue repair. Recent&#xD;
      work from our group has suggested that metabolic imbalance downstream of STAT3 may drive both&#xD;
      the reduced wound healing seen in patients with autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E&#xD;
      syndrome (AD HIES) or atopic dermatitis as well as in keloid scarring disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample collection protocol will enroll 50 to 150 adult participants who are healthy&#xD;
      volunteers or patients with confirmed or suspected primary immunodeficiency, psoriasis, or&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis. We will perform exploratory evaluations of metabolomics of immune mediated&#xD;
      diseases in peripheral blood cells, serum, skin biopsies, skin tape strips, and skin swabs.&#xD;
      We will contrast this host information with metabolomics of the microbiome as collected by&#xD;
      RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. Participants will have up to 4 skin punch biopsies from&#xD;
      the forearm over the course of 4 days to capture wound healing progress and identify involved&#xD;
      pathways. During the same timeframe, we will collect peripheral blood to assess the metabolic&#xD;
      signature of immune cells and serum/plasma. This protocol will afford the ability to link&#xD;
      known immune defects (monogenic or digenic immune disorders, atopic dermatitis, or psoriasis)&#xD;
      with metabolic profiling. We will be able to link, within individual cell types, serum, and&#xD;
      skin samples, how (as one example) mutations in STAT3 shift the metabolic responses.&#xD;
      Ultimately, we expect to construct a searchable database directly linking immune pathways&#xD;
      with their associated metabolic signatures in blood cells, serum, and skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that the research will provide critical new information on the human skin&#xD;
      immune and remodeling responses and will have direct relevance for the development of&#xD;
      vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. All research procedures will be performed at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.&#xD;
