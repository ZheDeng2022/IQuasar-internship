  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of the investigational drug 2217LS in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Investigational means 2217LS is a new drug that has not been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      any disease. 2217LS is human antibody designed to provide protection from Lyme disease. Lyme&#xD;
      disease is a disease carried by infected ticks and can cause the infection to spread to the&#xD;
      joints, heart and nervous system in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time 2217LS will be given to humans. This is not a study of how well 2217LS&#xD;
      works against Lyme disease. The only purposes of this study are to: 1) Learn about the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of a subcutaneous (SC [under the skin]) injection of 2217LS when&#xD;
      administered to healthy volunteers. 2) Find out how much 2217LS is in the blood of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers after receiving 2217LS SC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, groups of healthy volunteers will be given different doses of 2217LS by SC&#xD;
      injection. Volunteers will stay in the study unit for a total of 4 overnights. The planned&#xD;
      duration of participation is up to 14 months. Study personnel will monitor their safety using&#xD;
      standard procedures like physical examinations, electrocardiograms, questions about possible&#xD;
      side effects, blood and urine tests. The amount of 2217LS in their blood will also be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized, partial-blind, placebo controlled, sequential, dose escalation study, consisting of four cohorts of 10 subjects. Each cohort will have a sentinel group consisting of 2 subjects randomized 1:1 to receive 2217LS or placebo. Sentinel subjects will be dosed first. If judged safe and well tolerated by the Principal Investigator (PI) and if the stopping rules have not been met, the remaining 8 subjects in the cohort will be randomized 7:1 to 2217LS or placebo, respectively and dosed no less than 24 hours after dosing of sentinel subjects has been completed.&#xD;
For each cohort, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be reviewed by the PI, Independent Medical Monitor (IMM) and Sponsor prior to dosing the next cohort. A minimum of 7 days of safety data and available PK data from a minimum of 8 subjects from the preceding cohort must be reviewed. Dosing of the next cohort may proceed upon agreement between the PI, IMM and Sponsor, if the stopping rules have not been met.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Safety and tolerability of a study treatment by number of adverse events reported</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 360</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be assessed by targeted medical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. Abnormal laboratory values constitute adverse events only if they induce signs or symptoms and/or require therapy that are new or enhanced from baseline. Injection site reactions (pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, and induration/swelling) will be evaluated pre-dose through Day 15. The reactions are rated Mild (Grade 1), Moderate (Grade 2), and Severe (Grade 3) according to FDA guidance for industry. Adverse events will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) using MedDRA.</description>

             metabolic, renal, hepatic, respiratory, inflammatory, or infectious disease, as&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Receipt of any Lyme disease vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Abnormal ECG or laboratory parameters may be repeated once, if in the opinion of the PI,&#xD;
        the results are due to technical factors or are inconsistent with the potential subject's&#xD;
        medical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential study subjects who met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, but who,&#xD;
        for personal or administrative reasons, were not included in a study cohort, may be&#xD;
        rescreened if more than 30 days have passed since their previous screening. There are no&#xD;
