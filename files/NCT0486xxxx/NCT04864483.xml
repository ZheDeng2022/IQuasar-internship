      To examine effects of two approaches to sahoor meal consumption during Ramadan on blood sugar&#xD;
      control and incidence of early day hypoglycemic episodes requring the discontinuation of&#xD;
      fasting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most studies and guidelines regarding insulin dose adjustments have focused on basal insulin&#xD;
      modification rather than boluses or timing of meals. There hasn't been so far any study that&#xD;
      examines a specific dose reduction or timing that is best to avoid early day (post Suhoor)&#xD;
      hypo or hyperglycemia, and the advised dose reductions are based on expert opinion with small&#xD;
      observational studies that used certain dose changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing of sleep and meals are different during Ramadan and therefore have a direct impact&#xD;
      on blood glucose levels, we demonstrated in a previous prospective cohort of 156 T1DM&#xD;
      patients contrary to other studies, the post suhoor and early day period had the highest&#xD;
      incidence time for hypoglycemia in the Saudi population. It is therefore necessary to&#xD;
      understand how adjustments to the timing of the meals and their doses can achieve better&#xD;
      glycemic control during fastin Ramadan. Current guidelines recomend that the Suhoor meal is&#xD;
      delayed as much as possible in order to reduce the fasting duration to be taken with a&#xD;
      claculated insulin dose. However, the concern is that this would not allow patients to&#xD;
      correct the hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events related to miscalculation of Suhoor insulin&#xD;
      dose if they occur as the fasting time begins and they must break their fast to correct their&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. Many people with T1DM do not count meal carbohydrates correctly,&#xD;
      therefore, there is a need for an approach that allows patients to correct their blood&#xD;
      glucose levels after having a large meal that requires insulin administration without having&#xD;
      to break their fast, as well as the ability to have a snack or a late Suhoor without the need&#xD;
      for insulin administration to minimize the fasting period and insure that the blood glucose&#xD;
      is in range before starting to fast. The approach that we are proposing will allow patients&#xD;
      to do that by having the Suhoor meal with its bolus at least two hours before fasting begins,&#xD;
      and having a low carbohydrate snack - late suhoor- just before starting to fast without the&#xD;
      need for insulin administration (regimen 1). It is going to be compared with having the&#xD;
      Suhoor with its insulin bolus just before the start of fasting (regimen 2).&#xD;
