  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Synthetic products used in industrial, pharmaceutical, agro-alimentary or agricultural fields&#xD;
      are found in our environment. Thus, humans could be simultaneously exposed to several of&#xD;
      these pollutants. Furthermore, these environmental agents exert or could exert adverse&#xD;
      actions on fertility, by altering gamete and embryo quality through endocrine disruptor&#xD;
      effects or through increase in oxidative stress in gonads (cellular pathway known to be&#xD;
      involved in several human reproductive pathologies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the objectives of the present project are to obtain descriptive and&#xD;
      analytical data on woman and oocyte exposure to several environmental agents (bisphenols,&#xD;
      ethynylestradiol and glyphosate). The relation between these pollutant measures in follicular&#xD;
      fluid and urine (from women receiving follow-up of in vitro fertilization (IVF) protocol in&#xD;
      the University hospital of Tours, France) and the oocyte quality, the IVF and pregnancy&#xD;
      successes will be studied. Several oxidative stress biomarkers in blood and follicular fluid&#xD;
      will be also measured for these women, who will complete a questionnaire on their lifestyles.&#xD;
      Finally, thanks to in vitro approaches, the effects and the mechanisms of action (including&#xD;
      oxidative stress) of these pollutants (alone or in cocktails) will be studied on granulosa&#xD;
      cells from these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the project Fertenox during a meeting describing about the&#xD;
      Fecondation In Vitro protocol, all women patients not opposing to participate in the study&#xD;
      and to use individual information will be included in the research during the usual&#xD;
      bacteriological exam performed 1-2 months before oocyte pick up in the University hospital.&#xD;
      They will receive the questionnaire on their lifestyle during this exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the eve of the oocyte pick up (at the end of ovarian stimulation) during the usual blood&#xD;
      collection, three additional tubes of blood will be collected for each patient in the&#xD;
      University hospital. Women will also receive the screw-top container for morning-after urine&#xD;
      sample and the completion of the lifestyle questionnaire will be checked (some advices will&#xD;
      be done if necessary to help patients to fill out the questionnaire). Samples will be&#xD;
      treated, aliquoted and stored according to requirements the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the oocyte pick up, the first morning urine will be collected by patients at home&#xD;
      (or otherwise in the hospital). The completed questionnaire will be recovered and follicular&#xD;
      fluid and granulosa cells will be collected for each woman. Samples will be aliquoted and&#xD;
      stored according to requirements the same day. Granulosa cells will be cultured for in vitro&#xD;
      approaches in research labs the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tubes of blood, urine and follicular fluid will be coded and kept at -80°C in the University&#xD;
      hospital until their shipment to laboratories, where analyses of pollutants (bisphenols,&#xD;
      ethynylestradiol and glyphosate) and analyses of oxidative stress biomarkers (antioxidant&#xD;
      vitamins, FRAP), activity of several enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione&#xD;
      peroxidase) and oxidized lipids) will be performed.&#xD;
