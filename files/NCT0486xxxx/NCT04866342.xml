  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most premature babies require oxygen therapy. There is uncertainty about what oxygen levels&#xD;
      are the best. The oxygen levels in the blood are measured using a monitor called a saturation&#xD;
      monitor and the oxygen the baby breathes is adjusted to keep the level in a target range.&#xD;
      Although there is evidence that lower oxygen levels maybe harmful, it is not known how high&#xD;
      they need to be for maximum benefit. Very high levels are also harmful. Saturation monitors&#xD;
      are not very good for checking for high oxygen levels. For this a different kind of monitor,&#xD;
      called a transcutaneous monitor, is better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping oxygen levels stable is usually done by nurses adjusting the oxygen levels by hand&#xD;
      (manual control). There is also equipment available that can do this automatically (servo&#xD;
      control). It is not known which is best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research suggests that different automated devices control oxygen effectively as measured by&#xD;
      the readings from their internal oxygen saturation monitoring systems. When compared to&#xD;
      free-standing saturation monitors there appears to be variations in measured oxygen levels&#xD;
      between devices. This could have important clinical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to show the different achieved oxygen levels when babies are targeted to a&#xD;
      set target range. Babies in the study will have both a saturation monitor and a&#xD;
      transcutaneous oxygen monitor at the same time. Both types of monitor have been in long term&#xD;
      use in neonatal units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a period of 12 hours, each baby will have their oxygen adjusted automatically using two&#xD;
      different internal oxygen monitoring technologies (6 hours respectively). The investigators&#xD;
      will compare the range of oxygen levels that are seen between the two oxygen saturation&#xD;
      monitoring technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study babies born at less than 30 weeks gestation, who are at least 2&#xD;
      days old, on nasal high flow and still require added oxygen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently oxygen is titrated against saturation (SpO2) by manual adjustment. Automated or&#xD;
      servo-control systems have been developed that result in tighter control of SpO2 and more&#xD;
      time spent in the intended target range. These systems are already in clinical use. Automated&#xD;
      systems produce quite large fluctuations in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in order to&#xD;
      keep SpO2 in range. It is possible that this could result in short periods of high or low&#xD;
      oxygen tension (PO2) that are undetectable using saturation monitoring. Studies to date have&#xD;
      examined the effects of manual and automated (servo) oxygen targeting on SpO2 but not on&#xD;
      transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research suggests that individual servo control devices control oxygen effectively as&#xD;
      measured by the readings obtained from their internal SpO2 monitoring system. The device the&#xD;
      investigators intend to study is available with two different oximeter monitoring systems.&#xD;
      When compared to a separate free-standing SpO2 monitor the devices have a systematic bias in&#xD;
      the clinically targeted range. Consequently, this could allow variations between infants in&#xD;
      oxygenation large enough to influence important clinical outcome to go unrecognised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to determine the achieved SpO2 and TcPO2 distributions associated with the&#xD;
      use of different automated control systems as a first step in planning future trials. When&#xD;
      this is measured over a small number of hours it is not anticipated that this would have an&#xD;
      influence on clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, single centre, randomised crossover trial of two different&#xD;
      internal oximeter monitoring systems in an automated (servo) control device - IntellO2&#xD;
      (Vapotherm, USA) - delivering nasal high flow employing automated oxygen titration. Each&#xD;
      infant will act as their own control. Infants born at less than 30 weeks gestation, greater&#xD;
      than 48 hour of age and receiving supplementary oxygen will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be undertaken in the Neonatal Unit at the Simpson Centre for Reproductive&#xD;
      Health at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study time is 12 hours for each infant. Infants will be randomised to commence on&#xD;
      either Masimo oximetry or Nellcor oximetry using the Oxygen Assist Module (OAM), IntellO2&#xD;
      Vapotherm device. SpO2 (range 90-95%) will be continuously monitored on a second pulse&#xD;
      oximetry probe connected to a bedside multiparameter monitor as per normal standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional monitoring will be carried out as shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TcPO2 monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FiO2 monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heart rate monitoring (used to validate SpO2 readings)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Arterial gas sampling (only if conducted by the direct care team as part of the routine&#xD;
           care of the infant; no extra blood samples will be taken as part of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      FiO2 will be adjusted by the respiratory support device which has integrated automated oxygen&#xD;
      control, set to maintain a SpO2 target range of 90-95%.The IntellO2 device uses Precision&#xD;
      Flow technology (IntellO2, Vapotherm, USA). By means of a modified closed-loop algorithm, the&#xD;
      devise uses MasimoSET or Nellcor pulse oximetry to target a user-set SpO2 value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2 readings will be downloaded directly from the multiparameter patient monitor. SpO2 will&#xD;
      be measured using a Phillips MX500 multiparameter monitor (Phillips, Germany, CE 0366).TcPO2&#xD;
      will be measured using a SenTec Digital Monitoring System with OxiVent sensor (SenTec AG,&#xD;
      Switzerland, European patent No. 1535055, CE 0120). Both monitors are routinely used in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Transcutaneous data will be recorded contemporaneously and the site of the&#xD;
      transcutaneous probe will be rotated on each infant every 2 hours. Control of sensor&#xD;
      temperature and application duration are designed to meet all applicable standards and this&#xD;
      monitoring device is used routinely in many neonatal units.&#xD;
