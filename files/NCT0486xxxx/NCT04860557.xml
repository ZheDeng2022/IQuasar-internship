  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the cognitive skills, dual-task and physical activity&#xD;
      status of individuals who play problem video games and healthy individuals, and to determine&#xD;
      how much these skills are affected. The cognitive skills of individuals with video game&#xD;
      playing problems and the control group were evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      Test, the Trail Making Test A &amp; B sections, and the Stroop test. I evaluated dual tasks with&#xD;
      10-meter walking test (single-double task) and Time Up and Go Test (single-double task).&#xD;
      Physical activity levels were evaluated by International Physical Active Questionnaire. The&#xD;
      average cognitive skills, dual tasks, and physical activity levels of the individuals in both&#xD;
      groups were compared.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 days</time_frame>
    <description>It was used to evaluate the physical activities of individuals in the last week. It was also used to assess individuals' sedentary time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is used to measure exercise benefit perception. a high score indicates the presence of positive exercise perception. High scores on this scale indicate that the perception of obstacles to exercise is at the forefront.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed as a rapid screening test for mild cognitive impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test (TMT) A &amp; B sections</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It is one of the neuropsychological tests widely used all over the world. TMT is a test that requires visual-spatial processing and motor skills, which measures executive functions such as working memory, complex attention, planning, and set changes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It is a test that measures the ability to inhibition of inappropriate response in executive functions. It is a test that shows frontal functions that measures attention under a disruptive effect and evaluates to suppress inappropriate automatic responses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 meter walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>the 10-meter walking test, subjects are walked at their own normal speed and the walking time is measured with a stopwatch and recorded in m / sec. In the beginning, the 2-meter assembling phase is accepted as the 2-meter deceleration phase at the end of the walk, and measurement is made on a 14-meter-long track. In our study, normal walking speed and dual walking speed were measured and recorded separately, accompanied by dual tasks. In the evaluation of dual walking speed, individuals were asked to count animal names starting with the letter &quot;K&quot; and walking speed was recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG) test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG) test was used to evaluate functional mobility. Patients are asked to get up from the chair they are sitting in, walk 3 meters, turn back and sit on the chair again. Again, to evaluate the dual test, say words starting with the letter &quot;N&quot;, the test is repeated and the time is recorded.</description>
