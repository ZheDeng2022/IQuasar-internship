  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the year of 2010, the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare had implemented the 5-level&#xD;
      Taiwan Triage and Acuity Scale(TTAS) in Taiwan emergency department. TTAS is a triage system&#xD;
      that was modified from CTAS. It has a comprehensive chief complaint system and accomplished&#xD;
      with an electronic decision support system (eTTAS) to help triage nurse to assign acuity&#xD;
      level on emergency patients in emergency departments of Taiwan. TTAS has adult and children&#xD;
      modifiers, but no modifier for the elderly. In emergency departments, the geriatric&#xD;
      population have been increasing in many countries for the last few years. They often present&#xD;
      with atypical symptoms or signs, and multiple comorbidities that complicate diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment and are at risk of under-triage. Although the TTAS has overall validity and&#xD;
      reliability, its performance in geriatric patients has not been well studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the chance to under-triage the geriatric patients in emergency departments&#xD;
      and to improve the discriminatory and predictive power for triaged patients who require&#xD;
      admission, the objective of the study is to examine the difference of urgency, admission rate&#xD;
      and medical resource consumption of geriatric patients with different age group compared to&#xD;
      non-geriatric patients, to develop predictive model for hospitalization and medical resource&#xD;
      consumption among geriatric patients and to develop special geriatric modifiers.&#xD;

      Age and frailty have been demonstrated to be associated with clinical outcomes in the elderly&#xD;
      presented to emergent departments (EDs). This study aimed to assess the association of age&#xD;
      and frailty on admission rate and to find out whether the current Taiwan Triage and Acuity&#xD;
      Scale (TTAS) under-triage elderly presented to EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a retrospective cohort study that reviewed medical records of adult patients from a&#xD;
      single ED from 2016 to 2017. Data collected included patients' demographics, TTAS level,&#xD;
      chief complaints, frailty status, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate. Adults&#xD;
      patients included in the study were divided into three age groups of 18-&lt;65, 65-85, and &gt;85&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
