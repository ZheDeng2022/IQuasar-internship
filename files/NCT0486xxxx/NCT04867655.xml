  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brief summary Orange juice is the most widely consumed fruit juice, accounting for around a&#xD;
      third of the total fruit juice market and is a rich source of vitamin C and bioactive&#xD;
      compounds, predominantly flavonoids. Current research into the health effects of fruit juice&#xD;
      consumption has presented some conflicting conclusions. Although potential health benefits&#xD;
      have been attributed to the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of the bioactive&#xD;
      components in juice, other studies have suggested that the benefits of consuming orange are&#xD;
      outweighed by the negative implications of the high sugar content leading to increases in&#xD;
      blood glucose and insulin. At the same time it is well established that supplementation with&#xD;
      a mean dose of 5g of β-Glucan, a soluble fibre derived from cereals such as oats or barley,&#xD;
      significantly reduces insulin and glucose in healthy subjects and metabolic compromised&#xD;
      individuals. Thus, the formulation of an OJ beverage with an added β-Glucan supplement may be&#xD;
      a useful strategy to attenuate the detrimental impact of high sugar content. However, while&#xD;
      delaying the absorption of glucose brings about favourable effects on post-prandial glycemia,&#xD;
      dietary fibre may also reduce the bioavailability of some beneficial compounds, including&#xD;
      polyphenols. So far, it remains unclear how addition of β-Glucan impacts bioavailability of&#xD;
      orange juice flavanones. Thus, this study aims to determine how the bioavailability of orange&#xD;
      juice polyphenols of healthy adults is affected mixing orange juice with 3 g and 6 g of oat&#xD;
      β-Glucan.&#xD;

      Eligible participants for this study will be healthy adults aged 18 - 50 years and with a BMI&#xD;
      in the normal or overweight to obese range (≥20 kg/m2). Participants will be required to be&#xD;
      non-smokers, with a stable weight for the previous 3 months, and not engage in regular&#xD;
      strenuous physical activity. Other exclusion criteria will include suffering from any chronic&#xD;
      disease, taking any medication, or following a special diet, including being vegetarian and&#xD;
      vegan. Before being enrolled in the study, potential participants will attend a health&#xD;
      screening session, in which they will complete a health screening and physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomised controlled cross-over trial in which each participant will&#xD;
      complete two 24-h feeding trials. The experimental trials will be separated by a wash out&#xD;
      period of at least 7 days. The order of trials will be randomised for each participant, using&#xD;
      a random sequence generator. In the morning of the experimental trial participants will&#xD;
      consumed approximately 500ml of OJ (Tropicana 'with bits') without or with Oatwell fibre&#xD;
      supplement, providing either 6g or 3 g of β-Glucan. Blood samples and urinary fractions will&#xD;
      be collected prior to (baseline) and for 24 hours after consumption of corresponding&#xD;
      beverage. Participants will be asked to follow a special polyphenol-free diet and record&#xD;
      weighted dietary intake for 2 days preceding each trial and during the day of the&#xD;
      experimental trial.&#xD;
