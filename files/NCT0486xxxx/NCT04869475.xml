      This study is an open, prospective, single arm, multi center exploratory basket clinical&#xD;
      study. 20 refractory solid tumors patients with rescuable p53 mutation will be enrolled, and&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide in those patients will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      p53 is the most frequently mutated protein in cancer. It is mutated in about half of all&#xD;
      cancers and losses tumor-suppressive function. Yet there is no approved p53-targeted therapy,&#xD;
      being one of the most unmet clinical needs. At least 45 approaches/agents were identified to&#xD;
      kill cancer cells via p53 mutations by 2017, with at least 17 agents reported to function by&#xD;
      restoring mutant p53 with wild-type p53 activity, yet these compounds are far from being able&#xD;
      to achieve the desired outcome of converting all mutant p53 molecules to become&#xD;
      fully'wild-type-like' .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2020, investigators reported the FDA-approved arsenic trioxide (ATO) as a mutant p53&#xD;
      rescue drug. Investigators firstly, based on the knowledge that the hundreds of p53 mutations&#xD;
      inactivate p53 via heterogeneous mechanisms, proposed that there may be no single agent that&#xD;
      is able to recue all of the'rainbow'p53 mutants. Investigators next proposed a rational&#xD;
      mutant p53 rescue strategy, wherein the unfolded p53 mutants (termed as structural mutants)&#xD;
      were precisely selected as rescue objects and, in addition, a thermostabilizing compounds&#xD;
      were rationally used to promote the folding of structural mutants. Thirdly, investigators&#xD;
      aimed at a cryptical completely-buried pocket inside p53 (in conventional targeted therapy,&#xD;
      the targeted pockets are on the protein surface and thus exposed). By above, investigators&#xD;
      identified ATO as a mutant p53 rescue compound, mechanistically mimicking the formation of&#xD;
      disulfide bonds in C124-C135-C141 triad to promote the folding of structural mutants in the&#xD;
      solved co-crystal structures (disulfide bond is one of the main forces to promote protein&#xD;
      folding upon protein translation in classic biological chemistry textbook).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATO differentiates itself from previously reported broad-spectrum mutant p53 rescue compounds&#xD;
      in: (i) ATO is superior to the reported compounds by at least 100-time rescue efficiencies in&#xD;
      promoting structural p53 mutants'thermostability, protein folding, specific DNA-binding&#xD;
      ability, transcriptional activity, and other p53 activities in laboratories. (ii) the rescue&#xD;
      is accompanied with a structural mechanism revealing how broad-spectrum p53 mutants (note:&#xD;
      not all p53 mutants) can be rescued by a single small molecule. (iii) ATO is the compound&#xD;
      that can only rescue a part of structural p53 mutations (it can not rescue all p53 mutations,&#xD;
      it can not rescue all structural p53 mutations neither) and also a compound that has been&#xD;
      experimentally applied and confirmed on dozens of p53 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATO is the most effective APL leukemia treatment drug. When combined with ATRA, ATO cures APL&#xD;
      leukemia (5-year survival from ~30% to over 90%). ATO was also reported to be efficacious in&#xD;
      treating patients with non-APL hematological malignance and solid tumors, yet the response&#xD;
      rate is low. Investigators thus proposed that it is p53 mutation conferring the treatment&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hundreds of p53 mutations have wide-spectrum cancer distribution, and in addition, have&#xD;
      highly diverse rescue efficiencies by ATO. Thus, cancer type selection and mutation selection&#xD;
      are the two challenges in the current clinical trial (Note: These two challenges do not exist&#xD;
      for the other targeted drugs such as the widely used EGFR inhibitors and the recent&#xD;
      ground-breaking KRAS-G12C inhibitors since, according to the TCGA PanCancer Altas Studies,&#xD;
      their applicable mutations predominately occur in one cancer type (both in lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma), and clustered in one or few codons of their encoding genes). For these two&#xD;
      challenges:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The current trial will focus on the cancer types predicted to highly dependent on p53&#xD;
           mutations, in other words, the p53 mutation should be a key driver in this cancer type&#xD;
           and the cancer cells depend on the p53 mutation to survive and/or grow. Previous&#xD;
           clinical trials have confirmed the importance of selecting appropriate cancer types for&#xD;
           a targeted drug. For example, BRAFV600E inhibitors exhibit relatively high efficacy in&#xD;
           treating BRAF-mutated melanoma, but not colorectal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The current trial will further precisely select p53 mutations that can be effectively&#xD;
           and ideally, highly efficiently, rescued by ATO. Since ATO can only rescues a part of&#xD;
           structural mutations, investigators thus initialized a large-scale project-PANDA (P53&#xD;
           AND Arsenic) cancer project since 2016, wherein investigators cloned the most frequent&#xD;
           800 p53 mutations individually (covering &gt;95% p53 missense mutation cases in IARC) and&#xD;
           quantified their rescue efficiencies by ATO for their transcriptional activities (the&#xD;
           mutations were quantified individually), anti-proliferation ability in cancer cells,&#xD;
           anti-tumor growth in xenograft mouse model, et al. In the PANDA cancer project, there is&#xD;
           an apparent trend that ATO is most efficient in rescuing large-to-small amino acid&#xD;
           mutations, mutations near the arsenic-binding pocket, temperature-sensitive mutations,&#xD;
           as well as the mutations occurring on hydrophobic residues and in the LSH motif. Based&#xD;
           on the rescue efficiencies by ATO, p53 mutations were stratified in several classes in&#xD;
           the PANDA project (the open-access website for PANDA project is estimated to be&#xD;
           completed in end of 2021). The patients harboring the class of p53 mutations that can be&#xD;
           relatively efficiently and most efficiently rescued by ATO will be precisely recruited&#xD;
           in the current trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current exploratory trial was termed as PANDA-bascket1.&#xD;
