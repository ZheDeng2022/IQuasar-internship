  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of driving pressure guided ventilation&#xD;
      compared with conventional protective lung ventilation during laparoscopic bariatric&#xD;
      surgeries in morbid obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the primary outcome: Intraoperative oxygenation measured by the arterial partial&#xD;
           pressure of oxygen (PaO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the secondary outcome: incidence of early postoperative pulmonary complications e.g.,&#xD;
           postoperative hypoxia, the need for supplementary oxygen, atelectasis, barotrauma, and&#xD;
           respiratory failure.&#xD;

      Protective mechanical ventilation during anesthesia aims at minimizing lung injury and has&#xD;
      been associated to a decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Conventional&#xD;
      protective ventilation strategy is consisted of the use of a low tidal volume (VT) and fixed&#xD;
      moderate positive end expiratory pressure (peep). However, low-VT may result in the reduction&#xD;
      of the functional volume of the lung manifested as lung collapse. Another potential&#xD;
      consequence of lung collapse is the impairment in ventilatory efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery is proven to achieve significant and sustained weight loss in the morbidly&#xD;
      obese. Major weight loss can lead to partial/complete resolution of a range of conditions&#xD;
      including, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese patients undergoing general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation during abdominal and&#xD;
      bariatric surgeries commonly have a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications&#xD;
      (PPCs), due to factors such as decreasing oxygen reserve, declining functional residual&#xD;
      capacity, and reducing lung compliance. And also pneumoperitoneum aggravates pulmonary&#xD;
      atelectasis caused by mechanical ventilation, especially in obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving pressure (DP) which is the difference between the airway pressure at the end of&#xD;
      inspiration (plateau pressure, (Ppl) and PEEP was first introduced by Amato et al in 2015 in&#xD;
      their meta-analy¬sis study for ARDS patients. The authors suggested that driving pressure is&#xD;
      the stronger predictor of mortality as compared with low VT and Ppl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several retrospec¬tive and prospective studies confirmed the importance of driving pressure&#xD;
      in ARDS pa¬tients and during general anesthesia without differentiation between obese and&#xD;
      nonobese patients .only one retrospective study showed that driving pressure was not&#xD;
      associated with mortality in obese-ARDS patients. we hypothesize that these results may be&#xD;
      different in obese patients having healthy lungs.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be mechanically ventilated with driving pressure guided ventilation with VT 6-8 ml /kg of predicted body weight, and after recruitment we will return to the baseline PEEP 5 cmH2O that will be increased by 2 cmH2O until reaching the lowest possible driving pressure for every patient. Each PEEP level will be applied for 10 respiratory cycles and DP will be calculated at the last cycle.</description>
