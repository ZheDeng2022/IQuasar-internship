  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      psychosocial eHealth intervention designed to improve hormone therapy adherence among&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latinx women with breast cancer. Our proposed secondary outcomes are health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and self-efficacy in managing hormone therapy side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention components include breast cancer knowledge, hormone/endocrine therapy&#xD;
      knowledge, stress awareness and management, social support, and enhanced communication and&#xD;
      intimacy skills. The intervention will be delivered via a Smartphone application over a&#xD;
      12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the intervention application (described below). Aside from&#xD;
      using the Smartphone application for the recommended 12 weeks, participation in this study&#xD;
      includes three assessments: baseline (at the beginning of the research study), 6-week&#xD;
      follow-up, and 12-week follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Acceptability of My Guide: Usefulness</measure>
    <time_frame>T3 (immediately following 12 week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess acceptability, all participants are asked to complete an exit interview on My Guide. This interview assesses usefulness, satisfaction, learnability and usability of the application. This exit interview was synthesized from validated measures assessing eHealth intervention acceptability, and was adapted for our study to better fit our target population and our application design. Above average scores on the questionnaire are considered acceptable. The questionnaire is administered over the phone immediately following the 12 week intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life will be evaluated with The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G7)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 (prior to starting intervention), T2 (6 weeks into intervention), T3 (immediately following 12 week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-G7 is a validated questionnaire that assesses top-rated symptoms and concerns for a broad spectrum of advanced cancers and serves as a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Self-Efficacy in managing side effects is measured using the PROMIS Self Efficacy for Managing Symptoms</measure>
