  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia is seen in approximately 30% of patients who do not have a history of diabetes&#xD;
      and undergo general surgery. Hyperglycemia in this setting is associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of postoperative complications. The purpose of this study is to investigate risk factors for&#xD;
      developing high sugars during the time of surgery, and if these high sugars can be prevented&#xD;
      by the use of an injectable diabetes medication (dulaglutide) prior to surgery.&#xD;

      Hyperglycemia is seen in approximately 30% of patients who do not have a history of diabetes&#xD;
      and undergo general surgery. Hyperglycemia in this setting is associated with increased risk&#xD;
      of postoperative complications. This proposal seeks to identify underlying risk factors in&#xD;
      the development of stress hyperglycemia, and will investigate the use of a long-acting&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist for the prevention of stress hyperglycemia in a&#xD;
      high-risk surgical population.&#xD;
