  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to gather data on the effect of a device, the OtoBand, in participants who&#xD;
      have reported symptoms of vertigo, compared to the effect of using one of two sham devices.&#xD;
      The study is designed to be conducted remotely using video conferencing between&#xD;
      representatives of the manufacturer of the Otoband and participants. In order to comply with&#xD;
      requirements for non-essential contact due to the Covid-19 pandemic there will be no person&#xD;
      to person contact in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase of this pilot study, a minimum of 20 participants will be enrolled, with up to&#xD;
      100 participants maximum. This will provide adequately powered pilot data to measure effect&#xD;
      size for the OtoBand and sham devices and to identify different causes of vertigo for which&#xD;
      the OtoBand has a particularly strong effect as measured by the Otolith Vertigo Assessment&#xD;
      Tool. After inclusion/exclusion screening and informed consent is obtained, potential&#xD;
      participants will be assessed using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). The DHI will be&#xD;
      completed online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants with a DHI score in the appropriate range will be accepted into the&#xD;
      study. These participants will be asked to schedule an online meeting to with the study&#xD;
      coordinator. In this online enrollment meeting, the study coordinator will review the&#xD;
      Informed Consent and confirm other information supplied by the participant online&#xD;
      (inclusion/exclusion) and then make an affirmative decision to enroll or not enroll&#xD;
      participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two arms of the study (OtoBand /&#xD;
      Sham Device A or OtoBand / Sham Device B). This is a blinded study in which every participant&#xD;
      will be evaluated, and each participant may select the stimulation that best suits him or her&#xD;
      on both of the study devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will select his/her preferred stimulation level by pressing the power level&#xD;
      button on the study device; however, they will be blinded to which device they are using.&#xD;
      Study participants will be asked to use the devices whenever they are having a symptom of&#xD;
      vertigo. Each participant will be asked to record his/her level of vertigo in the online&#xD;
      Study Diary: before putting on the device, after wearing the device for 5 minutes, after&#xD;
      removing the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study devices will record the following information regarding usage: Date and time when&#xD;
      the device is turned on/off and the power level, Date and time when the power level is&#xD;
      changed and the new power level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to use the device as long as they are getting benefit from the&#xD;
      device at any power setting that they select. Participants will be asked to complete an entry&#xD;
      in the Study Diary even on days on which they do not experience a vertigo episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will schedule six study monitoring call with each participant as close&#xD;
      as possible to the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Call 1: Device I: 4 days after enrollment Call 2: Device I: 9 days after enrollment Call 3:&#xD;
      Device I: 14 days after enrollment Call 4: Device II: 17 days after enrollment Call 5: Device&#xD;
      II: 22 days after enrollment Call 6: Device II: 27 days after enrollment&#xD;
