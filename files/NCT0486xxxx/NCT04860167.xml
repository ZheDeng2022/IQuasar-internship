      This study was performed to evaluate the role of BIS monitored sedation in reducing the dose&#xD;
      of propofol and to know the effectiveness of pre-procedure administration of intravenous&#xD;
      diclofenac sodium along with topical pharyngeal anesthesia in reducing the dose of propofol&#xD;
      in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.&#xD;

      It was a single-center open-labeled Prospective Randomized study. After approval of the study&#xD;
      by the institutional ethical committee &amp; obtaining written informed consent, 90 patients&#xD;
      scheduled for ERCP procedure were randomized by using the block randomization method into the&#xD;
      following three groups, Group A (n=30)-The intravenous infusion of propofol was administered&#xD;
      for the ERCP procedure based on clinical judgment and the patient's requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (n=30) - The intravenous infusion of propofol was administered for ERCP procedure&#xD;
      titrated to BIS value 60-80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C (n=30) - Patients received 75 mg of inj. Diclofenac sodium (diluted in 100 ml of 0.9&#xD;
      % normal saline) intravenously 30 mins before the start of procedure &amp; topical pharyngeal&#xD;
      anesthesia with 4 squirts of 10% lidocaine spray ( one squirt each to posterior pharyngeal&#xD;
      wall, base of tongue, and bilateral palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal folds ) 5 mins before&#xD;
      the start of ERCP procedure. Intravenous infusion of propofol was administered for ERCP&#xD;
      procedure titrated to BIS value 60-80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all three groups, after completing the standard pre-anesthesia checklist, patients were&#xD;
      positioned in the semi prone-position and standard ASA monitors were attached&#xD;
      (electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and non-invasive blood pressure, EtCO2). Also, the BIS&#xD;
      monitor was attached in group B &amp; group C. Baseline values were noted before the start of&#xD;
      sedation. Supplemental oxygen was provided by nasal prongs @ 2/min. Patients in all groups&#xD;
      were sedated with an initial bolus dose of fentanyl 1 mcg/kg &amp; propofol 1-1.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      intravenously. Sedation was maintained with propofol infusion at the rate of 80-100&#xD;
      mcg/kg/min. In group A, propofol sedation was further titrated based on clinical judgment and&#xD;
      patient's requirement. Whereas in group B &amp; group C, propofol sedation was further titrated&#xD;
      to maintain a BIS value between 60-80. If the patient moves despite BIS 60-80, an additional&#xD;
      bolus of 30 mg i.v. propofol was administered. In addition to these, i.v. fentanyl 25mcg was&#xD;
      administered as a rescue analgesic.All pre-procedure drugs were administered in the&#xD;
      preoperative room with standard ASA monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters were monitored at 5-min intervals. The incidence and number of&#xD;
      episodes of patient's movements, cough/gag reflex, and hiccups were noted. The incidence of&#xD;
      desaturation (fall in oxygen saturation &lt; 94 % with oxygen supplementation), hypotension (17)&#xD;
      (defined as systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm of Hg ), and bradycardia (defined as HR &lt; 50&#xD;
      beats per minute) was also be noted. Standard anesthesia protocol was followed for the&#xD;
      management of desaturation and hemodynamic instability. Desaturation was managed by chin lift&#xD;
      &amp; jaw thrust maneuver. The nasal airway was inserted if deemed necessary by the concerned&#xD;
      anesthetist. Further, if desaturation persists &amp; lack of respiratory effort is seen for more&#xD;
      than 20 seconds, sedation was discontinued, and mask ventilation is initiated in the lateral&#xD;
      position. Insertion of supraglottic airway devise or tracheal intubation (after turning the&#xD;
      patient supine) performed as per anesthetist discretion and the patient will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study. Hypotension managed with 6-12 mg of intravenous ephedrine or a fluid bolus of 500&#xD;
      cc of plasmalyte. Bradycardia is managed by 0.6 mg of intravenous atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, propofol infusion was stopped and the total dose of propofol&#xD;
      administered in mg/kg/hr was calculated. Thereafter, time to achieve eye-opening to verbal&#xD;
      commands was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedure, patients were nursed in the left lateral position, and vitals (HR, NIBP,&#xD;
      SpO2) was noted every 5 mins. Also, readiness to discharge is assessed by the noting&#xD;
      post-anesthesia discharge score (PADS) every 15 mins. For patients having breakthrough pain,&#xD;
      1 gram iv paracetamol was administered in all the groups. The endpoint of complete recovery&#xD;
      was a PADS score of 10. Also at the end of the procedure, the endoscopist was asked to grade&#xD;
      ease of procedure based on 1=poor, 2=fair, 3=acceptable, 4=good, 5=excellent scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of discharge, the patient's satisfaction for the ERCP procedure was grade on&#xD;
      1=unacceptable, 2=extremely uncomfortable, 3=slightly uncomfortable, 4=no discomfort scale.&#xD;
