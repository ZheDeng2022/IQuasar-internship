  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this study were to evaluate the patient reported outcomes (PROs), safety and&#xD;
      efficacy, after 6-year (66 - 78 months) from the binocular implantation of the AT LISA tri&#xD;
      839MP. A secondary aim was to evaluate new metrics such as contrast sensitivity defocus&#xD;
      curves and light distortion analysis.&#xD;

      Retrospective cross-sectional study with two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phone call interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First stage included patient reported outcomes of visual function, spectacle independence and&#xD;
      satisfaction through questionnaires conducted by a phone call in all the patients implanted&#xD;
      in our center with AT LISA 839MP from March 2014 to June 2015 (n=92) which accomplished&#xD;
      inclusion / exclusion criteria and were able to be contacted by phone (n=62).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of Nd-YAG capsulotomy was retrospectively evaluated through the revision of the&#xD;
      medical history, in patients for which capsulotomy was conducted in our center, or a&#xD;
      question, for those treated in another center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage included the consecutive invitation of these phone interviewed patients to a&#xD;
      visit in our center for a long-term visual performance assessment up to accomplish the&#xD;
      required sample size (n=37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corrected and uncorrected monocular visual acuities were the primary end-points for testing&#xD;
      non-inferiority hypothesis in comparison to 12-month follow-up mean results reported in the&#xD;
      literature. Secondary variables of assessment were contrast sensitivity defocus curve and&#xD;
      light distortion analysis.&#xD;
