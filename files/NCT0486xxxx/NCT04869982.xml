    <masking_description>This study will be conducted in an observer-blind manner. This means that during the course of the study, the vaccine(s) recipient and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint will all be unaware of which vaccine was administered. The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing will be blinded to the treatment, and codes will be used to link the subject and study (without any link to the treatment attributed to the subject) to each sample.</masking_description>

    <description>The solicited administration site events are pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of any solicited administration site event regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevents normal activity. The maximum intensity of local injection site redness/swelling is scored at GSK using GSK's standard grading scale as follows: Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling above 100 millimeters (mm). The guidelines of grading standards set by the Chinese authorities are as follows: Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling above 100 mm and Grade 4 redness/swelling = Abscess, exfoliative dermatitis, and dermis or deep tissue necrosis.</description>

    <description>The solicited systemic events are fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, myalgia and shivering. Fever is defined as axillary temperature equal to or above (≥) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C) as per GSK guidelines and ≥37.3°C as per Chinese authorities' guidelines. Any = occurrence of any solicited general symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 symptom = general symptom that prevents normal activity. Grade 3 temperature = axillary temperature &gt;39.0°C as per GSK guidelines and axillary temperature, 38.5°C - &lt;39.5°C as per Chinese authorities' guidelines.
