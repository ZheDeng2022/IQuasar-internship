  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following informed consent, all recruited patients will have a baseline non-contrast CT scan&#xD;
      performed at the radiology department of &quot;G. Gennimatas&quot; hospital and reported by the same&#xD;
      dedicated uroradiologist for evaluation of stone volume, location, and consistency. All&#xD;
      patients will also have a free flow mid-stream urinalysis and culture before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of pain related to stones will be evaluated in all patients with the VAS tool&#xD;
      completed before commencement of treatment and at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a DJ stent at study entry will also complete the mini-Ureteral Stent Symptoms&#xD;
      Questionnaire (m-USSQ) and the PUF questionnaire completed one week into study, before&#xD;
      commencement of treatment and at the end of the study after taking either RENALOF® or&#xD;
      placebo. Patients with a DJ stent in situ at study entry, will have both ends of the DJ cut&#xD;
      and send for culture during scheduled DJ stent change. Approximately 90 days after&#xD;
      recruitment, all patients will have a follow up CT scan, done at &quot;G. Gennimatas&quot; hospital&#xD;
      radiology department and evaluated by the same dedicated uroradiologist , and a mid-stream&#xD;
      urinalysis and culture. Patients with a DJ in situ will have their catheters changed and cut&#xD;
      ends from the distal and proximal stent coils of the removed DJ stents will be send for&#xD;
      culture and sensitivity analysis. All patients will complete the VAS and the cohort of&#xD;
      patients with DJ stents will complete both the mini-USSQ and PUF questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period patients will be instructed to report to the research team any cases&#xD;
      of upper or lower urinary tract infection documented with a positive urine culture and any&#xD;
      treatment related adverse events.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 82 patients with renal stone or ureteral stones measured on a CT scan performed no&#xD;
      later than 1 month prior to randomization, will be recruited in the study. Full medical&#xD;
      history as well as demographic data and relevant medical treatment will be recorded in all&#xD;
      eligible patients, followed by a detailed physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients who have read and signed the study consent form will be randomized to&#xD;
      either RENALOF® or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization sequence will be computer-generated by the study coordinating team.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed before enrolment of the first patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the investigators and the study participants will be blinded to the treatment received&#xD;
      (RENALOF® or placebo). Following randomization, the participants will be given prefilled&#xD;
      non-labelled boxes containing either active drug (RENALOF®) or placebo. The pills in all&#xD;
      boxes will be visually identical in size, weight and shape. Each box will have a tag with a&#xD;
      unique code. A list of all dispersed coded boxes and the type of drug each box contains&#xD;
      (RENALOF® or placebo) will be kept sealed by the study coordinator until the end of the&#xD;
      study. Only at the end of the study period the research team will be unblinded to the&#xD;
      treatment each patient had received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in prespecified time-points, which are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point 0 (P0): Screening visit and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide a written informed consent before enrolment. A full medical history&#xD;
      will be recorded including medications, interventions for upper tract stones (ESWL, URS,&#xD;
      PCNL), medical treatment for stones, history of spontaneous stones passage. Findings on&#xD;
      clinical examination and patient demographic characteristics (body weight, height, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size, number and location of stones on CT scan will be recorded along with any other&#xD;
      relevant finding (horseshoe kidney, UPJ obstruction, duplicate collecting system, ureteric&#xD;
      stricture etc.). The location, size, surface area and volume of each stone will be calculated&#xD;
      and recorded as well as the total stone surface area and stone volume for each patient. All&#xD;
      CT studies will be evaluated and stone parameters will be estimated by the same independent&#xD;
      dedicated certified radiologist using the Invesalius computer software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a baseline Urea and electrolytes (U and E) blood test, free flow&#xD;
      random sample urinalysis and culture. U and E will include serum creatinine, sodium,&#xD;
      potassium, calcium and albumin. Parathyroid hormone will also be assessed to confirm or&#xD;
      exclude hyperparathyroidism. Urinalysis includes pH, specific weight, sodium, calcium,&#xD;
      oxalate, uric acid, citrate and magnesium. Urine culture tests for the possibility of a&#xD;
      urinary tract infection (UTI) and if necessary, sensitivity will be carried out which will&#xD;
      help treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with indwelling DJ stents will have their stents changed under local anesthesia. In&#xD;
      order to reduce patient discomfort and stent related symptoms (SRS) the stent length for each&#xD;
      patient will be estimated on the basis of individual patient's height as follows: height &lt;&#xD;
      175 cm will receive a 22F stent, &gt; 175 cm &lt; 190 cm will receive a 24 F stent and patients&#xD;
      taller than 190 cm will have a 26F stent. Care will be taken that the loop of the stents in&#xD;
      the bladder does not cross the midline. The distal and proximal ends of the stent will be&#xD;
      sent for culture. Patients with DJ stents will complete a m-USSQ and a PUF questionnaire 2&#xD;
      weeks following stent insertion or stent change. This will be done in order to avoid bias as&#xD;
      patients will have this procedure done under local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomized and 3 unlabeled boxes containing a total of 120 pills&#xD;
      (3-month supply) of either active treatment (RENALOF®) or placebo will be dispersed. The&#xD;
      patients will be asked to take 3 pills daily for 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point 1 (P1): End of the 90-day RENALOF® treatment All participants will have a follow up CT&#xD;
      scan. The location, size, surface area and volume of each stone will be calculated and&#xD;
      recorded as well as the total stone surface area and stone volume for each patient. The&#xD;
      findings will be compared to those of the baseline CT scan. Estimation of all stone&#xD;
      parameters (location, size, surface area, stone volume) will be done by the same radiologist&#xD;
      as in the screening visit in order to avoid interobserver variability. Incidences of&#xD;
      spontaneous stone passage will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a repeat free flow urinalysis and culture and complete a VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with DJ stents will have their stents changed and the stent ends will be sent for&#xD;
      culture and sensitivity. Patients with stents will complete a m-USSQ and PUF questionnaire.&#xD;
      Incidences of UTIs (with a positive urine culture) during the study period will be recorded.&#xD;
      Treatment related adverse events and drop-out rates will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once final assessment of all recruited patients has been completed, researchers will be&#xD;
      unblinded to the type of treatment each patient has received (RENALOF® or placebo). The&#xD;
      patients will then form 2 groups (group A, n = 41, those who received RENALOF®; and group B,&#xD;
      n = 41, those who received placebo) and the groups will be compared for primary and secondary&#xD;
      study endpoints.&#xD;

    <description>RENALOF® is a preparation that contains active Agropyron repens extract. It is designed with specific antioxidant compounds triggered by a bio-catalyst process that enables improved control of the production mechanism of anti-stress molecules. RENALOF® contains extracts of couch grass (triticin, potassium salts, agropyron, silicic salt, inositol, vanillin, saponin, mucilage, iron, and others trace elements), mannitol, corn starch and magnesium silicate. The magnesium in RENALOF® inhibits stone formation by inhibition of growth of crystals and aggregation.</description>
