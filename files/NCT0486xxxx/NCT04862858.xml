  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an educational outreach to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and their primary care and specialist&#xD;
      providers to improve use of guideline-recommended treatments, specifically sodium-glucose&#xD;
      cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA)&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      without use of select guideline-recommended medications in the previous year will be&#xD;
      identified from administrative claims. Primary care providers will be identified, randomly&#xD;
      selected and randomized to the intervention arm or control arm. All eligible patients for&#xD;
      that provider will be included. The patient's specialist providers (cardiologist and/or&#xD;
      endocrinologist, as applicable) will be identified and contacted. The intervention will&#xD;
      include a multi-faceted strategy to support providers in the care of their patients by&#xD;
      sharing recent guideline-based treatment recommendations and provide patients with&#xD;
      information regarding ways to reduce their cardiovascular risk. Outreach will occur for all&#xD;
      patients and providers randomized for the intervention - there will be no active enrollment&#xD;
      or recruitment.&#xD;
