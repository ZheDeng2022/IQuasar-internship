    <textblock>
      In this study, addressing prostate cancer survivors, i.e. men who received potentially&#xD;
      curative (radical) treatment two to six years ago, we will investigate if older age at time&#xD;
      of treatment is a detrimental factor with respect to long-term quality of life (Qol), health,&#xD;
      and function. We will also compare QoL, health and function between the prostate cancer&#xD;
      survivors and matched population based cohorts, and thereby provide realistic information on&#xD;
      the long-term impact of radical prostate cancer treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in Norway, with almost 5000 new cases yearly.&#xD;
      More than12 % of men contract prostate cancer before the age of 75. As 5-year survival is&#xD;
      high (&gt;95%), a significant proportion of the older male population are prostate cancer&#xD;
      survivors. The quality of life (QoL) and daily function of these older males need elucidation&#xD;
      to provide adequate health care services and information to this large patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project includes two studies(Study I and IIA). Study I is investigating the QoL,&#xD;
      health status, and local adverse treatment effects in all men 2-6 years after radical&#xD;
      treatment for prostate cancer. Local adverse treatment effects are defined as problems&#xD;
      related to organs and structures adjacent to the prostate gland (e.g. bowel and urinary&#xD;
      problems, and sexual dysfunction). Study IIA will focus on older prostate cancer survivors,&#xD;
      defined as men who were 70 years or older by the time of treatment. To complete the overall&#xD;
      project, we also plan a later study, Study IIB, that will investigate in more detail the&#xD;
      physical functioning and performance of the older survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Study I: A cross-sectional survey targeting all patients from the catchment area of&#xD;
      Innlandet Hospital Trust (SI-HF) who received radical treatment for localized/locally&#xD;
      advanced prostate cancer at SI-HF from 2014 to 2018 Study II A: A supplementary&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey targeting older participants from Study I who were &gt;70 years at time&#xD;
      of treatment Control groups: For comparison with a general population, we will use existing&#xD;
      data from male participants in the fourth wave of the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT4)&#xD;
      including the HUNT4 70+ survey. Control groups will be drawn, matched on age and education.&#xD;
      HUNT4 and HUNT4 70+ were both performed in 2017-2019, and targeted all inhabitants and&#xD;
      inhabitants &gt;70 years respectively in the former Nord-Trøndelag County. Jointly they include&#xD;
      broad health assessments using questionnaires, physical examinations, and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims Primary study aims are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate if older age at the time of radical treatment has a negative impact on&#xD;
           self-reported QoL, function and local adverse effects in prostate cancer survivors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate if health status, health problems, and use of health care services in&#xD;
           older prostate cancer survivors differ from a general male population of the same age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate how local adverse effects after radical prostate cancer treatment may&#xD;
           influence QoL and functioning in both older and younger survivors, and to explore how&#xD;
           other factors such as treatment modality and comorbidity may influence these outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate if health status, health problems, and use of health care services in&#xD;
           younger prostate cancer survivors (being &lt; 70 years by the time of treatment) differ&#xD;
           from a general male population of the same age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduct&#xD;
&#xD;
      All men who are eligible according to the inclusion criteria (see sample size below and&#xD;
      inclusion criteria), will be invited to participate. All participants will provide written&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Study I, participants will be asked to fill in a questionnaire covering QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30&#xD;
      questionnaire), local adverse effects after prostate cancer treatment (the EPIC-26) and other&#xD;
      health problems (selected items from the HUNT4 Survey). Participants in Study I, who were 70&#xD;
      years or more by the time they received their cancer treatment, will subsequently be asked to&#xD;
      fill in an additional questionnaire covering a broader range of health issues also with items&#xD;
      from the HUNT4 Survey (Study IIA). Questionnaires will be administered by post with pre-paid&#xD;
      return envelopes attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fulfill our aims, we will investigate the association between age at treatment and QoL,&#xD;
      self-reported health status, and local adverse effects (Primary aim 1). Furthermore, we will&#xD;
      compare self-reported health, health problems, and use of health care services between our&#xD;
      study population and the drawn control group (Primary aim 2 and Secondary aim 2). We will&#xD;
      also investigate how local adverse effects may influence prostate cancer survivors' QoL and&#xD;
      functioning (Secondary aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1400 men with prostate cancer received curative treatment for local or localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer at Innlandet Hospital Trust from 2014 to 2018, and about 1200 of these are&#xD;
      estimated to be eligible for the initial study I. Matched controls will be drawn from the&#xD;
      HUNT4 and HUNT4 70+ surveys, distribution 1:3 (cancer survivors : controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple descriptive statistics will be used to describe our cohorts. Comparison between groups&#xD;
      will be made using parametric and non-parametric statistics as appropriate. To assess the&#xD;
      impact of age, treatment regimen and relevant confounding factors on outcomes, multiple&#xD;
      regression models will be estimated.&#xD;
