  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MRG003 in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
      head and neck.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two stages. In Part A, approximately 22 patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and preliminarily efficacy of MRG003. Based on the initial safety and&#xD;
      efficacy data obtained from the Part A, the study design of second stage Part B single-arm&#xD;
      study either will be continued or the trail will be terminated. If the Part A data support&#xD;
      the continuation of the study, in the second stage, approximately an additional 98 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of MRG003.&#xD;
