    <textblock>
      An open, randomized, single-dose, three-cycle, three-sequence crossover study was conducted&#xD;
      in 36 healthy volunteers under fasting condition to evaluate the bioequivalence of two&#xD;
      abiratone acetate tablets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone acetate tablet is an androgen synthesis inhibitor, primarily for the treatment of&#xD;
      mCRPC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of&#xD;
      two abiraterone acetate tablets in healthy Chinese subjects. In healthy subjects, a&#xD;
      single-center, open, single-dose, randomized, three-cycle, three-sequence, semi-repeat&#xD;
      (duplicate reference preparation only), reference formulation corrected fasting mean&#xD;
      bioequivalence trial was conducted with a minimum of 7 days cleaning period between dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at prescribed time intervals, and the plasma concentration of&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate tablet was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry&#xD;
      and adverse events were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, T1/2 and so on were calculated by&#xD;
      non-atrioventricular model. When the individual coefficient of variation(CVWR) of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax) of reference formulation was less than&#xD;
      30%,with an average bioequivalence (ABE) criterion: if the test formulation and reference&#xD;
      formulation of pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0 - t,AUC0-∞ and Cmax) of the 90% CIs of GMR is&#xD;
      not beyond the range of 80.00% -125.00%, which can determine the test formulation and&#xD;
      reference formulation have bioequivalence.When the CVWR of the pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax) of the reference preparation is greater than or equal to 30%,the&#xD;
      reference preparation was used to correct for mean bioequivalence (RSABE): if the critbound&#xD;
      of the pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-t,AUC0-∞ , Cmax) of the test formulations and&#xD;
      reference formulations is less than 0, and the geometric average ratio is not beyond the&#xD;
      range of 0.8000 - 1.2500, which can determine the test formulation and reference formulation&#xD;
      have bioequivalence.&#xD;

    <description>The two formulations are considered to be bioequivalent if the CVWR is less than 30% and 90% CIS of the ratio of primary pharmacokinetic parameters is within a predetermined acceptance range of 80% to 125%. If the CVWR of the pharmacokinetic parameters of the reference preparation is greater than or equal to 30%, Critbound ≤0, and the geometric mean ratio does not exceed the range of 0.8000 to 1.2500, the test preparation and the reference preparation can be determined to be bioequivalent.</description>
