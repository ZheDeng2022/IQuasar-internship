  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of caffeine treatment, given either orally&#xD;
      or intravenously, on heart rate variability in newborns. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      sought for a potential association between caffeine treatment and vital functions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Neonatal Department of University Medical Centre Ljubljana caffeine is used to treat&#xD;
      neonatal apnoea. It has known affects on central nervous and cardiovascular systems, but&#xD;
      little is known about the impact of caffeine intake on heart rate variability (HRV) in&#xD;
      newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators performed measurements on one sample of 25 newborns with&#xD;
      apnoea who had been admitted to the Neonatal Department of University Medical Centre&#xD;
      Ljubljana and treated with caffeine citrate. The treatment regimen consisted of caffeine&#xD;
      citrate of a loading dose of 20 mg/kg of body mass, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 5&#xD;
      mg/kg after 24 hours. The investigators measured parameters of HRV in two situations: while&#xD;
      the treatment with caffeine citrate was ongoing and after the treatment was withdrawn. The&#xD;
      newborns served as controls. Electrical activity of the heart was measured with a Holter ECG&#xD;
      while the newborn was sleeping in supine position, first without a bed tilt and afterwards&#xD;
      with a 30° head-up tilt. Simultaneously was evaluated the alertness of the newborn and&#xD;
      measured their physiological variables (the breathing frequency, the heart rate, the arterial&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, and the body temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parents were given their written consent for their child to participate in the study.&#xD;

    <description>While the newborn was sleeping, the electrical activity of the heart was recorded by using ECG Holter. TP (ms2) was obtained from a suitable 5-minute ECG segment analysed by fast Fourier transform, using the Vision Premier Programme for each bed tilt. The values were compared across the two arms of the study, using student's t-test for comparisons of normally distributed variables, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for abnormally distributed data.</description>
