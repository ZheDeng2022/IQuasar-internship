      The use of non-invasive intracranial pressure monitoring, including intracranial pressure&#xD;
      pulse morphology in patients with COVID-19, could calculate possible components associated&#xD;
      with the presence of neurological symptoms in these patients, in addition to being a tool&#xD;
      with the potential to monitor the repercussion of MV at cerebral compliance patient patients.&#xD;
      In addition, it is likely that patients with COVID-19 also have cerebral embolization more&#xD;
      frequently than healthy patients, which is justified by transcranial doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      assessment. The aim of the study is to monitor this brain pressure using a non-invasive&#xD;
      method of monitoring, with a helmet-like system in place, for 1 hour for 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
      There will be no associated invasive procedure of any kind. Monitoring will be done by the&#xD;
      criteria themselves, no place where the patient and the mandatory volunteer. Another&#xD;
      objective is to capture signs of microembolisms (small strokes that have not yet manifested)&#xD;
      by performing a doppler ultrasound on the head with a helmet also for 1 hour, in a single&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include inpatients with COVID-19 infection. The control group will&#xD;
      be in patients who do not have Covid-19. The control group will consist of people with&#xD;
      similar characteristics and who have not recovered. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      incorporated into the monitoring with a non-invasive intracranial pressure device for 1 hour&#xD;
      during hospitalization (Brain4Care® device approved by ANVISA), being monitored for up to&#xD;
      seven days, in addition to monitoring for 1 hour with a transcranial doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      helmet DWL® in a single assessment. There will be no invasive procedures or other equipment&#xD;
      used without due knowledge by Organs competent bodies. It does not collect collection or&#xD;
      retention of any biological material.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease transmitted&#xD;
      one person to another mainly from cough and sneeze aerosols as well as from contaminated&#xD;
      surfaces. The most common respiratory symptoms are dry cough, fever, and dyspnea, but the&#xD;
      Severe Respiratory Acute Syndrome (SARS) can be installed increasing disease´s mortality. In&#xD;
      addition, neurological symptoms have been described according the increase of severity and&#xD;
      age. Changes of intracranial pressure (ICP) can partially explain the Central Nervous System&#xD;
      (CNS) impairment due to COVID-19. The ICP waveform can bring relevant information about&#xD;
      intracranial compliance, and, nowadays, it can be measured by non-invasive technology.&#xD;
      Clinically, non-invasive ICP waveform assessment would help to understand the repercussion of&#xD;
      Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) on CNS in COVID-19 persons. AIMS: This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the ICP waveform in intubated and non-intubated COVID-19 persons. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      association between ICP and IMV parameters, level of sedation, heart rate variability,&#xD;
      neurological symptoms, neuroimage, and final discharge will be investigated. . METHODS: At&#xD;
      least 30 COVID-19 individuals will be included within 72h from admission and 14 days from&#xD;
      symptoms onset. They will be divided into two groups: non-intubated (n=15) and intubated,&#xD;
      paired with non-COVID-19 ones (non-intubated and intubated non-COVID-19 groups,&#xD;
      respectively). The non-invasive ICP monitoring will be daily performed for 7 consecutive&#xD;
      days. The Brain4Care's device and Analytic System will be used to assess the three pulse&#xD;
      peaks (P1, 2 and 3) at the ICP waveform. The following variables will be investigated: P1 and&#xD;
      P2 amplitude, P2/P1 ratio, time to peak and time percentage of P2 higher than P1. For&#xD;
      statistics, all variables will be tested as to their normal or non-normal distribution&#xD;
      through appropriate statical analyzes. For basic demographic and clinical variables,&#xD;
      descriptive data analysis will be used. The repetitive measurement Anova will be used for ICP&#xD;
      outcomes throughout the days. Pearson's or Spearman´s correlations will be applied according&#xD;
      to data distribution.&#xD;
