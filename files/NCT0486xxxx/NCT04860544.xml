  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present cohort was performed between January of 2014 and December of 2019. It included&#xD;
      302 free flaps conducted between January 2006 and December 2019 in the Hospital de San José&#xD;
      and Hospital Infantil Universitario de San José in Bogotá, Colombia. Its aims were to&#xD;
      determine whether there is an association between perioperative red blood cell transfusion&#xD;
      and the risk of free flap vascular pedicle thrombosis. The exposure was the red blood cell&#xD;
      transfusion therapy during the perioperative eriod, and the primary outcome was the&#xD;
      occurrence of vascular pedicle thrombosis, which was defined as the intraoperative&#xD;
      visualization of arterial or venous thrombosis of the vascular pedicle observed until seven&#xD;
      days following the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary outcome, the presence of clinical signs of arterial or venous flap suffering.&#xD;
      Red blood cell transfusion was prescribed by the attending anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology included data collection from medical records history, statistical analysis&#xD;
      (incidence of thrombosis and to plot survival curves, the incidence rates calculated for&#xD;
      every 1000 free flaps and the analysis between thrombosis and perioperative variables) by&#xD;
      Kaplan Meier method and Cox regression models and its interpretation. The results showed that&#xD;
      red blood cell transfusion during the perioperative period did not represent a risk for&#xD;
      vascular pedicle thrombosis and also discarded a possible effect on the free flap survival.&#xD;

      The study included patients who underwent free flap surgery between January 2006 and December&#xD;
      2019 in the Hospital de San José and Hospital Infantil Universitario de San José in Bogotá,&#xD;
      Colombia. Criteria for exclusion were history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, hypercoagulability syndrome, and&#xD;
      previous medication with oral or parenteral anticoagulant within the past year of the&#xD;
      surgery. A standardized Google App for Work form was created where participant's medical&#xD;
      records were registered. The exposure criteria were RBCT, and the primary outcome was the&#xD;
      occurrence of VPT, which was defined as the intraoperative visualization of arterial or&#xD;
      venous thrombosis in the vascular pedicle, observed up until seven days after the procedure.&#xD;
      As a secondary outcome, the presence of clinical signs of arterial flap suffering (pallor,&#xD;
      decreased capillary filling time, decreased skin turgor, , venous congestion: blue dermal&#xD;
      bleeding, and poikilothermia). As well as the absence of blood flow measured by Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound that was registered from the beginning until the outcome. Different clinical&#xD;
      characteristics were recorded such as: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), diabetes (fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose &gt;126 mg/dl or random glucose value &gt;200 mg/dl), arterial hypertension&#xD;
      (persistently high value &gt;140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive medication for adequate&#xD;
      control) anesthetic risk (ASA Classification), most recent pre-surgical hemoglobin (Hb&#xD;
      mg/dl), most recent pre-surgical hematocrit (Ht %), anemia (Hb &lt;12mg/dl or Hto &lt;36% in&#xD;
      children under 14 and women of childbearing age, Hb &lt;13 mg/dl or Hto &lt;39% in men over 14 or&#xD;
      postmenopausal women), history of chemotherapy during the past year, history of radiation&#xD;
      therapy in the flap donor or free flap recipient site In regard to the surgery performed, the&#xD;
      following variables were analyzed: indication of procedure, free flap donor site, free flap&#xD;
      recipient site, type of flap, whether or not other concomitant surgical procedures were being&#xD;
      performed (oncological resections, osteosynthesis, tumor resections) and intra-operative&#xD;
      bleeding according to the records from anesthesiologists' evaluations. The information was&#xD;
      exported from the standardized formats to a database for statistical analysis through&#xD;
      statistical packages R and Stata 15® licensed by the Fundación Universitaria de Ciencias de&#xD;
      la Salud - FUCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposed group corresponded to patients who received red blood cell transfusion during the&#xD;
      perioperative period of free flap surgery (defined as: 24 hours before, during and up to 24&#xD;
      hours after the procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The unexposed group corresponded to patients who did not receive red blood cell transfusion&#xD;
      during the perioperative period of free flap surgery (defined as: 24 hours before, during and&#xD;
      up to 24 hours after the procedure).&#xD;
