      Background The management of patients with symptomatic nonacute intracranial artery occlusion&#xD;
      (sNA-ICAO), which is a special subset with high morbidity and a high probability of recurrent&#xD;
      serious ischemic events despite standard medical therapy (SMT), has been clinically&#xD;
      challenging. Some small-sample clinical studies have also discussed endovascular&#xD;
      recanalization for sNA-ICAO; however, there is currently a lack of evidence from multicenter,&#xD;
      prospective, large-sample cohort trials. The aim of our present study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      technical feasibility and safety of endovascular recanalization for sNA-ICAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: Our group is currently undertaking a multisite, nonrandomized cohort,&#xD;
      prospective registry study enrolling consecutive patients presenting with sNA-ICAO at 15&#xD;
      centers in China between May 1, 2020, and April 30, 2023. A cohort of patients who received&#xD;
      SMT and a cohort of similar patients who received ER plus SMT were constructed and followed&#xD;
      up for 2 years. The primary outcome is the composite of stroke/TIA within 2 years following&#xD;
      enrollment and stroke/TIA ipsilateral to the target vessel. The secondary efficacy outcome&#xD;
      includes the following two parts: 1) the incidence of stroke/TIA ipsilateral to the target&#xD;
      vessel within 30 days and 90 days in both groups; 2) the all-cause mortality, mRS score,&#xD;
      NIHSS score and cognitive function at 30 days, 90 days, 8 months, 12 months and 24 months for&#xD;
      both groups, including the MRI, CTA/MRA, CTP or MRP results in patients with internal carotid&#xD;
      artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion as well as CTA in patients with basilar or&#xD;
      vertebral artery occlusion at 90 days, 12 months and 24 months. Descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      linear/logistic multiple regression models will be generated. Clinical relevance will be&#xD;
      measured as relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination This study protocol was reviewed and approved primarily by Beijing&#xD;
      Tiantan Hospital, the Capital Medical University Medical Ethics Committee, and the&#xD;
      institutional review boards of all partner sites. The study is being externally monitored,&#xD;
      and the results will be published in open-access peer-reviewed scientific journals and&#xD;
      presented to academic and policy stakeholders.&#xD;
