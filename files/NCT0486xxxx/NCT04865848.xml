  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blind, parallel-design randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      that aims compare the effectiveness of articaine local infiltration to lidocaine inferior&#xD;
      alveolar nerve block (IANB) for restorative treatment of primary mandibular molars (PMM).&#xD;
      Four to 10-year-old children who needed PMM restorations are enrolled according to inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and randomly allocated into the articaine or lidocaine group. One operator&#xD;
      administers all local anesthesia (LA). Using the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale, 15 trained&#xD;
      and calibrated examiners, blinded to LA type, evaluate the subjects' reactions during LA&#xD;
      administration and treatment. Children rate their experience using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain&#xD;
      Rating Scale. Subjects' blood pressure and pulse throughout the visit are recorded. Results&#xD;
      are statistically analyzed using independent t-tests, Mann Whitney-U, and Repeated Measures&#xD;
      ANOVA (P&lt;0.05).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a parallel design randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of mandibular infiltration anesthesia with Articaine in comparison to IANB with Lidocaine&#xD;
      used for restorative and pulp therapy procedures in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine (2% Lidocaine Hydrochloride with 1:100,000 Epinephrine) and Articaine (4% Articaine&#xD;
      Hydrochloride with 1:100,000 Epinephrine) are compared and evaluated for their effectiveness&#xD;
      of anesthetizing primary mandibular molars for restorative and pulp therapy procedures. A&#xD;
      number of clinical and behavioral variables including blood pressure, pulse, physical&#xD;
      movements, and pain perception are evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for this study will be recruited from the pool of patients attending the&#xD;
      Post-graduate (PG) clinic at the Pediatric Dentistry Department of the College of Dentistry&#xD;
      (COD), University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      specified separately for the selected patients and for the teeth involved. Informed consent&#xD;
      from the parent/guardian and assent from the pediatric participant (7 years of age and older)&#xD;
      will be obtained and signed. This is a prospective randomized clinical trial utilizing a&#xD;
      random digit table for participant allocation into either the Articaine Group or the&#xD;
      Lidocaine Group. The dosage of LA will be determined by the child's body weight and will not&#xD;
      exceed the maximum recommended 4.4 mg/kg for Lidocaine and 7 mg/kg for Articaine. Before the&#xD;
      injection, 20% Benzocaine topical anesthetic gel will be applied at the injection site with a&#xD;
      cotton swab for approximately 3 minutes over dry mucosa. The randomly assigned LA, either&#xD;
      Lidocaine IANB or Articaine infiltration, will be administered. One designated operator, an&#xD;
      experienced specialist pediatric dentist, will conduct all LA injections to all participants.&#xD;
      A trained and calibrated dental assistant (examiner A) will record the child's reactions&#xD;
      during the LA administration using the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS), adapted by&#xD;
      Taddio et al. 1994. This scale allows for objective evaluation of pain using multiple&#xD;
      criteria such as facial display, movement of extremities, movement of torso, and crying. A&#xD;
      second trained and calibrated investigator (examiner B), a resident in pediatric dentistry,&#xD;
      who is blinded to the type of LA agent used, will complete the planned dental treatment for&#xD;
      the primary mandibular molars. Examiner B will complete MBPS (#B) evaluating the patient's&#xD;
      reactions during the dental treatment. Generally, effective LA results in less negative and&#xD;
      more positive patient's reactions to the dental care. In total, 15 examiners A and 17&#xD;
      examiners B will take part in the study. All examiners will be trained and calibrated with&#xD;
      respect to the use of MBPS. During the entire treatment visit, each participant will wear a&#xD;
      pulse and blood pressure monitor. The machine will produce automatic recordings every 10&#xD;
      minutes. Patients that experience distress and pain can exhibit increased pulse and blood&#xD;
      pressure values outside of the considered normal range per age. At the end of the dental&#xD;
      visit, the pediatric patient will be asked to complete a Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Response&#xD;
      Scale (PRS) for feedback of their experience with the entire dental visit. The PRS contains&#xD;
      six images of varying facial expression ranging from laughter to tears which are assigned at&#xD;
      numerical value for objective evaluation. All used data will be coded and captured on&#xD;
      specifically designed for the purposes of the study evaluation forms. The data gathered&#xD;
      through all study forms will be transferred into Microsoft® Excel 2018 and the statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics.&#xD;

    <description>Step-by-step:&#xD;
Reflect tissue to expose injection site.&#xD;
Orient bevel of the needle to be parallel to the bone and insert needle into mucobuccal fold&#xD;
Proceed to the depth that approximates the apices of the buccal roots of the primary molars.&#xD;
Aspirate.&#xD;
Deposit bolus of local anesthetic slowly at a rate of 1 ml/min.&#xD;
Remove needle.&#xD;
A subsequent lingual infiltration is delivered.&#xD;
The armamentarium includes: 4% articaine HCl with 1:100,000 epinephrine (Septocaine ®, Septodont, Lancaster, Penn. USA) in 1.7 ml cartridges and 30-gauge short needle manufactured by Henry Schein® (Melville, N.Y., USA).

    <description>Step-by-step:&#xD;
Dry injection site with gauze.&#xD;
The barrel of the syringe should be directed on a plane between the two primary molars on the opposite side of the arch. It is advisable to inject a small amount of the solution as soon as the tissue is penetrated and to continue to inject minute quantities as the needle is directed toward the mandibular foramen.&#xD;
Insert to the depth that is adjacent to bone.&#xD;
Aspirate.&#xD;
Slowly inject bolus of anesthetic at a rate of 1 ml/min.&#xD;
Remove needle.&#xD;
