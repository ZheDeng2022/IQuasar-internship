      The IRAM Chad impact evaluation will be based on a cluster randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      study the impact of the integrated and multisectoral services package (PASIM), aimed at&#xD;
      reducing the incidence and prevalence of wasting through integrated interventions, including,&#xD;
      among other things, strengthening the activity of community care groups, food&#xD;
      supplementation, water treatment, and screening for wasting conducted by families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of the integrated and multisectoral services package (PASIM) is to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence and prevalence of wasting through integrated interventions, including,&#xD;
      among other things, strengthening the activity of community care groups. The members of the&#xD;
      care groups conduct home visits to children aged 6-23 months (or up to 59 months when the&#xD;
      children are under treatment for wasting or have been discharged in the previous 6 months) to&#xD;
      deliver messages for behavioral change related to complementary feeding, health and hygiene ;&#xD;
      deliver nutritional supplement and water purification inputs; improve screening coverage&#xD;
      (training and supervision of families to take the Mid-Upper Arm Circumference measurements,&#xD;
      referral of malnourished cases); and verify adherence to treatment of malnourished cases, in&#xD;
      the health district of Mongo, Guéra province, Chad, Central Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the impact of PASIM will be based on a cluster randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      consisting of 100 villages or clusters of villages. The selected evaluation model will be&#xD;
      that of a comparison of control groups (n=50; no implementation of the intervention) and&#xD;
      intervention (n=50) through the follow-up of 3 cohorts :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Longitudinal in-home follow-up of a semi-open cohort of 1,750 children aged 6 months at&#xD;
           enrollment (included continuously for 7 months and all followed through to the end of&#xD;
           the study, which will last 9 months in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Longitudinal follow-up of all children aged 6-23 months enrolled for wasting treatment,&#xD;
           based on health system records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Longitudinal follow-up at home for 6 months of a closed cohort of 700 children aged 6-23&#xD;
           months at inclusion, discharged from a treatment for acute malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary impact results are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The longitudinal prevalence of wasting at the end of the study (Cohort 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recovery rate (Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of relapse during the 9 months of the intervention (Cohort 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary impact results include, but are not limited to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of wasting during the 9 months of the intervention (Cohort 1) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The screening coverage (cohorts 1 and 3);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of wasting cases enrolled in a treatment program (cohorts 1 and 3);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The adherence to treatment (cohort 2) during the 9 months of the intervention.&#xD;
