    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how Rybelsus® works in people with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and to see if Rybelsus® can lower their blood sugar levels. Participants will get&#xD;
      Rybelsus® as prescribed by the study doctor. The study will last for about 8-10 months.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about how they take their Rybelsus®&#xD;
      tablets. Participants will complete this questionnaire during their normally scheduled visit&#xD;
      with the study doctor. Participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires about their&#xD;
      diabetes treatment. Participants will complete these during their normally scheduled visits&#xD;
      with the study doctor.&#xD;

    <measure>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, change (DTSQc), relative treatment satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Study visit (Visit 3) (week 34-44)</time_frame>
    <description>The change version (DTSQc) has the same 8 items as the status version but is reworded to direct the patients to rate their change in treatment satisfaction compared to before being treated with oral semaglutide. Each question is scored on a scale of -3 to +3 (-3 = much less satisfied now to +3 = much more satisfied now), with 0 (midpoint), representing no change.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, status (DTSQs), change in absolute treatment satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (week 0) to End of Study visit (Visit 3) (week 34-44)</time_frame>
    <description>The status version (DTSQs) provides a measure of how satisfied patients are with their current diabetes treatment. It consists of 8 questions, which are to be answered on a Likert scale from 0 to 6 (0 = very dissatisfied to 6 = very satisfied). Six questions are summed to produce a total Treatment Satisfaction score. The remaining two questions are concerning perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia, respectively.</description>
