    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center therapeutic study&#xD;
      for patients age 3 and older with confirmed diagnosis of Niemann Pick disease type C1 (NPC1).&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 2000&#xD;
      mg/kg dose of Trappsol Cyclo (hydroxypropyl betacyclodextrin) administered intravenously&#xD;
      compared to standard of care. An open-label sub-study in countries following European&#xD;
      Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance will enroll asymptomatic or symptomatic patients from infancy&#xD;
      up to age 3 to evaluate safety in that population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TransportNPC study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled&#xD;
      therapeutic study for 93 patients age 3 and older with confirmed diagnosis of NPC1. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 2000 mg/kg&#xD;
      dose of Trappsol Cyclo (hydroxypropyl betacyclodextrin) administered intravenously by slow&#xD;
      infusion every two weeks in addition to standard of care as compared to placebo and standard&#xD;
      of care. Standard of care may include Miglustat or leucine products that are not currently&#xD;
      under investigation as a therapeutic. Patients will be randomized to receive Trappsol Cyclo&#xD;
      or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. The study duration is 96 weeks, with an unblinded interim analysis&#xD;
      at 48 weeks. An open-label extension of up to 96 weeks follows the interventional study.&#xD;
      Patients whose disease progression worsens by two levels in the Clinical Global Impression of&#xD;
      Severity scale over 12 weeks, starting at week 36, may be moved to open label treatment.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be measured at week 48 and week 96 by a composite score of major disease&#xD;
      features. A sub-study will be conducted in countries following EMA guidance for up to 12&#xD;
      patients age 0 - 3 years who may be asymptomatic. Outcomes for the sub-study are safety,&#xD;
      clinical and caregiver impression of disease.&#xD;
