  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using a mobile application (app)&#xD;
      called how2trak to improve people's experience, wound surveillance, and detection of surgical&#xD;
      site infections (SSI) after colorectal surgery while reducing in-person interactions for&#xD;
      patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will inform the implementation of a full-scale trial to establish if surveillance of&#xD;
      someone's incision and symptoms using how2trak improves SSI detection and management compared&#xD;
      to standard care (involving a single post-operative surgery clinic visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will contribute to a broader dataset of people with SSI surveillance to be&#xD;
      used in developing a clinical decision support system.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Surgical site infections (SSI) are the most common nosocomial infection and occur&#xD;
      in 16.3% of individuals undergoing colorectal surgery at our institution, the majority of&#xD;
      which are identified after discharge from hospital. Patients concerned to have an SSI,&#xD;
      generally present to the emergency department or surgery clinic. Both options for in-person&#xD;
      interaction are costly to the healthcare system and patients, and increase their risk of&#xD;
      COVID-19 exposure. A mobile application How2trak has proven to be beneficial for patients&#xD;
      with complex wounds at our institution by facilitating at-home monitoring and virtual&#xD;
      consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This study aims to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess if&#xD;
      How2trak can improve patients' experience, and detection of surgical site infections after&#xD;
      colorectal surgery while reducing their risk of COVID-19 exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this single-center, prospective feasibility trial, eligible patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective and semi-urgent colorectal surgery will be randomized to either standard care or&#xD;
      How2trak post-operative monitoring of their incision, symptoms, and ostomy function. Patient&#xD;
      self-assessments will be monitored by a nurse specialized in wound and ostomy care who will&#xD;
      meet virtually with the patient as needed. The primary outcome is feasibility as measured by&#xD;
      enrollment, randomization, H2T usability, data extraction, and resource capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: We anticipate this work will help us to better understand the feasibility of using&#xD;
      mobile technology to optimize patients' care after discharge from hospital after colorectal&#xD;
      surgery. Virtual post-surgery wound and symptom monitoring could enhance patient experience,&#xD;
      SSI detection, and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. If this technology is feasible&#xD;
      for our patient population and workflow, next steps will be to assess its effectiveness with&#xD;
      a full-scale randomized controlled trial and explore additional applications including ostomy&#xD;
      monitoring, patient education, and application in other surgical departments.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will undergo virtual monitoring of their incision and symptoms using the How2Trak application(app). Using the app, patients will be asked to answer a series of questions and photograph their surgical incision on post-operative day 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30. Patient responses and photographs entered into the app will be reviewed within 72 hours by a trained Nurse Specialized in Wound, Ostomy and Continence. If a concern is identified the nurse will contact the patient to arrange a virtual visit using the how2trak app or notify the surgeon team (including colorectal surgeons and physician residents) in accordance with clinical discretion.</description>

Data will be captured through the assessments and/or photographs in the app and EPIC. Data sent from how2trak to TOH will be transferred through a secure, access-controlled folder within Office 365 including patient identifiers to allow for merging with EPIC data. Once the data files are merged, they will be deidentified. Only research personnel will have access to the study data. A data monitoring committee will not be developed given the minimal risk and small sample size of this feasibility trial.</ipd_description>
