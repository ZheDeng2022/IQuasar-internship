      This study aims to measure the effects of a per-led educational intervention based on theory&#xD;
      of planned behavior to reduce tobacco, alcohol and khat use and intention to use among&#xD;
      secondary school students over 3-months of follow-up in Dessie and Kombolcha town, Northeast&#xD;
      Ethiopia.A quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group pretest-post-test design will be&#xD;
      carried out among secondary school students of Dessie and Kombolcha Town from April to&#xD;
      August, 2021. Individuals/Students/ in those selected schools will be allocated as&#xD;
      intervention and control group purposively. The study will include 748 students from two&#xD;
      secondary schools for the intervention group and another 748 students for the control group&#xD;
      from other two secondary schools. The per-educational intervention will be planned based on&#xD;
      results of the elicitation and TPB constructs and will be implemented on the experimental&#xD;
      group for three months. Both experimental and control groups will be followed up after three&#xD;
      months of educational intervention using the same tools and methods on same participants&#xD;
      interviewed in pretest survey. Primary outcomes are substance(Cigarette,alcohol and Khat) use&#xD;
      intention and behavior. Secondary outcome are attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived&#xD;
      behavioral control over substance(Cigarette,alcohol and Khat) use. Self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire based on TPB constructs will be used to collect the baseline and follow up&#xD;
      data. In-depth interviews will be employed to explore the salient beliefs about substance&#xD;
      use. The data will be analyzed using SPSS statistical software package version 20 using&#xD;
      appropriate statistical tests including paired t-test, independent t-tests, McNemar and&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression analysis. All statistical tests will be carried out using&#xD;
      two tailed tests with alpha set at 0.05. Information from the interviews will be transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim, analyzed, and coded thematically.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention will be a peer education process on substance use (smoking, drinking and chewing) prevention based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This program is a Level I, primary prevention; thus, it is an early intervention program. The program is targeting students with all substance experience (non-user, current user, and ever users).&#xD;
The intervention aims to encourage anti-substance attitudes and beliefs; foster perceptions of normative support for anti-substance behavior; increase perceptions of control/self-efficacy to resist substance use, increase knowledge and risk perceptions on substance and decrease in intention to use substance and actual substance use behaviors.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>It is the secondary school student motivation in the sense of his/her conscious plan to exert such behavior, intent to use cigarette. It will be assessed by a 3-item self-report questionnaire designed for the study, based on the manual for constructing questionnaires based on the TPB (Francis, et al. 2004). Participants could score between 3 -21, with a low score indicating no intention to use tobacco, over a 3-month period and a high score indicating an intention to use tobacco over a 3-month periods.</description>

Six education sessions will be delivered, with one session occurring each week. Each session will be lasted 40-55 minutes. The intervention will be conducted in 30 groups of selected students from grade 9-12, a pair of peer educators will educate a 30 sized group weekly (30 students /group)/ classrooms at pre-assigned time during class periods. The six sessions will be guided by four student training modules.</description>
