&#xD;
          1. Participants who have any visible skin damage or skin condition (eg, sunburn,&#xD;
             excessively deep tans, uneven skin tones, tattoos, scars, excessive hair, numerous&#xD;
             freckles, or other disfigurations) in or around the application site which, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigative personnel, will interfere with the evaluation of the test&#xD;
             site reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who have a history of or have active forms of dermatitides/eczematous&#xD;
             conditions (eg, contact dermatitis, seborrhhoeic, discoid, gravitational, asteatotic&#xD;
             and dishydrotic eczema) or other inflammatory skin diseases(eg, psoriasis, viral&#xD;
             infection, fungal infection, bacterial infection) that would interfere with evaluation&#xD;
             of the test site reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or&#xD;
             active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant&#xD;
             inappropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Acute disease state (unstable medical condition such as nausea, vomiting, fever or&#xD;

             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 4 months (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study&#xD;
             intervention used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A positive urine drug test at screening and/or Day -1.&#xD;

             5 minutes of supine rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Baseline 12 lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may&#xD;
             affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTcF&#xD;
             interval &gt;450 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third&#xD;

             allergy to any of the study intervention or any components in the study intervention&#xD;
             or history of hypersensitivity; or allergic reactions to any of the study&#xD;
             preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Not willing to refrain from shaving (Note: shaving around face is permitted), the use&#xD;
             of depilatories or other hair-removal activities, antiperspirants, lotions, skin&#xD;
             creams, fragrances or perfumes, or body oils (eg, baby oil; coconut oil), use of hair&#xD;
             products, hair gels, and hair oil in the treatment areas for 48 hours prior to&#xD;
             admission to the CRU and for the duration of the stay in the CRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia only if heparin&#xD;
             is planned to flush intravenous catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations&#xD;
             section of this protocol.&#xD;
