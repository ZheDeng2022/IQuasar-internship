  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomized trial in which clinics will be randomized to the intervention or&#xD;
      the control arm. The purpose of this study is to assess if receiving alerts can help&#xD;
      providers manage the scheduling of monthly cabotegravir + rilpivirine long-acting injections&#xD;
      for the treatment of HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel long-acting HIV antiretroviral therapy has recently been approved by the FDA:&#xD;
      cabotegravir and rilpivirine delivered through intramuscular injection. These injections&#xD;
      should be administered monthly, on the same day of the month as the initiation injections, up&#xD;
      to 7 days before or after the date of the scheduled monthly injection visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cluster randomized trial in which clinics will be randomized to the intervention or&#xD;
      the control arm. Providers in the intervention group will receive alerts to remind them when&#xD;
      patients are due for their injections, or if they missed their treatment window. Providers in&#xD;
      the control group will not receive alerts and will manage injections as per their clinic's&#xD;
      standard process. Surveys will be administered to understand the utility of the alerts for&#xD;
      the management of these injections.&#xD;
