  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, there are several methods that can be used for grade III hemorrhoidal disease,&#xD;
      according to Goligher classificiation. Milligan Morgan hemorrhoidectomy is considered the&#xD;
      most effective treatment in many centers, even if characterized by marked postoperative pain.&#xD;
      Among the minimally invasive alternative procedures, the transanal hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      dearterialization (HAL - ligation of the hemorrhoidal artery) Doppler-guided or without&#xD;
      Doppler, associated with mucopexy, seems to gain success, with promising results but still&#xD;
      awaiting high-grade scientific evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of this background, we decided to carry out a multi-center survey on a national&#xD;
      scale, retrospectively including patients diagnosed with Goligher's grade III hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease, surgically treated with hemorrhoidectomy or dearterialization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be of a multicentre observational retrospective type. Any Italian Center&#xD;
      belonging to the Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery (SICCR) in which at least 30&#xD;
      procedures are performed per year for haemorrhoidal disease can join the study. Each Center&#xD;
      must identify a Head of the study and a maximum of 2 collaborators. Each Center participating&#xD;
      in the Study will be provided with a data collection sheet for completion. The information&#xD;
      regarding the follow-up may come from a telephone survey or an outpatient clinical visit. In&#xD;
      both cases, the patient will be asked to express informed consent by filling in the form&#xD;
      attached to the information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients treated with the analysed methods (Milligan Morgan or&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal dearterialization) in the period comprising the 4 years prior to the adhesion of&#xD;
      the center to the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will need to have at least 24 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the inevitable effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on surgical and outpatient&#xD;
      activities, the study period is considered valid until February 2020. Data regarding surgery&#xD;
      or follow-up after March 2020 will not be included in analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of 435 patients for each group is expected (870 total patients) considering&#xD;
      a power of 80%, of which at least 50 in this facility, over the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical recovery is defined as the disappearance of the proctological symptoms reported by&#xD;
      the patient (post-operative symptom score equal to 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead, anatomical healing is defined as the absence of haemorrhoidal pathology on objective&#xD;
      examination (maximum Gholigher's grade 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse is defined as the persistence or reappearance of the reported symptoms and the&#xD;
      finding on physical examination of hemorrhoidal disease of a degree equal to or higher than&#xD;
      the assessment attributed during the preoperative examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical examination is conducted by the same medical staff who made the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms will be assessed using the symptom score system proposed by Giordano et al.,&#xD;
      according to which the patient is asked to assign a score to each parameter evaluated,&#xD;
      ranging from 0 (absence of symptoms) to 4 (daily symptoms or at each evacuation). The&#xD;
      parameters evaluated are bleeding, prolapse, the need for manual reduction, pain or&#xD;
      discomfort and the impact on quality of life. An overall score of 0 corresponds to the total&#xD;
      absence of symptoms, while an overall score of 20 indicates the worst possible&#xD;
      symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to assign a score to the symptoms present before the surgery and&#xD;
      therefore 24 months after the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the data in the literature, the following factors could be associated with a&#xD;
      higher risk of relapse: female sex, presence of associated mucosal prolapse.&#xD;
