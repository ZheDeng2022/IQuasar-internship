    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial to determine if a 6 months of shared medical appointments will&#xD;
      results in clinically and statistically significant weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese patients will be randomized to either the control or intervention group. The&#xD;
      intervention group will participate in 90-minute group visits occurring weekly for 4 weeks,&#xD;
      then biweekly for a total of 26 weeks/15 visits. Each visit will focus on intensive lifestyle&#xD;
      changes: calorie restriction to produce a 500-750 calorie deficit, increased physical&#xD;
      activity, and behavioral therapies including regular self-monitoring of food intake, physical&#xD;
      activity, and weight. Additional behavioral therapies that will be offered include techniques&#xD;
      for reducing stress, maximizing sleep, and controlling environments. Further, these patients&#xD;
      will each have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with a member of the research team at the&#xD;
      end of each visit in order to discuss individual goals and progress.&#xD;

    <description>Body weight will be measured at the initial and final visits using the Tanita DC-430 body composition analyzer for participants in both groups and documented in the medical record. Percent of body weight lost will be calculated for each participant and the percentage of participants who lose 5% of body weight will be included in the primary outcome.</description>

    <description>BMI will be calculated using weight and height measured at the initial and final visits and the difference will be calculated for each participant and documented in the medical record. Weights will be measured using the Tanita DC-430 body composition analyzer and heights measured using a stadiometer on a physicians scale. The mean for each group will be reported.</description>

    <description>Body weight will be measured at the initial and final visits using the Tanita DC-430 body composition analyzer for participants in both groups and documented in the medical record.

    <description>The group undergoing the intervention will participate in 90-minute group visits occurring weekly for 4 weeks, then biweekly for a total of 26 weeks/15 visits. Each visit will focus on intensive lifestyle changes. Further, these patients will each have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with a member of the research team at the end of each visit in order to discuss individual goals and progress. Pharmacotherapy therapy changes will be recommended to reduce or avoid use of medication which may contribute to weight gain and medications for weight loss will be prescribed as an individualized treatment strategy during one-on-one time with the pharmacist or physician if the patient can afford it and no contraindications exists.</description>
