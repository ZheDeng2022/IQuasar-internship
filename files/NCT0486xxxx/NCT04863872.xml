  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe hypoglycemia is the most feared complication of medications used to lower blood&#xD;
      glucose levels in patients with diabetes. Severe hypoglycemia, defined as plasma glucose low&#xD;
      enough to require assistance, has been linked to poor health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      emotional and interpersonal challenges, car accidents, serious falls, cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      dementia, and death. Older adults with type 2 diabetes are particularly vulnerable to the&#xD;
      complications of severe hypoglycemia. Each year, approximately 11% of patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes self-report severe hypoglycemia episodes. An estimated 14% of emergency&#xD;
      hospitalizations of older Americans for adverse drug events implicate insulin and 11%&#xD;
      implicate oral hypoglycemic agents. One in four diabetes-related hospital admissions is for&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare two ways to reduce severe hypoglycemia in people with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The two methods to be compared are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proactive care management. This will be a nurse outreach call which is similar to the&#xD;
           usual care that people with type 2 diabetes get to reduce their risk of severe&#xD;
           hypoglycemia, but given in advance rather than in response to a recent severe&#xD;
           hypoglycemia event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The same proactive care management (nurse outreach call) plus enrollment in my hypo&#xD;
           compass, a health education program aimed at improving awareness of hypoglycemia and&#xD;
           preventing severe hypoglycemia. This program has been shown to reduce severe&#xD;
           hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes but has not been tested in persons with type&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that proactive care management plus my hypo compass will be more effective&#xD;
      than proactive care management alone at preventing self-reported severe hypoglycemia in&#xD;
      adults with type 2 diabetes at high risk for severe hypoglycemia. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      measured using surveys at the beginning of the study and 14-months later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-arm (128 per arm), cluster-randomized, comparative effectiveness study of&#xD;
      two evidence-based approaches to preventing severe hypoglycemia. We will use a validated&#xD;
      Electronic Health Record (EHR)-based tool to identify patients with type 2 diabetes at&#xD;
      intermediate to high risk for severe hypoglycemia. Within this population, we will recruit&#xD;
      participants who either have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia or self-report a severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia event in the prior 12 months and are 50 years or older. Participants must be&#xD;
      members of Kaiser Permanente Washington and identified by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, we will compare patients who receive proactive care management from&#xD;
      nurses to patients receiving proactive care management plus my hypo compass, a structured&#xD;
      educational intervention that reduces the frequency of severe hypoglycemia in individuals&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes. In both groups, we will use proactive care management to assess and&#xD;
      provide evidence-based care for impaired awareness of hypoglycemia and other potential&#xD;
      contributors to severe hypoglycemia risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcome is participant-reported severe hypoglycemia, to capture all events,&#xD;
      including those not involving clinical care. We will also examine biochemical measures of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia measured using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), participant-reported&#xD;
      hypoglycemia awareness, fear of hypoglycemia, and emergency department visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations for severe hypoglycemia. We will conduct a process evaluation to assess the&#xD;
      fidelity of implementation and clarify the causal pathway.&#xD;
