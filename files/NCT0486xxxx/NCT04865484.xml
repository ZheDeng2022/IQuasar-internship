  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stenosis is one of the most frequent complications in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). In&#xD;
      particular, CD patients with multi segmental intestinal strictures are often faced with short&#xD;
      bowel syndrome after repeated or extensive surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strictureplasty conserves bowel and minimizes the risk of developing short-bowel syndrome in&#xD;
      the short-term and, probably, long-term. Strictureplasty has become an established surgical&#xD;
      option in the management of obstructive Crohn's disease, especially for multiple short&#xD;
      fibrous strictures. It is particularly suitable for patients at risk for short-bowel&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic management shows good efficacy and safety in the treatment of strictures in CD&#xD;
      patients. The ECCO guideline recommended that endoscopic balloon dilatation is suitable to&#xD;
      treat short [&lt;5 cm] strictures of the terminal ileum in CD. Recently, Lan et al. reported&#xD;
      that endoscopic stricturotomy appeared to be more effective in treating CD patients with&#xD;
      anastomotic stricture than endoscopic balloon dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no scientific evidence for determining the most appropriate treatment for&#xD;
      multiple fibrosis stenosis. We designed a prospective randomized comparative study of the&#xD;
      treatment of multisegmental fibrostenosing Crohn's disease (surgical resection plus&#xD;
      endoscopic stricturotomy versus surgical resection plus strictureplasty).&#xD;
