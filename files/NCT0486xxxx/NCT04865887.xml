  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial of combination therapy of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic cervical cancer that had failed first line of therapy.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab will overcome vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated immunosuppression to enhance the response of&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic cervical cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this phase II study is to determine the objective response rate&#xD;
      (partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]) of specific pembrolizumab-lenvatinib&#xD;
      combination therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cervical cancer. The&#xD;
      phase II portion of the trial will follow Simon's minimax two-stage design1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Stage 1, 11 patients will be accrued. If 1 or fewer patients among these 11 patients&#xD;
      achieve an objective response with the pembrolizumab-lenvatinib combination therapy, the&#xD;
      combination therapy will be rejected and the trial stopped. However, if there are 2 or more&#xD;
      patients who exhibit response in the Stage 1, then an additional 24 patients will be entered&#xD;
      into the Stage 2, for a total of 35 patients in this phase II study. If 9 or more patients&#xD;
      exhibit response among these 35 patients, then the treatment will be considered for further&#xD;
      investigation. Any unplanned interim analysis will utilize the sequential conditional&#xD;
      probability ratio test (SCPRT)2, which allows an early assessment of statistical evidence for&#xD;
      both efficacy and futility, and provides a discordance probability that early trend could be&#xD;
      reversed should the trial continue to enroll all 35 patients.&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

             arrhythmia requiring medical treatment at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The&#xD;
             degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery)&#xD;
             should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated&#xD;
             with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Subjects having &gt; 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing unless a 24-hour urine&#xD;
