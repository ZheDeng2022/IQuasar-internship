    <textblock>
      The study analysed direct levobupivacaine instillation in surgical wound and its&#xD;
      effectiveness in postoperative pain control. Half participants received 0,5 % levobupivacaine&#xD;
      and the other half received 0,9% saline solution&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia is one of the most common conditions that requires elective surgical repair&#xD;
      in children. The issue of post-operative pain in children is important, particularly because&#xD;
      the surgical intervention per se is a stressful experience, after which the level of&#xD;
      stressors in the recovery period should be minimized. Stress, including the pain in the&#xD;
      postoperative period, could contribute to a delayed postoperative wound healing and recovery.&#xD;
      Also, untreated acute pain could interfere with cognitive function, immune response as well&#xD;
      as lead to the development of chronic postsurgical pain. For this reason, it is vital to&#xD;
      reduce the painful sensations over the postoperative period as much as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levobupivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic. Evidence from animal models and human&#xD;
      volunteer participants showed that levobupivacaine has favourable effects on cardiovascular&#xD;
      and central nervous systems. Clinical studies have also showed that levobupivacaine has a&#xD;
      very low risk of systemic toxicity. A combination of levobupivacaine with non-opioid&#xD;
      analgesics could have a beneficial role in the postoperative recovery from inguinal hernia&#xD;
      surgery in terms of pain relief. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness&#xD;
      of levobupivacaine instillation combined with the routine postoperative non-opioid analgesia&#xD;
      in children who underwent inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very important for children to leave the hospital without additional support. Instilled&#xD;
      levobupivacaine applied directly to the wound, currently interrupting transmission of the&#xD;
      painful stimuli from the site of major trauma. The dose of applied levobupivacaine in this&#xD;
      study is 2 times lower than that administered for caudal block and 4 times lower than the&#xD;
      maximum dose. Analgesic effectiveness of this procedure is measured by the frequency of&#xD;
      administration of a mixture of ibuprofen and acetaminophen over 24 hours after surgery, and&#xD;
      duration of time between the administration of two doses.&#xD;

    <description>Once the hernia tissue had been surgically managed, the wound was sutured in layers and a solution of 0.5% levobupivacaine, 0.5 mg/kg (0.1 ml/kg), was instilled into the wound of children in the experimental group before suturing of the abdominal fascia. That same amount of 0.9% saline was given to children in the control group. The absorption of the solution took approximately 3 minutes, after which the wound was sutured. After completion of wound suturing, all children received 20 mg/kg of paracetamol administered as a rectal suppository.</description>
