      The overall goal of the VVIRTUOSO study is to determine the incidence of VTE including&#xD;
      symptomatic DVT and PE after hospital discharge in patients with COVID-19 by implementing a&#xD;
      pragmatic patient-centred prospective virtual VTE monitoring program in Canada and the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 induces a highly prothrombotic state particularly&#xD;
      among hospitalized patients based on abnormal coagulation parameters and high rates of venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE). Reported rates of VTE among hospitalized ward (3%) and critically ill&#xD;
      (17% to 69%) patients with COVID-19 suggest that the risk of VTE is substantially higher than&#xD;
      patients with other acute medical illnesses. VTE, which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&#xD;
      and pulmonary embolism (PE), is one of the most common preventable causes of&#xD;
      hospital-associated morbidity and mortality, and most events occur after hospital discharge.&#xD;
      The incidence of VTE after hospitalization for COVID-19 is not currently known. However, the&#xD;
      combination of COVID-induced hypercoagulability, ongoing recovery, reduced mobility, advanced&#xD;
      age, and comorbidities likely confers a high risk of VTE in this setting. The overall goal of&#xD;
      the VVIRTUOSO study is to determine the incidence of VTE including symptomatic DVT and PE&#xD;
      after hospital discharge in patients with COVID-19 by implementing a pragmatic&#xD;
      patient-centred prospective virtual VTE monitoring program at 12 sites in Canada and the&#xD;
      United States. We will also explore risk factors for VTE post-discharge, characterize the use&#xD;
      of pharmacological measures for VTE prevention, assess patient awareness of VTE and provide&#xD;
      VTE education.&#xD;
