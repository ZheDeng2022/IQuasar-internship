  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open label, non-randomized, cross-over study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the trial for approximately 18 weeks and will use the DIMI RRT System for&#xD;
      their dialysis treatments for all study phases, according to the schedule outlined below. The&#xD;
      schedule will consist of four phases and the number of sessions per week will be prescribed&#xD;
      the same throughout Phase 1 to 4.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Phase 1: Run-in. Duration: 2 weeks. Potential Subjects will undergo dialysis treatments&#xD;
           3 - 5 times per week for up to 2 weeks In-Center. Treatments will be administered by&#xD;
           study staff during this phase. Study eligibility will be assessed for both the potential&#xD;
           Subject and their Care Partner after completion of the run-in period. Potential subjects&#xD;
           and Care Partners who meet all eligibility criteria will be invited to Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2: In-Center Treatment. Duration: 6 weeks. Subjects will undergo dialysis&#xD;
           treatments 3 - 5 times per week for approximately 6 weeks (for a total of 18 - 30&#xD;
           sessions) In-Center. Treatments will be administered by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase 3: Cross-over Period from In-Center to In-Home environment. Duration: 4 weeks.&#xD;
           Care Partners will undergo the DIMI training, then perform dialysis treatments on&#xD;
           Subjects 3 - 5 times per week for approximately 4 weeks (for a total of 12 - 20&#xD;
           sessions). Treatments will be completed In-Center under the supervision of hemodialysis&#xD;
           nurses and at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Phase 4: In-Home Treatment. Duration: 6 weeks. Care Partners will perform dialysis&#xD;
           treatments to the Subject 3 - 5 times per week for approximately 6 weeks (for a total of&#xD;
           18 - 30 sessions) in a home environment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Delivery of the prescribed fluid volume, defined as delivered volume that is at least 90% of prescribed volume at each in-home dialysis session.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The delivered volume is the total effluent volume (spent dialysate plus net ultrafiltrate) as measured by the device by means of 2 independent and calibrated electronic scales. The effluent volume is an effective means of assessing the usability of the machine in different environments and by different people, as any early interruption of treatment will result in a lower delivered volume.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Delivery of a standardized weekly Kt/V based on lab data.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy endpoint is the delivery of a standardized weekly Kt/V of greater than or equal to 2.1, that will be measured weekly. The standardized weekly Kt/V value will be computed by the Sponsor and included in the study database from laboratory data provided and recorded by the site via the Case Report Forms (CRFs).</description>
