      Objective is to compare the effects of routine physical therapy with and without low&#xD;
      intensity blood flow restriction on pain and quadriceps muscle strength in women with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single blinded randomized controlled trial conducted at Department of Physiotherapy,&#xD;
      University of Lahore Teaching Hospital, Defense Road, Lahore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total 60 participants were randomly assigned in to two groups, with 30 in each group The&#xD;
      intervention group received routine physiotherapy program combined with Low Intensity Blood&#xD;
      Flow Restriction Technique (LI-BFR. While control group were treated with only routine&#xD;
      physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamometer was used to assess the knee extensor strength while Knee injury and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis outcome score was used to record any exacerbation in pain and effects of BFR&#xD;
      on activities of daily living. Training load determined 20% of 1RM. Data analysis had done on&#xD;
      SPSS version 23.&#xD;

      nonparametric test Friedman test was for comparison within the groups and Mann Whitney U test&#xD;
      was used for comparison between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization had done through the sealed envelope method. After allocation subjects had&#xD;
      received their treatment protocals.&#xD;

    <description>Patients of Interventional group were treated with routine physiotherapy program combined with LI-BFR consist of 10 minutes' session 3 per week for 12 weeks. In order to determine the training load 20% of 1RM, participants had performed knee extension in full range with a challenging weight. After each test, participants rated their perceived exertion level on (RPE) scale to determine the difficulty of the resistance. The derived 1RM was used to determine the 20% 1RM load used for low-load training. Blood flow restriction proximal to the working muscles achieved through using pressure cuffs. The cuff was applied to the proximal thigh. During week 1 the inflation pressure was 100mmHg. Final exercise pressure based the week of the training. Quadriceps size was measured by tape measures thigh</description>
