  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex practical BLS training have been stopped all over the world due to COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      in 2020. While launching the new Simulation Centre at Medical Faculty of Masaryk University&#xD;
      in Brno, Czech Republic, teachers and students have been dealing with the risk of COVID-19&#xD;
      transmission during the simulation training. One of the highest risks for the transfer of&#xD;
      COVID-19 between the medical students is during the mouth-to-mouth ventilation training in&#xD;
      BLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been assumed that rescuers during BLS simulation training with use of breathable&#xD;
      nanofiber respirator with layers with accelerated copper can provide efficient mouth-to-mouth&#xD;
      rescue breaths to the mannequin in compliance with safety rules.&#xD;

      The main aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of mouth-to-mouth ventilation through&#xD;
      breathable self-sterilizing nanofiber respirators with accelerated copper in COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic time. 100 volunteers (medical students trained as BLS trainers an medical students&#xD;
      trained in BLS) will provide 2 minutes cycle of BLS according to European Resuscitation&#xD;
      Council (ERC) guidelines 2021 wearing the breathable self-sterilizing nanofiber respirators&#xD;
      with accelerated copper in three different mannequins: Professional Adult Medium Skin CPR-AED&#xD;
      Training Manikin with CPR Monitor (Prestan), Resusci Anne QCPR AED (Laerdal), Resusci Baby&#xD;
      QCPR (Laerdal). The mannequin will be utilised in a randomised order. The efficiency of&#xD;
      mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths as &quot;visible breath &quot; and &quot;not visible breath&quot; will be recorded.&#xD;
      In first BLS mannequin, the visibility of chest rising by the observer will be recorded. In&#xD;
      two other mannequins, the ventilation metrics and each rescue breath evaluation in QCPR Skill&#xD;
      Reporter will be recorded. Overall, 3 levels of visible breath according to the relation to&#xD;
      set optimal breath volume (400 to 600 mL in adult, 30 to 50 mL in infant): low volume breath&#xD;
      (below 400ml in adults and below 30ml in infant), optimal volume breath (between 400-600ml in&#xD;
      adult and between 30-50 ml in infant), high volume breath (over 600ml in adult and over 50ml&#xD;
      in infant) will be evaluated. For the primary analysis of efficiency of mouth-to-mouth&#xD;
      ventilation, data from all three mannequins using outcome No breath / Visible breath will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Secondary analysis will utilize data from two mannequins where detailed&#xD;
      stratification No Breath / low / optimal / high Visible breath is possible. The mean volume&#xD;
      of rescue breaths in the 2-minute cycle, average pause, longest pause, success in achieving&#xD;
      the optimal breath volume, adverse events will be recorded. Regarding the technique of&#xD;
      provided mouth-to-mouth ventilation, head tilt in adult or neutral position in infant and&#xD;
      pinching of the nose will be evaluated.&#xD;
