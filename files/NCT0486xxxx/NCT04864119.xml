      The primary objectives of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the prevalence of coronary artery disease among patients with type 2&#xD;
           myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the prevalence of hemodynamically significant stenosis among patients with&#xD;
           type 2 myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients with type 2 myocardial infarction will have a&#xD;
      high burden of coronary artery plaque and a high prevalence of obstructive coronary artery&#xD;
      disease with hemodynamic significance.&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Emergency Department or admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital with an&#xD;
      elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin will be identified daily by the Clinical Core&#xD;
      Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital. The study investigators will then review the&#xD;
      electronic medical record for each of these patients to determine if the cause of the&#xD;
      patients' elevated high-sensitivity troponin is a type 2 myocardial infarction. If so, their&#xD;
      record will be reviewed to determine if they meet the inclusion criteria for enrollment and&#xD;
      to ensure no exclusion criteria are present. Patients with a type 2 MI who are eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment, will then be approached during their hospital stay to discuss the study and their&#xD;
      interest in consenting and enrolling in our study. Prior to approaching the patient, the&#xD;
      responding clinician treating the patient will be contacted to obtain the primary team's&#xD;
      approval before approaching the patient. In addition to confirming that the patient is an&#xD;
      acceptable candidate for the research, a clinician from the primary team must introduce the&#xD;
      study to the patient and obtain the patient's permission prior to being contacted by our&#xD;
      study staff. 50 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study visits and parameters to be measured (e.g. laboratory tests, x-rays, and other&#xD;
           testing) Patients who enroll in the study will undergo a CT coronary angiogram during&#xD;
           their index admission. In addition, patients will have the option of providing a blood&#xD;
           sample for future research. These biorepository samples may be used in the future for&#xD;
           biomarker analysis to examine associations between serum biomarkers of cardiac injury,&#xD;
           inflammation, and atherosclerosis, and coronary plaque presence/ severity and for&#xD;
           predicting future cardiovascular events up to 1-year. Genetic testing will not be&#xD;
           performed on these samples. There will be no required follow-up visits following their&#xD;
           index admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Drugs to be used (dose, method, schedule of administration, dose modifications,&#xD;
           toxicities).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will receive nitroglycerin prior to their CT coronary angiogram in the form of&#xD;
           a transdermal patch (0.8 mg/h [2 x 0.4 mg/h]; Nitro-Dur, Merck &amp; Co. Inc., White-House&#xD;
           Station, New Jersey). Nitroglycerin will be administered at least 45 minutes before&#xD;
           electrocardiography-gated coronary CTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Iohexol (OMNIPAQUE-350) 350 mg iodine/ml solution 150ml will be used as an iodinated&#xD;
           contrast agent for the scan as per standard protocol at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Devices to be used Patients will undergo a CT coronary angiogram. Once the images are&#xD;
           obtained, they will be sent to HeartFlow Inc for fractional flow analysis using their&#xD;
           FDA-approved CT-FFR software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Procedures/surgical interventions, etc. As this is a prospective observational study, no&#xD;
           procedures or interventions will be made. Any significant findings from the CT scan will&#xD;
           be relayed to the patient and the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data to be collected and when it will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who enroll in this study, the following information will be collected during&#xD;
      their index admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information Past Medical History Home cardiac medications Cause of type 2&#xD;
      myocardial infarction Laboratory information Cardiac testing Results of CT coronary angiogram&#xD;
      including presence and severity of coronary artery disease, total coronary plaque volume,&#xD;
      calcified plaque volume, non-calcified plaque volume, and LV mass Results of CT-FFR Results&#xD;
      of invasive coronary angiogram (including intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography) if performed In-hospital outcomes including mortality, acute kidney injury,&#xD;
      recurrent MI, and stroke Discharge cardiac medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the electronic medical record, the following data will be collected via chart review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-year outcomes including all-cause hospital readmission, recurrent MI, heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalization, stroke, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source of subjects and recruitment methods To screen for patients with type 2 MI the&#xD;
      investigators will first identify patients at Massachusetts General Hospital with an elevated&#xD;
      high-sensitivity cardiac troponin on a daily basis through the MGH Central Laboratory. For&#xD;
      patients with elevated troponin, the investigators will review their medical records to&#xD;
      determine if the cause of their troponin elevation is a type 2 MI. For patients with type 2&#xD;
      MI, their medical record will be reviewed to ensure there are eligible for enrollment based&#xD;
      on our inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOSTATISCAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Specific data variables being collected for the study During the index hospitalization&#xD;
      Demographic information Past Medical History Home cardiac medications Cause of type 2&#xD;
      myocardial infarction Laboratory information Cardiac testing Results of CT coronary angiogram&#xD;
      including presence and severity of coronary artery disease, total coronary plaque volume,&#xD;
      calcified plaque volume, non-calcified plaque volume, and LV mass Results of CT-FFR Results&#xD;
      of invasive coronary angiogram (including intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography) if performed In-hospital outcomes including mortality, acute kidney injury,&#xD;
      recurrent MI, and stroke Discharge cardiac medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the electronic medical record, the following data will be collected via chart review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-year outcomes including all-cause hospital readmission, recurrent MI, heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalization, stroke, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA &amp; SAFETY MONITORING The principal investigator will review any adverse events that occur&#xD;
      during the CT coronary angiogram. This will involve reviewing the patient's medical record&#xD;
      for any serious or life-threatening allergic reactions, kidney injury from contrast material&#xD;
      necessitating initiation of dialysis, and serious adverse reactions to nitroglycerin. This&#xD;
      review will occur monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others including adverse events will be&#xD;
      reported to the study sponsor and the Partners Human Research Committee (IRB) by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator within 5 working days (7 calendar days) in accordance with Partners&#xD;
      Human Research Committee unanticipated problems including adverse events reporting&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drs. McCarthy and Januzzi will be responsible for monitoring the accuracy and completeness of&#xD;
      case report form entries into REDCap and the informed consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIVACY &amp; CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be collected and stored on Partners REDCap (Research Electronic Data&#xD;
      Capture), a secure, electronic SSL-encrypted, web-based application. Only study investigators&#xD;
      will have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples obtained will be stored on-site at Massachusetts General Hospital in a secure&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deidentified data collected by study investigators may be shared with the study Sponsor. This&#xD;
      may include patient demographic data, medical history, cardiac test results, and patient&#xD;
      outcomes. No identifiable data or sensitive information will be shared with the Sponsor. As&#xD;
      this is a single-center study, no data will be shared with other collaborators outside of&#xD;
      Partners. No specimens or data will be stored at collaborating sites outside of partners.&#xD;
