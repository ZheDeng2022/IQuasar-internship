    <textblock>
      The sun emits numerous radiations, of which 10% are constituted by ultraviolet light. Only&#xD;
      ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-320 nm) and ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400 nm) reach the surface of the&#xD;
      earth. Poor penetrating UVB reach only to the deepest layers of the epidermis and cause DNA&#xD;
      damage. UVA rays pass through the epidermis and reach the dermis due to their greater&#xD;
      penetration property. UVA mainly generate intracellular oxidative stress. We can distinguish&#xD;
      short UVA (320-340 nm) and long UVA (340-400 nm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sun exposure causes short-term consequences such as sunburn and reflects a reaction erythema,&#xD;
      inflammatory type, and stimulation of pigmentation. One of the long-term deleterious&#xD;
      consequences is represented by the development of skin cancers, which are the most dramatic&#xD;
      result of sun exposure and are associated with mutations resulting from DNA damage badly&#xD;
      repaired. The other long-term consequence is illustrated by the clinical signs of photoaging,&#xD;
      associated with a major disruption in the dermal structure, linked both the decrease in&#xD;
      collagen content and an increase in its degradation by some enzymes in the family of MMPs&#xD;
      (matrix metalloproteinases). At the cellular and molecular level, many genes have their basal&#xD;
      expression modulated in response to UV exposure (transcription factors and genes involved in&#xD;
      DNA repair, inflammation, apoptosis, cell adhesion). Chronic sun exposure is also associated&#xD;
      with the development or aggravation of pigmentary disorders, zones of hypo- or&#xD;
      hyperpigmentation, actinic lentigo, melasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect ourselves from harmful effects of sun exposure, solar formulas applied to the&#xD;
      skin, constitute a &quot;barrier&quot; against UV radiation. Currently, the most efficient sunscreen&#xD;
      formulas from the market can absorb very efficiently and most of UVB and UVA rays. However, a&#xD;
      part of long UVA (370-400nm) is not absorbed by these formulas, while these wavelengths seem&#xD;
      to be involved in the generation of adverse biological effects on the skin, which may&#xD;
      participate in clinical consequences of sun exposure, such as photo-aging and carcinogenesis.&#xD;
      Biologically these wavelengths have been found to induce alteration at the tissue level, in&#xD;
      particular the dermal layer, but also at the cellular and molecular levels, with for example&#xD;
      the generation of oxidative stress and DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal in vitro studies on skin cells in culture or on reconstructed skin showed that long&#xD;
      UVA were the generators of oxidative stress, damage to DNA, cytotoxicity and modulation of&#xD;
      genes or proteins involved in inflammation, the response to oxidative stress or photo-aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New sunscreens that are able to absorb beyond 370 nm, are now available. We have shown in an&#xD;
      in vitro cultured cells or reconstructed skin that adding this type of filter in a state of&#xD;
      the art formulation, allowed to shift the absorption spectrum beyond 370 nm and more. Thus it&#xD;
      is possible to significantly reduce the biological impact of UVA long. These in vitro results&#xD;
      strongly suggest a gain of biological protection by shifting the spectrum absorption beyond&#xD;
      370 nm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical proof of concept study is to demonstrate that the addition of&#xD;
      the E212657, a new long UVA filter, in a reference formula improves protection against UV day&#xD;
      light exposure in vivo in human. Safety studies have demonstrated that E212657 is a safe&#xD;
      product (Non phototoxic, non irritant, non sensitizer, non photosensitizer and non&#xD;
      Genotoxic). In vitro studies have shown versus reference a photo-protector effect on&#xD;
      fibroblast, MMP1 and Cytokines after a 60J/cm² exposure. A first in vivo study&#xD;
      (ACR-LUVA-1311) was performed in 20 subjects with a single UVA long exposure (50J/cm2). This&#xD;
      study has shown that active E212657 associated with SPF 15 or SPF 30 provides a better&#xD;
      protection than the reference SPF30 alone with significant and clinically pertinent results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second in vivo study (ACR/UVDL1/1319) was performed in 7 subjects in order to determine a&#xD;
      suitable UVDL dose to have a residual pigmentation under SPF15 of SPF30 in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Results showed that 7 days with SPF15 under 40J/cm2 and with SPF30 under 70J/cm2&#xD;
      were sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new study will be performed with this determinate UVDL dose in order to demonstrate the&#xD;
      performance of the E212657 associated with SPF15 or SPF30 in day light photo-protection.&#xD;
