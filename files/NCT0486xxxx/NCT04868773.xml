      treatment will be eligible to participate for this study. After meeting the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, patients will be given a IP regimen consisting of cabozantinib 20 - 40 mg given&#xD;
      orally everyday for 28 days, trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS102) 25 - 35 mg/m2 on Days 1 - 5 and&#xD;
      Days 8 - 12 every 28 days, and peg-filgrastim 6 mg subcutaneously on Day 13 every 28 days.&#xD;
      Tumor assessments will be completed by CT/MRI every 8 weeks during the first year of&#xD;
      treatment and every 3 months after the first year until patient comes off treatment.&#xD;
