      This is phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled Ampion in adults with&#xD;
      respiratory distress due to COVID-19&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the pandemic&#xD;
      spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has a high rate of infection, has a high&#xD;
      rate of hospitalization, has overwhelmed healthcare systems, and can be fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ampion is the low molecular weight filtrate of human serum albumin with the in vitro ability&#xD;
      to modulate inflammatory cytokine levels. Ampion has the potential to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes for COVID-19 patients by reducing inflammatory cytokines correlated with the disease&#xD;
      and respiratory complications, such as Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of Ampion on mortality and clinical outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with respiratory distress due to COVID-19.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Male or female, ≥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosed with COVID-19, as evaluated by laboratory diagnostic test or diagnosis based&#xD;
             on radiological clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Baseline severity categorization of severe or critical COVID-19 infection per FDA&#xD;
             Guidance for developing drugs and biological products for COVID-19 (February 2021):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Severe COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Symptoms suggestive of severe systemic illness with COVID-19, which could&#xD;
                       include shortness of breath or respiratory distress&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Clinical signs indicative of severe systemic illness with COVID-19, such as&#xD;
                       respiratory rate ≥ 30 per minute, heart rate ≥ 125 per minute, SpO2 ≤ 93% on&#xD;
                       room air at or PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Critical COVID-19:&#xD;
