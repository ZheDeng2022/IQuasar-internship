  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study to be performed will allow visualization of skin micropores following microneedle&#xD;
      treatment in healthy subjects in differing racial/ethnic backgrounds.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transdermal drug delivery (by way of patches that adhere to the skin and deliver drug in a&#xD;
      time-dependent fashion) allows for systemic drug delivery through the skin, while avoiding&#xD;
      many of the side effects and challenges associated with oral or intravenous drug delivery.&#xD;
      One significant challenge limiting the number of drug compounds that can be transdermally&#xD;
      delivered is the hydrophobic nature of the skin, which provides a highly efficient barrier&#xD;
      against the absorption of drug molecules. Micropatches are small patches with tiny&#xD;
      projections that are a minimally invasive way to allow drug molecules to cross the skin by&#xD;
      creating micron-sized channels (also called micropores) in the skin, thereby increasing its&#xD;
      permeability. Micropatches have been safely used in hundreds of patients for administration&#xD;
      of drugs and vaccines through the skin. Studies have demonstrated that micropatch treatment&#xD;
      is relatively painless and well-tolerated by most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following micropatch treatment, the skin must heal the micropores. In young healthy&#xD;
      individuals this process takes approximately 48 to 72 hours when the skin is covered by an&#xD;
      occlusive patch. One of the factors that may also affect micropore healing time is the depth&#xD;
      of the micropores in the skin immediately after micropatch treatment. There are almost no&#xD;
      data available regarding how race and ethnicity affect the depth of micropores after&#xD;
      micropatch application. It is important to study differences in micropore depth so&#xD;
      investigators can better understand why rates of micropore closure vary in different&#xD;
      racial/ethnic populations. Without this information the potential for variability in drug&#xD;
      delivery is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will objectively measure skin color with a colorimeter to&#xD;
      characterize the epidermal properties of individuals of different self-identified races and&#xD;
      ethnicities. Measurements of trans-epidermal water loss will be used to evaluate formation of&#xD;
      micropores in the skin; electrical impedance measurements will be used to estimate rates of&#xD;
      micropore closure. The investigators will visualize the micropores created after micropatch&#xD;
      treatment with the use of an optical coherence tomography instrument that will allow for&#xD;
      calculation of epidermal thickness and micropore depth. All of these skin characteristics can&#xD;
      be measured using noninvasive methods that are quick and painless.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will complete this arm. Three sites each on the upper arm, volar (inner) forearm, and palm will be identified. Baseline measurements of trans-epidermal water loss, electrical resistance, and color will be made at each site. Baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans will be made at each site. Color will only be measured at baseline. One site at each location will undergo the following interventions: 1) micropatch application and an occlusive covering, 2) micropatch application, but remain uncovered, 3) occlusive covering, no micropatch application. Micropatch application will only occur on the first day and does not contain any drug substance. Trans-epidermal water loss and electrical resistance are re-measured after micropatch removal, along with an additional OCT scan. Electrical resistance and OCT scans will be repeated at all sites for 2 days. Measurements from the 2nd and 3rd sites allow each subject to serve as their own control in data analysis.</description>
