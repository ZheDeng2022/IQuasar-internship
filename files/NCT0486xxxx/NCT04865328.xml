  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) has a negative impact on the daily activities of affected&#xD;
      individuals. OAB affects an estimated 12-17% of adults and has a similar reported prevalence&#xD;
      in men and women. It has the potential to impair multiple domains of quality of life,&#xD;
      including restriction of social and work life, while also resulting in higher healthcare&#xD;
      resource use and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate, in a Croatian population&#xD;
      reporting symptoms of OAB, the effect on work productivity and treatment behaviors (treatment&#xD;
      seeking, receiving treatment, treatment dissatisfaction and treatment discontinuation).&#xD;

    <description>OAB-V8 is an eight-item, self-reported questionnaire that assesses the burden of OAB and the degree of bother caused by the symptoms. Since its development as a subscale of the overactive bladder questionnaire (OAB-q), the OAB-V8 questionnaire has been used to screen for OAB and to assess OAB symptom burden and severity.</description>
