&#xD;
          -  Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents&#xD;
             within 4 weeks [could consider shorter interval for kinase inhibitors or other short&#xD;
             half-life drugs] prior to [randomization /allocation]. Note: Participants must have&#xD;
             recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤Grade 1 or baseline. Participants&#xD;

             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment. Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an&#xD;
             investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last&#xD;
             dose of the previous investigational agent.&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
