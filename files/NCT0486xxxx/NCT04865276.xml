  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We developed and established the efficacy of a theory-based, culturally- and gender-relevant&#xD;
      Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention for low-income Brazilian women that augments the&#xD;
      tobacco cessation program offered through the public health system. This study represents the&#xD;
      continuation of our gender-relevant tobacco control efforts in Brazil by proposing the&#xD;
      adaptation of this CHW-delivered tobacco cessation program to be integrated with mHealth&#xD;
      support through mobile devices (App). We are proposing an integrated CHW-mHealth application&#xD;
      that (a) is culturally- and gender-relevant, (b) is theory-based (Social Cognitive Theory),&#xD;
      (c) considers the existing structure of the Brazilian health care system, and (d) will be&#xD;
      adapted based on an efficacious intervention as well as salient features of other mHealth&#xD;
      applications that have been shown to be successful in engaging users. During phase I we will&#xD;
      make the adaptations and determine feasibility of a CHW-delivered intervention that is&#xD;
      integrated with a mHealth tobacco cessation application (interactive App for participants and&#xD;
      tracking system for CHWs) through formative assessments among all involved stakeholders,&#xD;
      pretesting, and pilot testing of the intervention. In phase II we will assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the integrated CHW-mHealth tobacco cessation intervention through a group&#xD;
      randomized trial with towns as the unit of randomization (8 towns, N=344). The comparison&#xD;
      group will be the same as the previous intervention (consisting of a home visit by a CHW&#xD;
      during which the participant is scheduled to attend the tobacco cessation program at the&#xD;
      neighborhood public health clinic) to allow for comparisons. We hypothesize that at 6-months,&#xD;
      women smokers who receive the integrated CHW-mHealth intervention will have significantly&#xD;
      higher 7-day point prevalence abstinence (defined as no cigarettes in the past 7 days) than&#xD;
      women smokers in the control condition. Self-report will be verified through measurement of&#xD;
      exhaled carbon monoxide levels among 30% of participants. If shown to be effective, this&#xD;
      approach could be utilized as a model for a population-based intervention in low-resource&#xD;
      settings, including rural and disadvantaged women in the U.S.&#xD;
