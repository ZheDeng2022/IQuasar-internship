    <textblock>
      This study includes 3 cohorts of 25 mg BID, 50 mg BID and 100 mg BID. 30 patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B will be enrolled in this study and each cohort will enroll 10 patients&#xD;
      (GST-HG141 tablets : PBO=8:2). All enrolled patients will be given research drugs twice a day&#xD;
      for 28 days (D28 was administered only once in the morning). And each cohort requires at&#xD;
      least 4 subjects with elevated ALT. Tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics will&#xD;
      be evaluated according to the protocol.&#xD;
