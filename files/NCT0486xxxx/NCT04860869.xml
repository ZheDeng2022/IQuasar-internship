  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a subset of patients that, once recovered from&#xD;
      the acute infection, also experience an intractable and debilitating set of lingering&#xD;
      symptoms termed post-COVID syndrome. The most common symptoms include anxiety, shortness of&#xD;
      breath, continued loss of the sense of smell and taste, loss of appetite with subsequent&#xD;
      weight loss, sleep difficulties, severe fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (foggy brain) and&#xD;
      increased frailty. These patients frequently present to the emergency room looking for&#xD;
      symptom management because they are unable to perform normal activities of daily living and&#xD;
      maintain job performance. Thus, it is critical to characterize the baseline endocrine,&#xD;
      metabolic, inflammatory and microbiome alterations in the post-COVID syndrome patients to&#xD;
      better identify and manage the symptoms to prevent potential long-term health consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) has established a post-COVID clinic for management&#xD;
      of these patients, but it is recognized that a more complete clinical picture of the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms driving these lingering symptoms is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent and long-lasting health problems are common in patients after COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
      In a recent study of patients that had been hospitalized with COVID-19, two months after&#xD;
      discharge, 87% reported at least one lingering symptom (joint pain, fatigue, breathing&#xD;
      issues, etc), more than 50% reported more than three lingering issues, and over 40% reported&#xD;
      a reduction in their of quality of life. Another study found that at 1-month after&#xD;
      hospitalization for COVID-19, 74% reported persistent issues related to shortness of breath&#xD;
      and a decrease in both physical and mental health. Preliminary data from the UTMB Post-COVID&#xD;
      Recovery clinic agree with these two recent reports. In a recent study, 1 1/2 months after&#xD;
      COVID-19 diagnosis, patients reported on average 10 of the 18 common symptoms (with 90%&#xD;
      having chest pain, 87% dyspnea, 75% fatigue, and 90% with cognitive changes). While the&#xD;
      previous studies examined patients that had severe COVID-19 infections, &gt;50% of the patients&#xD;
      were never hospitalized, yet have numerous persistent symptoms. This has serious implications&#xD;
      for the ability of patients to return to work, downstream effects on mental health due to&#xD;
      sometimes drastic lifestyle and work capacity changes, and the ability to engage in&#xD;
      activities or hobbies enjoyed prior to COVID-19 illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, the cluster of symptoms associated with post-COVID syndrome include profound fatigue&#xD;
      and cognitive dysfunction, which are strikingly consistent with a syndrome that the&#xD;
      investigators clinical research team has described in patients after traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI) designated Brain Injury Associated Fatigue and Altered Cognition (BIAFAC). Over the&#xD;
      last 12 months the investigators have reported the characteristics of BIAFAC syndrome. In&#xD;
      particular, TBI patients with BIAFAC present with lingering and profoundly debilitating&#xD;
      symptoms including severe fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (foggy brain), sleep disturbances,&#xD;
      and the inability to perform activities of daily living that persist for years post-injury.&#xD;
      Mechanistically the investigators have explored the role of the gut microbiome discovering&#xD;
      altered communities in TBI patients in long-term care facilities compared with controls. The&#xD;
      investigators also established that many TBI patients with BIAFAC also present with abnormal&#xD;
      growth hormone (GH) secretion, and when treated with recombinant GH, a majority of patients&#xD;
      have significant improvement of both fatigue and impaired cognition. While studies are&#xD;
      underway to understand the details of the mechanism causing BIAFAC and why GH treatment&#xD;
      alleviates symptoms in these patients, the investigators are intrigued that the symptom&#xD;
      phenotype with post-COVID patients overlaps with many BIAFAC symptoms. It is possible that&#xD;
      post-COVID syndrome may be addressed through similar treatment strategies including the&#xD;
      potential for prebiotic/probiotic enhancement of microbiome health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current pilot proposal, the investigators will characterize the baseline endocrine,&#xD;
      metabolic, inflammatory and gut microbiome alterations in post-COVID syndrome patients and&#xD;
      compare those to the investigators extensive database of BIAFAC patients and normal controls.&#xD;
      From this critical baseline data, the investigators will develop carefully defined clinical&#xD;
      research trials that will test potential treatments for alleviating the syndrome. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that an imbalanced endocrine axis stemming from COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      leads to metabolic, inflammatory and microbial dysregulation resulting in the onset of&#xD;
      persistent post-COVID symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Characterize the baseline physiological measures of endocrine function,&#xD;
      metabolism, inflammation, and composition of the gut and nasal microbiome of patients&#xD;
      reporting symptoms of post-COVID syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Assess baseline neuropsychological measures of fatigue, sleep, and cognition&#xD;
      for patients reporting symptoms of post-COVID syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Correlate physiological and neuropsychological measures of post-COVID&#xD;
      patients and compare those measures to the investigators extensive database of BIAFAC&#xD;
      patients and normal controls.&#xD;

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid assessment of cognition. The MoCA consists of 9 questions with the following subcategories: visuospatial/executive, naming, memory, language, abstraction, delayed recall and orientation. The MoCA has been used extensively to detect cognitive impairment in many conditions, including head trauma. Version 7.1 will be used. Scores range from 0 to 30, higher score being a better outcome.</description>
