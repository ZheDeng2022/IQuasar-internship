      Implementing a Hospital-Based Walking Program (STRIDE): Function QUERI 2.0 aims to compare&#xD;
      implementation strategies for large-scale spread of STRIDE, a supervised walking program for&#xD;
      hospitalized older Veterans. The overall goal is to implement, evaluate, and sustain STRIDE&#xD;
      in 32 additional VA medical centers uses a type III effectiveness-implementation hybrid&#xD;
      design framework.&#xD;

      Background/Purpose. Hospitalization is a major risk factor for development of disability.&#xD;
      More than one-third of adults over the age of 70 are discharged from the hospital with a&#xD;
      major new disability that was not present before the onset of acute illness. A key&#xD;
      contributor to hospital-associated disability is immobility during hospitalization. Although&#xD;
      fewer than 5% of patients have physician orders for bed rest, hospitalized older adults spend&#xD;
      only about 3% of their time standing or walking. The hazards of bedrest have been recognized&#xD;
      for more than 2 decades, but there remains a persistent 'epidemic of immobility' in American&#xD;
      hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRIDE is a supervised inpatient walking program developed by an interdisciplinary team of&#xD;
      investigators, clinicians and administrators at the Durham VA and funded by the VHA Office of&#xD;
      Geriatrics and Extended Care. STRIDE is designed for patients aged &gt; 60 years and consists of&#xD;
      a one-time gait and balance assessment conducted by a Physical Therapist, followed by daily&#xD;
      walks supervised by a mobility assistant for the duration of the hospital stay. Clinical&#xD;
      demonstration of STRIDE conducted at the Durham VA resulted in a greater likelihood of&#xD;
      discharge to home than to skilled nursing or rehabilitation among STRIDE participants&#xD;
      compared to clinically similar patients receiving usual care. Based on this experience, the&#xD;
      cumulative evidence of the positive impact of early mobility interventions, and successful&#xD;
      spread to other hospitals, STRIDE has the potential to become a system-wide approach to&#xD;
      address hospital-associated disability in VA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of Implementing a Hospital-Based Walking Program (STRIDE), the investigators plan to&#xD;
      implement the STRIDE clinical program at an additional 32 VA medical centers using a type III&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation hybrid design framework with sites enrolled and randomized to&#xD;
      receive standard implementation support (foundational Replicating Effective Programs or REP)&#xD;
      or a higher-intensity implementation support (enhanced REP including additional facilitation,&#xD;
      self-organization, and team building support) for sites that do not meet adoption goals at 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The investigators plan to develop scalable approaches to implement and sustain&#xD;
      STRIDE as well as evaluate implementation with foundational REP versus the&#xD;
      enhanced-implementation strategy (enhanced REP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key questions: What are stakeholder perspectives on key elements of a large-scale&#xD;
      dissemination plan? How should the STRIDE clinical program be adapted to optimize&#xD;
      sustainability? Are there differences in implementation outcomes (penetration, fidelity) at&#xD;
      6, 10 months (primary), 13, 16 months between arms? How do sites experience implementation&#xD;
      strategies in each arm? What baseline organizational characteristics are associated with&#xD;
      sites that do not meet implementation benchmarks? The investigators also plan to conduct an&#xD;
      explanatory sequential mixed method design that includes qualitative data collection and&#xD;
      analysis that will not be reported here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. To evaluate implementation, the investigators will randomize sites (n=32) 1:1 to&#xD;
      either foundational REP or enhanced REP. The investigators will use generalized linear models&#xD;
      to examine the effect of foundational vs. enhanced REP on implementation outcomes at&#xD;
      10-months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>10 months (cumulative)</time_frame>
    <description>Penetration is defined as the proportion of patients with a STRIDE consult or walk among those age 60 and over admitted to a general medicine bed. It is not possible to assess all eligibility criteria in the EHR (e.g. able to walk at baseline); thus, with this more inclusive denominator, 100% penetration is not an appropriate goal. Based on preliminary data, we anticipate penetration to range from 0% (no program activity at 10-month outcome assessment) to 40% (estimated maximum achievable based on data from current STRIDE sites).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months (cumulative)</time_frame>
    <description>Fidelity will be the percentage of days with at least 10 minutes of daily walking during a hospital stay among those age 60 and over admitted to a general medicine bed with at least one documented supervised walk.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adoption</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months (cumulative)</time_frame>
    <description>Adoption is defined as greater than or equal to 5 patients with a STRIDE consult and walk in the Electronic Health Record.</description>

    <description>Foundational REP uses the Replicating Effective Program implementation strategy and includes 5 elements that were developed and tested in our prior Function QUERI work: Stakeholder engagement; Toolkit; SharePoint access for clinical program training materials; Data dashboard to assist sites with tracking their own data; and Diffusion Networks to promote peer-to-peer sharing and implementation support.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Enhanced REP</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Enhanced REP begins with the same activities as Foundational REP. Sites that do not meet adoption benchmarks within 6 months will continue with Foundational REP and also receive higher intensity support for a period of 4-6 months. The higher intensity support will consist of facilitation, a process of interactive problem solving and support that occurs in a context of a supportive interpersonal relationship and CONNECT, a complexity science-based bundle of interaction-oriented activities designed to supplement implementation efforts by promoting team function and readiness for change. Facilitation will be provided by Function QUERI team members.</description>

    <description>The goal is to test implementation intensification approaches for STRIDE sites that have not met implementation adoption benchmarks, specifically Foundational REP vs. Enhanced REP. We propose that low intensity implementation support that promotes adapting STRIDE for context and provides tools for ongoing STRIDE evaluation (defined as foundational REP), will be sufficient for some but not all sites to successfully incorporate STRIDE into routine practice.</description>

    <description>The goal is to test implementation intensification approaches for STRIDE sites that have not met implementation adoption benchmarks, specifically Foundational REP vs. Enhanced REP. We posit that monitoring sites' progress and adding, for sites with low adoption, higher intensity strategies (defined as Enhanced REP) that directly influence teams' capacity and skills to effectively self-organize and problem-solve will lead to higher implementation adoption, penetration, fidelity, and value.</description>
