      This project will use novel methods to detect clinically meaningful subgroups of older adults&#xD;
      based on long-term trajectories of bothersome pain and function. It will then identify older&#xD;
      adults at high risk of experiencing poor long-term pain and function. Anticipated results&#xD;
      will provide new insights into long-term patterns of pain and function across the aging&#xD;
      process and identify potential predictors of each trajectory.&#xD;

      The long-term goal of this planned line of research is to reduce the burden of pain and&#xD;
      maximize function in older adults as they age. This line of research will begin by completing&#xD;
      the following Aims: Aim 1) Identify and describe clinically meaningful long-term trajectories&#xD;
      of bothersome pain and functional decline in a population-based sample of older adults and&#xD;
      Aim 2) Estimate the association between candidate prognostic factors typically available in&#xD;
      electronic health records and long-term bothersome pain and function trajectories to inform&#xD;
      the development of eventual risk prediction models. This will be a retrospective cohort study&#xD;
      using longitudinal data from the population-based National Health and Aging Trends Study&#xD;
      (NHATS). This project will use novel methods to identify clinically meaningful subgroups of&#xD;
      older adults based on long-term trajectories of bothersome pain and function. Group-based&#xD;
      trajectory modeling (GBTM) is a novel method to model dynamic phenomena such as pain and&#xD;
      function. Older adults at high risk of experiencing poor long-term pain and function outcomes&#xD;
      will be identified by leveraging potential prognostic factors typically available in&#xD;
      electronic health records or administrative data. It is anticipated that our results will&#xD;
      provide new insights into long-term patterns of pain and function across the aging process&#xD;
      and identify potential predictors of each trajectory.&#xD;

Scores range 0-12 with higher scores indicating greater capacity to perform these activities.</description>

        NHATS is a cohort of older adults and is representative of Medicare beneficiaries age 65&#xD;
        years and older. It is a &quot;unique national resource for the scientific study of functioning&#xD;
        in later life.&quot; The sample is drawn from the Medicare enrollment files, and the survey&#xD;
        oversamples Blacks and those at older ages. NHATS data collection began in 2011 (Round 1)&#xD;
        with in-person interviews. Participants were re-interviewed yearly (Rounds 2-7). This is a&#xD;
        unique cohort because it contains comprehensive survey data in addition to physical&#xD;
        performance measures for individuals over multiple years. During each round, NHATS collects&#xD;
        a wide array of information during the interviews, including: demographic, health, social,&#xD;
        economic, environmental, cognitive, behavioral, and physical data.&#xD;
