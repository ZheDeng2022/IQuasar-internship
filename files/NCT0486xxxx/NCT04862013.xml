  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who were surgically treated with ACL reconstruction at a single clinic between 2013&#xD;
      and 2018 will be approached by a questionnaire regarding their return to sport after surgery.&#xD;
      Questions will focus on the timepoint of the return, subsequent injuries, and the impact of&#xD;
      the initial injury on the life of the patients. In addition, existing clinical data from the&#xD;
      baseline visit and from the follow-up visits offered routinely to the patient will be used.&#xD;
