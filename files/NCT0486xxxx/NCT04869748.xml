      This study objective is to study the immediate effect of Perfetti Method in reducing&#xD;
      spasticity of upper extremity in stroke patients at the Department of Physical&#xD;
      Medicine,Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodhi Hospital, Thailand. Participants were randomized&#xD;
      into experimental group who received therapy according to the Perfetti method, and controlled&#xD;
      group who underwent passive stretching exercise. Duration of treatment was 15 minutes for&#xD;
      every case, regardless of the treatment. Evaluation of spasticity immediately before and&#xD;
      after treatment according to Modified Tardieu scale (MTS) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)&#xD;
      by same blinded assessor.&#xD;

      -  This study was a single center, single-blind randomized controlled trial study conducted&#xD;
           in Thailand during June 2018 and September 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After approval by Human Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi&#xD;
           Hospital, Mahidol University, stroke patients with spasticity of upper extremity at the&#xD;
           Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodhi Hospital were&#xD;
           recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants were assigned to experimental group and control group by researcher using&#xD;
           computer randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome assessor was blinded to the allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data including gender, ages, type of stroke, hemiparesis side, time since&#xD;
           stroke, duration of upper limb spasticity, Brunnstrom stage of upper extremity, joint&#xD;
           proprioception of elbow joint, Barthel index, spasticity impact score, and current&#xD;
           treatment (conventional physical therapy, antispastic medication, botulinum toxin/&#xD;
           Phenol injection) were collected. A simplified questionnaire was used to determine&#xD;
           spasticity impact score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All therapy sessions were conducted by the same PMR residence, who was trained by an&#xD;
           experienced occupational therapist for 1 session and further practiced under supervision&#xD;
           for 10 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome was the improvement of the angle of muscle reaction (R1 angle) in&#xD;
           Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary outcomes were the number of participants with improvement of quality of&#xD;
           muscle action in MTS ≥1 and the number of participants with improvement of Modified&#xD;
           Ashworth Scale (MAS) ≥1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size was calculated using delta change of R1 angle of MTS in 10 subjects pilot&#xD;
           study, with alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.1. The total number of sample size is 7 subjects&#xD;
           per group, 14 subjects in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Experimental group, each participant received a 15-minute session of Perfetti method&#xD;
           on affected elbow flexor. Participant was blindfolded, while lying flat in a quiet and&#xD;
           comfortable room. Participants were asked to concentrate on the position of their&#xD;
           elbows. Protocol has 4 steps of training as shown in Table 1, starting from 2 positions&#xD;
           of elbow and ending with 5 positions. After therapist passively moved elbow joint to a&#xD;
           position, participant guessed the position of his/her elbow. If the answers were correct&#xD;
           consecutively for 10 times, the therapist increased the number of positions according to&#xD;
           the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In control group, each participant received gentle passive stretching of elbow flexor&#xD;
           and maintained in full elbow extension position for 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For statistical analysis, program SPSS version 21 was used to calculate mean and&#xD;
           standard deviation (mean±SD) for continuous variables, and percent and median for&#xD;
           categorical variables. Paired T-test and independent T-test were used to compared result&#xD;
           in the same group and between groups, respectively. Results were considered significant&#xD;
           when p &lt;0.05. The difference in quality of muscle reaction of MTS and MAS was deemed&#xD;
           meaningful if the reduction was ≥ 1 level.&#xD;

Quality of muscle reaction in MTS is an ordinal scale to assess spasticity, consist of 6 levels, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The worst level of spasticity is 5 and the best level is 0. The improvement of quality of muscle reaction means change in level of quality of muscle reaction from higher to lower ≥1 level .</description>
