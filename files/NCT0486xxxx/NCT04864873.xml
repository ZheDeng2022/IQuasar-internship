      This is a laboratory evaluation of a new testing methodology for microbiological diagnosis,&#xD;
      whereby participant samples received as part of routine care will be divided between the&#xD;
      standard diagnostic pathway and this new pathway: metagenomic next generation sequencing&#xD;
      (mNGS). Results obtained from the mNGS pathway will be compared against the standard&#xD;
      diagnostic pathway in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and clinical impact. The&#xD;
      samples will be identified at Wellington Southern Community Laboratories (WSCL), which&#xD;
      provides laboratory services for Capital and Coast District Health Board, and forwarded to&#xD;
      the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) to undergo mNGS testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic microbiology has traditionally involved culture of organisms to diagnose&#xD;
      infection, which is time consuming, insensitive for organisms that are difficult to grow, and&#xD;
      compromised by prior antimicrobial therapy. Molecular diagnostics, predominantly in the form&#xD;
      of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), e.g. PCR, overcome some of these limitations and&#xD;
      are now in widespread and increasing use. NAAT-based tests are however limited by only being&#xD;
      able to detect a small number of pre-specified organisms and can offer limited to no&#xD;
      antimicrobial susceptibility information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) works by directly sequencing all of the nucleic&#xD;
      acid in a microbiological sample, thus allowing identification of all microorganisms that are&#xD;
      present in sufficient quantity, along with the potential to infer antimicrobial&#xD;
      susceptibility patterns based on the presence or absence of relevant genes. Unlike NAAT, no&#xD;
      pre-specification of target pathogen(s) is required, so mNGS has the potential to identify&#xD;
      important pathogens that may have not been tested for otherwise. Host (human) sequences will&#xD;
      also be present in the sample, so are removed from the analysis either by preventing them&#xD;
      from being sequenced, or deleting them during the initial analysis steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mNGS therefore has the ability to overcome the limitations of both culture-based and&#xD;
      NAAT-based infection diagnosis, with the potential to offer rapid diagnostics with greater&#xD;
      levels of antimicrobial susceptibility detail, which is less affected by whether the organism&#xD;
      is viable/culturable. Rapid infection diagnostics has the ability to significantly improve&#xD;
      patient care, whereby appropriately targeted antimicrobial therapy can be instituted promptly&#xD;
      (or ceased if e.g. a viral pathogen is identified). This is of particular importance given&#xD;
      ongoing global increases in antimicrobial resistance. Rapid diagnostics with mNGS may also&#xD;
      reduce the need for multiple other lines of investigation. There are likely to be certain&#xD;
      groups of patients where this technology can be particularly targeted for maximal benefit&#xD;
      either due to the rapidity of the results or the ability to diagnose infections that may not&#xD;
      have been clinically suspected or detected with standard processes. In the investigators'&#xD;
      department, several cases have been seen recently where patients have had very poor outcomes&#xD;
      due to delays in diagnosis, where mNGS would have had the potential to markedly improve their&#xD;
      outcomes. There are also potential benefits on a population level, such as reducing exposure&#xD;
      of the population to overly broad-spectrum antibiotics, rapid identification and surveillance&#xD;
      of communicable diseases that may require a public health response, and expediting&#xD;
      appropriate management and flow of patients through an already congested hospital system.&#xD;
      mNGS also has the ability to detect novel pathogens. As an example, the rapid identification&#xD;
      and dissemination of information relating to SARS-CoV-2 was due to the availability of rapid&#xD;
      'agnostic' sequencing technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next generation sequencing has typically been too expensive to be used as a front-line&#xD;
      diagnostic test, with its use confined to larger research-affiliated institutions. However,&#xD;
      nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT]), now offers a relatively inexpensive&#xD;
      option, with a small physical footprint and an ability to generate a large amount of sequence&#xD;
      data rapidly, making it a potentially viable option for front-line diagnostic microbiology&#xD;
      laboratories. As such, there is considerable interest in the use of nanopore sequencing for&#xD;
      mNGS. A number of publications have reported on its use in clinical diagnostics, and it is&#xD;
      already in use in a number of healthcare settings overseas&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Continuous Quality Improvement (QI) via the evaluation of new diagnostic assays is a&#xD;
      critically important component of clinical laboratory medicine. In line with this, the&#xD;
      investigators are interested in evaluating the use of mNGS in their laboratory as a QI&#xD;
      initiative to enhance the diagnostic service, increase the sensitivity of infection&#xD;
      diagnostic testing, and compare existing standard diagnostic procedures against mNGS. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to undertake this in the form of an external evaluation, whereby samples&#xD;
      from Wellington Southern Community Laboratories (WSCL) would be forwarded to the Institute of&#xD;
      Environmental Sciences and Research (ESR) for mNGS testing. ESR has existing expertise in&#xD;
      sequencing and bioinformatics and have already developed mNGS capability, however have not&#xD;
      comprehensively evaluated it on real patient samples. The initial evaluation would occur at&#xD;
      ESR, with the aim of producing a workflow that could be usable at WSCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample selection and referral from WSCL to ESR&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Residual samples that have been collected as part of routine patient care and sent to&#xD;
           WSCL microbiology laboratory for the purposes of diagnosing infection will be used. It&#xD;
           is standard accepted practise in the laboratory for the microbiologist to arrange&#xD;
           additional (unrequested) testing on certain clinical samples to optimise the diagnostic&#xD;
           process, including referral of samples to an external laboratory such as ESR. This&#xD;
           evaluation would follow a similar procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Samples will be identified at WSCL by the clinical microbiologist(s) involved in the&#xD;
           project. A variety of sample types will be evaluated. The specific sample types that&#xD;
           will be assessed in the evaluation will vary during the course of the evaluation, based&#xD;
           on how well the mNGS workflow functions on different sample types. Initially samples&#xD;
           from normally sterile sites and those with potentially the greatest positive impact on&#xD;
           patient care will be chosen (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid, joint fluid, pleural fluid,&#xD;
           blood) followed by samples from non-sterile sites (e.g. sputum, urine, wound fluids) if&#xD;
           the initial results are encouraging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. WSCL processes microbiology samples for the entire Capital &amp; Coast and Hutt Valley DHB&#xD;
           regions, so samples would be sourced from patients in these regions. The majority of&#xD;
           samples will be from hospitalised patients, rather than community-based. Samples from a&#xD;
           variety of different clinical specialties will be evaluated, including augmented care&#xD;
           units e.g. both adult and neonatal intensive care units, and general ward patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size 1. A specific sample size has not been calculated for this evaluation, as the&#xD;
      total number of samples tested will be contingent upon how much refinement of the mNGS&#xD;
      testing process is required, and the evaluation is likely to need to be an ongoing process.&#xD;
      The investigators have set a maximum sample size at 400.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mNGS methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical samples will be processed to enrich for bacterial cells using solid phase&#xD;
           reversible immobilisation (SPRI) magnetic beads functionalised with poly-lysine. Host&#xD;
           (human) DNA will be depleted using differential lysis and nuclease treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total nucleic acid will be extracted from the processed samples using commercially&#xD;
           available DNA extraction kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ONT rapid sequencing kit will be used to sequence the resulting DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify potential pathogen species in the sample, all non-human sequences generated&#xD;
           will be will taxonomically classified to the species level using a fast minimiser-based&#xD;
           approximate mapping algorithm against customised pathogen databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avoidance of host (human) genome sequencing Robust processes involving several different&#xD;
      published strategies will be put in place to avoid the possibility of inadvertent human&#xD;
      genome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reducing host DNA in the sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Bacterial cell enrichment and chemical depletion of host DNA during the initial&#xD;
           sample processing stage of the protocol will be the first line in avoiding sequencing&#xD;
           human DNA by reducing the amount of host DNA in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ejecting host DNA from the sequencer:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The second filter to reduce host sequencing will the use of the ONT 'Read Until' API.&#xD;
           This process automatically prevents prespecified DNA sequences from entering the&#xD;
           detector by reversing the molecule's direction of travel through the detector within&#xD;
           less than one second, preventing any full-length host molecules from being sequenced.&#xD;
           Given the raw error rate of the sequence data, any short host reads that pass this&#xD;
           filter carry insufficient information to be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Deleting host sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The final step to avoid exposing host sequence to analysis is automatically and&#xD;
           permanently deleting any residual human sequence data as it is produced, prior to the&#xD;
           data stream entering the analysis step.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mapping sequences only against microbial databases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In the very unlikely event that host sequence passes the above steps, a further&#xD;
                safety step is that any sequences will only be mapped against microbial databases.&#xD;
                This means that any human sequences would not create a match, so would not form&#xD;
                part of the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of results&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Results will be reported by ESR directly to WSCL via the same secure pathways used for&#xD;
           other reference testing that ESR performs for WSCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Results will be reviewed by the clinical microbiologist(s) involved in the project so&#xD;
           that an assessment of their clinical relevance can be made prior to results being made&#xD;
           available to clinical teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Results will be entered onto the WSCL laboratory information system so that they can be&#xD;
           reported to the clinical team. A comment will be attached to the text report explaining&#xD;
           that the results have been generated using mNGS, which is still being evaluated, and the&#xD;
           microbiologist will discuss directly with the clinical team regarding the results if&#xD;
           there is any potential for uncertainty surrounding the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of results&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The results of the parallel mNGS testing will be compared over time to the results&#xD;
           produced by routine laboratory testing on the same sample, to assess the sensitivity,&#xD;
           specificity, and level of agreement between methods. Given that mNGS is potentially more&#xD;
           sensitive than routine methods, mNGS results will also be assessed by the clinical&#xD;
           microbiologist(s) involved in the project against other routine diagnostic (orthogonal)&#xD;
           testing, which could include other laboratory tests, radiology, and the overall clinical&#xD;
           assessment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The clinical impact of the mNGS testing will also be assessed and recorded: for each&#xD;
           mNGS result the clinical microbiologist(s) will make an assessment as to the clinical&#xD;
           impact the mNGS result had on the overall assessment and management of the patient.&#xD;
