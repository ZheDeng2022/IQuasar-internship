  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wireless telemonitoring is compared with regular nursing procedure in terms of patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, adherence to continuous positive pressure (CPAP) treatment and nursing time&#xD;
      during the habituation phase of the CPAP therapy in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Both patients and study nurses were unblinded for the wireless telemonitoring system&#xD;
      (ResTraxx™Online, ResMed, Sydney, Australia). The module was attached to the S9 Elite™&#xD;
      (ResMed, Sydney, Australia) CPAP device, which transmitted compliance data every day&#xD;
      automatically to the ResTraxx™ Online (ResMed, Sydney, Australia) data base. The treatment&#xD;
      was considered successful when CPAP use was &gt;4 h/day, mask leak &lt;0.4 L/s, and AHI &lt;5/h during&#xD;
      the last 6 days. Study nurses made the data check-ups daily during weekdays and if the&#xD;
      criteria for successful CPAP therapy was not achieved during two consecutive nights the&#xD;
      nurses adjusted the CPAP pressure remotely and called the patient to give further advice.&#xD;
      Patients had also a control viist aftr one year.&#xD;

    <description>Nursing time of the TM group was estimated as follows: patient education regarding ResTraxx™ Online system (2 min), online data check-ups (0.5 min), remote changes for pressure settings (1 min), telephone guidance (5 min for the end of monitoring, 10 min for each extra call), visit at the study nurse (30- 60 min depending on type of visit), updating the patient records (2 min), and no show visits, which led to organizing a new appointment (20min). The time estimations are based on the measurements of the first 20 telemonitored patients. Nursing time in the UC Group was estimated with the same time calculations as in the TM group presented above with the exception of ttelemonitoring time which was not applicable in the UC group.</description>
