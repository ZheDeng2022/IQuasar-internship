    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized controlled clinical study. Patients with femoral neck&#xD;
      fracture (AO classification 31-B) will be randomly divided into three-screw fixation group&#xD;
      and four-screw fixation group. The internal fixation failure rate (IFFR) and functional&#xD;
      outcomes of the two groups will be compared and the patients will be followed up to 2 years&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. All patients will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into 2 groups at a ratio of 1:1. The investigators will use three screws for internal&#xD;
      fixation in the first group, and four screws for internal fixation in the second group. The&#xD;
      relevant parameters of the sample calculation are α = 0.05 (one-sided) and β = 0.2. PASS 15&#xD;
      was used for calculation, and the final sample size was 290, 145 for each group. Subjects who&#xD;
      meet all the inclusion conditions but do not meet any exclusion conditions and have signed&#xD;
      the informed consent will be randomized, and each patient will be assigned a unique patient&#xD;
      identification number, which will be used throughout the study. Using a computer random&#xD;
      allocation system, eligible patients were randomly divided into the two groups at a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1. The investigators will perform preoperative preparations, intraoperative operations, and&#xD;
      internal fixation in accordance with the instructions provided in the internal plant product&#xD;
      packaging. The investigators only plan to include cases in which closed reduction can be&#xD;
      successfully performed, so the investigators will exclude cases that require open reduction.&#xD;
      For the three-screw group, three cancellous screws with an inverted triangle pattern are used&#xD;
      to fix the fracture of femoral neck. For the four-screw group, the fourth screw will be&#xD;
      implanted in the horizontal direction of the femoral distance on the basis of the three&#xD;
      screws. After the operation, the subjects will be managed according to the standard nursing&#xD;
      and rehabilitation procedures at the experimental site and the results of laboratory&#xD;
      examinations will be recorded. Regular follow-up evaluations will be carried out after the&#xD;
      operation until the end of the two-year follow-up or the end of the study. In this study, the&#xD;
      internal fixation failure rate (IFFR) will be used as the main research endpoint, which is&#xD;
      defined as the total incidence of cutouts, fractures. The results of the radiographic&#xD;
      examination, the lateral X-ray film and computed tomography(CT), will be evaluated by an&#xD;
      independent radiologist to determine whether there are cut-out or fracture of the internal&#xD;
      plant. Secondary endpoints include: 1. Bone nonunion after 36 weeks: evaluate bone healing&#xD;
      according to the lateral X-ray examination. According to the regulations of Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration of the US, it is defined as nonunion if there are no obvious signs of fracture&#xD;
      healing 9 months after the fracture, or if there is no obvious difference in fracture space&#xD;
      after three consecutive months. 2. Garden classification proportion, and Garden index for&#xD;
      reduction assessment. 3. Clinical prognosis: o A 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) o&#xD;
      Harris hip score. 4. Operation time, from the incision to internal fixation implanted. 5. The&#xD;
      times of intraoperative fluoroscopy, average 25 milliseconds per X-ray shot, record the&#xD;
      number of X-ray shot. 6. Postoperative adverse events within 2 years, including ipsilateral&#xD;
      femoral head avascular necrosis, infection, wound hematoma, ipsilateral coxa vara, and&#xD;
      ipsilateral limb shortening. In this study, it is difficult to blind anyone to randomization.&#xD;
      However, considering that most of the patients may not have medical expertise, if the&#xD;
      researchers do not inform them, the patients are the only people who may be blind.&#xD;
      Investigators will try their best to reduce human-induced bias in experimental results.&#xD;
      Investigators will use one-sided α = 0.05 for statistical tests and confidence interval&#xD;
      calculations. P value &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. SPSS (latest version:&#xD;
      SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) will be used to analyze the results.&#xD;
