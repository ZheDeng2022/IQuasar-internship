  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Chronic Orchialgia (i.e., testicular pain) is a challenging condition to treat,&#xD;
      with unresolved testicular pain leading to distress, diminished activities of daily living&#xD;
      and decreased quality of life. Testicular Pain may be caused by a tumor, hernia, infection,&#xD;
      trauma, vein compression, cysts, and/or postoperative or radiating pain, though is often&#xD;
      times unknown. Non-pharmacologic, conservative pain reduction interventions include heat,&#xD;
      ice, scrotal support, physical therapy, and/or counseling, and should often be used as first&#xD;
      line of defense. More aggressive, invasive, and non-conservative medical treatment options&#xD;
      include medications, nerve blocks, and/or surgery, each of which may be effective, but may be&#xD;
      invasive and/or cause serious side effects. However, there is no standard of care for&#xD;
      managing the testicular pain and many men do not respond to current biomedical or&#xD;
      nonpharmacologic treatment options. Novel, non-invasive treatment options are needed for ICO&#xD;
      to improve distress, daily living activities, and quality of life. Transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-pharmacologic intervention for acute and chronic pain. This&#xD;
      treatment involves the application of electric current through the skin; it is safe, easy to&#xD;
      use, and inexpensive. Despite the impact and distress associated with Testicular Pain, only&#xD;
      one known study examined the efficacy of TENS for this condition. A 2018 double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized controlled study of people with Testicular Pain reported that TENS improved pain&#xD;
      and quality of life significantly more than the control condition (analgesia only). This 2018&#xD;
      study lacked a placebo control condition (i.e., unknown whether pain relief was due to the&#xD;
      placebo effect, where knowing an intervention is happening leads to an expectation that pain&#xD;
      will decrease, and therefore pain perception decreases independent of the intervention).&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of TENS on Testicular Pain using a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled design. The results of this study will be used to inform a&#xD;
      larger, federally-funded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Primary Aim: To assess the efficacy of TENS for Testicular Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Secondary Aim: To assess the feasibility of TENS for Testicular Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Third Aim: To assess the tolerability of TENS for Testicular Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. To assess associations between dispositional pain catastrophizing on responsiveness to&#xD;
      the TENS intervention.&#xD;

      The overall aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of TENS on Testicular Pain using a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled design. The results of this study will be used to inform a&#xD;
      larger, federally-funded study. The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover design (each participant completes all 3 study conditions) with&#xD;
      randomization to 3 study conditions: 1) Active TENS; 2) Placebo TENS; or 3) No Treatment&#xD;
      Control. Subjects will be tested 1x/week for 3 weeks. Each subject will receive the 3&#xD;
      treatments in randomized order. Importantly, the experimenter and subject will be blinded to&#xD;
      the treatment condition. A second experimenter will administer the Active or Placebo TENS, or&#xD;
      the Control to ensure appropriate blinding (to ensure no bias from knowing which TENS&#xD;
      condition is given at each visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Thirty men with Testicular Pain (lasting &gt;3 months), aged 18-99yrs will be&#xD;
      recruited. Exclusion criteria includes: pain intensity rating ≤ 3/10, contraindications for&#xD;
      TENS (pacemaker) or TENS use ≤ 5 years. Participants will provide written informed consent,&#xD;
      as approved by the University of Iowa Biomedical Institutional Review Board. TENS Treatment.&#xD;
      All subjects will receive each of the 3 TENS treatment conditions while sitting in an upright&#xD;
      position. Four adhesive electrodes (2in x 2in) will be placed bilaterally on the: 1) sacrum&#xD;
      (for pudendal nerve); and 2) groin (ilioinguinal nerve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active TENS includes high frequency TENS delivered for 30mins at a frequency of 100 Hz and&#xD;
      pulse duration of 100μsec using the EMPI Select TENS unit (calibrated using an oscilloscope&#xD;
      prior to study). The intensity will be increased until patients feel a &quot;maximally strong but&#xD;
      comfortable sensation&quot; to ensure an analgesic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo TENS parameters will be identical to Active TENS (100 Hz and 100 μsec), but a novel&#xD;
      placebo TENS unit, previously tested and validated will be used. The placebo device provides&#xD;
      a current for 30sec and ramps off over 15sec to zero output. An indicator light remains on so&#xD;
      it appears to the subject that the unit is still producing current. This unit has&#xD;
      demonstrated nearly 100% blinding of investigators such that the investigator applying the&#xD;
      TENS is unable to distinguish between the active and the placebo unit; approximately ~50% of&#xD;
      subjects are successfully blinded using this unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The No Treatment Control includes application of TENS electrodes identical to the other 2&#xD;
      conditions, but the unit remains off. This condition will control for potential effects of&#xD;
      repeat testing and any placebo effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Measures. Pain will be assessed before and after TENS each session to measure any&#xD;
      within visit changes in pain from the TENS intervention. Pain change will be measured using&#xD;
      the: 1) Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 27 with qualitative (i.e., sharp, distressing)&#xD;
      and quantitative pain scales; and 2) 10-point numeric pain intensity rating scale (NRS)&#xD;
      ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable); These pain measures are valid and&#xD;
      reliable. Pain medication intake will also be assessed. Finally, pain-related catastrophizing&#xD;
      (i.e., coping) will be measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale to determine if any&#xD;
      responsiveness to TENS intervention is related to dispositional catastrophizing (i.e., their&#xD;
      general catastrophizing levels prior to initiating the TENS study interventions).&#xD;
