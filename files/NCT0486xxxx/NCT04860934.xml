  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medulloblastoma is a rapidly-growing tumor of the cerebellum, this area controls balance,&#xD;
      posture and sophisticated motor functions like finer hand movements, speech, and swallowing.&#xD;
      With the goal of, complete resection, major complications during tumor removal are usually&#xD;
      caused by damage to the brain stem and injury to the lower cranial nerves.It has been&#xD;
      reported that those children present Ataxia after resection. So the purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the effectiveness of using a selected dual-task- training program to improve&#xD;
      postural stability in those Children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients present with symptoms of hydrocephalus due to obstruction by tumor at the level&#xD;
      of the fourth ventricle or cerebral aqueduct, and ataxia (Martin et al., 2014). If the tumor&#xD;
      is large enough, the lesion itself can also cause mass effect and increased intracranial&#xD;
      pressure. Furthermore, direct structural damage from the children can thus present with&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, ataxia,diplopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ataxia in children is a common clinical sign of various origins consisting of impaired&#xD;
      coordination of movement and balance with a lack of muscle control during voluntary activity.&#xD;
      Ataxia is most frequently caused by dysfunction of the complex circuitry connecting the basal&#xD;
      ganglia, cerebellum and cerebral cortex, and this type of involvement is recorded as&#xD;
      &quot;cerebellar ataxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the evidence for procedural memory training has advanced sophistication to suggest&#xD;
      and ultimately prove that automaticity of a primary (motor task can be developed through&#xD;
      exposure to massive repetitions practice) and the forced subconscious processing using dual&#xD;
      task interference (Berm√∫dez, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Objectives of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- Aim of the Study: Determining the efficacy of &quot;Dual Task Training in children with ataxia&#xD;
      after Medulloblastoma Resection regarding &quot;Static Balance&quot; and &quot;Dynamic Balance&quot; as&#xD;
      indicators of Postural Control&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess static balance by measuring center of pressure using force plate mode in the&#xD;
           humac balance system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess dynamic balance by using tilt mode in the humac balance system .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the improvement on functional status and independence in ADL activities by&#xD;
           functional independence measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the more effective program for rehabilitation of children with ataxia&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the degree of ataxia in children after medulloblastoma resection by SARA scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detect the effect of cognitive interference on postural stability and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Detect if there is improvement in cognitve function after dual task training.&#xD;
