  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to administer a brief, phone(voice)-based training program in&#xD;
      mindfulness (or control task of active listening to narrated articles) to older adults who&#xD;
      receive primary care services at NM. Older adults represent a population that is at risk for&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic and the social&#xD;
      isolation it entails. Many older adults also possess relatively low access to&#xD;
      application-based mindfulness training opportunities. The monitoring aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether the experimental intervention (mindfulness training) performs&#xD;
           better than a control task (active listening) in improving mood assessed using the&#xD;
           Profile of Mood States (POMS) and/or anxiety assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
           Inventory (STAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether the experimental and/or control intervention is associated with&#xD;
           quantified changes in language use (e.g., frequency of negative word use), which may or&#xD;
           may not also be associated with changes in mood and anxiety.&#xD;
