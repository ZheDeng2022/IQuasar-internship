  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve eating disorders symptomatology, mental, psychosocial and physical&#xD;
      health, quality of life, strength and body composition of adolescents with eating disorders&#xD;
      by the development of a dog-assisted therapy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research will involve thirty-two patients distributed equally in a control and an&#xD;
      experimental group. The intervention group will participate once a week in a dog-assisted&#xD;
      therapy of seven weeks. Moreover, all the included patients will participate in an assessment&#xD;
      session before and after the intervention to compare the effects of the dog-assisted therapy&#xD;
      within and between groups in anxiety, depression, character, behavior, eating disorder&#xD;
      evolution, health-related quality of life, treatment satisfaction, strength and body&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies on different populations, it is expected that, compared to the&#xD;
      control group, the experimental group may experience a potential reduction in anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and symptoms, while improving quality of life, strength, body composition and&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Animal-Assisted Therapies (AAT) have proved to increase self-esteem, social capacity and&#xD;
      impulse control while reducing anxiety and depression. Thus, AAT could be an innovative and&#xD;
      effective therapy to improve the mental, social and physical health of adolescents with&#xD;
      eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies on different populations, it is expected that, compared to the&#xD;
      control group, the experimental group may experience a potential reduction in anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and symptoms, while improving quality of life, strength, body composition and&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-two adolescents, younger than 18 years and diagnosed with eating disorders from the&#xD;
      University Hospital Niño Jesus will participate in this study. The informed consent must be&#xD;
      signed to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of 7 weeks conducted once a week (50 minutes each session). It&#xD;
      will include three parts: 1) a welcome part aimed to get in touch with the dog, 2) a main&#xD;
      part, where participants will be taught basic notions about dog training and then try to&#xD;
      train the dogs. In this part, the patients will perform different activities and exercises&#xD;
      with the dog. 3) A closing part to say goodbye to the dogs.&#xD;
