  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial that will examine the efficacy of IV iron&#xD;
      supplementation when compared to placebo, with and without exercise training, on changes in&#xD;
      patient exercise capacity. The study aims to provide sufficient data to inform a power&#xD;
      calculation for the definitive study to examine whether IV iron therapy in patients with CKD&#xD;
      stages 3-4 (non-dialysis) can improve exercise capacity, muscle metabolism and physical&#xD;
      function. Specifically, we propose to examine whether a strategy of IV iron therapy in&#xD;
      patients with stages 3-4 CKD who are iron-deficient but NOT anaemic leads to improvements in&#xD;
      exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little is currently known about the effects of iron deficiency on cardiac or skeletal&#xD;
      muscle metabolism in patients suffering from CKD. Nevertheless, it seems likely that iron&#xD;
      deficiency will contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced energy production in&#xD;
      cardiac or skeletal muscle of CKD patients, and importantly may contribute to the reduced&#xD;
      exercise capacity, physical function and overwhelming fatigue commonly reported in this&#xD;
      population. The results of this trial will provide data to ascertain whether intravenous iron&#xD;
      therapy might be beneficial to exercise capacity, muscle metabolism, physical function, and&#xD;
      fatigue and whether iron repletion enhances the effect of an exercise intervention.&#xD;
