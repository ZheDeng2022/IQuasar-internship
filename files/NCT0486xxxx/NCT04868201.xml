  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the efficacy of a fully self-guided app-based virtual reality cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy (VR CBT) using low-cost (cardboard) virtual reality goggles compared with a wait-list&#xD;
      control group and to determine its user friendliness. We hypothesize that children with GAD&#xD;
      enrolled in the self-guided app will present lower scores of anxiety.&#xD;

      A randomized controlled design will be carried out, in which the effectiveness and user-&#xD;
      friendliness of an online app-based VR self-help treatment '0-anxiety' will be evaluated. Our&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine the clinical effects (a reduction in anxiety symptoms at&#xD;
      post-test [between the experimental condition and controls] of 0-anxiety, and whether effects&#xD;
      are sustainable at follow-up [a reduction in anxiety symptoms between baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      for those in the experimental condition]). Our secondary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      user-friendliness of 0-anxiety. In this study, 230 children from the Brazilian population&#xD;
      will be randomized over 2 conditions: the experimental condition (0-anxiety) and a waitlist&#xD;
      condition. The duration of the intervention will be 3 weeks. Measures will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline, directly after the intervention (3 weeks) and at 3 months (follow-up). All measures&#xD;
      will be completed online. Therefore, the child will participate in the study in his/her&#xD;
      natural environment. Subjects in the wait-list condition will receive the intervention after&#xD;
      completion of the post-test. Randomization (block-randomization) will be performed by an&#xD;
      independent researcher.&#xD;

    <measure>Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 weeks after the intervention, and 3 months after the completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The FSSC-R is a widely used self-report measure of children and adolescents' fears. The instrument, a revision of Scherer and Nakamura's (1968) original Fear Survey Schedule for Children, contains 80 items that are each rated on a three-point scale (none, some, a lot). A total fearfulness score can be obtained, as can five subscale scores based on a factor analysis of the items. In addition, the number of intense fears can be indicated (i.e., the number of fears endorsed 'a lot'), as can the most prevalent fears for a given child/adolescent or group of children and adolescents (i.e., boys, preadolescents, school phobic youngsters, etc.). Higher scores mean worse fear levels.</description>

    <measure>Spence Children's Anxiety Scale - Parent and Children version</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 weeks after the intervention, and 3 months after the completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is completed by a parent of an anxious child between the ages of 6 to 18. It provides an overall measure of anxiety together with scores on six sub-scales each tapping a specific aspect of child anxiety. - Panic attack and agoraphobia - Separation anxiety - Physical injury fears - Social phobia - Obsessive compulsive - Generalized anxiety disorder / overanxious disorder. This yields a maximum possible score of 114. Higher scores mean worse anxiety levels.</description>

    <description>0-anxiety is based on the principles of VRT and CBT, which currently is the most researched and used treatment for anxiety disorders. The 0-anxiety intervention is an app-based intervention consisting of six modules that can be followed according to a user's own timing and without the intervention of a therapist.</description>
