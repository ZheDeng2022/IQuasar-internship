    <textblock>
      This project seeks to identify DNA-adducts in colon tissue from different groups of patients&#xD;
      with CRC scheduled for complete or partial colon resections. Other patients scheduled for&#xD;
      resection of the colon serve as controls. In addition, surrogate samples such as white blood&#xD;
      cells are investigated for the presense of adducts while blood plasma and urine are&#xD;
      investigated for the presense of DNA-repair products.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) develops as a result of multiple genetic mutations causing normal&#xD;
      intestinal epithelium to transform into a colorectal carcinoma. Genetic mutations may be&#xD;
      caused by many different genetic events including chemical damage to the DNA nucleosides.&#xD;
      These chemical modifications are due to both exogenous compounds coming from diet,&#xD;
      environment and gut microbiota, or endogenous compounds produced by our own metabolic&#xD;
      processes like inflammation and oxidative stress. Such genetic alteration is thought to be&#xD;
      the starting event leading to development of sporadic CRC. However, there is little&#xD;
      understanding on which DNA nucleoside modifications are associated with increased risk of CRC&#xD;
      and their mechanism of action. The study of these DNA nucleoside modifications has been&#xD;
      addressed in the recent years by a new research field, called DNA adductomics. DNA&#xD;
      adductomics uses the new advanced high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentations&#xD;
      for identifying the complexes that are formed between toxic compounds and DNA, namely DNA&#xD;
      adducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have been previously identified DNA adducts in CRC with older technology.&#xD;
      However, there is not a real evidence on which DNA adducts are related to sporadic CRC,&#xD;
      hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and other diseases such as familial&#xD;
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) which turns into CRC with a 95% risk before the age of 35. The&#xD;
      lack of more recent human studies in DNA adductomics is mainly due to the lack of appropriate&#xD;
      analytical methods. Developing such methods requires sufficient sample material and the&#xD;
      amount of sample in a colon biopsy is too low to be used for method development. In this&#xD;
      study, colon epithelial tissue obtained by resection of colon during surgery will be used for&#xD;
      developing a more sensitive method, possibly allowing DNA adduct analysis from biopsies in&#xD;
      future studies. In order to ascertain that the developed method can differentiate the level&#xD;
      of DNA-adducts between inherited CRC, sporadic CRC and non-CRC subjects, also materials from&#xD;
      other groups coming to the hospital for colon resections will be obtained. By analyzing the&#xD;
      materials obtained in a case-control manner, we might also be able to resolve whether some of&#xD;
      the DNA adducts differ between the different CRC cases or in comparison with cancer-free&#xD;
      subjects. This knowledge should provide a preliminary basis for suggesting prevention and&#xD;
      intervention approaches to reduce morbidity and mortality from CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in case-control studies, a proper selection of the subjects should be carried out by&#xD;
      assuring gender and age balance between the control group and the CRC group. This will be&#xD;
      difficult in the first part of the current study since 1) there is limited possibility of&#xD;
      obtaining resected colon from healthy subjects 2) CRC incidence rates are markedly higher in&#xD;
      men than in women, and 3) different types of CRC develop at different ages. It is also&#xD;
      obvious that a method relying on analyses of colon resections would have a limited&#xD;
      application in preventive medicine. A solution to these issues may be the use of appropriate&#xD;
      surrogate samples like blood, faeces and urine. Indeed, since DNA lesions may be removed from&#xD;
      the genome by the DNA repair system, they are often excreted in urine, in faeces, or in&#xD;
      blood. In order to know whether we may substitute tissues with surrogate samples, we will&#xD;
      explore whether there is a correlation between DNA-repair product level in surrogate samples&#xD;
      and DNA adducts in colon tissues. Substituting colon tissues with surrogates, or developing a&#xD;
      sensitive method for DNA analysis from biopsies, would allow an easier collection of the&#xD;
      samples, giving the possibility, in the future, of performing large and controlled clinical&#xD;
      studies as well as less invasive sampling from patients. This could allow to confirm a causal&#xD;
      relationship between specific DNA-adducts and CRC, providing real advances in prevention and&#xD;
      intervention approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, after the identification of the DNA adducts and DNA-repair products possibly&#xD;
      associated with CRC, it will be important to identify the real cause of DNA adducts&#xD;
      formation. Our final purpose is therefore identifying which life-style, dietary or&#xD;
      environmental factors are possibly associated with the DNA adducts and DNA-repair products&#xD;
      identified in colon and surrogate samples, respectively. For this purpose, we will perform a&#xD;
      metabolic profiling of serum, urine and faeces, a microbial profiling of faeces, and we will&#xD;
      correlate it with basic information on patient life styles about smoking, alcohol consumption&#xD;
      and intake of red meat, e.g. factors suspected to influence risk of colonic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing a causal relationship between specific DNA-adducts and CRC or other colonic&#xD;
      diseases, and understanding the causes for DNA adducts formation, will not only yield much&#xD;
      richer insights into the molecular defects but will also result in advances in prevention and&#xD;
      intervention approaches.&#xD;
