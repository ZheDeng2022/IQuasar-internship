  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized cross-over study compares two identical cardiorespiratory exercise bouts,&#xD;
      differing only in the inclusion or exclusion of a dynamic period of increasing exercise&#xD;
      intensity prior to the exercise bout. Planned comparisons include physiological responses and&#xD;
      perceived effort during exercise, leukocyte mobilization, and mood between the two exercise&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physically active adult men and women are asked to complete three study visits to the&#xD;
      laboratory. On Visit 1, participants provide informed consent and are screened for study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: being between 18 and 40 years of age, a non-smoker, not pregnant, free of&#xD;
      disease impacting exercise performance or immunity, and performing at least one hour per week&#xD;
      of vigorous exercise training (any modality) for at least the prior six months. Participants&#xD;
      also complete an incremental submaximal exercise test on a stationary bicycle. The results of&#xD;
      this test are used to calculate the resistance corresponding to 80% of estimated maximal&#xD;
      heart rate. Participants return within 2-14 days for Visits 2 and 3. These visits consist of&#xD;
      30 min of bicycling at this resistance. One visit included a 10 min dynamic warm-up prior to&#xD;
      the exercise bout. Participants were stratified by sex and randomized such that half of the&#xD;
      men and women completed the exercise trial with warm-up during Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate, perceived exertion, and wattage are recorded during each minute of the exercise&#xD;
      bouts. Participants donate blood before, immediately after, and 1h after each exercise. Blood&#xD;
      is analyzed by flow cytometry to characterize leukocyte subsets. After each exercise session,&#xD;
      participants complete surveys assessing mood and affect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological, immunological, and psychological parameters recorded will be compared within&#xD;
      participants between the two experimental exercise sessions using appropriate statistical&#xD;
      tests. p&lt;0.05 will be accepted as significant.&#xD;
