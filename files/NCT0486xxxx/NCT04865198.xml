    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad spectrum neurodevelopmental disease. Some&#xD;
      individuals with ADS by high cognitive functions are diagnosed with High Functioning Autism&#xD;
      (HFA). Learning difficulties and memory problems are detected in children with ASD. In some&#xD;
      studies, it has been shown that NEURL1 gene increases learning and memory and RGS14 gene is&#xD;
      suppressed them. We aimed to evaluate the differences between the expression levels of these&#xD;
      genes between ASD, HFA and healthy controls and the role of these genes in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of ASD. Patients with ASD (N=20) and HFA (N=20), and healthy controls(N=20) compatible with&#xD;
      patient ages were included in this study. Expression of NEURL-1 and RGS14 genes was evaluated&#xD;
      by quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a complex and neuro-developmental disease starting in the&#xD;
      early stages of life and is characterized by cognitive and behavioral disorders (Ansel et&#xD;
      al., 2008). In addition, the definition of High Functioning Autism (HFA) is used for the&#xD;
      individuals who are diagnosed with ASD with an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of 70 and above&#xD;
      with no mental disabilities (Alvares et al., 2020). It is considered that the etiology of ASD&#xD;
      stems from genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors; however, it has not yet been&#xD;
      definitively clarified(Ito et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was shown in previous studies that individuals who are diagnosed with ASD have learning&#xD;
      disabilities (Sullivan et al., 2019) and disorders in cognitive episodic memory, future&#xD;
      planning, visual working memory (Goh and Peterson 2012). In some studies, it has been shown&#xD;
      that NEURL1 gene increases learning and memory and RGS14 gene is suppressed them (Pavlopoulos&#xD;
      et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2010). Considering this information, we aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      differences between the expression levels of these genes between ASD, HFA and healthy&#xD;
      controls and the role of these genes in the pathogenesis of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with ASD (n=20) and HFA (n=20), and healthy controls (n=20) compatible with patient&#xD;
      ages were included in this study. Clinical evaluations of the patients were made and&#xD;
      classification was made in accordance with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For RNA isolation, 2 ml of peripheral blood was taken from each subjects. RNA isolation was&#xD;
      made in line with the recommended protocol by using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche&#xD;
      Diagnostic, Version 12, Germany) from the blood samples taken from the groups. The quality&#xD;
      and quantity of the RNA was measured with nanodrop (Nanodrop 2000/Thermo Scientific, USA).&#xD;
      Analyses were made in the RNAs by using the Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit&#xD;
      (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim). Since the amount of the target genes is less in the&#xD;
      blood, pre-amplification was performed by applying Realtime Ready Assays (NEURL1, RGS14, ACTB&#xD;
      genes primary and probes) and Multiplex PCR before Real Time PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of the NEURL1 and RGS14 genes were determined with the Semiquantitative&#xD;
      Real-Time PCR Method by using the hybrid probe. The LightCycler®480 Real Time Ready Assay&#xD;
      Master Probe Kit (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim) was used, and the analysis was made in&#xD;
      Light Cycler in the study. The incubation was made with the PCR device program for 10 minutes&#xD;
      at 95oC for 45 cycles, for 10 sec at 95oC, and for 60 sec at 60oC. The Ct values were&#xD;
      obtained from the Light Cycler 480 Software Program, and both genes were analyzed separately.&#xD;
      The 2-ΔΔCT method was applied for the relative quantification of the samples that were&#xD;
      normalized with ACTB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statisticaly:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fitness of the data to normal distribution was evaluated with Histogram, q-q graphics,&#xD;
      and Shapiro-Wilk Test. Variance homogeneity was evaluated with the Levene Test. Inter-group&#xD;
      comparisons were evaluated with the Pearson's Chi-Square analysis and Fisher's Exact&#xD;
      Chi-Square Test for qualitative variables, and with Mann-Whitney U-Test, Kruskal-Wallis&#xD;
      H-Test, and One-Way Variance Analysis for quantitative variables. Spearman's test was used&#xD;
      for correlation analysis. The data were expressed as mean and standard deviation, or median&#xD;
      with 25 and 75 percentages. The analysis of the data was made at R 3.1.1 (www.r-project.org).&#xD;
      The P&lt;0.05 level was taken as significant.&#xD;
