      The aim of this project is to assess the effectiveness of the fruit and vegetable (FV)&#xD;
      gardening component of the Preventing Obesity by Design strategy to support preschool fresh&#xD;
      fruit and vegetable knowledge, liking and consumption, and physical activity in children 3-5&#xD;
      years old living in under-resourced communities and attending childcare using a Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trial research design. Sample: 15 childcare centers, 286 children.&#xD;

      Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a gardening component on preschool children's&#xD;
      knowledge, liking and consumption of fruit and vegetable consumption, and their level of&#xD;
      physical activity during gardening season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Fruit and vegetable garden installation. Childcare centers were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three groups: Group 1, intervention (5 centers); Group 2, wait list&#xD;
      control (5 centers); Group 3, no-intervention control (5 centers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Year 1 (Spring), baseline data was collected from Groups 1 and Group 2 (waitlist). Group&#xD;
      1, initial intervention centers, received the garden intervention in the Summer and both&#xD;
      groups were assessed in the Fall, post intervention. No further data was collected from Group&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Year 2 (Spring), Group 2 (waitlist, now intervention) and Group 3 were assessed. Group 2,&#xD;
      received the garden intervention in the Summer of Year 2 and both groups were assessed in the&#xD;
      Fall of Year 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No further data was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: 15 centers. Children: 286 (4 and 5 years old). Center demographic profile includes&#xD;
      child data: age, gender, parental education, race/ethnicity, special needs, and height/weight&#xD;
      (BMI). To avoid losing &quot;graduating&quot; five year old children, post-intervention data was&#xD;
      gathered before school start date.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in fruit consumption, measured by mean weight of 6 snack-time fruit consumed after 5 months of gardening</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective measurement of grams of fruit consumed during snack time data collection. Store-bought, standard pieces of fruits offered on individual segmented trays (6&quot; x 12&quot;). Each tray is labeled with a child's ID number. Six fruits (approximately 50gr/each are served). The measure is based on the Fruit &amp; Vegetable Snack Tool, Witt KE, Dunn C. Increasing Fruit and Vegetable Consumption among Preschoolers: Evaluation of Color Me Healthy. J Nutr Educ Behav. 2012;44(2):107-113.&#xD;
Fruit servings are weighed in grams before and after the snack consumption session to the nearest .01gr. Fruits offered for consumption are the same as shown on pictorial tablet questionnaires (knowledge and liking) and planted in the intervention gardens except for apple that takes too long to produce fruit.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Children wear Actigraph GT3x+ accelerometers for three consecutive days during same weeks of Outcome 1 - 6 data collection in April (before garden installation) and August (end of garden season) each study year.&#xD;
Minutes of sedentary (&lt; 8.3 counts/5 sec), light (8.4-191 counts/5 sec), moderate (192-334 counts/5 sec), and vigorous (≥335 counts/5 sec) physical activity is computed based on METS.&#xD;
