      This case-control study consists of 120 participants aged between 18 and 65 years. Case group&#xD;
      included 60 patients with bruxism who presented to physical medicine and rehabilitation&#xD;
      outpatient clinic between May 2021 and August 2021. Control group included 60 healthy&#xD;
      participant. Patients who had temporomandibular region surgery, congenital teporomandibular&#xD;
      joint pathologies, and previous temporomandibular region trauma were also excluded.&#xD;
      Assessments including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), education level, and symptom&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to effect of bruxism on temporomandibular disorders (TMD) diagnosed&#xD;
      by means of the research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders (RDC/TMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case-control study consists of 120 participants aged between 18 and 65 years. Case group&#xD;
      will be included 60 patients with bruxism who presented to physical medicine and&#xD;
      rehabilitation outpatient clinic between May 2021 and August 2021. Control group will be&#xD;
      included 60 healthy participant. Patients who had temporomandibular region surgery,&#xD;
      congenital teporomandibular joint pathologies, and previous temporomandibular region trauma&#xD;
      were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), education level, and symptom&#xD;
      duration will be recorded. Patients will evaluated according to the Diagnostic Criteria for&#xD;

    <measure>DCTMD: AI Axis I Pain Screener</measure>
    <time_frame>0 day</time_frame>
    <description>MD Pain Screener which is a simple, reliable, and valid self-report instrument used to assess for the presence of any pain-related TMD, with sensitivity and specificity ≥ 0.95 which is recommended for all patients in any clinical setting. A positive screen is followed by further evaluation to arrive at the specific TMD pain-related diagnoses.</description>

    <measure>DCTMD: AI Axis I Symptom questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Symptom questionnaire which assess pain characteristics as well as history of jaw noise, jaw locking, and headache.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>DCTMD: AI Axis I Clinical Examination Form</measure>
    <time_frame>0 day</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Examination Form- The clinical examination includes provocation tests for TMJ arthralgia of pain with any jaw movement (ie, opening, lateral, and protrusive) and TMJ palpation. For myalgia, the tests include pain with opening jaw movements and palpation of the temporalis and masseter muscles.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DCTMD: AI Axis II-Pain Drawing</measure>
    <time_frame>0 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Drawing-pain drawing of the head, jaw, and body, and it allows the patient to report the location of all pain complaints</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DCTMD: AI Axis II-Graded Chronic Pain (version 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 day</time_frame>
    <description>Graded Chronic Pain (version 2) is a short, reliable, and valid instrument that assesses pain intensity and pain-related disability.10 The two GCPS subscales are: Characteristic Pain Intensity (CPI), which reliably measures pain intensity, with ≥ 50/100 considered &quot;high intensity,&quot; and the pain-disability rating, which is based on number of days that pain interferes with activity and on extent of interference with social, work, or usual daily activities</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DCTMD: AI Axis II-Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-8 (JFLS-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 day</time_frame>
    <description>Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-8 (JFLS-8) which assesses global limitations across mastication, jaw mobility, and verbal and emotional expressionJFLS-8 is aimed to evaluate functional limitation of the jaw. The restriction due to TMD is indicated in eight items and these include changes in jaw mobility (item four), mastication (items 1-3), and verbal and emotional expression (items 5-8).Patient will asked to score between 0 and 10 according to the severity of the restriction. A higher score indicates more functional limitations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DCTMD: AI Axis II-Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) is a short, reliable, and valid screening instrument for detecting &quot;psychological distress&quot; due to anxiety and/or depression in patients in any clinical setting.A cutoff of &gt; 6, suggesting moderate psychological stress, should be interpreted as warranting observation, while a cutoff of &gt; 9, suggesting severe psychological distress, should be interpreted as warranting either further assessment or referral</description>

    <description>patient diagnosed with bruxism The presence of bruxism was based on self-reported bruxism and examination. Self reported bruxism was recorded as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; . Participants were examined for the existence of four clinical signs of bruxism: (I) abnormal tooth wear, (II) impressions of teeth in the buccal area, (III) impressions of teeth on the tongue, and (IV) hypertrophy of the masseter muscle. In this study, clinical signs of bruxism were considered present if one of the four items was answered &quot;yes.&quot;</description>
