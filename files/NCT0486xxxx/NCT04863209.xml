  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects osteopathic techniques at the upper&#xD;
      cervical vertebrae or at the sphenopalatine ganglia on the intraocular pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 30 volunteers will be randomized into 3 groups and there will be an experimental group 1&#xD;
      that will receive a technique of manipulation of the upper cervical, an experimental group 2&#xD;
      that will receive a technique of manipulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion and a control&#xD;
      group that will not receive any intervention. Each group will have 10 volunteers each. There&#xD;
      will be 3 assessments, one before the procedure, one just after the procedure and one 30&#xD;
      minutes after the procedure.&#xD;

    <description>The patient will be in the supine position. The cephalic hand will make contact with one side of the patient's skull, leaving the sternocleidomastoid muscle between the third and fourth fingers. The caudal hand will make global contact with the patient's skull on the opposite side. The therapist should place his torso on the patient's head, leaving the two forearms aligned with the axis of the patient's spine, as this technique is applied to the axis of the odontoid process of the ax. With neutral flexion-extension the therapist will place the rotation parameter to the opposite side (70-80 degrees) and a small contralateral inclination. Then it will search for the driving barrier with a small axial traction movement. When the driving barrier is found, the thrust should be applied in a helical direction, increasing rotation and traction. It will be applied bilaterally.</description>

    <description>The patient will be supine on the bench and the therapist with gloves will sit next to the patient contralateral to the manipulated sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG). One of the therapist's hands will be placed flat in contact with the apex of the patient's head to stabilize it. The patient will be instructed to open his mouth and deviate the mandible laterally to the same side of the ganglion to be treated. The therapist will then apply pressure to the SPG with the fifth finger of your other hand in the patient's mouth, moving up along the alveolar process of the maxilla teeth to reach the pterygoid process. The therapist will keep the patient's head elevated until the lateral pterygoid muscle relaxes. Then, the pressure will be applied into the pterygopalatine fossa. The therapist will then apply gentle pressure on the SPG with the pulp of the fifth finger until tissue relaxation. He will then release the contralateral SPG in the same way.</description>
