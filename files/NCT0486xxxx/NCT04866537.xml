      To evaluate the diagnostic performance of antenatal echocardiography with regard to the main&#xD;
      diagnosis of heart disease made by cardio-pediatricians at the couple-child hospital in&#xD;
      Grenoble according to the ACC-CHD classification, in pregnant women who have had a fetal&#xD;
      heart ultrasound between 2015 and 2019.&#xD;

      This work is in line with the desire of the Pluridisciplinary Center for Pre-Natal Diagnosis&#xD;
      (CPDPN) of the Arc Alpin network, to assess their professional practices regarding the&#xD;
      prenatal diagnosis of heart disease over the last five years from 2015 to 2019, and so&#xD;
      identify areas for improving their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the Arc-Alpin network, pregnant women for whom an abnormality is detected in the fetus&#xD;
      during the screening ultrasound, then benefit from a diagnostic ultrasound, to confirm the&#xD;
      detected abnormality. Then, the patient's file will be studied within the CPDPN of the Alpine&#xD;
      Arc, and the patient will then be referred to a doctor specializing in the diagnosed fetal&#xD;
      pathology. The latter will prescribe additional examinations to characterize as much as&#xD;
      possible the diagnosed pathology, in order to develop a course of action to be taken, and to&#xD;
      establish a prognosis for this fetus (specialized ultrasound, MRI, amniocentesis, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the diagnosis of fetal heart disease, the woman will be referred to&#xD;
      cardio-pediatricians at the Couple Enfant Hospital in Grenoble, who will perform a so-called&#xD;
      specialized 2nd line ultrasound in order to clarify the diagnosis, to develop a course of&#xD;
      action to take, and establish a prognosis for this unborn child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore want to study the diagnostic performance of specialized 2nd line fetal cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound in the CPDPN network of the Alpin Arc, by comparing the diagnosis established&#xD;
      following the 2nd line fetal echocardiography with the reference examination (test of&#xD;
      reference) which is the postnatal cardiac ultrasound.&#xD;
