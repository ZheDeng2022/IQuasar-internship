  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypotheses of the study are that the diagnostic accuracy of Multiplate® device for&#xD;
      diagnosis of aspirin resistance is comparable to the serum TXB2 assay and that certain&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms and phenotypic factors significantly influence the antiplatelet effect&#xD;
      of aspirin and contribute to aspirin resistance observed in this study.&#xD;

      Fasting blood samples will be obtained from patients in the study centre after fasting&#xD;
      overnight for at least 10 hours immediately before and 1 hour after the 80 mg aspirin dose. A&#xD;
      5-ml blood sample will be obtained in a serum separator tube and allowed to clot at room&#xD;
      temperature followed by centrifugation at 4 degrees C. Separated serum will be stored in&#xD;
      aliquots at -80°C until analysis of TXB2. A 3-ml blood sample will be obtained in a hirudin&#xD;
      blood tube for the platelet aggregation test with the Multiplate® analyzer which will be&#xD;
      performed within 3 hours after blood collection. A 10 ml blood sample will be obtained in an&#xD;
      ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) tube to be used for DNA extraction. During the&#xD;
      study, a total of 26 ml blood will be taken from each participant. Morning urine samples&#xD;
      before and 1 hour after aspirin ingestion will also be collected and stored at -80 °C until&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platelet activity of the samples will be measured with the hirudin blood using the&#xD;
      Multiplate analyzer from Roche (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd, CH-6343 Rotkreuz,&#xD;
      Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions for the arachidonic acid induced&#xD;
      platelet aggregation (ASPI) test. It will be analyzed within 0.5-3 hours after blood&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serum samples will be assayed for TXB2 with EIA kits from Cayman (Item no. 501020, Cayman&#xD;
      Chemical, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urine will be assayed for 11-dehydro TXB2 using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (EIA) kit from Cayman (Item no. 519510, Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions. The data will then be standardized with urinary creatinine&#xD;
      measured with Cayman creatinine (urinary) colorimetric assay kit (item no 500701).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 11-dehydro TXB2 data will be standardized with the urinary creatinine levels measured by&#xD;
      Creatinine (urinary) Colorimetric Assay kit from Cayman (Item no. 500701, Cayman Chemical,&#xD;
      MI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA of the patients will be extracted from EDTA blood by using phenol chloroform. The&#xD;
      following six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be investigated initially: ITGA2&#xD;
      rs1126643, ITGA2B rs5911, PTGS1 rs1330344, ADK rs16931294, PEAR1 rs12041331 and COX2 rs20417.&#xD;
      The SNPs will be assayed with TaqMan SNP genotyping assays from Applied Biosystems (Applied&#xD;
      Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) by Thermo Fisher Scientific according to the product&#xD;
      inserts.&#xD;
