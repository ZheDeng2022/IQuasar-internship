  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quercetin is a flavonoid dietary supplement that occurs in many edible fruits and vegetables.&#xD;
      It has remarkable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunoprotective and antiviral properties.&#xD;
      It is widely used to boost the body immune system against infections and keeping healthy&#xD;
      life-style. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the potential benefits of&#xD;
      quercetin for preventing COVID-19 disease progression and symptoms improvement in the early&#xD;
      stage of infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of quercetin are closely related to&#xD;
      its effective fight against a variety of disease conditions related to inflammation,&#xD;
      including: viral infections, allergies, asthma, hay fever, arthritis, respiratory diseases,&#xD;
      &quot;hardening of the arteries&quot; (atherosclerosis), high cholesterol, heart disease and&#xD;
      circulation problems, insulin resistance and diabetes, eye-related disorders, including&#xD;
      cataracts, stomach ulcers, cognitive impairment, gout, cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome,&#xD;
      inflammation of the prostate, bladder, and ovaries, chronic infections of the prostate, skin&#xD;
      disorders, including dermatitis and hives. Quercetin can help stop damaging particles in the&#xD;
      body known as free radicals, which damages the cells by natural oxidation processes. It can&#xD;
      also reduce the expression of inflammatory genes in the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quercetin has been shown to be effective against broad range of viruses including human&#xD;
      respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), rhinovirus, echovirus, coxsackievirus, poliovirus,&#xD;
      parainfluenza type 3, Herpes Simplex Virus-1, cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-1, dengue virus, and&#xD;
      Hepatitis C virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the potential benefits of quercetin for&#xD;
      preventing COVID-19 disease progression and improving symptoms in the early stage of&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
