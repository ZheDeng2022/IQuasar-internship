    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human phase I, open-label, single-site, dose escalation study to determine&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and Plasmodium falciparum transmission reducing activity of the&#xD;
      R0.6C vaccine in two different adjuvant combinations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-two healthy adult volunteers will be recruited and divided over the study arms that&#xD;
      will receive four vaccinations on days 0, 28, 56 and 168 with either 30μg or 100μg of R0.6C&#xD;
      adjuvanted with Alhydrogel alone, or combined with Matrix-M1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three volunteers (Group 1A, n=3) will receive four vaccinations with the lower dose of 30μg&#xD;
      R0.6C with Alhydrogel, and, in parallel, three volunteers (Group 1B, n=3) will receive four&#xD;
      vaccinations with the lower dose of 30μg R0.6C with Alhydrogel and Matrix-M1. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be closely monitored for adverse events for a period of minimally 14 days after the first&#xD;
      vaccination. If safe, an additional 5 volunteers per adjuvant arm (groups 2A and 2B) will&#xD;
      then receive four vaccinations with the lower dose (30μg R0.6C). If considered safe following&#xD;
      a minimum of 14 days of follow-up after the first R0.6C administration of groups 2A and 2B,&#xD;
      three volunteers per adjuvant arm (groups 3A and 3B) will start the vaccination regimen with&#xD;
      the higher dose of 100μg R0.6C. Finally, a minimum of 14 days after administration of the&#xD;
      first vaccination in groups 3A and 3B, if considered safe, an additional 5 volunteers per&#xD;
      adjuvant arm (groups 4A and 4B) will initiate the vaccination regimen with the higher dose of&#xD;
      100μg R0.6C. There will be no placebo group. All volunteers will be followed up for adverse&#xD;
      events until 84 days after the last immunisation. Total trial duration is approximately 8&#xD;
      months for each subject. Blood will be collected to assess functional Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      transmission reducing activity (TRA) and transmission blocking activity (TBA) by standard&#xD;
      membrane feeding assay (SMFA), as well as immunogenicity, at pre-specified time points after&#xD;
      R0.6C vaccinations compared to pre-vaccination values.&#xD;
