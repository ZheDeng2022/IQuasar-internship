  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of the collaborative health management&#xD;
      model on the functional status, quality of life and rehospitalization rate of patients with&#xD;
      heart failure. This is a three-year project. The first phase (introduction phase): A&#xD;
      systematic literature review and meta-analysis of collaborative care and heart failure&#xD;
      patients will be conducted, and relevant research results will be evaluated for the clinical&#xD;
      benefits of heart failure patients, and empirical knowledge will be proposed as The basic&#xD;
      holistic conclusions are supported by the research literature on the establishment of a&#xD;
      collaborative health management model for heart failure (CHMM). The second stage&#xD;
      (construction period): based on the results of systematic literature review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis, adopt the CHMM model, design intervention measures, and conduct pilot studies&#xD;
      to determine the safety and feasibility of the research, and review future research&#xD;
      improvements Wherever possible, develop more complete intervention measures. The third stage&#xD;
      (operation period): Randomized controlled trials were adopted, with random sampling and&#xD;
      double-blind research design. In the cardiology ward of a regional teaching hospital in the&#xD;
      south, 120 patients with heart failure who met the admission criteria were selected, and 60&#xD;
      patients were selected as control group. The group received routine care in the hospital, and&#xD;
      60 of the experimental group received interventions in the collaborative health management&#xD;
      model. Data collection includes variables such as physiological indices, functional status,&#xD;
      self-care behavior, quality of life, re-admission rate, medical cost. Instruments tools&#xD;
      include Minnesota Heart Failure Quality of Life Questionnaire, European Heart Failure&#xD;
      Self-care Behavior Scale after the intervention 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months.The&#xD;
      intervention effect will be statistically verified and analyzed by GEE. It is hoped that this&#xD;
      care model will be applied to the clinical care of patients with heart failure, and will be&#xD;
      verified by clinical benefits, reduce symptom troubles, improve quality of life, and reduce&#xD;
      medical costs.&#xD;
