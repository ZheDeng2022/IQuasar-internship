  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Movement and loading asymmetry have been associated with injury risk for a variety of both&#xD;
      acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries. In addition, asymmetric movements have been&#xD;
      identified as compensatory strategies to allow for ambulation in a variety of post-operative&#xD;
      populations. Osteopathic physicians have been assessing both structure and function through&#xD;
      the use of structural evaluation techniques along with postural assessment that can identify&#xD;
      somatic dysfunction. However, no studies have identified the ability of an osteopathic&#xD;
      structural evaluation and postural assessment to identify potential movement disorders and&#xD;
      loading asymmetry. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine the acute&#xD;
      impact of an osteopathic manipulation on restoration of side-to-side symmetry during walking&#xD;
      gait in participants who are categorized as having lower extremity dysfunction. We enrolled&#xD;
      51 participants who are pain-free and without a history of major orthopaedic injuries that&#xD;
      required surgical intervention. Each subject completed an osteopathic structural evaluation&#xD;
      and postural assessment along with an osteopathic manipulation. All participants completed&#xD;
      instrumented gait analyses before and after the osteopathic manipulation using a motion&#xD;
      capture system and an instrumented treadmill to determine the participant's movement and&#xD;
      loading asymmetry during walking.&#xD;

      Following recruitment and the completion of informed consent, each subject had a standard&#xD;
      osteopathic postural assessment. This assessment was completed by a single experienced&#xD;
      osteopathic physicians who uses manual medicine techniques in clinical practice as well as&#xD;
      teaching these techniques to osteopathic medical students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the osteopathic exam, all participants completed an initial biomechanical&#xD;
      assessment in the Kevin P. Granata Biomechanics Lab at Virginia Tech. All subjects wore form&#xD;
      fitting shorts and a shirt, plus a pair of athletic shoes (Nike Pegasus, Nike Inc, Beaverton,&#xD;
      CO) all of which was provided for them to use during testing. Patients had retro-reflective&#xD;
      markers attached at specific locations on both lower extremities to track segmental motion&#xD;
      level walking. Three-dimensional coordinate data was collected using a 8-camera motion&#xD;
      capture system at a sampling rate of 120 Hz (Qualysis, Sweden). Ground reaction forces were&#xD;
      collected using an instrumented treadmill with a sampling rate of 1440 Hz (AMTI, Watertown,&#xD;
      Massachusetts). Each subject completed a standing trial followed by 2 walking trials.&#xD;
      Participants completed 5 minutes of continuous steady state walking at 1.5m/s on the&#xD;
      instrumented treadmill. Participants then completed a second 5 minute walking trial at their&#xD;
      self-selected speed on the instrumented treadmill. During both 5 minute walking trials, data&#xD;
      was collected simultaneously from the motion capture system and the instrumented treadmill&#xD;
      from minute 1 through minute 4 in order to avoid collection during the beginning and end of&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial biomechanical examination, osteopathic manipulation was performed on&#xD;
      participants in the Dysfunction group. The osteopathic manipulations were focused on treating&#xD;
      the asymmetric postural dysfunction that was identified by the initial functional structural&#xD;
      evaluation. The manipulation consisted of typical time-honored osteopathic treatments&#xD;
      directed at the identified somatic dysfunction(s). These techniques were clinically directed&#xD;
      and include: soft tissue, muscle energy, high velocity low amplitude, low velocity high&#xD;
      amplitude as well as facilitated positional release as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the osteopathic manipulation, participants completed the same walking assessment for a&#xD;
      second time. This immediate post-biofeedback testing was completed using the same protocol as&#xD;
      the baseline assessment previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All osteopathic assessments and manipulations were completed by a single experienced&#xD;
      osteopathic clinicians and the biomechanical assessments was completed by a second individual&#xD;
      using a standard set of directions.&#xD;
