  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study was to observe the changes of HBsAg levels after a&#xD;
      sequential 48 weeks-treatment of TAF in ETV experienced CHB patients and to monitor the&#xD;
      levels of cytokines such as IFN-λ3, IP-10, IL-12, IL-10, and IL-21.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first-line NAs include entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir&#xD;
      alafenamide (TAF). All the NAs mentioned above could achieve complete virologic response. NAs&#xD;
      mentioned above are sufficient in inhibiting viral replication. However, there may exist&#xD;
      difference in long-term prognosis such as HBsAg level decline, resistance development and HCC&#xD;
      development. A prospective study performed by our team previously showed that TDF was better&#xD;
      than ETV in HBsAg decline. A Korean research showed that TDF therapy was associated with a&#xD;
      significantly lower risk of HCC than ETV therapy; the TDF group showed a distinct reduction&#xD;
      in HBsAg level after one-year treatment. Also, a Japanese RCT study indicated that the&#xD;
      reduction in HBsAg level was significantly greater in the TDF arm than the ETV arm at week&#xD;
      24. The mechanism of HBsAg decline induced by TDF has not been fully elucidated. Patients&#xD;
      treated with nucleotide analogues (adefovir, tenofovir) had higher serum IFN-λ3 levels than&#xD;
      those treated with nucleoside analogues (lamivudine, entecavir), according to results&#xD;
      recently published in Gut. A team from Japan has found that nucleotide analogues inhibit&#xD;
      LPS-mediated IL-10 production and induce IL-12p70 and TNF-α production. We speculated that,&#xD;
      compared with entecavir, tenofovir could up-regulate IFN-λ3 and reduce the level of HBsAg&#xD;
      more significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As known as the second generation of TDF, TAF has a significantly longer half-life than TDF.&#xD;
      A phase 3 study displayed that TAF 25 mg was non-inferior to TDF 300 mg in suppressing HBV&#xD;
      replication, with a better performance in renal and bone safety. However, there is lack of&#xD;
      study evaluating TAF in reducing HBsAg and induces IFN-λ3.The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate whether the TAF can achieve a better antiviral therapeutic endpoint, i.e. a&#xD;
      greater reduction in HBsAg levels, or even meet the therapeutic expectation of stopping NAS&#xD;
      in a larger number of treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical study was to observe the changes of HBsAg levels after a&#xD;
      sequential 48 weeks-treatment of TAF in ETV experienced CHB patients and to monitor the&#xD;
      levels of cytokines such as IFN-λ3, IP-10, IL-12, IL-10, and IL-21.&#xD;
