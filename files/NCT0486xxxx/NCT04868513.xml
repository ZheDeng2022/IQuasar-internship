  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence exists on the vertical transmission of Streptococcus mutans from the mother to her&#xD;
      children. This transmission can be prevented by maintaining maternal oral health during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the enhancing effect of 1% chlorhexidine varnish&#xD;
      together with silane fluoride re-mineralizing varnish and oral health promotion strategy on&#xD;
      the reduction of S. mutans counts in saliva of pregnant women and the early mother-infant&#xD;
      transmission until the first six months of age of the newborn. Methods: An open, random&#xD;
      clinical trial of parallel groups was performed. 56 pregnant women free of caries were&#xD;
      studied prospectively and longitudinally since the third trimester of gestation until 6&#xD;
      months after giving birth, the newborns were also assessed until reaching 6 months of age.&#xD;
      Two groups were formed assigning 28 women to each intervention group. G-I received 0.1%&#xD;
      silane fluoride applied as varnish in each visit. G-II women's teeth were coated with 0.1%&#xD;
      silane fluoride and 1% chlorhexidine. For the primary culture, CRT Bacteria® system&#xD;
      (Ivoclar-Vivadent™) was used for the growth and identification of cariogenic Streptococci.&#xD;
      Identification of S. mutans was performed through PCR. The DNA of the isolates identified&#xD;
      molecularly as S. mutans was used for a second PCR reaction using the arbitrary primer OPA-O2&#xD;
      to determine the homology among the samples of isolated bacteria from the mother-child pair.&#xD;

    <measure>Caries prevalence assessment in pregnant womens</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal measurement, at the beginning of the third trimester of gestation.</time_frame>
    <description>For this purpose, the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth Index was used to measure the prevalence of caries. This index is based on in-field clinical examination of individuals by using a probe, mirror and cotton rolls, and simply counts the number of decayed, missing (due to caries only) and restored teeth the number of participants with prevalence of caries will be reported.</description>
