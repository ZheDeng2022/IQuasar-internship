      The objective of this study is to demonstrate safe and effective use of the Ringer perfusion&#xD;
      balloon catheter for dilatation/pre-dilatation of coronary stenoses during percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI).&#xD;

      A prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical study. The study will be conducted in 3 to 5&#xD;
      investigational sites in the US and Canada and will enroll up to 60 participants. The&#xD;
      population for this study is adult participants undergoing non-emergent percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) as a stand-alone procedure or following non-emergent diagnostic&#xD;
      angiography performed during the same procedure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and Female subjects &gt;18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing clinically indicated non-emergent PCI as a stand-alone procedure&#xD;
             or in combination with diagnostic angiography during the same procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study target lesion characteristics: a) native de-novo coronary stenosis of at least&#xD;
             70% visually estimated stenosis, or at least 50% visually estimated stenosis and shown&#xD;
             to be physiologically significant by flow-mediated criteria (FFR &lt;0.80, IFR &lt;0.91); b)&#xD;
             estimated reference vessel diameter 2.0-4.5mm; c) lesion length &lt;25mm; d)&#xD;
             calcification not greater than mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Per investigator assessment, the patient may benefit from inflation distal perfusion&#xD;
             during balloon inflation. Examples include, but are not limited to: (i) LV systolic&#xD;
             dysfunction with LVEF&lt;50% by any modality; (ii) a territory subtended by the target&#xD;
             vessel downstream from the target lesion that is estimated to be in excess of 25% of&#xD;
             viable LV mass; (iii) prior hemodynamic or electrical instablility during intervention&#xD;
             on the target lesion; (iv) the potential to avoid placement of a coronary stent if a&#xD;
             stent-like result can be achieved through prolonged balloon inflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test per&#xD;
             standard of care for PCI and be practicing contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodynamic or arrhythmic instability within 48 hours or a myocardial infarction&#xD;
             within 72 hours of PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 2 lesions planned during index PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Procedural complication developing prior to PCI of study target.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ejection fraction (EF) &lt;25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance (Cr-Cl) &lt;25 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline flow at study target &lt;TIMI-2.&#xD;
