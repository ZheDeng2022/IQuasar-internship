  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the satiating effect of EverVita Pro when consumed at breakfast on&#xD;
      subsequent food intake. On 2 separate days, subjects will consume in random order a test&#xD;
      breakfast (bread, butter, jam), either containing containing EverVita Pro or not (control),&#xD;
      followed by an ad libitum pizza lunch 1.5 hours later. Before breakfast, after breakfast and&#xD;
      after the pizza, subjects will fill in questionnaires regarding their motivation to eat&#xD;
      (feelings of hunger/fullness). The hypothesis is that the EverVita Pro breakfast will result&#xD;
      in less pizza consumption and prolonged feeling of fullness and satiety in comparison to the&#xD;
      control bread.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A standard breakfast meal will be consumed at each visit and it will contain either the test&#xD;
      (EverVita Pro) or control product. The test meals and control meals are designed to be&#xD;
      isocaloric. The portion size of the EverVitaPro or Control bread is matched in the calories&#xD;
      equivalent to 3 slices of wholemeal bread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A (GI) symptoms questionnaire will be administered to assess GI tolerability: 1) before&#xD;
      breakfast (0'), 2) before ad -libitum pizza lunch (90'), 3) before bedtime, and 4) before&#xD;
      breakfast the following morning (24h). Comparison of satiety scores at each time point for&#xD;
      each individual question between test and control over 2h. Subjective measurements of&#xD;
      motivation to eat will be assessed using visual analog scales (VAS) by filling out the VAS&#xD;
      motivation to eat questionnaire. For instance, fullness is assessed with the following&#xD;
      statement on the left side of the line &quot;not full at all&quot; with the following statement to the&#xD;
      right side of the line &quot;As full as I have ever felt&quot;. Participants will place a vertical line&#xD;
      along the horizontal line to the point that they feel reflects their feelings at that moment.&#xD;
      Subjects will not be permitted to refer to their previous ratings when completing the VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation was done for a two-sided, two-sample t-test assuming equal variances and&#xD;
      equal sample sizes for the two groups to detect a 700 KJ difference in intake between&#xD;
      products using a non-central t-distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 60 subjects, 30 per sequence, is sufficient to detect a 700 KJ difference in&#xD;
      intake between products with 94% statistical power if the standard deviation for intake is as&#xD;
      large as 1500 KJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Individuals are allocated to the two sequence of preloads (EverVita Pro&#xD;
      meal/Control meal and Control meal/EverVita Pro meal) completely at random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome (response) measured is the energy intake 90 min after preload&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue scores (VAS) from 4 questions (Desire to eat, Hunger, Fullness, Prospective&#xD;
      consumption) and gastrointestinal severity symptoms from 9 questions (Diarrhea, Vomiting,&#xD;
      Abdominal distension, Hiccups, Stomach aches/abdominal pain, Constipation, Flatulence or gas&#xD;
      in abdomen, Nausea, Indigestion) are evaluated as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are presented as mean Â± SEM unless stated otherwise. All statistical analyses are&#xD;
      performed using R statistical software, version 3.6.3 (http://www.r-project.org/). All test&#xD;
      are two-sided and a value of P &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
