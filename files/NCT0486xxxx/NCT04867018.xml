  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overarching aim is to define the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and natural history of HO&#xD;
      by following patients from date of injury until full wound healing has occurred and the&#xD;
      window for HO has passed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To classify the acute and chronic physiologic profiles of fracture patients and how&#xD;
      they relate to the development of HO. Here the investigators will look at the systemic&#xD;
      derangements to patients' coagulation, fibrinolytic, and inflammatory profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify the true incidence and time course of HO development after traumatic&#xD;
      fracture. To accomplish this the investigators will look at patients who have sustained hip&#xD;
      fracture, midshaft/distal femur fracture, humerus fracture, proximal radius fracture, and&#xD;
      elbow dislocation/fractures and track follow-up images up to one year after injury looking&#xD;
      for HO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Define the histologic characteristics of HO development. To accomplish this aim the&#xD;
      investigators will perform a histologic analysis on a sample of injured muscle surrounding&#xD;
      the fracture area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To determine what comorbid, iatrogenic, or environmental influences are associated&#xD;
      with the formation of HO. To achieve this aim the investigators will evaluate data including&#xD;
      injury type, surgery type, operative duration, surgical approach, contamination (open vs&#xD;
      closed injury), complications (malunion, nonunion, infection, hardware failure, removal of&#xD;
      hardware), hardware type, comorbidities (smoking, cardiac history, diabetes), and&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;

      The aforementioned general inclusion/exclusion criteria will be used to determine patient&#xD;
      eligibility. All eligible patients will be identified using a patient list from StarPanel&#xD;
      provided by the managing team. The study will proceed until all eligible patients are&#xD;
      enrolled (our goal for this study is to recruit at least 1000 patients). If the patient&#xD;
      agrees to participate in the study they will be asked to sign an informed consent document by&#xD;
      the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and Comorbidities The following patient data will be recorded: age, gender,&#xD;
      height, weight, date of admission, date of discharge, diagnosis, injury time, injury type,&#xD;
      laterality, surgical approach, implants used, duration of surgery, time to union,&#xD;
      contamination (open vs closed injury), comorbidities (smoking, cardiac history, diabetes,&#xD;
      etc.), current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labs Patients will have an additional 9ml of blood drawn during their normal course of care&#xD;
      for this study up to 4 times. The draws will happen while they are an inpatient in the&#xD;
      hospital. The timing of the draw will surround the timing of their operation. They will have&#xD;
      blood drawn within 24 hours before surgery, immediately after surgery, 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery, and 72 hours after surgery. Labs values, including CBC with dif, CMP, D-Dimer, CRP,&#xD;
      PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, lactate, PAI-1, plasminogen activation assay, chromogenics,&#xD;
      plasmin-anti-plasmin complex, and phosphate will be collected for this study. Patient often&#xD;
      have a blood draw before and after surgery, one for typing and another as part of routine&#xD;
      labs. The investigators will use the remnants of those blood draws which will be stored in&#xD;
      the Vanderbilt Lab core and retrieved for further analysis by key research personnel. The&#xD;
      remaining plasma will come from another remnant blood or an extra draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue Samples Intraoperatively, investigators will request a tissue sample of the debrided&#xD;
      injured muscle from the area where the surgeon is operating. There will be no additional&#xD;
      tissue sample taken during the surgery, but what is removed in the normal course of the&#xD;
      operation will be used for analysis in our study. The amount of tissue that will be analyzed&#xD;
      for this study will vary based on how much of the injured muscle the operating physician&#xD;
      decides to take in their normal course of operation. If the tissue sample is not readily&#xD;
      accessible, such as in the case of an intramedullary nail fixation, the investigators will&#xD;
      forgo the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic imaging and notes from follow-up appointments will be examined for&#xD;
      complications, such as: malunion, nonunion, infection, hardware failure, removal of hardware,&#xD;
      presence of amorphous tissue calcification, symptomatic HO, or asymptomatic HO. Time to the&#xD;
      development of calcific complications, will also be recorded. To document post-surgical&#xD;
      complications the investigators will use imaging, photographs, progress notes, clinic notes,&#xD;
      ICD-9 codes, CPT codes and operative reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time frame for follow up visits will be based on the preference of the participant's&#xD;
      physician. Any complications resulting from the injury will be documented. Complications will&#xD;
      be documented if they occur within 2 years of injury. No study activities will take place&#xD;
      during this time frame other than recording complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated according to established clinical practice guidelines at&#xD;
      Vanderbilt Children's Hospital or Vanderbilt Medical Center, decreasing the chance that&#xD;
      differences in the patients' results and outcomes result from variability of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 Volunteers Blood Draw Blood will be taken from healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at&#xD;
      least 110 pounds. All volunteers will have a single blood draw of 100ml at the time of&#xD;
      consent. No more than 2.5% of the volunteer's blood volume will be taken at any point (100ml&#xD;
      maximum for a 110lb person in one sitting).&#xD;

    <description>The normal platelet count range is 150,000-450,000/uL. Typically a decrease in platelet count is associated with activation of coagulation, and increases represent a rebound reparative period. This is not always the case, so we will record both increases and decreases in platelet count, specifically.</description>
