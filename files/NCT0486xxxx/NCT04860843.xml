    <textblock>
      Pain management is a major concern in oncologic breast surgery and reconstruction.&#xD;
      Significant risks for acute and chronic pain after surgery might be reduced through improved&#xD;
      pain control pre-operatively. Addition of regional anesthesia to a multimodal peri-operative&#xD;
      pain management protocol offers a promising solution for improved recovery. For patients&#xD;
      undergoing mastectomy with immediate alloplastic breast reconstruction, this RCT compares&#xD;
      TPVB+Pecs II local anesthetic block with TPVB local anesthetic block and Pecs II placebo&#xD;
      normal saline block for their effect on acute pain, chronic pain, opioid consumption,&#xD;
      opioid-related side effects, patient-reported quality of recovery after surgery, and length&#xD;
      of stay.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the pilot trial are to demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and&#xD;
      to demonstrate efficacy potential. The primary objectives of the definitive trial are to&#xD;
      determine if Thoracic Paravertebral with Pecs II blocks (TPVB+PecsII) will reduce opioid&#xD;
      consumption and chronic pain compared to a TPVB+Sham block in patients undergoing mastectomy&#xD;
      with IBR using tissue expanders or implants. Secondary objectives of the definitive trial&#xD;
      include assessment of opioid consumption, patient-reported postoperative pain scores,&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting, length of stay, and patient-reported quality of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate implant-based breast&#xD;
      reconstruction, the addition of a Pecs II block to a thoracic paravertebral block&#xD;
      (TPVB+PecsII) will reduce acute and chronic patient-reported postoperative pain as compared&#xD;
      to a thoracic paravertebral block with sham Pecs II block (TPVB+Sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses include: the TPVB+PecsII over TPVB+Sham will decrease opioid&#xD;
      consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting, decrease patient-reported postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores, length of stay, and improve patient-reported quality of recovery in patients&#xD;
      undergoing total mastectomy with IBR using tissue expanders or immediate implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definitive trial will determine if TPVB+PecsII improves postoperative acute and chronic&#xD;
      pain and reduces opioid use for patients undergoing mastectomy with IBR using tissue&#xD;
      expanders or immediate implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Consensus guidelines for ERAS in breast reconstruction make a strong&#xD;
      recommendation for multimodal, opioid-sparing analgesia postoperatively based on high-level&#xD;
      evidence. Increased total opioid analgesic use has been shown to increase length of stay in&#xD;
      hospital. Reduced opioid consumption results in less postoperative nausea, vomiting, and&#xD;
      constipation, supports early ambulation, shortens hospital stays, and improves psychological&#xD;
      well being. Current ERAS protocols for alloplastic breast reconstruction are successfully&#xD;
      opioid-sparing and address acute recovery. However, opioids continue to play an important&#xD;
      role in peri-operative protocols for achieving adequate pain control, which suggests further&#xD;
      adjunctive strategies may be beneficial. Furthermore, the effects of peri-operative protocols&#xD;
      on the development of chronic pain are lacking. By evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      TPVB+PecsII in alloplastic reconstruction, our proposed study would help to establish an&#xD;
      important additional feature to the ERAS pathway for our hospital and other institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the pilot RCT is the same as the future definitive trial, a parallel-group,&#xD;
      double-blinded RCT. The target population includes patients undergoing mastectomy with IBR&#xD;
      using tissue expanders or immediate implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TPVB using local anesthetic infiltrate with Pecs II using local anesthetic infiltrate&#xD;
           (TPVB+PecsII, the intervention arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TPVB using local anesthetic infiltrate with Pecs II using normal saline infiltrate&#xD;
           (TPVB+Sham, the control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot trial will be conducted at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital (MSJH). The assignment of&#xD;
      intervention will be determined by randomization through REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned a consecutive Study ID at time of enrollment. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 to either TPVB+PecsII or TPVB+Sham. Patients undergoing symmetrizing&#xD;
      procedures as part of a bilateral breast surgery will not have a regional block on the&#xD;
      symmetrizing side (which is not IBR). Patients undergoing bilateral IBR surgery using&#xD;
      implants or expanders on both breasts will not be included in the study due to risk of local&#xD;
      anesthetic toxicity with bilateral TPVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization sequence will be created using REDCap-generated 1:1 randomization with&#xD;
      permuted blocks of varying size (4 and 6). The assignments (TPVB+PecsII or TPVB+Sham) will be&#xD;
      placed in order in opaque, consecutively numbered envelopes. The sequence and envelopes will&#xD;
      be created by an independent research assistant who will not be involved in the remainder of&#xD;
      the study implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants, Operating Room (OR) anesthesiologists, surgeons, research assistants, and&#xD;
      nurses in the OR, Post-anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), and ward will be blinded as to whether a&#xD;
      participant receives TPVB+PecsII or TPVB+Sham block. At MSJH, the anesthesiologists in the&#xD;
      operative theater are separate from the team of regional anesthesiologists performing&#xD;
      regional blocks in the preoperative area. Only the regional anesthesiologist and anesthesia&#xD;
      assistant in the preoperative block area, who will administer the regional block, will be&#xD;
      unblinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, the regional anesthesiologist at MSJH will be provided with the Study&#xD;
      ID specific sealed envelope which will assign the patient to receive either the TPVB+PecsII&#xD;
      or TPVB+Sham block. The regional anesthesiologist will prepare local anesthetic or normal&#xD;
      saline injections for infiltration based on the random assignment. For all patients, the&#xD;
      regional block will be performed as outlined in the Procedure Protocols (See Appendix 1:&#xD;
      Nerve Block). All participants will receive general anesthesia following the nerve block. All&#xD;
      other parameters and protocols will be identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, at MSJH, approximately 4 - 5 cases of mastectomy with IBR are performed per week.&#xD;
      We do not anticipate difficulty with enrolment into this study. This internal pilot will&#xD;
      generate initial recruitment data to enable an early review and validation of our recruitment&#xD;
      projections and study population target prior to transition to formal RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Details of Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be given at the time of consent a post operative package. This will&#xD;
      contain the Quality of Recovery-15 Questionnaire (Form 7), Recovery Booklet (Form 5) and Pain&#xD;
      Burden Index (Form 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Quality of Recovery-15 Questionnaire (see Form 7) is to be completed at 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery in paper format or electronic format (based on their preference). This 24 hour time&#xD;
      point will be marked on the QoR-15 form. If paper format is preferred, the QoR-15 will be&#xD;
      provided with a paid-postage envelope to return once completed at 24 hours after surgery. The&#xD;
      pain NRS at 24 hours will be recorded from the chart. The envelopes will be addressed to the&#xD;
      research coordinator at UBC Hospital office. If the participant prefers electronic format,&#xD;
      the questionnaire will be sent to their provided email address using secure online format&#xD;
      (REDCap developed questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery Booklet (see Form 5) will include: a) schedule for taking prescription pain&#xD;
      medications; b) a postoperative 7-day symptom diary (for recording pain on NRS at 24 hours,&#xD;
      episodes of vomiting, nausea, and use of prescribed medications). Patients will be provided&#xD;
      with a paid-postage envelope to return their Recovery Booklet via mail once completed 7 days&#xD;
      after surgery. Patients will be reminded to complete the Recovery Booklet (Form 5) in 3-4&#xD;
      days and once again at 14 days to return the envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pain Burden Index questionnaire (see Form 8) asks specifically about pain in four&#xD;
      surgically related body areas and to calculate the Pain Burden Index (PBI). The PBI is&#xD;
      calculated by summing the pain severity scale (0-10) at each of four locations (breast,&#xD;
      axilla, chest wall, arm) multiplied by the frequency of the pain at each site. The PBI&#xD;
      questionnaire will be sent to participants via mail as paper format (with paid-postage&#xD;
      envelope to return once completed) or email as electronic format (as per their requested&#xD;
      preference) to be completed 3 and 6 months after their surgery. Details of present adjuvant&#xD;
      treatments (radiation and chemotherapy) will also be included in the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes data including opioid consumption and side effects, length of stay in&#xD;
      hospital (hours), rescue medications, failure of early discharge, complications and adverse&#xD;
      events and time-based outcome measures (time in PACU, time under general anesthesia, time to&#xD;
      perform ultrasound-guided TPVB+PecsII, failure of discharge from PACU and requiring&#xD;
      admission) will be collected through participants' charts and EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics and outcome measures will be summarized by group. An 80% confidence&#xD;
      interval for the difference in average pain score over 24 hours will be calculated.&#xD;
