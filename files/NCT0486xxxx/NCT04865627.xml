  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study will be to determine the accuracy of the MOX, the Axivity and Fitbit,&#xD;
      Empatica and Chill+ activity monitors (with both custom-made and available algorithms) for&#xD;
      the classification of lying, sitting, standing, walking and climbing stairs in hospitalized&#xD;
      older people in Acute Care for the elderly (ACE) and geriatric rehabilitation units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the feasibility of the use of the activity monitors as a measurement tool in&#xD;
      daily practice during hospitalization in the geriatric department will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate physical activity and exercise throughout the day are important to maximize&#xD;
      independence and quality of life. To be able to optimize the physiotherapeutic interventions&#xD;
      and to monitor how much geriatric patients move during hospitalization, it is desirable to&#xD;
      follow up their activity by means of an activity monitor. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      will determine the accuracy of three different types of activity monitors, the &quot;MOX&quot; placed&#xD;
      on the thigh, the &quot;Axivity&quot; placed on the torso and the &quot;Fitbit Sense&quot;, the &quot;Empatica&quot; and&#xD;
      the &quot;Chill+&quot; placed on the wrist, for the classification of lying, sitting, standing, walking&#xD;
      and climbing stairs in hospitalized older people in the geriatric department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical study, 40 patients will participate of which 20 hospitalized in the&#xD;
      geriatric rehabilitation unit at campus Pellenberg and 20 hospitalized in the acute care of&#xD;
      elderly units at campus Gasthuisberg UZ Leuven, Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These activity monitors will remain attached for seven days so that activity can monitored&#xD;
      during the week as well as on weekends. In an experimental test session a total of five&#xD;
      activities (lying down, sitting, standing, walking and possibly climbing stairs) will be&#xD;
      performed and observed, each lasting four minutes. The observations will be recorded by video&#xD;
      where only the lower body will be in focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be daily checks to see if the activity monitors on the thigh, torso, and wrist&#xD;
      stay in place, if the skin tolerates it well, if participants experiencing subjective&#xD;
      discomfort, and if the measurements continue. At the end of the week, a short questionnaire&#xD;
      will be completed on the user-friendliness of the different monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the accuracy and patient satisfaction outcomes to decide the&#xD;
      feasibility of using these activity monitors as a measurement tool in daily practice during&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
