  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), a multisystem disease, on the body system and&#xD;
      functions are being investigated all over the world. Examining the effect of exercise&#xD;
      capacity, which is an important marker of cardiovascular risk in young individuals with&#xD;
      COVID-19, will allow the planning of exercise and physical activity programs according to the&#xD;
      needs of that specific population. The objectives of this project are:(1) To compare the&#xD;
      submaximal and maximal exercise capacity of young adults aged between 18-30 who have had&#xD;
      COVID-19 with healthy individuals in the same age group (2) To determine the roles of muscle&#xD;
      strength, respiratory functions, fatigue, dyspnea, and physical activity level on exercise&#xD;
      capacity evaluated by two different tests in young adults survived from COVID-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The effects of COVID-19, a multisystem disease, on the body system and functions are being&#xD;
      investigated worldwide. For young adults, exercise capacity is vital in the workforce,&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and long-term health perception. Determining exercise capacity,&#xD;
      which is an essential indicator of cardiovascular risk in the long term, and determining the&#xD;
      factors affecting exercise capacity in cases with COVID-19 will allow the planning of&#xD;
      exercise and physical activity programs according to young people's needs. The objectives of&#xD;
      this project are:(1) To compare the submaximal and maximal exercise capacity of young adults&#xD;
      aged between 18-30 who have had COVID-19 with healthy individuals in the same age group (2)&#xD;
      To determine the roles of muscle strength, respiratory functions, fatigue, dyspnea, and&#xD;
      physical activity level on exercise capacity evaluated by two different tests in young adults&#xD;
      survived from COVID-19. There is no study in the literature evaluating the exercise capacity&#xD;
      and the factors affecting the prolonged COVID-19 symptoms for patients with COVID-19. This&#xD;
      project can provide objective evidence on this subject and includes controlled&#xD;
      multi-directional measurement.&#xD;

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue levels will be measured with this scale. This questionnaire contains nine statements that rate the severity of your fatigue symptoms and each question ranged from 1 to 7 based on how accurately it reflects the condition of the participant during the past week.</description>

    <measure>Dyspnea-12 Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The dyspnea perception will be measured with this scale.There are 12 descriptor items on this scale ranging none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). It provides an overall score for breathlessness severity that incorporates seven physical items and five affective items.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The physical activity (PA) levels will be measured with this scale.The IPAQ-short is a seven-item measure of vigorous-intensity physical activity, moderate-intensity physical activity, walking, and sitting. Participants reported physical activity frequency, duration, and total time spent sitting on a week day during the last week. The total daily PA (MET-min day21) will be estimated by summing the multiplication of reported time within each item by a MET value specific to each category of PA and expressed as a daily average MET score, in accordance with the official IPAQ scoring protocol.</description>
