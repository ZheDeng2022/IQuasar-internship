  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent literature has highlighting the importance of the time of SB and the level of&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) as predictors of metabolic cardio risks. Now, sedentary lifestyles are&#xD;
      well recognized as one of the causes of mortality. As with physical activity, a dose-response&#xD;
      relationship appears to exist: mortality would increase with time spent in sedentary&#xD;
      behaviors. However, this relationship would not be linear: the more the daily sitting time&#xD;
      increases, the more the consequences on mortality are important. It is now well demonstrated&#xD;
      that time spent in sedentary adult behaviour finds primarily its origin in the work,&#xD;
      characterized by prolonged and uninterrupted periods of sitting. Many strategies have been&#xD;
      settled to break the prolonged sitting time. The most promising one seem to be the use of&#xD;
      active workstations (standing, walking, cycling, stepping) because they reduce sedentary time&#xD;
      at work and increase physical activity with positive effects on the global health. However&#xD;
      inter variability in energy response have been identified during a sit to stand allocation&#xD;
      with subject &quot;savers&quot; profile showing an increase in energy expenditure while others&#xD;
      categorized as &quot;non-savers&quot; increased significantly their energy expenditure between sitting&#xD;
      and standing position. As others active workstation strategies exist, this study aim to&#xD;
      first, better characterize energy response to posture and activity allocation (15min&#xD;
      sit-15min stand-15min sit-15min low intensity cycling), secondly to identify parameters that&#xD;
      could explain different energy profile.&#xD;

      Subject will have an inclusion visit during a medical consultation where the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria to participate to this study will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a second experimental visit, subjects will have to take a calibrated breakfast. Three&#xD;
      hours after the breakfast, body composition will be assessed and energy expenditure and&#xD;
      substrates oxidation will be measured with an indirect calorimetry device during 15min in a&#xD;
      sitting position fallowed by 15min in standing position , 15min in a sitting position and&#xD;
      15min of low intensity cycling with a cycling desk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then subjects will underwent physical capacity test :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6min step test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handgrip test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lower limb strength test Finally, subjects will be equipped with accelerometer and&#xD;
           inclinometer device they will need to wore during 7 days.&#xD;
