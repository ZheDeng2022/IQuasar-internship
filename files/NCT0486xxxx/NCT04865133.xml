    <textblock>
      This early phase I study gathers information about how the body responds to COVID-19 vaccine&#xD;
      during cancer treatment compared to healthy individuals. The information gained may help&#xD;
      determine how effective currently available COVID-19 vaccines are in cancer patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy and learn more regarding how long an immune response will last&#xD;
      compared to healthy individuals.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the antibody response to COVID-19 vaccine after vaccination. II. To assess&#xD;
      the adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients. III. To determine the incidence&#xD;
      and severity of COVID-19 infection after the vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline (prior to first vaccination), prior to&#xD;
      second vaccination, 1, 6, and 12 months after the last vaccination. Patients who receive the&#xD;
      types of COVID-19 vaccines that do not require the second injection omit the blood sample&#xD;
      collection prior to the second vaccination. For patients who have already received COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines, medical records are reviewed retrospectively.&#xD;

    <description>Antibody response will be evaluated using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody test. Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compared between baseline and other 3 time points (before the second vaccination, 3 months, and 12 months after the second vaccination).</description>

    <measure>Adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be described using descriptive statistics. Adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE). Complete blood count (CBC) with 5 parts differential and complete metabolic panel per standard of care will be collected if available within 3 months prior to the 1st vaccination until 3 months after the 2nd vaccine.</description>
