  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cd276 (B7-H3) is an ideal target for car-t treatment because of its high expression on the&#xD;
      surface of neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, gastric cancer and lung cancer cells, but not in&#xD;
      normal peripheral cells or tissues. In conclusion, car-t cell therapy has achieved exciting&#xD;
      results in blood tumors, but it has been stopped in solid tumor. The main reason for the poor&#xD;
      effect is the existence of tumor microenvironment of solid tumor, which inhibits the&#xD;
      chemotaxis and infiltration of car-t cells to tumor site. Therefore, in this clinical&#xD;
      experiment, we will explore the best model of car-t therapy for solid tumor by intravenous&#xD;
      and local tumor injection, which will bring new hope to patients with osteosarcoma,&#xD;
      neuroblastoma and gastric cancer&#xD;
