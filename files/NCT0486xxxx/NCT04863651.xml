    <textblock>
      The Adult Attachment Style (AAS) is a questionnaire designed to measure how an adult&#xD;
      generally feels in their close personal relationships. The questionnaire has two main axes of&#xD;
      measurements - avoidance and anxiety, that gives rise to four different categories of&#xD;
      attachment styles. Women's attachment styles have been shown to be correlated to pain during&#xD;
      labour, but not after. No study has analyzed whether attachment styles are correlated to the&#xD;
      pain after cesarean section. This study will assess correlation between the AAS score, and&#xD;
      pain after elective cesarean section. Additionally, this study aims to clarify the&#xD;
      correlation between attachment scale and overall quality of recovery after cesarean section&#xD;
      as defined by a recently validated tool, the ObsQoR10.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall recovery after cesarean section is difficult to measure and must consider several&#xD;
      factors that may influence recovery. The ObsQoR10 is a recently validated tool that provides&#xD;
      an overall picture of post cesarean recovery using pain, functional milestones, and emotional&#xD;
      needs1. One of the factors that may influence recovery post operatively is a person's Adult&#xD;
      Attachment Style (AAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAS refers to how a person &quot;generally feels in close relationships in their lives&quot; and is&#xD;
      prevalent in literature in the context of chronic pain. AAS has been shown to be correlated&#xD;
      to patients' psychological stress2, self reported pain intensity and even the prevalence of&#xD;
      chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia3. In a cohort of patients with chronic pain,&#xD;
      securely attached individuals were less likely to report disability due to pain, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and perceived negative spouse responses in comparison to securely attached&#xD;
      individuals4. Another cohort showed that patients were characterized as fearful avoidant were&#xD;
      more likely to catastrophize their pain and exhibit activity avoiding behaviours5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature on AAS in the context of pain experienced by parturients is not as well&#xD;
      characterized. Costas-Martins et al showed that insecurely attached women experience more&#xD;
      pain during labour6. Costas-Martins et al include in their cohort a number of cesarean&#xD;
      patients but do not consider them separately. To date there has not been a study&#xD;
      investigating whether the AAS of parturients undergoing cesarean section is correlated to&#xD;
      their perceived pain.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      While pain is an important clinical outcome, overall recovery as measured by the ObsQoR10 may&#xD;
      present a more complete clinical picture of the predictive power of a person's AAS. Our study&#xD;
      aims to characterize whether parturients' AAS is correlated with their overall recovery post&#xD;
      cesarean section as well as pain.&#xD;
