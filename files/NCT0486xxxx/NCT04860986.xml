  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized repeatability and reproducibility (R&amp;R) study of the&#xD;
      EarliPoint DeviceTM in pediatric subjects 16-30 months of age. The study will enroll subjects&#xD;
      who are both clinically-positive and clinically-negative for ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at a single center in the US. The Study consists of a screening&#xD;
      period in order to review the subject's medical history to determine subject eligibility,&#xD;
      followed by a device administration period during which subjects will undergo testing with&#xD;
      the EarliPoint Devices and Expert Clinician Diagnosis (ECD) procedures to determine if they&#xD;
      are clinically-positive or clinically-negative for ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo testing with the same two (2) devices, with one (1) testing session per&#xD;
      device per subject, with each testing session yielding three (3) measurements per endpoint&#xD;
      per subject, for a total of six (6) measurements per endpoint for each subject enrolled. The&#xD;
      order in which the subjects receive testing with each device will be randomized so that the&#xD;
      same device is not always used first or last for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to quantify the repeatability variability and&#xD;
      reproducibility variability of all of the EarliPoint device's continuous valued outputs: the&#xD;
      underlying continuous score used to classify patients into the binary diagnostic&#xD;
      classification of either clinically-positive or clinically-negative for autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (ASD) as well as each of the three EarliPoint Device severity scores (the social&#xD;
      disability index, verbal ability index, and nonverbal ability index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to quantify the repeatability and reproducibility&#xD;
      variability in producing each of the three EarliPoint Device severity scores: the social&#xD;
      disability index, verbal ability index, and nonverbal ability index.&#xD;

        Toddlers and young children will be enrolled in this study, as the aim of this research is&#xD;
        to examine repeatability of eye-tracking measures in children aged 16-30 months.&#xD;
        Precautions will be taken when working with young children. Our clinicians and research&#xD;
        staff are well trained and experienced in working with children and families with some&#xD;
        level of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subject's parent or legal guardian will be consented to the study. No protocol-specific&#xD;
        procedures, including screening, will be performed until the parent has signed and dated&#xD;
        the consent form. Subjects will also satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria in order&#xD;
        to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
