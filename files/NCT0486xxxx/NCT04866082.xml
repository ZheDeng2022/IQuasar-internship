      Brief Summary: Administration of systemic corticosteroids for patients with severe forms of&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome in coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are recommended by&#xD;
      several guidelines. In the very beginning of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic the early recommendation by&#xD;
      professional organization was against routine use of corticosteroids for patients with&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ARDS, despite previous data and clinical practice for&#xD;
      patients with refractory or severe form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). But&#xD;
      recently after publication of RECOVERY trial (Randomized Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy, July&#xD;
      2020) and ensued metaanalysis of World Health Organization (WHO) working group, routine&#xD;
      administration of systemic corticosteroids was revisited. However, there is an ongoing debate&#xD;
      regarding evidence supporting the dose, type of administration (bolus vs. continuous&#xD;
      infusion), timing and type of corticosteroids. Ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs)&#xD;
      are challenging the recommendation of 6 mg of dexamethasone for all patients with severe form&#xD;
      of COVID-19. Due to the dynamics of COVID-19 surges and rapid issuing of official&#xD;
      recommendations, daily clinical practice of systemic corticosteroids administration can vary.&#xD;
      An electronic evaluation form containing 20 questions will be sent to European Society of&#xD;
      Intensive Care (ESICM) and European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC)&#xD;
      members. Participants will be asked to describe their routine clinical practice regarding&#xD;
      administration of systemic corticosteroids among patients with COVID-19 ARDS.&#xD;
