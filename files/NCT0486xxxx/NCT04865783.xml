      This trial aims to evaluate if cryospray can reduce pain during intravenous cannulation in&#xD;
      elective surgery compared to a placebo spray.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous cannulation is a common practice in the health care system. Before any procedure,&#xD;
      intravenous access is always placed before induction of any anaesthesia. For many patients&#xD;
      placement of a venous catheter is associated with pain and discomfort. Any quick and easy&#xD;
      reduction in pain during the procedure is important for patients. Cryospray has been&#xD;
      described as an easy-to-use supplement of analgesia to alleviate pain during intravenous&#xD;
      access. Cryospray has been shown to reduce pain in venous cannulation in the emergency&#xD;
      setting but not in the elective setting. A search in the literature reveals 2 recent&#xD;
      metanalyses reporting 8 included trials and 11 included trials, respectively. Both&#xD;
      metanalyses call for further research in relation to patients' satisfaction. By randomizing&#xD;
      patients to either cryospray or placebo before venous cannulation, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      cryospray reduces pain during venous cannulation compared to placebo.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Before elective surgery, all patients will have an intravenous line placed before induction of anaesthesia. Patients will be blinded to whether cryospray or placebo is used. Two anaesthesia trained persons (nurse/doctors) will perform the procedure. One person will randomize and apply the randomized spray and the other person will be blinded to the randomized treatment. The anesthesiologist performing the puncture but blinded for randomization will fill out a questionnaire</masking_description>
