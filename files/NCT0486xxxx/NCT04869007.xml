  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Caesarean sections continues to increase around the world. In France, the&#xD;
      proportion of Caesarean sections has doubled from 11% in 1981 to 20,2% in 2016, bringing with&#xD;
      it an increase in the risk of obstetrical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine defects, or Isthomcele, first defined by Morris in 1995 as a scarring abnormality&#xD;
      with a dehiscence of the hysterotomy following a caesarean section. This purely iatrogenic&#xD;
      pathology can cause inter-menstrual bleeding or pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several definitions of isthmosceles exist in scientific literature with variations according&#xD;
      to the nature of the reference examination chosen and the measurements made. However, for the&#xD;
      majority of authors, isthmoceles are characterized by a residual myometrial thickness of less&#xD;
      than 3 millimetres in the sagittal plane. The prevalence of isthmoceles amoung patients with&#xD;
      a unicicatricial uterus is about 61%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the main diagnostic technique for isthmoceles are 2D or 3D ultrasound and&#xD;
      hysterosonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small, non-controlled studies have found that surgical treatment of the isthmocele is&#xD;
      effective in reducing metrorrhagia. In these studies, the authors noted that patients with&#xD;
      metrorrhagia were also more frequently affected by secondary infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small number of non-comparative studies with a low level of evidence have looked into the&#xD;
      efficacy of surgical treatment of isthmoceles on related symptoms: metrorraghia, pelvic pain&#xD;
      and/or secondary infertility. Their results show an idiopathic secondary infertility rate in&#xD;
      the presence of isthmoceles prior to surgical treatment of approximately 66%. Significantly&#xD;
      higher pregnancy rates after treatment suggest that the surgical management of isthmoceles is&#xD;
      worthwhile. However, these data suffer from not negligible selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial findings concerning fertility after surgical repair seem promising and some teams&#xD;
      propose systematic surgical management of the isthmocele before a technique of assisted&#xD;
      reproduction (ART) although without any evidence in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isthmocele surgery can result in uterine perforations, adhesions and intrauterine synechia&#xD;
      known to be detrimental to future fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of surgical management of surgey must therefore be demonstrated prior to any&#xD;
      attempts at treatment. This will require large prospective studies based on a consensual&#xD;
      definition of isthmocele. The diagnosis using Hysterosonography is currently considered as&#xD;
      the &quot;gold standard&quot; examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of our study is that a significant isthmocele, defined by a residual&#xD;
      myometrial thickness of less than 3mm, measured in the sagittal plane by hysterosonography,&#xD;
      could alter the results of ART.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has a multicentric, parallel group, comparative, non-interventional, exploratory&#xD;
      and prospective design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of isthmocele: defined as a dehiscence of the hysterotomy following a caesarean&#xD;
      section. The residual myometrial thickness is less than 3mm, measured in the sagittal plane&#xD;
      by hysterosonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence or absence of an isthmocele according to this definition will allow for the&#xD;
      distribution of patients into one of two study groups : &quot;isthmocele +&quot; or &quot;isthmocele -&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of clinical pregnancy rate: defined as the presence of an intrauterine gestational&#xD;
      sac and an embryo with cardiac activity visualized during an ultrasound examination at 7&#xD;
      weeks after embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : During the initial ART consultation, the study is presented (oral information and&#xD;
      distribution of a brochure) to patients consulting for infertility and with a history of&#xD;
      cesarean section. It is during this consultation that the ART treatment assessment (blood&#xD;
      tests and imaging: ultrasound and hysterosonography) is prescribed. If they agree to take&#xD;
      part in the study, the non-opposition of eligible patients is collected during this&#xD;
      consultation (pre-inclusion). Furthermore, among patients who agreed to participate in the&#xD;
      study, socio-demographic data and the couple's medical history are collected during this&#xD;
      initial consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who agreed to participate in the study, a specific measurement is made during&#xD;
      the hysterosonography examination in order to determine the presence or absence of an&#xD;
      isthmocele. Inclusion in the study is validated after a successful hysterosonography&#xD;
      examination that confirms the presence or absence of an isthmocele. The patients are then&#xD;
      attributed either to the: &quot;isthmocele +&quot; group or &quot;isthmocele -&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second ART consultation, the results of the treatment assessment are collected, in&#xD;
      particular the presence or absence of an isthmocele on the hysterosonography examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the data relative to ovarian stimulation, the methods of triggering and embryo&#xD;
      transfer are collected prospectively by the investigator or co-investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the standard ART treatment, blood HCG tests are carried out 14 days after embryo&#xD;
      transfer in order to detect a possible pregnancy. If the blood HCG levels are positive, the&#xD;
      test is repeated 48 hours later and again a week later to survey the evolution of the blood&#xD;
      HCG levels. At 6 to 7 weeks after oocyte puncture, an ultrasound scan is performed in the ART&#xD;
      department if the blood HCGs level is greater than 10 IU/L with a satisfactory evolution&#xD;
      after 48 hours. This data is collected for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of pregnancy and delivery in the same hospital as the ART treatment, obstetrical&#xD;
      data is collected by the investigators or co-investigators from the obstetrical file. In the&#xD;
      case of delivery at another facility, patients were contacted by telephone one year after a&#xD;
      positive pregnancy test (HCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: No individual benefit is expected from this study since the management of the&#xD;
      patients included corresponds to standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the collective benefits, if the conclusions of this study allow for the&#xD;
      confirmation of our hypothesis (reduction in the pregnancy rate in the presence of a&#xD;
      significant isthmocele), this could lead to a change in clinical practices in patients&#xD;
      treated with ART. Indeed, surgical management of the isthmocele could be discussed prior to&#xD;
      ART by informing the patient of the benefit-risk balance of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our hypothesis of reduced fertility in the presence of isthmoceles is confirmed, further&#xD;
      studies should ideally be carried out in order to demonstrate that the surgical management of&#xD;
      isthmoceles improves the results of ART before systematically offering surgery to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

      authorities Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Méditerranée IV on the 10th of November&#xD;
