  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well anlotinib hydrochloride works in treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. Anlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow&#xD;
      to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the anti-tumor activity of anlotinib hydrochloride (Objective Response rate,ORR)&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety profile of anlotinib. II. To assess progression-free survival time. III.&#xD;
      To assess disease control rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anlotinib hydrochloride 12mg orally once daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo urine and blood sample collection, imaging examinations at baseline and&#xD;
      periodically during study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.&#xD;
