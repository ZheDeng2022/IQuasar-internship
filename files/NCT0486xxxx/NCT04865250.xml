      Exploratory study evaluating the potential of immune signature profiling for predicting&#xD;
      response in patients with resectable Stage II, IIIA and select IIIB (T3N2 only) non-squamous&#xD;
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to neoadjuvant ATEZOLIZUMAB plus Carboplatin/nab&#xD;
      Paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is given as intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 1200 mg, day 1 of each&#xD;
      21-day cycle (every 3 weeks) for 3 cycles during the neoadjuvant treatment phase, Carboplatin&#xD;
      at an initial dose of AUC 5 mg/mL/min, intravenously day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles&#xD;
      during the neoadjuvant treatment Phase, and Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) at 100 mg/m2,&#xD;
      intravenously day 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles during the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment phase. Surgery after the 3rd cycle Atezolizumab / Carboplatin / Nab-Paclitaxel is&#xD;
      standard procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), surgical treatment with curative&#xD;
      intent is the treatment of choice. Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard of care for fully&#xD;
      resected stage II, IIIA, or select IIIB [T3N2] NSCLC to improve survival outcome as compared&#xD;
      to surgery alone. Neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy has become a widely accepted&#xD;
      alternative therapy. Chemotherapy regimens used in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings&#xD;
      consist of platinum-based doublets. With the successful development of cancer immunotherapy&#xD;
      in advanced NSCLC, several (neo)adjuvant studies of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are currently&#xD;
      being conducted in resectable early-stage NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IREP study explores neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy with three cycles of atezolizumab,&#xD;
      carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel in patients with histologically confirmed and resectable&#xD;
      non-squamous NSCLC Stage II, IIIA or select IIIB (T3N2 only). The primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      study is the Major Pathologic Response (MPR) rate (≤10% residual viable tumor cells) at&#xD;
      surgery. Secondary endpoints include EFS and OS, safety endpoints as well as analyses of&#xD;
      molecular and immunological biomarkers that are predictive of response to the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      immunochemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is given as intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 1200 mg day 1, carboplatin&#xD;
      at an initial dose of AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously day 1 and nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2&#xD;
      intravenously day 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle (every 3 weeks) for 3 cycles during the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment phase. Subsequent surgery is standard procedure with standard lobectomy&#xD;
      / bi-lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection.&#xD;
