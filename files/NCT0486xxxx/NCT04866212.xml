      There are two different groups in this study. The first group includes children with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes and the second group includes healthy children. Children aged 8-12 years were&#xD;
      included in the evaluation. Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration ,&#xD;
      academic achievement (Turkish, mathematics, social sciences exam scores) Participation and&#xD;
      Environment Measure-Children an Youth, Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test were used for&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Visual-motor integration (VMI) is &quot;the degree to which visual perception and finger-hand movements are well coordinated&quot; and will asses with Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration in this study. This test is a standardized, norm-referenced assessment involving copying geometric forms that is used to determine the level of integration between visual and motor systems in people of all ages. The Short Format and Full Format tests take about 10-15 minutes each to administer. Results are reported as standard scores, percentiles, and age equivalents.</description>

    <description>The Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) assesses both dominant and non-dominant hand skills and provides an objective assessment of hand function included in 7 subtests of daily living activities. The time (in seconds) to perform the 7 subtests is measured by the stopwatch. JTHFT is valid, reliable and normative for children.</description>

    <description>Participation and Environment Measurement- Children and Youth (PEM-CY) is a parent reported measure developed in North America. Evaluates the environmental factors affecting the participation of disabled and non-disabled children and young people. It examines three environments, home, school and environment, and discusses each environment in two parts as &quot;participation and environment&quot;.</description>
