      INTRODUCTION: Particle contamination is suggested to have substantial negative effects on&#xD;
      health, with candles emitting huge amount of particles, thus being one of the largest&#xD;
      contributors to indoor air pollution. Chronic low levels of exposure to indoor particles over&#xD;
      time is an important risk factor for the health of the population as a whole and it becomes&#xD;
      particularly important for vulnerable groups like people suffering from respiratory diseases&#xD;
      such as asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: In a randomized controlled cross-over trial the difference in health effects between two&#xD;
      candles I) a standard candle and II) a low emission candle modified from the standard candle&#xD;
      is studied.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION; Particle contamination is suggested to have substantial negative effects on&#xD;
      health, with candles emitting the huge amount of particles, thus being one of the largest&#xD;
      contributors to indoor air pollution. Chronic low levels of exposure to indoor particles over&#xD;
      time is an important risk factor for the health of the population as a whole and it becomes&#xD;
      particularly important for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly or people already&#xD;
      suffering from allergies and respiratory diseases such as asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: To study the difference in health effects between two candles I) a standard candle and&#xD;
      II) a low emission candle modified from the standard candle. The following hypothesis will be&#xD;
      examined: Short-term exposure to particles generated by the standard candle is associated&#xD;
      with more objectively measurable effects in metabolomics inflammation compared to exposure to&#xD;
      modified low-emission candle particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Separated by two weeks 20 young asthmatics will be exposed in a randomized&#xD;
      cross-over double-blind study under controlled conditions in a climate chamber to three&#xD;
      different exposures; A) a standard (Scandinavian) stearin candle, B) a modified low emitting&#xD;
      version of the same candle, and C) clean air from the adjacent chamber. The experiment will&#xD;
      be carried out in groups of 3-6 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS: TSI P-TRAK Ultrafine Particle Counter and SMPS will be used for particle&#xD;
      counts. Health effects, including spirometry and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) will&#xD;
      be evaluated in relation to local and systemic effects prior to, right after and 24 h. after&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: Mixed methods approach taking both time and exposure into account.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At baseline (0 hour), after exposure (5 hours), and the day after exposure (24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Acoustic rhinometry is used to assess the nasal cross sectional area and volume. The left and right nasal cavity were studied alternatively until three reproducible measurements were obtained. The minimum cross sectional cavity area is calculated from the means of the measurements. By integration of the area-distance curve, the sum of the volume 2 to 4 (vol2-4) from the nostril is determined on both sides.</description>

Afterwards the saturated swab was removed to the suspended insert and closed firmly with a lid. Then the sample was transferred to a freezer and stored for -80 C until further analysis. The sample will be analyzed for biomarkers (amylase, cortisol, substance P, lysozyme and secretory IgA. (same unit measure))</description>

    <description>n the exposure chamber participants are asked to fill out a symptom questionnaire every 30 minute regarding their well-being and experienced symptoms in eyes, nose and throat. The participants are asked to score their evaluation / rate the strength of symptoms on a Linear Numeric Scale from 0-10, with 10 being worst. Health effects are evaluated in relation to rated changes in symptoms</description>
