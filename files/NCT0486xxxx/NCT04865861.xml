  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overlap between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis is a&#xD;
      neglected area of research, and it is not covered by guidelines for clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD and bronchiectasis share common symptoms of cough with sputum production and&#xD;
      susceptibility to recurrent exacerbations driven by new or persistent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological criteria for the diagnosis of COPD and structural criteria for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis create the possibility for individual patients to fulfil both, resulting&#xD;
      conceptually in either co-diagnosis or an overlap syndrome between the two conditions. The&#xD;
      prevalence of this overlap will vary depending on the respective prevalence of COPD and&#xD;
      bronchiectasis in the population under consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study of 201 COPD patients with airway wall abnormalities typical of bronchiectasis&#xD;
      confirmed an association with exacerbations and was predictive of mortality over 48 months. A&#xD;
      further, single-centre study demonstrated a near three-fold increased mortality rate, with&#xD;
      patients with bronchiectasis and associated COPD having a 5-year mortality of 55%, compared&#xD;
      with 20% in those with bronchiectasis without COPD. Airflow obstruction is perhaps best&#xD;
      considered one marker of disease severity in bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease-associated exacerbations have a major effect on patient healthcare costs as well as&#xD;
      quality of life due to increased lung damage and mortality risk. Microorganisms such as&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and, to a lesser extent, other Gram-negative and Gram-positive&#xD;
      microorganisms identified in culture, have been linked to disease progression, poor clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in bronchiectasis and driving airway neutrophil-mediated inflammation. The&#xD;
      microbiome has the potential to provide valuable information regarding disease&#xD;
      phenotype/endotype, treatment responses and targets for future therapy.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The exacerbation of bronchiectasis is defined as a deterioration in three or more of the following key symptoms for at least 48 h: cough; sputum volume and/or consistency; sputum purulence; breathlessness and/or exercise tolerance; fatigue and/or malaise; haemoptysis AND a clinician determines that a change in bronchiectasis treatment is required.</description>

    <measure>α-diversity</measure>

    <description>α-diversity is a measure of how diverse a sample is based on how many species here are (richness) and how abundant each species is (evenness) within that sample.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>β-diversity</measure>

    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The positive result of bacteria is defined as at least one positive potentially-pathogenic bacteria being cultured from sputum (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus aureus).&#xD;
The positive result of viral is defined as at least one positive viral PCR (HRV, RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, human bocavirus, or coronavirus) from sputum.</description>
