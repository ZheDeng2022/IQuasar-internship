  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults, which may be assessed through various&#xD;
      assessment tools. One frequently used tool is the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) which&#xD;
      potentially can be adopted for daily use in the Emergency Department and has been appraised&#xD;
      for reliability to some extent, but have so far not been evaluated in the Swedish emergency&#xD;
      care context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of the Clinical Frailty&#xD;
      Scale (CFS) in a clinical Swedish Emergency Department (ED) setting. Members of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary emergency care teams will conduct the assessments individually.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CFS is introduced and tested as part of a quality-improvement process regarding elderly&#xD;
      people within the Emergency departments (EDs) of Region Östergötland (Östergötland County) in&#xD;
      Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFS is a 9-point scale developed within the Canadian Study of Health and Aging. It comprises&#xD;
      of a pictograms and a clinical description to help assign scores ranging from very fit to&#xD;
      terminally ill. CFS enables clinicians to rapidly stratify the degree of frailty in the&#xD;
      elderly with the help of questions and clinical assessment. However, since the assessment is&#xD;
      judgement based, it is important that the inter-rater reliability is satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a larger project where all eligible patients who visit the ED (24/7)&#xD;
      for a period of four weeks will be enrolled and then subsequently assessed with CFS by one of&#xD;
      their responsible health-care professionals (i.e. physician, registered nurse or nurse&#xD;
      assistant). For this study, each professional on the team will individually assess each&#xD;
      patient. First, a clinical judgement is performed (frail/not frail) without any instrument,&#xD;
      and then the patient is assessed by using the CFS. This will take place during work shifts&#xD;
      when someone from the research team is present and can arrange the assessments, as well as&#xD;
      ensure that they are conducted independently. These work shifts will be selected using the&#xD;
      online application Research Randomizer, to randomly include all hours of the day as well as&#xD;
      eligible health-care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research-team member will collect the assigned CFS-scores and information on the age,&#xD;
      gender, profession, position (emergency physician or intern/resident from other specialities)&#xD;
      and the number of years in the profession of each assessor. Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from all health-care professionals who participate. No data that can identify any patient&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is determined to be 100 patients, which would be more than sufficient with a&#xD;
      power of 90% and α 0,05.&#xD;

    <description>An Emergency department in Sweden typically has physicians from other specialities who work for a period of time. They may not have the same education and training in CFS assessments, we want to explore if the results differ in terms of inter-rater reliability between care teams with emergency physicians and care teams with other physicians.</description>
