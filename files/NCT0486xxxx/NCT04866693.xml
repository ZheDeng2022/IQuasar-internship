  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety incidents are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. So far,&#xD;
      existing safety improvement work has largely focused on physical healthcare. Only a small&#xD;
      body of research has studied safety as it applies to mental healthcare, with these studies&#xD;
      concentrating primarily on psychiatric inpatient units. However, mental healthcare is&#xD;
      increasingly delivered in community settings, through primary care and secondary care mental&#xD;
      health provision, rather than in hospitals. Less is known about the safety problems service&#xD;
      users experience in community-based mental healthcare. It is important that safety problems&#xD;
      in community-based mental health services are better understood, so that care can be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will aim to understand the nature of the safety problems experienced by adult&#xD;
      users of community-based mental healthcare, from the perspective of service users, carers,&#xD;
      and healthcare providers. The study will also aim to identify priority areas and effective&#xD;
      practices to improve safety in these settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual in-depth interviews or focus groups will be held with service users, carers, and&#xD;
      frontline healthcare providers employed within appropriate community-based mental healthcare&#xD;
      settings. Interviews or focus groups will last for approximately one hour and will be carried&#xD;
      out face-to-face or via secure videoconferencing technology (e.g. Microsoft Teams or Zoom),&#xD;
      depending on up-to-date guidance relating to the Covid-19 pandemic. With participant consent,&#xD;
      interviews and focus groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts will be&#xD;
      analysed using thematic analysis, with themes developed, defined, and revised throughout the&#xD;
      analysis process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study findings will help to fill key evidence gaps concerning safety in community-based&#xD;
      mental healthcare. More broadly, the results may lead to the development of evidence-informed&#xD;
      interventions to address the safety issues which are raised in participant discussions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety problems are widespread. Research suggests that around 10% of inpatients&#xD;
      experience an adverse event during their hospital admission, with almost half of these&#xD;
      incidents judged to be preventable. There have been considerable advancements in initiatives&#xD;
      to improve patient safety in medical settings in the past 20 years. However, safety in mental&#xD;
      healthcare remains an under-researched and poorly understood issue, with only a limited&#xD;
      amount of research having explored safety as it uniquely applies to this population.&#xD;
      Self-harm, suicide, and coercive interventions (such as physical restraint) are some of the&#xD;
      specific risks which may affect mental health service users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small body of research focusing on safety in mental healthcare has primarily concentrated&#xD;
      on hospital-based inpatient care. This is problematic for improving mental healthcare safety&#xD;
      and quality, as only a minority of mental healthcare episodes take place within psychiatric&#xD;
      inpatient services. As such, research into the types of safety problem experienced by users&#xD;
      of community-based mental healthcare is of great importance to improving care and reducing&#xD;
      harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a willingness to share their perspectives, mental health service users and carers&#xD;
      have reported barriers to raising their safety concerns with professionals. These include&#xD;
      feeling as if their concerns were not listened to, as well as challenges associated with the&#xD;
      process of raising a complaint whilst unwell. Likewise, frontline care providers and service&#xD;
      managers within mental health services can also provide different yet complementary&#xD;
      professional insights into safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-based mental healthcare provision is diverse, often involving complex relationships&#xD;
      between and joint responsibly of multiple agencies. Because of this, the safety problems&#xD;
      associated with different care pathways are likely to be varied in nature. In order to fully&#xD;
      understand safety and broader quality of care problems, it is important to draw upon the&#xD;
      perspectives of mental health service users, carers, and healthcare providers from a range of&#xD;
      community settings. Using qualitative research methods, this research will begin to address&#xD;
      this evidence gap, focusing on services for working-aged adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the safety problems which&#xD;
      occur in the context of community-based mental healthcare. Specifically, drawing upon the&#xD;
      perspectives of multiple stakeholder groups, including service users, carers and frontline&#xD;
      care providers, the objectives are to investigate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore perspectives on the meaning of 'safety' in mental healthcare;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand the nature of the safety problems faced by people accessing&#xD;
           community-based mental health services;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To learn about experiences of good practice in the delivery of safe mental healthcare;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify priority areas and strategies for intervention to improve care safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will comprise in-depth qualitative interviews or focus groups, with three&#xD;
      participant groups: (a) working-age adult service users, (b) carers, (c) staff within&#xD;
      community-based mental health services (frontline providers and service managers). The&#xD;
      research team consulted with service users and carers about the study design, and received&#xD;
      positive feedback about the proposal to conduct either individual qualitative interviews or&#xD;
      focus groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews and focus groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by a professional&#xD;
      transcription company from King's College London's list of approved suppliers. Prior to&#xD;
      analysis, any interview or focus groups excerpts containing information which could&#xD;
      potentially identify the participant, will be redacted. Interview and focus group data will&#xD;
      be managed in NVivo and analysed using a reflexive approach to thematic analysis, according&#xD;
      to the methodologies outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006). Themes will be developed and&#xD;
      revised through an iterative process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paper consent forms will be stored in a locked filing cabinet within the university premises,&#xD;
      to which only the research team will have access. Digital files, such as interview&#xD;
      transcripts and electronically completed consent forms, will be stored on the researcher's&#xD;
      secure university account server, which is password protected. Audio recordings will also be&#xD;
      stored here up until the point of transcription, after which they will be securely deleted.&#xD;
      Data will be stored anonymously and archived in line with King's College London's policy on&#xD;
      data storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on service users, carers, and staff members employed within general&#xD;
      adult community-based mental health services. Community-based mental health services herein&#xD;
      refers to non-institutional mental health services which deliver multidisciplinary care&#xD;
      accessed by service users living independently, or in supported accommodation (excluding&#xD;
      settings with 24-hour on-site care from qualified nurses, which resemble institutional care&#xD;
      models). As such, participants associated with a range of settings may be recruited,&#xD;
      including community mental health services within secondary care (e.g. Assertive Outreach&#xD;
      Services) and mental health support available through primary care (e.g. from a general&#xD;
      practitioner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to capture a range of perspectives, participants will be purposively sampled&#xD;
      according to several key characteristics. The recruitment strategy will aim to recruit&#xD;
      service users, carers, and healthcare professionals who have experience of different types of&#xD;
      community-based mental health services. To reflect the range of care contexts and&#xD;
      professional roles, the investigators will seek to sample healthcare professionals from&#xD;
      different disciplinary backgrounds. This will likely include clinical service managers,&#xD;
      psychiatrists, occupational therapists, nurses, social workers, and psychologists. Efforts&#xD;
      will be made to recruit people within each group who represent a range of sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics, including participants of different sexes and from different ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited via community-based mental health services and via&#xD;
      an open recruitment call (e.g. via online advertisements, or existing service user and carer&#xD;
      network newsletter mailings). Snowball sampling techniques may also be used to supplement the&#xD;
      sample. As such, recruited participants may be asked to invite other people they know to&#xD;
      contact the research team directly, if they are interested in taking part and meet the study&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. These sampling approaches have been selected due to their&#xD;
      appropriateness for qualitative research which seeks to capture the range and diversity of&#xD;
      participant perspectives, rather than aiming to achieve a representative study sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who express interest in taking part will receive a participant information sheet at&#xD;
      least 24 hours before taking part in a scheduled interview or focus group. Potential&#xD;
      participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and receive further information about&#xD;
      the study before deciding whether to take part and providing their informed consent.&#xD;
      Interviews or focus groups will last for approximately one hour and be conducted in a private&#xD;
      space. Interviews and focus groups will be primarily conducted remotely (due to COVID-19&#xD;
      safety considerations) via secure digital communications software (e.g. Microsoft Teams or&#xD;
      Zoom). Where face-to-face interviews are held, these will be conducted in accordance with&#xD;
      up-to-date safety guidance.&#xD;
