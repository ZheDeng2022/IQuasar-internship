  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a multi-site, three-arm randomized controlled trial of a&#xD;
      mindfulness-based intervention for Chinese family caregivers in Hong Kong. Effects of the&#xD;
      intervention will be compared with those of an evidence-based psychoeducation program, and&#xD;
      treatment-as-usual. 240 caregivers of frail elderly with moderate to severe levels of&#xD;
      frailty, will be recruited and randomly assigned to mindfulness-based intervention,&#xD;
      psychoeducation, and treatment-as-usual experimental conditions. Overall program&#xD;
      effectiveness will be analyzed on measures of caregiver burden, depression, anxiety, positive&#xD;
      caregiving experience, spirituality, family conflict, and the biomarker of heart rate&#xD;
      variability. Measures on coping styles, experiential avoidance, and self-efficacy will be&#xD;
      explored to see if they mediate the changes to participant improvements in outcomes. 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up will be included to investigate the maintenance effects.&#xD;
