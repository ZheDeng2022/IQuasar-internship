      Essentials® on cognition in a healthy adult population with self-reported memory complaints.&#xD;
      As there is a dearth of available literature on BDNF in this study population, the current&#xD;

      The objective of this open-label, exploratory study is to investigate the efficacy of BDNF&#xD;
      Essentials® on cognition in a healthy adult population with self-reported memory complaints.&#xD;
      As there is a dearth of available literature on BDNF in this study population, the current&#xD;
      study is designed to understand the role of BDNF to inform potential future studies. The&#xD;
      study population represents a target group of individuals who would benefit from safe and&#xD;
      efficacious nutraceuticals for the support of cognitive function. This transitional stage&#xD;
      from normal cognition to cognitive impairment is viewed as an opportune window for&#xD;
      intervention. This population of participants is being recruited to expand on previously&#xD;
      published work on these individual ingredients while limiting confounding variables that&#xD;
      could influence outcomes.&#xD;
