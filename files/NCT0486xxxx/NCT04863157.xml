  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn if an educational program delivered to parents/guardians&#xD;
      can help improve the sleep of children experiencing sleep problems after completing cancer&#xD;
      treatment. The name of the intervention is Survivor-SHIP (Sleep Health Information Program).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate Survivor-SHIP in a single-arm trial of 20 off-treatment childhood&#xD;
      cancer survivors (ages 5-12). The intervention is an adapted version of the family-centered&#xD;
      Sleep Health Program designed at Seattle Children's Hospital. The program offers parents&#xD;
      information about how to utilize evidence-based strategies for their child's sleep, and has&#xD;
      demonstrated success in a community-based sample of children with behavioral sleep problems.&#xD;
      Sessions will focus on providing parents with education about healthy sleep and setting&#xD;
      targets for modifiable behaviors that can improve their child's sleep health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 3 education sessions taking place over videoconference. Families will&#xD;
      be asked to track their child's sleep using sleep diaries during the course of the program.&#xD;
      Prior to, and following the program, families will be asked to complete study questionnaires.&#xD;

    <measure>Sleep knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Sleep Knowledge questionnaire is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the parents' knowledge about children's sleep. The scale is scored from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating more knowledge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep habits</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) is a 33-item questionnaire that will assess the child's overall sleep habits. A Total Sleep Disturbances score is calculated as the sum of all scored questions, and can range from 33 to 99, with higher scores indicating more sleep disturbance.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) pediatric sleep scales are an 8-item measure that assesses the child's sleep quality. A total score will range from 8 to 40, with higher scale scores indicating poorer sleep health</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The child's quality of life will be evaluated by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), a 23-item scale measuring core physical, mental, and social health dimensions. Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Screen time</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of the child's electronic screen use will be assessed by a set of 9 questions that were developed specifically for this study by the Principal Investigator. They assess the duration of electronics usage across different devices and timing of usage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess whether the family implemented any non-intervention advised changes to their child's sleep routine, such as increasing medication for their sleep during the intervention period. This set of 5 questions will be assessed only at the post-intervention timepoint.</description>
