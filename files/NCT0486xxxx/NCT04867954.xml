      The goal of this research is to validate novel non-invasive Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      biomarkers to detect Gastroesophageal varices (GEV) in patients with cirrhosis, including&#xD;
      fractional flow change in the portal vein and elevated azygos flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-stage liver disease (cirrhosis) is characterized by advanced fibrosis, liver failure, and&#xD;
      portal hypertension. There are many causes of cirrhosis, including viral hepatitis, alcohol&#xD;
      abuse, and perhaps most importantly, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its&#xD;
      aggressive subset, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). 3 million new cases of end-stage&#xD;
      liver disease (cirrhosis) are expected over the next decade. In cirrhosis, portosystemic&#xD;
      collaterals that shunt blood away from the liver develop due to increased portal pressure.&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal varices (GEV) are the most clinically relevant because they can cause fatal&#xD;
      internal bleeding. GEV bleeding carries ~20% mortality at 6 weeks, and ~34% overall&#xD;
      mortality. Identification of at-risk varices, prior to bleeding, is of paramount importance&#xD;
      to initiate primary prophylaxis. To identify and treat at-risk patients, current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend regular esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and variceal band ligation. Detection of&#xD;
      high-risk GEV is key to initiating primary prophylaxis, which can reduce mortality by 50-70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, endoscopy is invasive and often unnecessary when no treatment is required.&#xD;
      Therefore, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases has identified the&#xD;
      development of &quot;non-invasive markers that predict the presence of high-risk varices&quot; as a&#xD;
      major unmet need.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to implement advanced non-invasive 4D flow MRI&#xD;
      biomarkers to predict the presence of treatable but potentially lethal GEV in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis. This would facilitate the triage of patients with high-risk GEV to therapeutic&#xD;
      EGD, while reducing unnecessary EGD procedures in patients without them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary biological mechanism for development of GEV is elevated portal pressure and&#xD;
      reversal of flow in the left gastric vein (LGV). Applying 4D flow MRI, investigators aim to&#xD;
      detect and quantify reversed flow in the LGV to detect GEV at risk for bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Perform pre-clinical validation of an optimized, accelerated radial 4D flow MRI&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the diagnostic performance of radial 4D flow MRI, in cirrhotic adults&#xD;
      including&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. diagnostic accuracy to identify high-risk GEV using EGD as reference standard, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. test-retest repeatability Aim 3: Evaluate the effects and added value of a meal&#xD;
           challenge to assess for high-risk GEV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Compare the accuracy of 4D flow MRI to current non-invasive markers of liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Clinical Validation (Phase 1): A total of 21 participants (7 healthy volunteers, 7&#xD;
      patients with small, low-risk, and 7 with large, high-risk GEV) will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a single research visit that will include a contrast&#xD;
      enhanced MRI scan lasting up to 1 hour. Participants will be screening a final time for&#xD;
      contraindications to contrast enhanced MR imaging; an IV will be placed; and participants&#xD;
      will be positioned in the MR scanner, asked to lie as still as possible and to follow some&#xD;
      breath hold instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Validation (Phase 2-3): A total of 100 patients diagnosed with cirrhosis will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Participants will be asked to complete a single research visit, lasting&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours, that will include the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to fast for 12 hours prior to arriving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An IV will be placed and a blood sample collected (~11mL, if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo a research MRI lasting approximately 1.5 hours (up to 1 hour&#xD;
           of total scan time)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All participants will be positioned in the MRI scanner for the initial scanning&#xD;
                session (30 min) during which the first dose of GBCA (3/4 of total dose) or the&#xD;
                total dose of Ferumoxytol will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The first 50 participants will be removed from the scanner bore, repositioned, and&#xD;
                scanned for an additional 15 minutes (repeatability testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All participants will then be removed from the scanner and asked to consume 16&#xD;
                ounces of Ensure Plus®. After 20 minutes, they will be repositioned in the scanner&#xD;
                for an additional scanning session (15 min) during which, a second dose of GBCA&#xD;
                (1/4 of total dose) will be administered if required.&#xD;

    <description>R2* is an imaging method used in MRI. R2* = (1/T2*) where R2* is a relaxation rate measured in units of Hz ([1/sec]). R2* is commonly used to look at iron levels by measuring the relaxation times of hydrogen nuclei affected by iron. The presence of the iron results in the shortening of proton relaxation times (T2*), thus increasing R2*.

Parameters included are Encephalopathy, Ascites, Bilirubin levels, Albumin levels, Prothrombin Time and International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR) . Parameters are scored on point 1-3. CTP score is obtained by adding the score for each parameter. CTP scores can be categorized into A= 5-6 points, B=7-9 points and C=10-15 points.
