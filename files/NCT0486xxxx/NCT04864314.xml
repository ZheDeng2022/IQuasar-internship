    <textblock>
      TetraSOD® is a unique marine phytoplankton (Tetraselmis chuii) SOD-rich ingredient that is&#xD;
      grown under patent-protected technology exclusively designed by the company Fitoplancton&#xD;
      Marino, S.L. (Spain). In a previous pilot trial, the ability of TetraSOD® to improve semen&#xD;
      characteristics in idiopathic infertile men after three months of treatment was assessed,&#xD;
      revealing significant improvements in almost all of the analyzed parameters. In the present&#xD;
      clinical trial, such positive effects will be tested again in a higher number of patients,&#xD;
      and additional parameters will be included in order to gain insights into the sperm&#xD;
      physiological changes that underpin the improvement in semen quality&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IInfertility is an increasing global public health problem present in about 15-20% of the&#xD;
      population of reproductive age, affecting as many as 186 million people worldwide. A male&#xD;
      factor is present in approximately 50% of the infertile couples, a large number of them of&#xD;
      unknown or idiopathic origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spermatogenesis is a complex biological process that requires a highly regulated genetic and&#xD;
      hormonal program in a singular environment created by the interaction with different cell&#xD;
      types to orchestrate a successful differentiation process. This process occurs periodically&#xD;
      every 72 days during a man's fertile life. It has been demonstrated that semen quality is&#xD;
      deteriorating over the time, perhaps as a result of exposition to several environmental&#xD;
      factors related with lifestyle: drug use (such us tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine,&#xD;
      opioids and anabolic agents), diet and overweight, disorders of the sleep-wake cycle and&#xD;
      working conditions (continuous exposition to heat sources or toxic substances) that could&#xD;
      impact both directly and indirectly on the complex process of spermatogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the impact of oxidative stress, a cellular state product of an imbalance between&#xD;
      the generation of highly unstable molecules known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the&#xD;
      antioxidant cellular capacity in male fertility is being deeply investigated. High levels of&#xD;
      oxidative stress in semen have been associated with both lower sperm concentration, sperm&#xD;
      motility and acrosome integrity and higher sperm DNA damage and mitochondrial activity.&#xD;
      Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the high prevalence of sperm DNA damage by up to 80%&#xD;
      of men diagnosed with idiopathic male infertility. This DNA damage produced during&#xD;
      spermatogenesis or sperm maturation process could be the result of an increase of reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) in male reproductive tract, which are related to different known factors&#xD;
      (chronic systemic disease, use of some drugs, radiation or pesticides, febrile processes, old&#xD;
      age and environmental factors related to lifestyle: smoking, obesity, alcohol) and other&#xD;
      unknown so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antioxidant supplementation has gained relevance within routine practices in patients with&#xD;
      reproductive problems. Different studies have shown the beneficial effect of antioxidant&#xD;
      consumption against oxidative damage caused by environmental and pathological components,&#xD;
      improving sperm characteristics associated with the seminal analysis. There are scientific&#xD;
      evidences about the improvement of male fertility and higher rates of live newborn after&#xD;
      antioxidant treatment in subfertile men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TetraSOD® is a unique commercial product comprised of 100% lyophilized biomass of the marine&#xD;
      microalgae Tetraselmis chuii strain CCFM03, which is currently marketed for food and&#xD;
      nutraceutical applications around the world by the company Fitoplancton Marino, S.L. This&#xD;
      microalgae product is characterized by a high content in the antioxidant enzyme superoxide&#xD;
      dismutase (SOD), as it is produced using own (patent pending) technology developed by the&#xD;
      company. Results of in vitro studies with human cell lines suggest that TetraSOD® stimulates&#xD;
      the cellular protective mechanisms against oxidative stress. Moreover, results previously&#xD;
      obtained in a pilot study with the highest dose of TetraSOD® (250 mg/day) were promising,&#xD;
      since a high statistically significant response was observed in three of the four studied&#xD;
      parameters after three months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account these results, a new extended double-blind randomized and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical study will be performed to confirm the positive effects of&#xD;
      dietary supplementation with 250 mg of TetraSOD® during 3 months (corresponding to the time&#xD;
      of a complete spermatogenic cycle) in sperm quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is to demonstrate the usefulness and safety of TetraSOD®&#xD;
      treatment in the improvement of sperm quality including sperm DNA fragmentation. As we&#xD;
      previously mentioned, oxidative stress is one of the main causes of sperm DNA damage.&#xD;
      Nowadays, a diagnostic test for the study of the sperm DNA fragmentation exists, but it&#xD;
      requires a specific sperm sample processing and the results are obtained in delay-time. In&#xD;
      our study we are going to also assess the correlation between sperm DNA fragmentation and&#xD;
      sORP (static oxidation reduction potential) degree by the use of &quot;MiOXSYS&quot;. Therefore, the&#xD;
      availability of a simple and cheap instantaneous response time diagnostic test seems&#xD;
      promising for the reproductive clinics. It allows us to advance in the diagnosis of male&#xD;
      fertility potential and in the identification of those patients susceptible to antioxidant&#xD;
      treatment in order to improve their reproductive results, increasing the chances of pregnancy&#xD;
      both spontaneously or after assisted reproductive treatment&#xD;
