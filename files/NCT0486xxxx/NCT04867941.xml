      The study will evaluate the influence of hepatic insufficiency on the PK of ACP-196.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a 2-part study. Part 1 of the study will compare the PK of ACP-196 in participants&#xD;
      with mild hepatic insufficiency (a score of 5 to 6, on the Child-Pugh scale) and moderate&#xD;
      hepatic insufficiency (a score of 7 to 9, on the Child-Pugh scale) to healthy (mean) matched&#xD;
      control participants for age and weight. Part 2 of the study, if it is conducted, will&#xD;
      compare the PK of ACP-196 in participants with severe hepatic insufficiency (a score of 10 to&#xD;
      15 on the Child-Pugh scale) to the healthy control participants from Part 1. In Part 1, 6&#xD;
      participants with mild hepatic insufficiency, 6 participants with moderate hepatic, and 6&#xD;
      healthy control participants matched to the hepatic insufficiency groups according to mean&#xD;
      age and mean weight will be enrolled. In Part 2, if conducted, 6 participants with severe&#xD;
      hepatic insufficiency will be enrolled. The control group of Part 1 will be used for Part 2&#xD;
      PK comparison. Participants will be screened within 28 days before the dose. Participants&#xD;
      will be contacted approximately 14 days after the last dose of study drug administration to&#xD;
      determine if any adverse event has occurred since the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
