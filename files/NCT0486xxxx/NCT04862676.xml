      Subjects with multiple myeloma (MM) who are considered eligible for high-dose therapy and&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation by the transplant team at WCI will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects will receive HBO therapy on Days 0, +1 and +2 of the transplant. The&#xD;
      treatment consists of exposure to hyperbaric oxygen at 2.5 atmospheric absolutes for a total&#xD;
      of 90 minutes after compression to 2.5 atmosphere absolutes in a monoplace hyperbaric chamber&#xD;
      (Model 3200/3200R, Sechrist Industries, Inc., USA), breathing 100% oxygen. Subjects will be&#xD;
      in the chamber for a total of 120 minutes as approximately 10-15 minutes will be spent during&#xD;
      the compression and decompression phases and subjects will have 5-10 minute room air breaks&#xD;
      every 30 minutes of hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Subjects will be seen daily until neutrophil&#xD;
      recovery is documented . After neutrophil recovery is documented, the subjects will be seen&#xD;
      in clinic at least weekly through day +100. A final visit will be scheduled day +100. As part&#xD;
      of routine care, subjects will be followed daily or as directed by the treating physician&#xD;
      until neutrophil recovery, defined as three consecutive days of achieving a neutrophil count&#xD;
      of &gt;500/mm3. Laboratory testing will occur per institutional guidelines. Follow-up will&#xD;
      continue until Day +100. Donor chimerism and disease status will be determined by bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsy on Day +30 and day +100 post-transplant.&#xD;
