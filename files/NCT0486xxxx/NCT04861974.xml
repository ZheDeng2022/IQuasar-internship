      Robotic is having increased interest in the last decade and on of its limits is the cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From previous report Robotic surgery entails higher costs. However, cost solely is not enough&#xD;
      to validate a new procedure. Whenever a new technology is introduced it is important to&#xD;
      evaluate cost and improved quality of life as well, which is the Cost Effectiveness (CE)&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate in Spain the CE of laparoscopic and robotic procedure of&#xD;
      Distal Pancreatectomy, Gastrectomy, Nissen procedure, Rectal resection and Inguinal hernia&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective snapshot study during 6 months in which patients are included from&#xD;
      several Spanish centers. Cost are defined according to the spain official cost data recorded&#xD;
      from the RECH (https://www.rechosp.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main clinical outcomes are gathered divided in intra operative and post operative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life (EQ 5D-5L) is recorded as well pre operatively and post operatively at 30&#xD;
      days and 9 days from the surgery, time in which the follow up is ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost effectiveness analysis is finally performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A model-based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and QALYs per patient was&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Institute for Validation of Clinical Efficacy (IVEC) of the HM Hospitals group was&#xD;
      responsible for capturing costs ascribed to each patient's treatment. The total direct&#xD;
      hospital costs of care, with the exception of the acquisition or maintenance of the robotic&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and medicines used during surgery were standardized so that the same materials were&#xD;
      used in all patients undergoing surgery regardless of the technique employed (Robotic or&#xD;
      Laparoscopic). Operative costs included the cost of the operating room in relation to the&#xD;
      operative time, and all required supplies (including all laparoscopic devices, sutures, and&#xD;
      instruments), anaesthesia, laboratory and related blood transfusion costs when required.&#xD;
      Hospitalization costs included costs associated with room and board, the length of hospital&#xD;
      stay (including intensive care, medications, blood transfusion, parenteral nutrition and&#xD;
      radiology charge) and costs for surgical visits (programmed and emergency) as well as&#xD;
      readmission costs up to 90 days from surgery. The direct costs of the professionals involved&#xD;
      have not been calculated as they did not vary between the two types of operation. A discount&#xD;
      rate of 3% per year is used in the estimation of the costs and QALYs, as recommended by&#xD;
      health economic guidelines (9) All costs are presented in Euros (exchange rate 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stochastic cost-utility analysis was undertaken, whereby the incremental cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      ratio (ICER) was estimated using overall costs of the RRR and LRR procedures and QALYs&#xD;
      derived from patient interviews, in order to find the incremental cost per QALYs gained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Net monetary benefits (NMBs) were calculated in order to estimate the maximum willingness to&#xD;
      pay (WTP) of decision makers for a QALY gained. The NMB was calculated as the mean QALYs per&#xD;
      patient multiplied by WTP threshold minus the mean cost per patient for the treatment. The&#xD;
      decision rule is to adopt the treatment if the NMB &gt; 0, and the alternative with the highest&#xD;
      NMB represents best value for money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to propagate the&#xD;
      uncertainty of the estimations to the results of the model. We used a multivariate and&#xD;
      stochastic sensitivity analysis performed by 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness plane was used to represent all pairs of solutions of the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the one-way sensitivity analysis are shown in the tornado diagram which&#xD;
      depicts graphically how variations in each input affect the outcome. The 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals around the base case values were derived using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles&#xD;
      calculated from the sensitivity analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tornado diagram is stacked in order of decreasing width, indicating that variations in&#xD;
      inputs near the top (Total Costs Robotic) have the greatest effect on the outcome, while&#xD;
      variations in inputs near the bottom (QALYs discount rate) have relatively small effects on&#xD;
      the outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability curve The investigators also computed a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve&#xD;
      which plots the probability that the Robotic was cost-effective relative to Laparoscopy over&#xD;
      a reasonable range of levels of willingness-to-pay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although in Spain there is no specific willing to pay threshold in healthcare, according to&#xD;
      the National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE), the investigators used a&#xD;
      willingness-to-pay of 20,000 € and 30,000 € per QALY as a threshold to recognize which&#xD;
      treatment was most cost-effective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Data have been recorded in a SPSS Statistics Version 20.0 database and are&#xD;
      expressed as median values (interquartile range-IQR 25-75). Categorical data are presented as&#xD;
      numbers (%). To compare the means of the quantitative variables when the variables followed a&#xD;
      normal distribution, a variance analysis and a Student's t-test were used. For the rest of&#xD;
      the variables, both Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. Cost, QALYs and&#xD;
      incremental results are presented in a 95% Confidence Interval. A p value &lt; .05 was&#xD;
      considered significant. Data herein reported are for patients who reached a minimum of one&#xD;
      year of follow up.&#xD;
