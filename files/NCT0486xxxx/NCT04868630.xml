      The purpose of this study is to calibrate the average breathing rate measurement of the&#xD;
      PAD-2A device to be within ±2 breaths per minute of clinical capnography breathing rate&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The plan for this study is to calibrate the average breathing rate measurement of the PAD-2A&#xD;
      device with the breathing rate measurement of a standard clinical capnography device. The&#xD;
      data will be collected and analyzed in order to calibrate the PAD-2A device via the&#xD;
      capnography measures by adjusting the device algorithm for the breathing rate measurements to&#xD;
      be within ±2 breaths per minute. Additionally, the secondary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the clinical standard respiratory rate measurement of capnography with the&#xD;
      respiratory rate measurements of other standard clinical respiratory devices (i.e. nasal&#xD;
      pressure transducer, thermistor, and the respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) belts&#xD;
      of the chest and abdomen).&#xD;
