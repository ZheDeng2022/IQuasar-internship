      Long-term extension of a multi-site, first-in-human study to assess safety and efficacy of an&#xD;
      active implantable Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) device in adult patients with active&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an incomplete response or intolerability&#xD;
      to at least two biologic and/or targeted synthetic DMARDs having at least two different&#xD;
      mechanisms of action&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, extension study to assess long term safety and efficacy of an active&#xD;
      implantable VNS device in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The study is uncontrolled&#xD;
      and randomized, where the sites and subjects are blinded to treatment until completion of the&#xD;
      parent study. Subjects who were randomized to the inactive device group in the parent study&#xD;
      are re-randomized to receive active vagus nerve stimulation either 1 min QD or 1 min QID.&#xD;
      Subject who were randomized to the active device groups remain on their assigned treatment (1&#xD;
      min QD, 1 min QID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment in SPM-011 begins at the Day 0 Visit. At the Day 0, Week 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5&#xD;
      Visits, all subjects are given the opportunity to have the output current of their implant&#xD;
      adjusted to the maximum level tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Week 5 onward, subjects will receive their maximally tolerated output current as 1 min&#xD;
      QD or 1 min QID treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up assessment visits occur at Week 8, Week 12, Months 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 33 and 36.&#xD;
      Subjects are assessed for safety and durability of response throughout the follow up period.&#xD;
      If the subject's symptoms or RA disease worsens, additional concomitant medications are&#xD;
      allowed for treatment of their RA.&#xD;
