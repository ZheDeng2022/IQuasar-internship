    <textblock>
      Kidney stone is one of the most common diseases in every human society and also Iran. What is&#xD;
      normally used to treat renal colic pain is Intravenous Opioid with a variety of side effects&#xD;
      including hypotension, respiratory depression and apnea, nausea and vomiting. Regarding less&#xD;
      complications of Intravenous Acetaminophen, we aimed to compare it with Intravenous Morphine&#xD;
      in management of renal colic pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Kidney stone is one of the common diseases of human society which is demonstrated in the form&#xD;
      of renal colic. Evidences indicate that renal colic is one of the mot painful conditions that&#xD;
      require urgent pain relief treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from renal colic do not usually recover from pain by using oral pain&#xD;
      killers or rectal suppositories. Hence, a considerable percentage of these patients are&#xD;
      admitted to the emergency department. A bothering and sharp pain is the most common&#xD;
      characteristics of renal colic pain that wakes the patient up in the middle of the night. To&#xD;
      achieve more relief, patients somehow take unusual positions such as squatting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are normally used as pain relievers in emergency department are Non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and intravenous Opioids. However, both of these classes of&#xD;
      drugs have many side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another point in this regard which is worthy to be mentioned is that some patients with renal&#xD;
      colic complaint are drug addicted, so we have to administer higher dosage of analgesic drugs.&#xD;
      According to the statistics provided by the US National Library website, the prevalence of&#xD;
      kidney stones around the world in 2005 has been averagely around 140.1% which is&#xD;
      considerable. This issue suggests more attention to the field of prevention and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the statistics of kidney stones incidence in Iran, 2.4 out of every 1000 people&#xD;
      suffer from this pathologic condition whereas it differs from 0.5 to 2 in every 1000 ones in&#xD;
      other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous Acetaminophen has been imported to our country and introduced with the brand of&#xD;
      Apotel. In this regard, we decided to compare the effect of Intravenous Acetaminophen and&#xD;
      Morphine on renal colic pain.&#xD;

    <description>patient's pain was assessed by using a Visual Analog Scale Ruler, that rates the amount of pain from 0 to 10 based on patient's confession. Patient's pain was checked out twice: exactly before receiving the pain reliever, and 30 minutes later.</description>

    <description>Specified dosage for Acetaminophen was 15 mg/kg. so based on the patient's weight(averagely 70 kg), about 1gr Acetaminophen (one complete Apotel Ampule) was used.</description>

    <description>This protocol prepared by a nurse and labeled as Drug A. Since the rapid injection of Acetaminophen can result in hypotension, therefore based on the Apotel Injection Instruction, it must be infused slowly within 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>This protocol was prepared by a nurse and labeled as Drug B. Since the rapid injection of Morphine can result in histamine release, therefore it must be infused slowly within 15 minutes. The nurse, who was in charge of infusing pain reliever, was unaware of the type of injected drug.</description>
