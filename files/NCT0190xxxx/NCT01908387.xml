  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study that will evaluate the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CC-486 in&#xD;
      Japanese subjects with hematological neoplasms including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS),&#xD;
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM),&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). A standard phase 1 design for MTD&#xD;
      determination, an open label, dose ascending, &quot;3 + 3&quot; design, is adopted in this study. This&#xD;
      study consists of screening phase, MTD determination phase, and treatment phase. Each subject&#xD;
      continues study treatment until documentation of progressive disease or discontinuation of&#xD;
      study treatment for any reason. Originally only MDS subjects were targeted and the MTD of&#xD;
      CC-486 when administered once daily (QD) for 21 days in a 28-day cycle would be evaluated in&#xD;
      this study. Currently CC-486 is being clinically developed with both 14-day and 21-day dosing&#xD;
      schedules in various diseases. This study was suspended to amend protocol to evaluate the MTD&#xD;
      on these different dosing schedule in larger population. This study was re-opened after&#xD;
      amended protocol was approved by institutional review board at study site.&#xD;
