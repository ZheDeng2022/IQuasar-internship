  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increased HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection testing in Africa, many&#xD;
      patients never enroll in subsequent HIV care after testing or remain in care after an initial&#xD;
      enrollment. This study's aim is to improve linkage to HIV care and retention in HIV care&#xD;
      through the use of feasible, evidence-based, and practical interventions. The study takes&#xD;
      place in Swaziland, the country with the highest HIV prevalence (24%) in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
      The study will randomize groups of HIV testing sites and affiliated clinics to either&#xD;
      standard of care or a combined intervention strategy (CIS) which consists of point-of care&#xD;
      CD4 (cluster differentiation 4 (CD4)) testing at time of HIV testing, fast-track HIV&#xD;
      medications for those who are eligible for treatment,mobile phone appointment reminders, care&#xD;
      bags filled with health prevention materials, and financial incentives. The study outcomes&#xD;
      are linkage to and retention in care as well as cost effectiveness, feasibility of&#xD;
      interventions, and patient acceptability of interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Linkage of patients from HIV testing to HIV care programs and their retention once enrolled&#xD;
      in care are essential to HIV program effectiveness in terms of prevention of HIV;related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality and prevention of HIV transmission. Linkage and retention rates in&#xD;
      HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are suboptimal, with less than half of patients who&#xD;
      test positive successfully linking and remaining in care at 1 year. This study is a two-arm&#xD;
      cluster site;randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a novel combination package of&#xD;
      evidence;based interventions, the combination intervention strategy (CIS), compared to&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) on linkage and retention of HIV;positive patients from point of&#xD;
      testing to retention in care. CIS will include 1) point of care CD4+ count assays at HIV&#xD;
      testing sites; 2) accelerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for eligible patients;&#xD;
      3) provision of a basic care and prevention package (BCPP); 4) short message service (SMS)&#xD;
      reminders for clinic appointments; and 5) financial incentives for linkage and retention. The&#xD;
      primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of CIS as compared to SOC on the combined&#xD;
      outcome of rapid linkage to HIV care within 1 month and retention in care at 12 months among&#xD;
      adults testing positive for HIV. Secondary aims include evaluation of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      CIS compared to SOC on each of linkage to HIV; retention in care; time to ART initiation; HIV&#xD;
      disease progression and mortality; patient acceptability; association between baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and outcomes, and comparison of cost effectiveness.&#xD;

    <description>Each HIV testing and counseling (HTC) site will be equipped with POC CD4+ testing using PIMA™ Analyser (Inverness), test strips, and reagents. Study staff will obtain 25 microliters of blood via finger prick and process the POC (point-of-care) CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) Count' test immediately following the baseline interview. Test results will be recorded on study forms including a referral form that has multiple copies, one copy to be given to the participant, the second sent to the affiliated HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus)care clinic in the study unit, and the third kept by study staff in a locked cabinet with other confidential material. All participants, regardless of the CD4+ result, will be encouraged to enroll in HIV care as soon as they can.</description>
