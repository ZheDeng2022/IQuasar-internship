  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of two HIV vaccines in HIV-1-infected&#xD;
      young adults who are taking anti-HIV medications and have very low virus levels. This study&#xD;
      will also look at how the immune system responds to the vaccines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response of the combination of two vaccines: a&#xD;
      multigene DNA HIV-1 vaccine that also expresses GM-CSF (GEO-D03) and a MVA HIV-1 (MVA/HIV62B)&#xD;
      vaccine. HIV-1-infected young adults who have suppressed viral levels, have likely acquired&#xD;
      (Clade B) HIV-1 infection from sexual contact, and are on highly active antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (HAART) will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms. Arm A participants will&#xD;
      receive the GEO-D03 vaccine at entry and Week 8 and the MVA/HIV62B vaccine at Weeks 16 and&#xD;
      24. Arm B participants will receive placebo vaccines at entry and at Weeks 8, 16, and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration will be 120 weeks (24 weeks for vaccinations plus 96 weeks of follow-up).&#xD;
      Study participants will remain on HAART throughout the study. Study visits will occur at&#xD;
      screening, entry, and at Weeks 1, 8, 9, 16, 17, 24, 25, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120. At each&#xD;
      study visit, participants will undergo blood collection, a physical exam, and an adherence&#xD;
      assessment. At screening, participants will also undergo an electrocardiogram (ECG) and urine&#xD;
      collection. Some blood samples will be stored for future use.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infected. More details on this criterion can be found in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Likely HIV-1 acquisition in North America or Europe (in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Likely HIV-1 acquisition from sexual transmission (in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On stable HAART, defined as at least three different antiretrovirals (ARVs) from two&#xD;
             different classes, with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels fewer than 100 copies/mL for at least&#xD;
             12 months prior to screening. Furthermore, at least two plasma HIV-1 RNA levels fewer&#xD;
             than 100 copies/mL (and none with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels 100 or more copies/mL),&#xD;
             separated by at least 3 months must have been documented during the 6-month period&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness of participant to provide signed written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4 count 400 cells/mm^3 or greater at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following lab values (at screening visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatine phosphokinase no higher than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
                  More details on this criterion can be found in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Troponin I no more than 1.0 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,000 mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets greater than 100,000 mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) no greater&#xD;
                  than 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times ULN (less than 5 times ULN if taking&#xD;
                  atazanavir)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants who engage in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must&#xD;
             agree to avoid pregnancy and to consistently use two methods of contraception,&#xD;
             including at least one form of barrier contraception, from the screening visit until&#xD;
             90 days after the final vaccination. Medically acceptable contraceptives include&#xD;
             barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, an&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD), or approved hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control&#xD;
             pills, Depo Provera, or Lupron Depot. Condoms are recommended because their&#xD;
             appropriate use is the only contraception method effective for preventing HIV-1&#xD;
             transmission. Two methods of barrier contraception (condom and diaphragm) may be&#xD;
             combined to meet this requirement. Sexually active female study participants without&#xD;
             reproductive potential are eligible without requiring the use of contraception.&#xD;
             Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff from one&#xD;
             of the following is required for participants: physician report/letter or discharge&#xD;
             summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To prevent pregnancies, male participants must agree to not attempt to impregnate a&#xD;
             female or participate in sperm donation programs. Males engaging in sexual activity&#xD;
             that could lead to pregnancy must use a condom from the date of receipt of the first&#xD;
             study vaccine until 90 days after receipt of the last study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To prevent HIV-1 transmission to a partner, all participants participating in sexual&#xD;
             activity must agree to use effective barrier methods (condoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to comply with all study requirements, including adherence to ARV treatment as&#xD;
             prescribed by regular healthcare provider and the expectation to be available for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of infection with HIV-1 other than Clade B (e.g., if genotype data are&#xD;
             available from pre-treatment viral resistance analyses)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation that the last CD4 T-cell count prior to the initiation of ARV was fewer&#xD;
             than 300 cells/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis C virus RNA positive&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  evidence of past or evolving myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  angina pectoris&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  congestive heart failure with permanent sequelae&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  myocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  pericarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  clinically significant arrhythmia (including any arrhythmia requiring medication,&#xD;
                  treatment, or clinical follow-up)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Screening ECG with clinically significant findings or features that would interfere&#xD;
             with the assessment of myo/pericarditis, including any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Conduction disturbance (complete left or complete right bundle branch block or&#xD;
                  nonspecific intraventricular conduction disturbance with QRS greater than 120 ms,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;

             significant findings during the screening medical history or physical examination&#xD;
             that, in the site investigator's opinion, would compromise the outcome of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active alcohol or substance abuse (abuse is defined as use of alcohol or other&#xD;
             substance such that it is likely to interfere with the ability of the participant to&#xD;
             adhere to medications or to return for study visits or is likely to lead to AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any foreseeable circumstances that, in the opinion of the site investigator, are&#xD;
