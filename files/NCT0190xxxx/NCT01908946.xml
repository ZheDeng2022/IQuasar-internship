      The investigators plan to test the effectiveness of reminders to parents/guardians on cell&#xD;
      phones through short messaging system (SMS) in improving the on-time routine immunization for&#xD;
      children in Pakistan. SMS message as a reminder tool can be very effective in health care&#xD;
      settings at public health scale. This study will be conducted in an urban- squatter&#xD;
      settlement area, Ibrahim Haidry union council in Karachi. Parents/guardians of children&#xD;
      randomized in intervention arm will be sent SMS reminders vaccination visit reminders at 6,&#xD;
      10 and 14 weeks of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immunization coverage in Pakistan is still well below the desired level, leading to&#xD;
      continued polio transmission, large measles outbreaks and thousands of deaths from&#xD;
      vaccine-preventable illnesses. A major reason for poor childhood vaccine coverage is the lack&#xD;
      of awareness among parents regarding the need for immunization in children, and the&#xD;
      importance of completing the entire series of vaccines. This result in significant drop-out&#xD;
      between vaccines delivered at birth and later in the infancy period. Customized short&#xD;
      messaging system (SMS) text can be designed as personally tailored messages to remind and&#xD;
      inquire parents regarding vaccination for their children according to the EPI schedule. We&#xD;
      plan to test the effectiveness of reminders to parents/guardians on cell phones through short&#xD;
      messaging system (SMS) in improving the on-time routine immunization for children in&#xD;
      Pakistan. This study will be conducted in an urban- squatter settlement area, Ibrahim Haidry&#xD;
      union council in Karachi, Pakistan. Our experimental plan has three components: First, we&#xD;
      will conduct baseline survey of parents at our study site to explore their preferences for&#xD;
      text for immunization reminders. Simultaneously, we will develop a computerized application&#xD;
      for reminders scheduling. This application will contain the phone number, message&#xD;
      information, language preferences and date on which the message will be sent. It will be&#xD;
      interfaced with the gateway to send the message. Lastly, we will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of automated SMS reminders to parents in&#xD;
      improving the on-time vaccination rates in children. If the result shows that the vaccines&#xD;
      compliance can be increased through the SMS reminders, this program can be incorporated with&#xD;
      the existing systems to collect the cell phone numbers of parents at the time of child's&#xD;
      first contact with the health system and sending auto generated reminders for vaccine&#xD;
      compliance at national level.&#xD;
