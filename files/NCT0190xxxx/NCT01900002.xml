  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sorafenib tosylate and yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres&#xD;
      work in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Sorafenib&#xD;
      tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres use glass beads to carry radiation directly to tumor&#xD;
      cells without harming normal cells. Giving sorafenib tosylate with yttrium Y 90 glass&#xD;
      microspheres may be an effective treatment for liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Median progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Time to radiographic progression (TTRP). III. To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of the combination of sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) and Yttrium-90; adverse events&#xD;
      (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0&#xD;
      [NCI-CTAE v 4.0]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Predictive biomarkers of response to therapy and survival: will assess pre-treatment&#xD;
      plasma level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as above, and assess its predictive&#xD;
      ability of time to progression (TTP) and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). After 4 weeks, patients&#xD;
      receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intra-arterially (IA). Courses of sorafenib tosylate&#xD;
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
