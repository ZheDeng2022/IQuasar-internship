      This is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the effectiveness of vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplementation on depressive symptoms, self-management, and blood pressure in approximately&#xD;
      180 adult women with type 2 diabetes who have significant depressive symptoms. Consenting&#xD;
      adult women who are eligible to participate will be randomly assigned to either a weekly dose&#xD;
      of 50,000 international units of vitamin D3 supplementation or a matching weekly active&#xD;
      comparator of 5,000 international units of vitamin D3 for six months. Participants will&#xD;
      complete approximately four in-person study visits and several telephone visits throughout&#xD;
      the six month trial period, where the researchers will assess depressive symptoms, diabetes&#xD;
      self-management, and systolic blood pressure.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, self-management, and systolic blood pressure compared to placebo. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that women receiving vitamin D supplementation will report fewer depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, increased diabetes self- management mediated by depression improvement, and will&#xD;
      have a lower systolic blood pressure compared to those taking placebo at three and six months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to explore the mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers and their association with depression. Here, the hypothesis is that&#xD;
      women receiving vitamin D supplementation will have a decrease in inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      which will be associated with fewer depressive symptoms compared to those taking placebo at&#xD;
      three and six months follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>(1) Full Scale Name: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D). (2) Definition: The CES-D is a self-report questionnaire assessing frequency and severity of depression symptoms. (3) Construct Measured: Mood. (4) CES-D Score Range: Raw scores may range from 0 to 60, where higher scores indicate worse mood. (5) Change Calculation Details: Continuous/ordinal measure comparing mood from Baseline (month 0) to mood in month six for the experimental versus active comparator cohorts.</description>

    <time_frame>After 6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>(1) Full Scale Name: Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAIDS). (2) Definition: The PAIDS is a 20-item self-report scale that assesses diabetes burden and treatment. (3) Construct Measured: Distress. (4) PAIDS Score Range: Raw scores may range from 0 to 80, where higher scores indicate greater distress. (5) Change Calculation Details: Continuous measure comparing change in distress from Baseline (month 0) to month six for the experimental versus active comparator cohorts.</description>

    <description>(1) Full Scale Name: Diabetes Self-Care Inventory. (2) Definition: The Diabetes Self-Care Inventory is a 13-item self-report assessment of compliance with diabetes treatment for persons with type 2 diabetes. (3) Construct Measured: Self-Care. (4) Diabetes Self-Care Score Range: Raw scores may range from 13 to 65, where lower scores indicate poorer adherence to diabetes treatment and self-functioning. (5) Change Calculation Details: Continuous/ordinal measure comparing diabetes treatment compliance and self-care at Baseline (month 0) to compliance and self-care at month six for the experimental versus active comparator cohorts.</description>

(3) Construct Measured: Diabetes management. (4) Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale Score Range: Raw scores may range from 8 to 80, where lower scores indicate poorer diabetes management. (5) Change Calculation Details: continuous/ordinal measure comparing diabetes management from Baseline (month 0) to diabetes management in month six for the experimental versus active comparator cohorts.</description>
