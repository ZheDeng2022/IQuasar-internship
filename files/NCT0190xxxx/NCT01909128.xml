    <textblock>
      The respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are a very common problem with high morbidity&#xD;
      in children. These conditions were due, in general, immaturity and all &quot;inexperience&quot; of the&#xD;
      immune system, as well as to the particular anatomical structure and function of the&#xD;
      respiratory and gastrointestinal tract still developing. This inevitably means that&#xD;
      school-age children develop disease (as a result of infection) more easily than at later&#xD;
      ages. The frequency and duration of these conditions implies a high discomfort and incur&#xD;
      significant costs in relation to drug administration, the need for hospitalization, days of&#xD;
      absence from school and work days lost by parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently probiotics, defined as &quot;microorganisms that prove able, once ingested in adequate&#xD;
      amounts, exert beneficial functions for the body &quot;have been proposed for the treatment of&#xD;
      treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections of childhood but only in recent&#xD;
      years have been conducted controlled clinical trials that have conclusively proven&#xD;
      effectiveness. All probiotics induce an immune response, the characteristics of which are&#xD;
      related to the strain or the mixture of bacteria used. Recent studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      positive effects of probiotics on the respiratory system, and in particular on the prevention&#xD;
      and reduction of the severity of respiratory infections, probably mediated by an increase of&#xD;
      cells that secrete Immunoglobulin A in bronchial mucosa. It 'been shown that probiotics can&#xD;
      be a sure way to reduce the risk of early acute otitis media and the use of antibiotics for&#xD;
      recurrent respiratory infections during the first year of life. Similar results were seen in&#xD;
      a study conducted on a population of 326 children aged between 3 and 5 years, who found a&#xD;
      decrease in the incidence of antibiotic use by over 65% and a reduction of days of absence of&#xD;
      more than 25% among children treated with a probiotic. Many of the studied effects of&#xD;
      probiotics, understandably, refer to the digestive system. These effects relate to both&#xD;
      conditions paraphysiological (constipation) and more specifically in situations of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies carried out in recent years has demonstrated the efficacy of specific&#xD;
      probiotics in reducing the symptoms in the pediatric population affected by infectious&#xD;
      gastroenteritis. Probiotics reduce the duration of infectious diarrhea by 0.7 days and reduce&#xD;
      the frequency of diarrheal episodes in the first few hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiota on the other hand participates in the function of the mucosal barrier against&#xD;
      the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria, crucial time for the start of the infectious process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When this barrier function is altered by chemical agents, by antigens or by stressors of&#xD;
      different nature, may manifest intestinal disorders, sometimes due to the growth of bacteria&#xD;
      pathogens. Numerous experimental data suggest that probiotics can contribute to the&#xD;
      reinforcement of the activities of gut mucosal barrier, in particular aspects affecting the&#xD;
      functionality of the intestinal epithelial cells or macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently it has been shown that daily intake for 3 months of preparation with probiotics&#xD;
      reduce the incidence and severity of the most common respiratory infections and limits the&#xD;
      number of days of absence school children during the winter season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's scientifically recognized as some probiotic effects can also be obtained with the use of&#xD;
      inactivated bacteria or bacterial components isolated (eg bacterial DNA). It has been&#xD;
      recently proposed a modified definition of probiotic products as &quot;prepared bacterial cells or&#xD;
      bacterial components that have a beneficial effect on the health and welfare of the host&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among these products &quot;probiotic-like&quot; fall ingredients object of this study: food ingredients&#xD;
      (rice flour and skim milk) fermented, or in which has been made to grow a probiotic&#xD;
      (Lactobacillus CBA-L74) that has been inactivated at the end of the fermentation process&#xD;
      through a heat treatment. The benefits are attributable to bacterial components that remain&#xD;
      in the final product (for example, DNA, cell wall, etc.) and factors produced during the&#xD;
      fermentation (short chain fatty acids, bacterial proteins, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main effects of these bacterial components relate to the stimulation of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), through interaction with the immune&#xD;
      cells via Toll-like receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some components, such as proteins and peptides, may have a Bifidogenic activity&#xD;
      and are available in the literature some studies that have demonstrated the ability of infant&#xD;
      formula, milk-based fermented to reduce the severity of episodes of infectious diarrhea in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this data, the Commission of the European Society of Nutrition Gastroenterology,&#xD;
      Hepatology and Pediatric Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has defined this type of products are not only&#xD;
      safe but to determine a potential prebiotic effect and the reduction of the severity of&#xD;
      episodes of infectious diarrhea.&#xD;
