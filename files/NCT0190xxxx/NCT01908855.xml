  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether cognitive-behavioral therapy enriched with&#xD;
      strategies from emotion regulation training leads to better improvement in somatic symptoms&#xD;
      and comorbid problems than cognitive-behavioral therapy alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Somatic symptoms not caused by a known biomedical condition (&quot;somatoform disorders&quot;) are&#xD;
      highly prevalent, involve a high risk of chronicity, are one of the major reasons for doctor&#xD;
      visits, and are a tremendous burden for health care systems. Despite the economic relevance,&#xD;
      research activities are disproportionately low. The only intervention with an evidence grade&#xD;
      I is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, average effect sizes for CBT in&#xD;
      somatization syndromes are only moderate (Cohen's d &lt; 0.5), and more powerful interventions&#xD;
      are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is convincing evidence that patients with somatoform disorders have emotion regulation&#xD;
      deficits, which are not addressed by current CBT approaches. Based on positive results of a&#xD;
      small pilot study it is expected that enriching CBT programs with emotion regulation&#xD;
      techniques improves treatment outcome. The primary goal of the proposed project is therefore&#xD;
      to evaluate this hypothesis in a randomized design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be primarily recruited via referrals by primary care doctors. After a screening&#xD;
      phase a baseline assessments with different self- and clinician-rating scales (see Outcome&#xD;
      Measures) follows. If participants fulfill the eligibility criteria they will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of the two study arms: cognitive-behavioral therapy vs. cognitive-behavioral therapy&#xD;
      enriched with emotion regulation strategies. After every therapy session patients will be&#xD;
      screened in regard to aspects of therapeutic alliance, adverse events, and symptom&#xD;
      intensity/annoyance. The post assessment takes place after the 20th session and a follow-up&#xD;
      is planned six months after post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods will be applied to prevent bias and to assure a high quality level of the&#xD;
      current study. Data handling, data monitoring and statistical analyses will be supervised by&#xD;
      the Coordinating Center for Clinical Trials (KKS) of Philipps-University of Marburg; data&#xD;
      quality and safety principles will be applied. Additionally an independent Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board will be nominated. The study center will visit all study sites regularly to&#xD;
      verify correct procedures, data sampling, and data management. Randomisation occurs and is&#xD;
      controlled centrally through the randomisation's central office in KKS Marburg. Furthermore&#xD;
      the current study constitutes a single-blinded trial. Assessment interviews are conducted and&#xD;
      analyzed by people blinded to the treatment condition. Additionally, treatments are&#xD;
      manualized, and therapists receive an intense training. Treatment fidelity/integrity is&#xD;
      analyzed with rating schemes for 5% randomly selected videotaped treatment sessions. Allowed&#xD;
      additional treatments during study inclusion are thoroughly monitored and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome variable &quot;somatization severity&#xD;
      index&quot; of the Screening of Somatoform Disorders (SOMS-7T). Based on results of the main&#xD;
      validation study of SOMS-7T, meta-analytic estimations, and results of a pilot study of the&#xD;
      efficacy of ENCERT, the power calculations yield a necessary total sample size of N=194 to&#xD;
      detect a clinical relevant difference of 4 points symptom reduction on SOMS-7T between the&#xD;
      two treatments with a power of 0.80 and an alpha=.05. With regard to an estimated drop-out&#xD;
      rate of 20%, N=244 patients are to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As main efficacy analysis the primary outcome shall be analyzed with linear mixed-effect&#xD;
      models. It will be done according to the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) principle: to consider&#xD;
      missing values as a potential source of bias, they will be handled according to the framework&#xD;
      by Rubin. Secondary statistical analyses focus on establishing longer term treatment efficacy&#xD;
      and describing the pattern of change. For this purpose the mean response will be modeled as a&#xD;
      function of time with a separate mixed effects linear model over all assessments.&#xD;
      Furthermore, interindividual differences in intraindividual change will be modeled using&#xD;
      multilevel analysis for longitudinal data. Multilevel longitudinal mediation analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted in order to test whether the effect of treatment condition on intraindividual&#xD;
      changes in somatic symptom severity can be explained by intraindividual changes in emotion&#xD;
      regulation skills.&#xD;

    <description>ENCERT contains 1) psychoeducation (session1), 2) relaxation techniques for coping with stress (sessions 2-4), 3) non-judgmental awareness of body perceptions, (sessions 5-7), 4) modifying illness behavior and accepting unpleasant body perceptions (sessions 8-13), 5) attention defocusing on positive perceptions plus emotional self-support (sessions 14- 15), 6) analyzing interpretation processes to understand situational cues (sessions 16-17), and 7) change of behavior and interpretations (sessions 18-20). The innovative elements of ENCERT are: improving the awareness for the association of somatic symptoms with emotions, learning non-judgmental awareness and acceptance of unpleasant body perceptions, achieving high-frequent skill exercising with the emotion regulation audio training.</description>

As such, it presents the reference of efficacy and safety for new regimen. The strictly manualized program includes the following components focusing on the special needs of chronic somatoform patients: psychoeducation providing a framework for psychotherapy, attention defocusing, reduction of over-interpretation of symptoms, increase of physical activity, stress reduction.</description>
