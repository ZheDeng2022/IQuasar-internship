  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic surgery holds the potential to overcome many of the ergonomic challenges posed by&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery. In this study, we propose to quantify this potential ergonomic benefit&#xD;
      by measuring electromyography (EMG) and instrument motion analysis of subjects performing&#xD;
      surgical tasks using robotic assistance versus standard laparoscopic instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that surgeons will experience significant, measurable ergonomic&#xD;
      advantages when performing tasks using robotic surgery when compared to conventional&#xD;
      laparoscopic tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Subjects for the study will include three groups of varying degrees of training&#xD;
      - (1) novice laparoscopists/novice roboticists, (2) expert laparoscopists/novice roboticists,&#xD;
      and (3) expert laparoscopsts/expert roboticists. Subjects will perform the following tasks&#xD;
      (chosen based on their reliability and validity in previous studies). Each task will be&#xD;
      performed with standard laparoscopic instrumentation and with the da Vinci Surgical System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inanimate (dry lab): Fundamentals of Laparoscopic (FLS) peg transfer, pattern cutting,&#xD;
           intracorporeal suturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Animate (porcine lab): laparoscopic bowel resection and anastomosis, robotic bowel&#xD;
           resection and anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human (clinical case): any laparoscopic or robotic procedure (preferably laparoscopic&#xD;
           bowel resection and anastomosis, robotic bowel resection and anastomosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to completion of tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EMG: peak amplitudes, % maximum voluntary contraction and frequency analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NASA Task Load Index scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject-Reported Qualitative Data from surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality analysis of tasks (e.g., pattern cutting accuracy, % knots tied securely) for&#xD;
           dry lab and animate lab tasks only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instrument motion analysis of tasks (for dry lab and animate lab tasks only)&#xD;

      Under an IRB-approved protocol, medical students, residents, fellows, and attending surgeons&#xD;
      of the Department of Surgery and the Department of Obstetrics-Gynecology of Washington&#xD;
      University School of Medicine who respond to the email or mailed letter invitation for&#xD;
      recruitment will be screened by the Principal Investigator or one of the approved study&#xD;
      members listed on the IRB protocol for inclusion and exclusion criteria using the following 5&#xD;
      screening questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is your date of birth?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are you a medical student, a resident, a fellow, or an attending surgeon in general&#xD;
           surgery, urology, or obstetrics-gynecology?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Approximately how many laparoscopic surgeries have you performed as primary surgeon or&#xD;
           first assistant surgeon during your career?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Approximately how many robotic surgeries have you performed as primary surgeon or first&#xD;
           assistant surgeon during your career?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Do you have any known severe skin sensitivities or allergies to adhesives?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those subjects who meet the inclusion criteria yet who are not disqualified by the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be prospectively enrolled by an informed consent process into one of the three&#xD;
      experimental groups of the study, defined by the subject's degrees of expertise in Minimally&#xD;
      Invasive Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. age&gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. medical student, resident, fellow, or attending in Surgery, Urology, or&#xD;
           Obstetrics-Gynecology at Washington University School of Medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inclusion in Novice Laparoscopist/Novice Roboticist Group: performance of &lt;100&#xD;
           laparoscopic cases and &lt;50 robotic cases as primary surgeon or first assistant surgeon&#xD;
           during one's career&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inclusion in Expert Laparoscopist/Novice Roboticist Group: performance of = or &gt;100&#xD;
           laparoscopic cases and &lt;50 robotic cases as primary surgeon or first assistant surgeon&#xD;
           during one's career&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Inclusion in Expert Laparoscopist/Expert Roboticist Group: performance of = or &gt;100&#xD;
           laparoscopic cases and = or &gt;50 robotic cases as primary surgeon or first assistant&#xD;
           surgeon during one's career&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. known severe skin sensitivities or allergies to adhesives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, recruitment, and informed consent processes may be conducted by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator or any of the approved study members listed on the IRB protocol. To eliminate&#xD;
      any potential for conflict of interest, recruitment and consent of medical students and&#xD;
      residents for this study will be performed by a study investigator who does not have a&#xD;
      supervisory role to medical students and residents, and not the Principal Investigator. To&#xD;
      ensure that each subject is adequately informed of the study, the informed consent process&#xD;
      will include but not be limited to discussion of the research procedures; anticipated&#xD;
      frequency and types of participant interactions; length of the study period; potential risks&#xD;
      and benefits to the participant; practices to protect the privacy and confidentiality of&#xD;
      participants; the alternative to not participate in the clinical study; and means by which to&#xD;
      ask questions, report concerns, or withdraw from the study at any time. Each subject will be&#xD;
      informed that his decision to participate or not participate in the study does not in any way&#xD;
      impact the health care decisions of his health care providers, or the clinical or academic&#xD;
      performance evaluations of his evaluators. This information will also be included in the&#xD;
      &quot;Informed Consent Document&quot; and the &quot;Notice of Privacy Practices&quot;, and the content of these&#xD;
      documents will be reviewed with each subject at the time of the informed consent discussion.&#xD;
      Each subject will have the opportunity to review these documents at his leisure both before&#xD;
      and after his decision to participate in the study, and each subject will receive at the time&#xD;
      of the informed consent discussion a signed copy of the &quot;Informed Consent Document&quot; and the&#xD;
      &quot;Notice of Privacy Practices&quot; to keep for his personal records. Each subject will be enrolled&#xD;
      by informed consent discussion in a private environment to facilitate subject comfort in&#xD;
      discussing details of the study and asking questions. During each subject enrollment attempt,&#xD;
      the opportunity will be provided for the subject to meet individually with the approved study&#xD;
      member listed on the IRB protocol to address private questions or concerns. Private&#xD;
      environments may include a private office, a private conference room, or a private laboratory&#xD;
      room. The subject will be able to discuss the study with family, friends, and/or others&#xD;
      before deciding on participation. The subject will have until the end of the study enrollment&#xD;
      period to consider study participation. Each subject who does not respond to the invitation&#xD;
      to participate in the study at the time of the informed consent discussion will receive a&#xD;
      copy of the &quot;Informed Consent Document&quot; and the &quot;Notice of Privacy Practices&quot; signed by the&#xD;
      approved study member listed on the IRB protocol with whom informed consent was discussed,&#xD;
      and a stamped envelope addressed to the Principal Investigator in the event that the subject&#xD;
      wishes to consent to the study at a later time within the enrollment period. There will not&#xD;
      be any follow-up contact regarding the study with subjects who do not wish to respond to the&#xD;
      invitation to participate in the study. Capacity to consent for all subjects to be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study will be determined by the approved study member listed on the IRB protocol&#xD;
      conducting the informed consent. Capacity to consent will be assessed in a variety of ways&#xD;
      such as explaining the study to the subject and then asking him to answer basic questions&#xD;
      about the study procedures, risks and benefits, options for skipping questions, or how to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study. The document entitled &quot;Evaluation to Sign an Informed Consent&quot;&#xD;
      provided by the IRB may be a resource used to assist with this assessment. If at any time the&#xD;
      approved study member listed on the IRB protocol has reason to believe that the subject is&#xD;
      incompetent or incapacitated to make decisions for himself, the consent process will be&#xD;
      aborted, and the subject will not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
