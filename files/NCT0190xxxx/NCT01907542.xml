    <textblock>
      Background Stapled skin closure is frequently performed following open colectomies. However,&#xD;
      its pain and cosmetic outcomes have been suboptimal. Monocryl sutured skin closure has been&#xD;
      shown to be cosmetically superior and does not require removal of the sutures. But its&#xD;
      association with wound infection has been questioned Aims This study aims to compare the&#xD;
      outcomes using skin stapler or Monocryl suture in the skin closure following open colectomy.&#xD;
      Hypotheses We believe Monocryl suture is associated with reduced pain and better cosmesis.&#xD;
      Methodology Inclusion criteria: All patients who underwent elective open colectomy for&#xD;
      various etiologies Exclusion criteria: i) Emergency laparotomies ii) Patient who require the&#xD;
      creation of a stoma After consenting for the trial, patients will be randomized into either&#xD;
      the skin stapler or the Monocryl suture group. Randomization is performed using a computer&#xD;
      model. To minimize confounders, the pre-operative preparation and antibiotics regime will be&#xD;
      standardized. The closure of the fascia and the skin will also be performed by at least a&#xD;
      Registrar. The wounds will then be covered with a thick sterile dressing to blind the patient&#xD;
      and the research assistant. The wound will only be reviewed on the POD 3. The patient is&#xD;
      scheduled to return on POD 14, POD 30, 3 and 6 months post operatively upon discharge. Some&#xD;
      of the variables that will be collected for this study include: 1. Time taken for skin&#xD;
      closure 2. Superficial surgical site infection 3. Pain score 4. Cosmesis We aim to enrol 72&#xD;
      participants in each group. Importance/Impact to Medicine This study will validate the role&#xD;
      of Monocryl suture as an effective method for skin closure following open colectomy. We&#xD;
      believe Monocryl sutured closure can potentially change the practice of surgeons worldwide&#xD;
      for the benefits of the patients.&#xD;

      Methodology All consecutive patients who are scheduled to undergo elective open laparotomy&#xD;
      for colecotomies for cancer/diverticular disease would be invited to participate in the study&#xD;
      through written consent. These patients would be randomized into 2 arms, stapler skin closure&#xD;
      (n= 72) and continuous absorbable skin closure (n= 72). Patients involved in the study would&#xD;
      have their skin closure done by an adequately trained surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients having a preoperative diagnosis requiring abdominal surgery through a single&#xD;
           incision, open laparotomy technique, determined preoperatively by the attending surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age 21 and above, able to understand the information regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Agreeable for randomization and signed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All elective open colonic resections above the level of the peritoneal reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with known allergy to products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pregnant women or breast-feeding mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No signed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who undergo a Low Anterior Resection or with distal resection margins lower&#xD;
           than mid rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients who require a stoma to be fashioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with previous midline laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization If a patient fulfils the selection criteria above, the surgical team must&#xD;
      explain the nature of the study and provide the patient with a Patient Information Sheet and&#xD;
      Consent Form. The patient must sign both the Patient Information Sheet and Consent Form. A&#xD;
      copy of the Patient Information Sheet is to be given to the patient and both signed copies of&#xD;
      the Patient Information Sheet and Consent Form must be returned to the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      for filing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is performed using a computer model generator and the skin closure technique&#xD;
      would be eluded to the surgeons at time of closure. The operating surgeon would contact the&#xD;
      designated research assistant who will reveal the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative preparation All patients participating in this trial would have to comply to be&#xD;
      kept Nil By Mouth from 12midnight the day before surgery. Bowel preparation as per preference&#xD;
      by the individual surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of Wound Closure Instruments and products required for both techniques of closure&#xD;
      should be prepared by the operating theatre nurses prior to the operation. The stapling&#xD;
      device used would be PROXIMATE PLUS MD Skin Staple速. Absorbable 4-0 Monocryl速 with 1/2-circle&#xD;
      curved needle sutures would be used for the skin closure. Both products are from Ethicon,&#xD;
      Johnson &amp; Johnson and routinely used for this hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery should be performed in this consistent manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prophylactic antibiotics will be given to all patients as per hospital protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clean and draped with chlorhexidine and Povidone&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Manner of skin incision, dissection, entry into the abdominal cavity and ensuing&#xD;
           procedure of the abdominal surgery are left to the operating surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Peritoneal cavity to be irrigated with warm water prior to closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Abdominal fascia is to be closed using mass closure technique with continuous 1-0 PDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The wound with closed fascia must then be lavaged adequately with chlorhexidine&#xD;
           solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. According to randomization skin closure is then performed using either skin staples or&#xD;
           Monocryl速 in the following way:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. For staple skin closure, staples should be placed 1.0cm apart apposing the entire&#xD;
                length of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. For continuous absorbable suture skin closure, 4-0 Monocryl速 should be used, with&#xD;
                an initial anchor stitch. Subsequently stitches should be made within the dermis&#xD;
                layer of the skin, not catching any subcutaenous fat during the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. local anaethesia will be used after the completion of closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both techniques, complete apposition throughout the entire length of the wound should be&#xD;
      achieved, checked by the registrar and another assistant. No drain can be placed in the&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat layer of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time for wound closure is defined as the time the stapler or stitch contacts the patient's&#xD;
      skin till the time the last staple is fired or the final cut is made for the suture&#xD;
      technique. Time for wound closure will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical wounds would then be dressed with a Opsite dressing and then masked with 2&#xD;
      layers of sterile gauze adequately covering the entire length of the wound until POD 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should receive PCA morphine for post operative analgesia. additional oral&#xD;
      paracetamol can be administered if PCA morphine does not adequately control pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Assessment The post-operative assessment of the wound will be carried out by&#xD;
      an independent assessor, single trained wound nurse, according to the data entry form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This dressing would not be removed till POD3 for wound inspection and the dressing should be&#xD;
      changed by the ward nurses immediately with the same type of dressing before the patient can&#xD;
      view the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staples would be removed on POD10-14 if uncomplicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any participant in the study cohort were to require any form of re-operation within the&#xD;
      study period, he/she would be excluded from the analysis to minimise confounders for the&#xD;
      study's outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound assessment includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Superficial Surgical Site Infection (SSI) (within POD30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rates of wound dehiscence (within POD30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Need for re-intervention due to Superficial SSI/dehiscence (within POD30, within 6/12&#xD;
           post-op)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Amount and duration of (opoid) analgesia required&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Visual analog scale (POD1, 3, 14, 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. SF-8 4 week recall questionaire (POD 30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Comesis a. Patient scar assessment scale (POD14, POD30, 3/12, 6/12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment would be conducted in a double blinded manner on POD1 and 3 where both the&#xD;
      assessor (research assistant) and the patient would not know the patient's allocation. After&#xD;
      the staples are removed on POD10 and wound dressing removed on POD3, patients would know of&#xD;
      their allocation while the assessor would still not be, thus, the pain assessment on POD14&#xD;
      and POD 30 would be single blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superficial SSI shall be defined as infection occuring within 30 days after the operation and&#xD;
      infection involves only skin or subcutaneous tissue of the incision and at least one of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial&#xD;
           incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the&#xD;
           superficial incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or tenderness,&#xD;
           localized swelling, redness, or heat and superficial incision is deliberately opened by&#xD;
           surgeon, unless incision is culture-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon discharge, the study participant is scheduled to return for at least two visits - the&#xD;
      first visit at POD 14, POD 30, 3 months and 6 months post operatively. The patient's wound&#xD;
      will be assessed by the same independent assessor at each visit.&#xD;
