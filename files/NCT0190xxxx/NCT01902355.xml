      The purpose of this study is to compare two needle insertion techniques(Seldinger vs.&#xD;
      modified Seldinger technique) on success rate and complications during central venous&#xD;
      catheterization.&#xD;

      Unintended arterial puncture and local hematoma formation are the most common complications&#xD;
      during internal jugular vein central venous catheterization. Other serious complications like&#xD;
      pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, arterial dissection, thrombosis, embolism are also&#xD;
      possible. These complications mostly occur by mechanical trauma or injury when advancing&#xD;
      needle back and forth to puncture internal jugular vein. Placement of guidewire or dilator&#xD;
      can also cause mechanical trauma or injury around the vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because internal jugular vein collapses easily during needle advance, anterior and posterior&#xD;
      wall of the vessel can be punctured simultaneously. Posterior wall puncture can increase the&#xD;
      risk of complications of the catheterization. Delicate puncture of the vessel and stable&#xD;
      fixation of the needle after puncture are important to reduce overall number of&#xD;
      catheterization attempts, increase success rate, reduce complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seldinger technique(thin-wall needle technique) is commonly used procedure to obtain safe&#xD;
      access to central vein. The desired vessel is punctured with a sharp hollow needle, syringe&#xD;
      is detached and guidewire is advanced through the lumen of the needle, and then the needle is&#xD;
      withdrawn. Central catheter is then passed over the guidewire into the vessel. Contrarily,&#xD;
      modified Seldinger technique(guiding sheath-over-the-needle technique) use needle that is&#xD;
      covered with guiding sheath. After desired vessel puncture, guiding sheath is instantly slid&#xD;
      over the needle into the vessel. The needle is withdrawn, guidewire is advanced through the&#xD;
      guiding sheath, central catheter is placed into the vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When using Seldinger technique, it is important to fix the needle firmly with hand until the&#xD;
      guidewire is placed into the vessel lumen. If hand fixation is not stable, needle tip can&#xD;
      migrate from the lumen, can pierce the vessel wall, and carotid artery puncture, and local&#xD;
      hematoma formation might occur. Even if there is no evidence of complications, when blood&#xD;
      regurgitation fails, overall number of vessel puncture attempts would increase and it is&#xD;
      expected that rate of complications of the catheterization would increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When using modified Seldinger technique, guiding sheath is easily slid over the needle,&#xD;
      providing stable route into the vessel lumen relatively in early step of the catheterization.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is expected that stability of the fixation improves, success rate of the&#xD;
      catheterization increase, and complications of the catheterization decrease. But there is no&#xD;
      high level of evidence yet, and still decision to use which technique is based on experience&#xD;
      of the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are going to compare the Seldinger technique and modified Seldinger technique&#xD;
      on success rate and complications during central venous catheterization by prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled study.&#xD;
