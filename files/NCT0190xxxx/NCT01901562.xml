    <textblock>
      In this prospective clinical trial, patients who sign an approved informed consent for&#xD;
      ductoscopy to assess etiology of Pathologic nipple discharge (PND) will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Consented patients who have been diagnosed with a solitary papilloma within the&#xD;
      discharging duct will be recruited to have interventional ductoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are identified ductoscopically with a solitary non-sessile papilloma will&#xD;
      undergo an attempted ductoscopic papillomectomy (DP). Patients with ductoscopic findings&#xD;
      other than single non-sessile papilloma will undergo standard ductoscopically guided&#xD;
      microductectomy. The investigators will investigate whether the ductoscopic basket can be&#xD;
      used as a safe endoscopic extraction instrument without adverse events. Histopathological&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed to confirm the ductoscopic diagnosis and to determine the&#xD;
      existence of any malignant tissue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nipple discharge is the third most common breast related symptom for which women seek medical&#xD;
      care, accounting for 37% of all breast complaints. Pathologic nipple discharge (PND) is&#xD;
      defined as spontaneous or easily expressible single duct nipple discharge, which contributes&#xD;
      to 5% of referrals to breast surgeons. Patients with PND represent a diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic challenge for the surgical clinician. The most frequent causes of PND in these&#xD;
      cases are intraductal papilloma (IP) in 36% to 66%, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 3% to&#xD;
      20% and other benign causes in up to 23%. The evaluation of women with PND usually involves&#xD;
      radiological(mammography, ultrasound, ducto (galacto)graphy and cytological (nipple smear,&#xD;
      ductal lavage) examinations; however, each of these procedures has found to have low&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity. A ductoscope is an instrument which allows visualization of&#xD;
      abnormalities and polypoid lesions within the ductal system with access via the nipple&#xD;
      orifice to aid in evaluation of PND. Moreover, it is currently being used to improve&#xD;
      localization of lesions in patients with PND. Ductoscopically guided excision is an&#xD;
      improvement over standard surgical approaches with terminal duct excision which removes a&#xD;
      large volume of tissue with potential cosmetic deformity and for young women may make breast&#xD;
      feeding not possible. Ductoscopy also allows retrieval of intraductal cells for diagnostic&#xD;
      purposes using brush cytology.&#xD;
