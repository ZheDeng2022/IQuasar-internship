    <textblock>
      background: The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) presents many disturbances multidimensional&#xD;
      affect holistically to people who have the disease and current management of fatigue, pain,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances present in this clinical entity is unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this essay is to contrast that acupuncture is more useful than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suggest the use of a clinical study protocol (PEC), randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, acupuncture technique, aimed at increasing the patient's sense of&#xD;
      well-being, relief of pain and stiffness, acupuncture is effective to reduce fatigue,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and sleep disorders in patients diagnosed with CFS.&#xD;

      Headline Goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effectiveness of true acupuncture (AV) compared to placebo-acupuncture or sham&#xD;
      acupuncture (AS) in improving symptoms of patients diagnosed with CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether, in patients diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, AV treatment,&#xD;
           compared to AS, is associated with a reduction in fatigue as measured by the scale FIS&#xD;
           (Fatigue impact Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check the reduction of pain in patients diagnosed with CFS, following treatment with AS&#xD;
           versus AV as measured by the McGill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify the decrease in the use of analgesics in patients diagnosed with CFS, after&#xD;
           treatment with the AV versus AS, by counting these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate reducing anxiety in patients diagnosed with CFS, following treatment with AS AV&#xD;
           against measured by HAD scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether, in patients diagnosed with CFS, treatment with AV compared to AS, is&#xD;
           associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured by the HAD scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the improvement in sleep quality in patients diagnosed with CFS, after&#xD;
           treatment with AV compared to the AS, as measured by the Pittsburgh scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check the quality improvement of health-related life (HRQOL) in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
           CFS, after treatment with AV compared to the AS, as measured by the SF-36 (Short&#xD;
           Form-36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot clinical trial randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled simulated acupuncture,&#xD;
      single-center, prospective, patient and assessor blind. 1:1 randomized trial, the principal&#xD;
      investigator unknown randomization to the time the patient is randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint. Scores on the fatigue impact scale (FIS) after treatment with two&#xD;
      acupuncture techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and total number of patients. After signing the informed consent, we&#xD;
      included 60 patients diagnosed with CFS, 30 in the intervention group (IG) of real&#xD;
      acupuncture and 30 in the control group (CG) of sham acupuncture, applying an individualized&#xD;
      treatment plan customized according energy assessment of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment. 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study can demonstrate the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for the&#xD;
      symptoms of CFS. The reduction in fatigue, anxiety, depression, pain and reduction in the&#xD;
      intake of analgesics with improved sleep quality, after treatment with real acupuncture&#xD;
      technique, i results in increased quality of life for the patient suffering from CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>That through the center of the guide tube is inserted blunt rod, producing the sensation of a prick in each of the eight points that are not acupuncture points. No intervention is a completely inert as it involves some type of peripheral stimulus, but the technique is closer to a placebo and offers interesting option from a methodologic al point of view showing and ability to mimic real acupuncture The points are not used acupuncture points but are fictional points. The patient should remáis lying prone during the 20 minutes of the session, so the placebo technique remains hidden. Every five minutes the acupuncturist will repeat the action in the corresponding eigh points.</description>
