    <textblock>
      Sleep disorder is a common problem in menopausal women and the decrease in the sleep leads to&#xD;
      poor daily activity. Traditional Chinese acupressure is a noninvasive, effective and safe&#xD;
      technique that can be easily taught to menopausal women so that they apply it as a self-care&#xD;
      method and a manager of sleep disruption. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality of postmenopausal women.This double blind&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial was performed on 120 qualified menopausal women at the age of 41-65&#xD;
      years; and sleep quality was measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI&#xD;
      ).Participants were randomly assigned to an acupressure group, a sham acupressure group and a&#xD;
      control group by two time randomized method (systematic and simple randomized). These&#xD;
      interventions were carried out for 4 consecutive weeks. Participants in acupressure group and&#xD;
      sham acupressure group learned to carry out acupressure technique as a self care at home with&#xD;
      the simultaneous massage techniques that were to be performed 2 hours before sleep, whereas&#xD;
      only conversation was used in the control group. The statistical software package for social&#xD;
      science (SPSS) Version 17 was used for data analysis.&#xD;
