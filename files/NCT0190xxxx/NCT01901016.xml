  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and autogenic training (AT) are effective relaxation&#xD;
      techniques to reduce depressive symptoms. However, no studies on their effectiveness have&#xD;
      been conducted among people living with HIV and depressive symptoms. The primary aim of this&#xD;
      pilot study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of PMR and AT interventions among&#xD;
      people living with HIV who have depressive symptoms. A secondary aim was to assess the&#xD;
      potential effectiveness of these interventions on depressive symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

      This study was a three-arm pilot randomized control trial with mixed methods. Participants&#xD;
      were randomized to PMR, AT, or control group (CG), with four assessments (baseline, one-,&#xD;
      three-, and six-month). The PMR and AT interventions consisted of six one-hour sessions of&#xD;
      individual training over 12 weeks and home practice. Recruitment, attrition, and completion&#xD;
      rates were calculated. Depressive symptoms and quality of life were assessed at all times.&#xD;
      Participants' perceptions of the interventions were collected in semi-structured interviews.&#xD;

    <description>PMR involves learning to identify the tension in specific muscle groups by tightening and relaxing each muscle group. It includes three different exercises: 1) contraction-relaxation of 12 large muscle groups in the arms, legs, and trunk; 2) identification and relaxation of tensions without the need for movement or contractions; and 3) contraction-relaxation of 12 small muscle groups in the neck, eyes, and mouth</description>

    <description>AT is a relaxation technique that is based on body attitude, reduction of exterior stimulation, inner concentration, and mental repetition of verbal formulas [28]. These formulas are organized into six exercises: 1) heaviness; 2) warmth; 3) calm and regular heart function; 4) self-regulation of respiration; 5) warmth in the upper abdominal area; and 6) agreeable cooling of the forehead.</description>
