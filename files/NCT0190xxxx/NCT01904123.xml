    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 in&#xD;
      treating patients with malignant glioma that has come back or melanoma that has spread to the&#xD;
      brain and is growing, spreading, or getting worse. STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells and modulate the immune system.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. Identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STAT3 inhibitor WP1066&#xD;
      (WP1066) in patients with recurrent malignant glioma (glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma), and&#xD;
      melanoma patients with progressive brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the safety and tolerability of WP1066 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma&#xD;
      and melanoma patients with progressive brain metastasis using the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) with special attention directed at determining whether&#xD;
      any induced autoimmune reactions occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the in vivo bioavailability of WP1066. II. Assess overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas and progressive metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess immunological response in patients with recurrent malignant glioma and melanoma&#xD;
      patients with progressive brain metastasis treated with WP1066.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess time to radiographically assessed progression and/or response in patients treated&#xD;
      with WP1066.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with&#xD;
      WP1066.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Estimate the proportion of patients treated with WP1066 who develop additional melanoma&#xD;
      metastatic lesions, including those in the central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on Monday, Wednesday,&#xD;
      and Friday of weeks 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed progressive brain metastases from melanoma&#xD;
             or recurrent/progressive malignant glioma (glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma), for which&#xD;
             standard curative or palliative measures, with the exception of surgery, do not exist&#xD;
             or are no longer effective&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease in the brain, defined as at least one lesion&#xD;
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as &gt;= 10 mm by brain&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); MRI of the brain (with and without gadolinium&#xD;
             enhancement) is to be performed using standard 5-mm slices with 2.5-mm spacing for&#xD;
             comparison to subsequent MRI scans&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the case of malignant glioma patients, they must have previously undergone&#xD;
             standard-of-care treatment including surgery, radiation, and first line adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy prior to the experimental treatment (WP1066); in the case of melanoma&#xD;
             patients with brain metastasis, they may have previously undergone a resection (with&#xD;
             radiographic evidence of progression), have undergone gamma knife radiosurgery (with&#xD;
             radiographic evidence of progression), or have been treated with other systemic&#xD;
             therapies that failed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance scale score &gt;= 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 x normal institutional&#xD;
             standard&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Melanoma patients must be intolerant of, or have disease that has proven refractory to&#xD;
             approved therapies such as BRAF or MEK inhibitors for BRAF-positive metastatic&#xD;
             melanoma and/or checkpoint blockade with either anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA-4 for metastatic&#xD;
             melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to tolerate brain MRI's with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with stable seizures (e.g., no seizures for &gt;= 14 days and not requiring&#xD;
             escalation or addition of anti-epileptic drugs for 14 days from starting treatment)&#xD;
             will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are eligible for the surgical expansion cohort are identified by the&#xD;
             clinical team who have made the independent decision that the patient would benefit&#xD;
             from non-emergent palliative surgical resection (i.e. they are not a candidate for&#xD;
             gamma knife or other type of standard therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; biological agents, immune&#xD;
             modulators, and targeted therapeutic approaches require a 2-week washout window&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents require a 4 week washout&#xD;
             period; patients who have received cellular or gene therapy at any time are not&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to WP1066&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The enzymatic metabolism profile of WP1066 is unknown; patients who are receiving&#xD;
             drugs that significantly interact with the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme(s) are&#xD;
             ineligible; however, if they are switched to other medications with a 2-week washout&#xD;
             window, they will be eligible; patients are also excluded if they have been exposed&#xD;
             within 7 days of planned first study treatment day to medications that are&#xD;
             predominantly cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6),&#xD;
             cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (2C9) or cytochrome P450, family&#xD;
             2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (2C19) substrates, strong inhibitors or inducers, and&#xD;
             sensitive substrates of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)&#xD;
             with narrow therapeutic range; patients requiring escalation of the corticosteroid&#xD;
             dose will be excluded, but patients receiving a stable or decreasing dose for at least&#xD;
             one week will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No single lesion can be larger than 3 cm in maximal diameter; there may not be midline&#xD;
             shift exceeding 5 mm or hydrocephalus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because WP1066 could potentially be&#xD;
             teratogenic or have abortifacient effects; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with WP0166; female subjects of childbearing potential should be&#xD;
             willing to use 2 methods of birth control prior to study entry, during the study, and&#xD;
             for 2 months after the last dose of the study drug or be surgically sterile; subjects&#xD;
             of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have&#xD;
             not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she&#xD;
             is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of WP1066 administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with WP1066&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received bevacizumab, Gliadel, or are on active therapy with Optune&#xD;
             are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The potential for further hemorrhaging with the use of WP1066 is unknown; furthermore,&#xD;
             because brain melanoma metastases commonly hemorrhage, toxicity may be inappropriately&#xD;
             attributed to WP1066 in this setting; it will be at the principal investigator's (PIs)&#xD;
             discretion to enroll a patient who has a small, asymptomatic brain hemorrhage, but&#xD;
             patients who have had symptomatic hemorrhages will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures or seizure requiring escalation or addition of&#xD;
             anti-epileptic drugs will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because one of the secondary objectives is PFS based on radiographic volumetric&#xD;
             analysis of the tumor, the presence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease will be an&#xD;
             exclusion criterion for this study; this is secondary to the inadequacy of measuring&#xD;
             the extent of the tumor burden within this setting and the very poor prognosis of&#xD;
             these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cardiac toxicities of WP1066 are unknown; thus, patients who have a corrected QT&#xD;
             (QTc) interval &gt; 450 ms at base line will be excluded; concomitant use of agents that&#xD;
             prolong the QT interval will be avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant glioma patients within 12 weeks of completion of radiation concurrent&#xD;
             temozolomide will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Melanoma patients with large or symptomatic brain metastasis, and in whom&#xD;
             neurosurgical removal is indicated will not be eligible for this trial&#xD;
