  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer, especially at advanced metastatic stage, is a devastating disease. It is&#xD;
      the fourth leading cause of cancer death. Its prognosis is grim - 5-year survival rate being&#xD;
      6%. The current therapies for advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer are very toxic and with&#xD;
      limited efficacy. A safer and more effective therapy for this devastating disease is greatly&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-FLIP regimen is a combination of low doses (doses lower than those approved by the FDA and&#xD;
      used in the clinic) of several anti-cancer drugs, Gemcitabine, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin,&#xD;
      Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin. The efficacy of G-FLIP against cancers (especially pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer) is based on laboratory and clinical results, which indicates the synergistic efficacy&#xD;
      of these anti-cancer drugs against cancer cells and overcoming tumor drug resistance that&#xD;
      cancer cells frequently develop. Also, because of their low doses, this regimen is less toxic&#xD;
      than when these drugs are used alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, intravenous infusion of high doses (doses significantly higher than the daily&#xD;
      nutritional requirements) of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has been observed to have anti-cancer&#xD;
      activities. This is especially true when Vitamin C is used in combination with other&#xD;
      anti-cancer drugs.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of G-FLIP&#xD;
      (Low Doses of Gemcitabine, Fluorouracil [5FU], Leucovorin, Irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin), when&#xD;
      used in combination with ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), as first-line therapy in patients with&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer. The objective of this study is also to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of G-FLIP-DM (G-FLIP + Low Doses of Docetaxel and Mitomycin C),&#xD;
      when used in combination with ascorbic acid, in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who&#xD;
      develop Disease Progression (DP) with G-FLIP treatment. The primary endpoint is 12-month&#xD;
      survival rate. The secondary endpoints include Overall Survival (OS), Quality of Life (QOL),&#xD;
      Response Rate (RR), Progression-Free-Survival (PFS), and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DRUGS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drugs include G-FLIP, G-FLIP-DM, and Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 30 &quot;evaluable&quot; study subjects in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-FLIP: All study subjects are treated with G-FLIP. Each treatment cycle of G-FLIP is 2&#xD;
      weeks, with G-FLIP given on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. If study subjects exhibit Disease&#xD;
      Progression (DP), treatment with G-FLIP will stop, and they will be treated with G-FLIP-DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-FLIP-DM: Study subjects who exhibit DP with G-FLIP treatment will be treated with&#xD;
      G-FLIP-DM. Each G-FLIP-DM treatment cycle is 2 weeks, with G-FLIP-DM given on Days 1 and 2 of&#xD;
      each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascorbic Acid: Ascorbic acid will be administered twice weekly throughout the study, given on&#xD;
      any 2 separate days of the week. Ascorbic acid will be administered throughout the study&#xD;
      including during the follow-up period, even if treatment with G-FLIP or G-FLIP-DM has been&#xD;
      terminated due to DP. Additionally, in 50% of the study subjects (i.e., 15 evaluable study&#xD;
      subjects), treatment with ascorbic acid will begin on the same week when G-FLIP begins. In&#xD;
      the other 50% of the study subjects (i.e., the other 15 evaluable study subjects), treatment&#xD;
      with ascorbic acid will be delayed by 2 cycles. Results from these 2 groups of study subjects&#xD;
      would allow comparison of potential acute safety of ascorbic acid, when used in combination&#xD;
      with G-FLIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-Label: This is an open-label study, where investigators and study subjects are not&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The assignment of study subjects will be randomized, as long as they meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE DELAY AND DOSE MODIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of adverse drug reactions, dose delay and dose modification will be dependent on&#xD;
      the type of toxicities. The detailed dose modification scheme for G-FLIP, G-FLIP-DM and&#xD;
      Ascorbic Acid are outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other than G-FLIP, G-FLIP-DM and ascorbic acid, patients cannot receive any other standard or&#xD;
      investigational treatment for their cancer, or any study drugs for any non-cancer&#xD;
      indications, while on this study. All concomitant medications (including names, dosage and&#xD;
      schedule) must be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic treatment for drug-related symptoms can be given according to Package Inserts of&#xD;
      the study drugs and clinical practice. Supportive treatment may include anti-emetic,&#xD;
      anti-diarrhea, anti-pyretic, anti-allergic, anti-hypertensive, analgesics, antibiotics,&#xD;
      allopurinol, and others such as blood products and bone marrow growth factors. Patients may&#xD;
      use erythropoietin for anemia. The investigator may utilize erythropoietic factors, or blood&#xD;
      or platelet transfusions at their discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least six months of treatment is recommended for study subjects who have a response from&#xD;
      G-FLIP or G-FLIP-DM, unless or until:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients exhibit disease progression in the opinion of the principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable toxicity from the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient withdrawal of consent (Note: The investigator should make every effort to&#xD;
           contact the subject to perform a final evaluation and to determine the reason(s) for&#xD;
           withdrawal from the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator's discretion to withdraw patients from the study because continued&#xD;
           participation in the study is not in the patient's best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Underlying illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the intended disease&#xD;
           which the study is investigating, that renders continuing treatment unsafe or regular&#xD;
           follow-up impossible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition that renders the patient&#xD;
           ineligible for further investigational treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-compliance with investigational treatment, protocol-required evaluations or&#xD;
           follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, study subjects should be followed so that information on survival and post&#xD;
      study treatment are available for at least 1 year after the study subjects participate in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the study drugs will be assessed according to the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response Criteria of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and&#xD;
      Progressive Disease (Disease Progression or DP) will be derived from CT or MRI according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) (Eisenhauer et al. 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response Rate (RR) is the number of study subjects, expressed as a percentage of the total&#xD;
      number of study subjects participated in the trial, who exhibit PR or CR that has been&#xD;
      confirmed from 2 consecutive scans (CT or MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) is the length of time when SD (or better) of a study subject&#xD;
      is first documented until the time when DP, or death from any cause, occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Survival (OStreatment) is the time from which the study subjects are first treated&#xD;
      with G-FLIP to the time when death from any cause occurs. OS, which is the time from which&#xD;
      the study subjects are first diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer to the time when death&#xD;
      from any cause occurs, will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-Month Survival Rate is the number of study subjects, expressed as a percentage of the&#xD;
      total number of study subjects in the trial, who survive for 12 months starting from the time&#xD;
      when the study subjects are accrued to the trial. The 12-Month Survival Rate for study&#xD;
      subjects who survive for 12 months starting from the time when the study subjects are first&#xD;
      diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the study drugs will be assessed from the first dose to 1 month after last&#xD;
      dose of the study drugs. The assessments will be based on the following parameters, performed&#xD;
      at baselines and at various times during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status and survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, renal function [assessed utilizing the&#xD;
           Cockcroft-Gault formula], hematology, and coagulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QOL, assessed as described by Aaronson NK, et al. 1993.&#xD;
