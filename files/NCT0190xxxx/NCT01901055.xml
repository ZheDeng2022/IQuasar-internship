  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes self-management is important to help adults with type 2 diabetes achieve glucose&#xD;
      control. Obstructive sleep apnea often co-exists with type 2 diabetes and may act as a&#xD;
      barrier to diabetes self-management and glucose control. We will examine if treatment of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), combined with&#xD;
      diabetes education, results in improved diabetes self-management and glucose control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While diabetes self-management has been improved and refined over the last 30 years, many&#xD;
      persons with T2DM continue to have difficulty in achieving glycemic goals. Obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA) has a high prevalence among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and is associated&#xD;
      with excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired mood, decreased vigilance, and reduced functional&#xD;
      outcomes. The degree that OSA affects diabetes self-management, a known determinant of&#xD;
      glycemic control, remains unstudied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most effective treatment for OSA, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), results in&#xD;
      improved self-reported daytime functioning. However, the effect of CPAP treatment on&#xD;
      reception of diabetes education remains unknown. The underlying premise of the proposed study&#xD;
      from this new investigator is that OSA hinders diabetes self-management in adults with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to improve understanding of the effect of OSA on diabetes self-management and to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of CPAP treatment in improving diabetes outcomes in adults treated&#xD;
      with CPAP compared to those on sham-CPAP. Expanding our understanding of the effect of sleep&#xD;
      disturbances on diabetes self-management may lead to improved guidelines for screening and&#xD;
      treatment of OSA in the increasingly large portion of the population with diabetes&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study did not reach 50% of the proposed sample size. Recruitment slow because persons not&#xD;
    interested in being randomized to a sham-control CPAP device or not CPAP naïve.&#xD;

The total sample screened (N=862) was from the University of Pittsburgh (n=720), Veterans Administration Pittsburgh Healthcare System (n=58), West Virginial University (n=72), and the John Dingell Detroit Veterans Administration Healthcare System (n=12).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Phone assessment excluded persons with prior CPAP use, not having diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, history of a sleepiness related accident or near miss, or not ambulatory.&#xD;
Participants (n=355) who met the phone screening were invited for a baseline assessment. The baseline assessment excluded persons with HbA1c either &lt; 6.5% or &gt; 11%; without OSA, with too high a AHI or severe oxygen desaturations, or not interested in being randomized to sham-CPAP. 98 participants meet all eligibility criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

CPAP: CPAP is a device that has a mask worn over the nose that is attached to a device that provides positive airway pressure. CPAP is worn while sleeping, it splints open the airway and prevent apneas (cessation of breathing) and hypopneas (reduced airflow while breathing).&#xD;
Diabetes Education: Diabetes Education will be delivered to participants in both the CPAP group and the Sham-CPAP group. The education will be based on ADA and AADE guidelines and consist of 2 in-person sessions (90 minutes and 60 minutes) and 3 follow-up phone calls 9about 15 minutes each)</description>

CPAP: CPAP is a device that has a mask worn over the nose that is attached to a device that provides positive airway pressure. CPAP is worn while sleeping, it splints open the airway and prevent apneas (cessation of breathing) and hypopneas (reduced airflow while breathing).&#xD;
Diabetes Education: Diabetes Education will be delivered to participants in both the CPAP group and the Sham-CPAP group. The education will be based on ADA and AADE guidelines and consist of 2 in-person sessions (90 minutes and 60 minutes) and 3 follow-up phone calls 9about 15 minutes each)</description>
