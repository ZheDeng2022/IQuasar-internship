      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - GATA2 deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause problems with a person s immune&#xD;
      system and other body systems. Some people who have this disorder develop few problems from&#xD;
      it. Others can have a wide range of health problems, from skin problems, to hearing loss, to&#xD;
      cancer. These problems can happen at any age. Researchers want to study GATA2 deficiency to&#xD;
      better understand what types of health problems it can cause, and why it causes problems in&#xD;
      some people but not others, and at different ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To improve understanding of GATA2 deficiency so there can be better diagnostic tests and&#xD;
      treatments in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People 2 years of age or older who have a GATA2 gene mutation or certain health conditions&#xD;
      that are commonly seen in people with this mutation and their blood relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected to see whether participants have the GATA2 genetic mutation.&#xD;
           Several other tests may be recommended, but participants can decline to take them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be eligible to receive standard care for GATA2 deficiency through this&#xD;
           protocol. They may be eligible for other clinical trials at the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular study visits once a year to evaluate their GATA2&#xD;
           deficiency. Participants will take part in the study for at least 3 years and up to 15&#xD;
           years. At these follow-up visits, participants will fill out a questionnaire and take a&#xD;
           physical exam and blood tests. Other tests may be performed as needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mutations in GATA2, a critical hematopoietic transcription factor, underlie a complex&#xD;
      congenital disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, bone marrow failure, and&#xD;
      lymphatic/vascular dysfunction. Patients with GATA2 deficiency may suffer from a striking&#xD;
      variety of diseases including severe and recurrent infections, myelodysplasia/leukemia,&#xD;
      pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, lymphedema, sensorineural hearing loss, and possibly&#xD;
      susceptibility to other malignancies, autoimmune disorders, thrombotic events, and&#xD;
      miscarriage. Mutations in GATA2 appear to be fully penetrant, but expressivity is remarkably&#xD;
      variable, even among related individuals. Disease may also manifest at nearly any age ranging&#xD;
      from early childhood to late adulthood, the reasons for which remain poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While considerable progress has been made towards better understanding this complex&#xD;
      congenital disorder, many important questions remain unanswered: What is the full spectrum of&#xD;
      clinical disease and the associated pathophysiology? What accounts for the remarkable&#xD;
      variability in age of onset and clinical phenotype? What are the optimal strategies for&#xD;
      disease diagnosis and management? This natural history protocol is designed to further&#xD;
      characterize the clinical phenotype of GATA2 deficiency, better understand the reasons for&#xD;
      phenotypic variability, better understand disease progression over time, standardize the&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluation, and facilitate the screening of at risk relatives. Up to 300 males and&#xD;
      females greater than or equal to 2 years old with proven mutations in GATA2 or clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory characteristics strongly consistent with GATA2 deficiency will initially undergo a&#xD;
      series of baseline laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures at the NIH. Follow-up&#xD;
      laboratory testing will be conducted at yearly visits for up to 15 years; additional&#xD;
      follow-up diagnostic procedures will be conducted based on clinical need.&#xD;
