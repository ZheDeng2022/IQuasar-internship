  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, patients with cancer pain in need of opioids for moderate to severe pain get&#xD;
      long-acting morphine twice a day and morphine tablets taken on demand in addition. This&#xD;
      procedure might be based on the assumption that cancer pain is persistent, although the&#xD;
      evidence to support whether this assumption applies to all cancer patients is lacking. Some&#xD;
      cancer patients might not need a fixed dose of long-acting morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of rapid pain relief, the new fentanyl drugs open for the possibility to take an&#xD;
      opioid on demand when pain occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study where 10 patients with cancer pain were treated with a rapid-acting fentanyl&#xD;
      nasal spray taken on demand, showed that this treatment was apparently feasible and safe for&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach is studied further in NFCP-II. The participants will be treated with&#xD;
      rapid-acting fentanyl nasal spray and long-acting morphine in a crossover study. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a test dose of nasal fentanyl, a dose-finding phase and a treatment&#xD;
      phase with either nasal fentanyl taken on demand or slow-released morphine taken twice a day.&#xD;
      After 10 days of treatment there is a crossover and the opposite drug is used for the same&#xD;
      participant. Morphine tablets can be taken on demand in all phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will meet the investigator at inclusion, at the crossover and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment. During the study, a diary is filled in by the participants every morning.&#xD;
      Questions about pain and side effects are answered. Satisfaction is measured at the crossover&#xD;
      and at end of treatment while preference is measured at the end of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Fentanyl for nasal administration (NF), is supplied as sprays containing a phosphate buffered solution of fentanyl citrate. NF is available in three strengths: 0.5 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml in multiple-dose sprays. The corresponding doses are 50, 100 and 200 µg/puff. NF is applied as one puff in one nostril. One puff defines and equals one dose. Applying a puff to each nostril the upper dose can be increased to 400 µg. The doses used in this study are 50, 100, 200 ad 400µg. Fentanyl may be administered for up to 6 pain episodes/ 24 hours. For each pain episode, a dose of NF is self-administrated in one nostril. If pain relief is not achieved, another dose of NF could be administered in the opposite nostril after 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>The active substance is released gradually during its transit through the gastrointestinal tract. Slow release (SR) morphine is available in 5, 10, 30, 60, 100 and 200 mg. SR morphine is administered twice a day, usually every twelfth hour.</description>
