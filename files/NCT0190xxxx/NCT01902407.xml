  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop a way of predicting with computers how&#xD;
      surgery on the airway will affect night time breathing called Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)&#xD;
      in children with Down Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research measurement for airway resistance will also be done during the clinical sleep MRI.&#xD;
      The airway resistance measurement will take about 10 minutes and is done during sleep. The&#xD;
      airway resistance measurement is called critical closing pressure (Pcrit).&#xD;

      This is a proof-of-concept study to determine if a dynamic computational model can be used to&#xD;
      predict surgical outcomes. If the results from the study are positive, they can be used to&#xD;
      help design a larger subsequent study. The purpose of this research is to develop a&#xD;
      computational model that simulates OSA and different surgical treatments for OSA in children&#xD;
      and young adults with DS. Thus, the only population that will be studied is children and&#xD;
      young adults with DS who have persistent OSA despite having previously undergone T&amp;A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs in 50-100% of patients with Down syndrome (DS) and can&#xD;
      significantly cause and exacerbate medical problems in these patients. Current surgical&#xD;
      management of children with DS is imperfect. There are variable surgical success rates for&#xD;
      both first line surgery of palatine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&amp;A) as well as&#xD;
      secondary surgeries performed if and when T&amp;A fails. There is a critical need for a&#xD;
      diagnostic modality that takes into account airway anatomy, tissue compliance, and&#xD;
      collapsibility to be able to predict surgical outcome and improve surgical planning in these&#xD;
      patients. Our central hypothesis is that upper airway flow-structure interaction (FSI)&#xD;
      modeling using three-dimensional (3-D) computational simulations from dynamic magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI or MR) data can be used to predict surgical outcomes for children with&#xD;
      DS who have OSA despite previous T&amp;A. The long-term goal is to improve surgical outcome of&#xD;
      children with Down syndrome and OSA by creating an accurate FSI predictive model. Such a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool would help tailor surgical procedures to be more effective as well as&#xD;
      identify and avoid unnecessary or unhelpful surgical procedures. These created models can in&#xD;
      future be adjusted and applied to other populations with OSA. Our specific aims include: 1)&#xD;
      In children with Down syndrome and persistent OSA despite previous T&amp;A, to collect data&#xD;
      characterizing upper airway anatomy, tissue compliance, and collapsibility; 2) to generate&#xD;
      and validate individualized dynamic FSI models for each child and 3) to use the validated&#xD;
      dynamic computational models to predict the success of surgical treatment on children with&#xD;
      Down syndrome who have persistent OSA despite previous T&amp;A. This work is innovative as it&#xD;
      uses dynamic rather than static MR imaging data and applies a unique computational model that&#xD;
      accurately captures the unsteadiness of the flow and accounts for the interaction between the&#xD;
      airflow and the surrounding airway flexible structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research components will involve two parts of the project. The first will be the generation,&#xD;
      validation and use of computational models from MRI data. The second is the measure of&#xD;
      critical closing pressure (Pcrit) on DS subjects who are at least three months post T&amp;A, have&#xD;
      OSA and are being evaluated for possible additional airway surgery. The measurement of Pcrit&#xD;
      will be done during the research PSG (in the Sleep Center) and during the clinical sleep MRI&#xD;
      (in the MRI suite). Pcrit measurements will be acquired with the use of a Continuous Positive&#xD;
      Air Pressure (CPAP) mask during sleep. Additionally, to measure improvement in OSA based on&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) and sleep, the Obstructive Sleep Apnea questionnaire (OSA18) will be&#xD;
      administered both preoperatively and postoperatively.&#xD;
