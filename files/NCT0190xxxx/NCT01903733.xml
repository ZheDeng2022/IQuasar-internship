    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Probability of Maintaining Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) at Year 10: B1871006 Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>Cytogenetic response (CyR) is based on prevalence of Ph+ cells. Duration for MCyR: time from first response to confirmed loss, progression of disease, or on-treatment death due to any cause, or censoring analyzed for responders only. Confirmed loss was defined as 2 consecutive non-responses at least 28 days apart. MCyR was categorized as either complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or partial cytogenetic response (PCyR). Response was achieved when there was 0% (CCyR) or 1-35% (PCyR) Ph+ cells analyzed from conventional cytogenetics based on the analysis of 20 to 100 metaphases or &lt;1% (CCyR) or 1-35% (PCyR) Ph+ cells analyzed from fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) based on analysis of at least 200 nuclei. CCyR may be imputed on a specific date if an MMR or better is achieved and denoted on the CRF on that date for B1871040 study visits. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze percentage of participants maintaining MCyR at Year 10.</description>

    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>Duration for CCyR was defined as time from first response to confirmed loss, progression of disease, or on-treatment death due to any cause, or censoring analyzed for responders only. Confirmed loss was defined as 2 consecutive assessments with &gt;0 Ph+ metaphases or &gt;=1% positive cells from FISH at least 28 days apart or progression or death. CCyR was achieved when there was 0% Ph+ cells analysed from conventional cytogenetics with 20 to 100 metaphases or &lt;1% Ph+ cells analysed from FISH with at least 200 nuclei. CCyR may be imputed on a specific date if MMR or better is achieved and denoted on the CRF on that date for B1871040 study visits.

    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>Duration for CHR was defined as time from first response to confirmed loss, progression of disease, or on-treatment death due to any cause, or censoring analyzed for responders only. Confirmed loss was defined as 2 consecutive non-responses at least 14 days apart. Complete hematologic response was considered when participants met all of the following criteria: White blood cells equal to or less than (&lt;=) institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), no blasts or promyelocytes in blood, &lt;20% basophils in blood, no extramedullary involvement (including hepatomegaly or splenomegaly), myelocytes and metamyelocytes &lt;5% in blood, platelets &lt;450*10^9 per liter (/L). The following were applicable only to advanced phase: &lt;=5% bone marrow blasts, absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1.0*10^9/L, platelets &gt;=100*10^9/L.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was offered to participants randomized to bosutinib arm in B1871008 (NCT00574873) or dosed with bosutinib in B1871006 (NCT00261846). Participants enrolled in this study were who in any of the parent studies (B1871008 or B1871006) at time of protocol approval 1) receiving bosutinib, benefiting per investigator, 2) discontinued bosutinib, being followed-up,3) completed parent study. Per enrolment criteria, 281 participants were enrolled in this study and 21 participants were from China.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Per protocol data from 2 parent studies were combined with data from this study (B1871040) for all analyses. Reporting arms were based on parent study, disease phase and line of therapy (CP1L,CP2L,CP3L/CP4L,ADV).The B1871040 data from 21 participants enrolled in China were not included in results because the Human Genetics Resources Administration of China did not approve the use of the data in accordance with its regulations. This data has been excluded from all our analyses.</pre_assignment_details>

Dose for bosutinib was 500 milligram (mg) orally once daily (adjusted dose varied from 200 mg to 600 mg once daily). Treatment continued until the end of the study, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent or study discontinuation whichever occurred first. Follow-up continued till end of the study or death due to any cause whichever occurred first. Participants remained in this study, either for treatment or for follow-up, until the last participant enrolled in 1 of the parent studies reached 10 years of follow-up, as calculated from the date of his/her first dose of bosutinib administered in parent study.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death, was life threatening (immediate risk of death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions), resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any event increasing in severity from baseline or any new event started during bosutinib therapy or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug.</description>

        <description>Cytogenetic response (CyR) is based on prevalence of Ph+ cells. Duration for MCyR: time from first response to confirmed loss, progression of disease, or on-treatment death due to any cause, or censoring analyzed for responders only. Confirmed loss was defined as 2 consecutive non-responses at least 28 days apart. MCyR was categorized as either complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or partial cytogenetic response (PCyR). Response was achieved when there was 0% (CCyR) or 1-35% (PCyR) Ph+ cells analyzed from conventional cytogenetics based on the analysis of 20 to 100 metaphases or &lt;1% (CCyR) or 1-35% (PCyR) Ph+ cells analyzed from fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) based on analysis of at least 200 nuclei. CCyR may be imputed on a specific date if an MMR or better is achieved and denoted on the CRF on that date for B1871040 study visits. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze percentage of participants maintaining MCyR at Year 10.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Probability of Maintaining Complete Hematologic Response (CHR) at Year 10: B1871006 Participants</title>
        <description>Duration for CHR was defined as time from first response to confirmed loss, progression of disease, or on-treatment death due to any cause, or censoring analyzed for responders only. Confirmed loss was defined as 2 consecutive non-responses at least 14 days apart. Complete hematologic response was considered when participants met all of the following criteria: White blood cells equal to or less than (&lt;=) institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), no blasts or promyelocytes in blood, &lt;20% basophils in blood, no extramedullary involvement (including hepatomegaly or splenomegaly), myelocytes and metamyelocytes &lt;5% in blood, platelets &lt;450*10^9 per liter (/L). The following were applicable only to advanced phase: &lt;=5% bone marrow blasts, absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1.0*10^9/L, platelets &gt;=100*10^9/L. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze percentage of participants maintaining CHR at Year 10.</description>
