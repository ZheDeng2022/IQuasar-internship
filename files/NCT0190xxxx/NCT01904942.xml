      The project is based on a case-control study including cirrhotic patients with (200 cases)&#xD;
      and without (400 controls) Hepatocellular carcinoma. The determination of sample sizes in&#xD;
      proteomic or spectroscopic studies has to be adapted to the high dimensional setting. The&#xD;
      proteomic analysis will be conducted by Clinical Innovation Proteomic Platform of Dijon. Two&#xD;
      approaches will be used in the proteomic study: A global approach based on the comparison of&#xD;
      proteomic spectra profiles obtained after mass spectrometry analysis (MALDI-TOF). The&#xD;
      particularity of this study with regard to previous studies is : the procedures used to&#xD;
      purify the sub proteomes (Five automated methods including depletion fractionation and&#xD;
      purification will be applied), the qualification of the generated data with the introduction&#xD;
      of quality controls, the high number of samples included in the study. The second approach&#xD;
      BIA-MS (Biomolecular interaction analysis mass spectrometry) is targeted approach allows the&#xD;
      capture, quantification and characterization of proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality controls allow to quantify the various variability sources and to validate that&#xD;
      biological variability is higher than technical variability. All the samples will be treated&#xD;
      and analyzed with the same protocols, 100 samples will be used to validate the marker and&#xD;
      statistical models developed after analysis of the first 500 samples. The infra-red&#xD;
      spectroscopy analysis will be conducted by MÃ©DIAN team, CNRS UMR 6237 of Reims university.&#xD;
      The first 300 samples after feature selection reference spectra, are classified into&#xD;
      different classes by means of mathematical classification methods such as multivariate&#xD;
      statistical processes of pattern recognition, neuronal networks, support vector machines and&#xD;
      methods of case-based classification or machine learning, genetic algorithms or methods of&#xD;
      evolutionary programming. The analysis of a second set of samples (300) will validate the&#xD;
      different mathematical classification methods developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the global study the investigators will unravel the relationship between proteomic,&#xD;
      spectroscopic and metabolic/nutritional data. The description of these relationships will use&#xD;
      canonical analysis and multi-block analysis in a more general extent. The goal of these&#xD;
      methods is to explore relationships that may exist between several groups of quantitative&#xD;
      variables observed on the same set of individuals.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cases and controls will be males aged 35 or older, and will give an informed consent&#xD;
             to participate in the study. All HCC cases evolving in cirrhotic liver, whatever the&#xD;
             etiology of cirrhosis, will be included. Criteria for the diagnosis of HCC will be&#xD;
             those defined by the European Association for Study of the Liver (EASL) (Bruix J, J&#xD;
             Hepatol 2001): All patients with cirrhosis, whatever its etiology, will be included.&#xD;
             The diagnosis of cirrhosis will rely on histological confirmation by liver biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients free of portal thrombosis at Doppler imaging, on the presence of portal&#xD;
             hypertension ascertained by biological (tricytopenia), morphologic (abdominal US, CT&#xD;
             or MRI), hepatic venous pressure measurement or upper endoscopy (mosaic gastropathy,&#xD;
             varices).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with portal thrombosis, on the presence of portal hypertension associated&#xD;
             with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical (hepatomegaly with clinical evidence of hepatocellular failure: spider&#xD;
                  naevi, palmar erythema, white nails, gynecomastia) or morphological signs of&#xD;
                  cirrhosis (enlarged liver, nodular surface, sharp lower edge).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  And/or biological signs of hepatocellular failure (TP&lt;70%, low albuminemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  And/or sinusoidal block assessed by liver venous gradient &gt;18 mm Hg In the&#xD;
                  present state of knowledge, a fibrotest value at 4 or a fibroscan value &gt; 12,5&#xD;
                  kPa Without any other clinical or biological signs will be considered as&#xD;
                  diagnosis criteria of cirrhosis only for chronic viral C hepatitis. The lack of&#xD;
                  HCC in cirrhotic patients at inclusion will be assessed through good quality&#xD;
                  imaging examinations (abdominal US, CT scan or MRI) and AFP below 100 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  - patients under 35years old or more than 75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  other cancer in evolution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  major somatic or psychiatric illness not compatible with the inclusion in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  non HCC primary liver cancer.&#xD;
