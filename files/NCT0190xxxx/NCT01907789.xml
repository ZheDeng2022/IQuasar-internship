  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare ovarian cancer screening,&#xD;
      risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), and prophylactic salpingectomy with delayed&#xD;
      oophorectomy (PSDO). The safety of RRSO and PSDO will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cancer screening does not involve a surgical procedure. Instead, physical exams,&#xD;
      blood tests, and ultrasound are used to check for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedures, RRSO and PSDO, are designed to lower your risk of ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In RRSO, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are removed at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PSDO, the fallopian tubes are removed and the ovaries remain in place so that the patient&#xD;
      does not go through menopause. The ovaries are removed at a later date. The main goal of this&#xD;
      study is to learn how many patients actually have their ovaries removed at a later date.&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn whether the removal of fallopian tubes will decrease the risk&#xD;
      of ovarian cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has 3 options: ovarian cancer screening, PSDO, and RRSO. You may choose which&#xD;
      study group you want to take part in. However, you must let the researchers know what your&#xD;
      choice is before any testing for the study begins. The 3 study groups are described in detail&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: OVARIAN CANCER SCREENING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this group, there is no testing required before starting the study. If you agree to be in&#xD;
      Group 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound (ultrasound inside the vagina) to look at your&#xD;
           ovaries and fallopian tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure your CA125 levels. This test is&#xD;
           used to screen for ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life. This should take up to 15&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months for up to 3 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries and fallopian tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Years 1, 2, and 3, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of your test results will be discussed with you. If any of your test results are&#xD;
      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125&#xD;
      testing, ultrasound, and/or a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI). If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a gynecologic&#xD;
      oncologist (a doctor for women's cancer) and/or recommend that you have your ovaries and&#xD;
      fallopian tubes removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may have study visits for up to 3 years. You will be taken off study early if you develop&#xD;
      cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time or preferably at the end of 3 years, you will have the option to cross over and&#xD;
      choose one of the treatment options (Group 2 or 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will&#xD;
      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical&#xD;
      history. If you are called, the calls should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2: FALLOPIAN TUBE REMOVAL WITH DELAYED OVARY REMOVAL (PSDO):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salpingectomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study in Group 2, the study doctor will&#xD;
      discuss the salpingectomy surgery with you in detail, including the risks and possible&#xD;
      benefits. You will be asked to sign a surgical consent form. After that, the salpingectomy&#xD;
      will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients have salpingectomy performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that you&#xD;
      will likely go home the day of your surgery. If the study doctor plans to have you stay&#xD;
      overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your fallopian&#xD;
      tubes will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that may be&#xD;
      cancerous, a tissue sample or a complete ovary will be removed during surgery and tested. If&#xD;
      cancer is found, a gynecologic oncologist would perform your cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Salpingectomy Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing. The&#xD;
      calls should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) month after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions (wounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathology (tissue) results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the&#xD;
      1-week phone call or the 1-month visit. If the results show cancer, the study doctor will&#xD;
      refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian Cancer Screening Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 months or until your delayed oophorectomy after the salpingectomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire 1 time a year until 1 year after your&#xD;
      delayed oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Oophorectomy Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 3-year screening period, you will have a pre-oophorectomy visit. The following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and CA-125 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries, if this has not been&#xD;
           done in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire, if this has not been done in the&#xD;
           last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have other tests performed if the study doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oophorectomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your pre-surgical testing is normal, the study doctor will discuss the planned surgery&#xD;
      with you in detail, including the risks and possible benefits. You will be asked to sign a&#xD;
      surgical consent form. After that, the oophorectomy will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients have oophorectomy performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that you&#xD;
      will likely go home the day of your surgery. If the study doctor plans to have you stay&#xD;
      overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your ovaries&#xD;
      will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that may be cancerous,&#xD;
      a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Oophorectomy Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) month after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week phone&#xD;
      call or the 1-month visit. If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a&#xD;
      gynecologic oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months and 1 year after surgery, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 year after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of your test results will be discussed with you. If any of your test results are&#xD;
      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125&#xD;
      testing, ultrasound, and/or a CT scan or MRI. If the results show cancer, the study doctor&#xD;
      will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have study visits until 1 year after your oophorectomy. You will be taken off study&#xD;
      early if you develop cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will&#xD;
      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 3: REMOVAL OF FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES AT THE SAME TIME (RRSO):&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRSO:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study in Group 3, the study doctor will&#xD;
      discuss the surgery with you in detail, including the risks and possible benefits. You will&#xD;
      be asked to sign a surgical consent form. After that, the RRSO will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients have RRSO performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that you will likely&#xD;
      go home the day of your surgery. If the study doctor plans to have you stay overnight in the&#xD;
      hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your ovaries and&#xD;
      fallopian tubes will be removed. If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that&#xD;
      may be cancerous, a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week phone&#xD;
      call or the 1-month visit. If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a&#xD;
      gynecologic oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Surgery Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) month after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week phone&#xD;
      call or the 1-month visit. If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a&#xD;
      gynecologic oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months and 1 year after surgery, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 year after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure your CA-125.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of your test results will be discussed with you. If any of your test results are&#xD;
      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125&#xD;
      testing, ultrasound, and/or a CT scan or MRI. If the results show cancer, the study doctor&#xD;
      will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have study visits for up to 1 year after surgery. You will be taken off study early&#xD;
      if you develop cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will&#xD;
      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. At this time, the only known method that may lower your&#xD;
      risk of ovarian cancer is to have both of your ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (RRSO).&#xD;
      Screening for ovarian cancer does not lower the risk that you will develop cancer. PSDO has&#xD;
      not previously been studied and may not lower your ovarian cancer risk. PSDO is currently&#xD;
      being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 women will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 60 will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
