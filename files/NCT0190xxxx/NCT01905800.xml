  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) represents the most common cause of labyrinthine&#xD;
      vertigo with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. Onset is most common between the fifth and&#xD;
      seventh decades of life. The disease can be a major handicap for the affected patient, and&#xD;
      causes a great expense for society. The traditional manual treatment with repositioning&#xD;
      maneuvers has greatly improved the possibilities for treatment of BPPV the last decade.&#xD;
      However some patients are still difficult to diagnose and treat, and there are some who for&#xD;
      health reasons cannot undergo traditional manual treatment. In this perspective there is a&#xD;
      demand for a reliable, effective and precise method to treat all semicircular canals for the&#xD;
      differentiated patient groups, and the techniques are under continuous development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been extended research to improve the techniques and develop better and more&#xD;
      reliable methods for diagnosing and treating BPPV efficiently. An important part in this&#xD;
      technique evolution is the development of biaxial rotational chairs that can treat the&#xD;
      patients regardless of other health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical assistance chairs have been designed to diagnose, differentiate and treat more&#xD;
      precisely all forms of positional vertigo. The patient is strapped to a chair and fitted with&#xD;
      infrared video goggles which identify and quantify the nystagmus in different positions. Dr.&#xD;
      John M. Epley developed the Epley Omniax System, an automated, power driven, multi axial&#xD;
      patient positioning device that can move the patient into any position to treat the affected&#xD;
      canal. This chair is electronically managed. Another mechanical assistance chair, the TRV&#xD;
      chair, developed by Thomas Richard-Vitton in Marseille France, became commercially available&#xD;
      in 2005. This chair has a vertical and a horizontal axis of rotation and is lockable in&#xD;
      preset positions. It is manually handled and can swivel between two axes in all planes of the&#xD;
      semicircular canals for up to 360 degrees or more. Velocity of rotation can be regulated&#xD;
      freely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRV chair is used by 34 centers worldwide today. Bergen (Norway) was the first place in&#xD;
      North-Europe to acquire this chair, and have used it since December 2009. In 2013&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet Denmark started using the TRV chair as well and Oslo University Hospital&#xD;
      Rikshospitalet, will have their chair in 2013. The TRV chair opens for treatment that&#xD;
      previously was not possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the presence of positional nystagmus in the normal population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of D-BBC treatment compared to S-BBC for treatment of lateral&#xD;
           canal BPPV in TRV chair&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the serum level of vitamin D in BPPV patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give a detailed description of the method.&#xD;
