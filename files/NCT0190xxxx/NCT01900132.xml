      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a new technique being studied to see if it is&#xD;
      helpful in evaluating muscle disorders and nerve disorders. EIM looks at how a mild, painless&#xD;
      electrical current travels through muscles. Researchers want to gain experience in using the&#xD;
      EIM device. They will collect information on the results of using it on people with and&#xD;
      without nerve and muscle diseases, and compare that with information from other standard&#xD;
      tests. First, they will test the device on healthy people. Then they will test people with a&#xD;
      variety of neuromuscular diseases. Because the test is noninvasive and not painful,&#xD;
      researchers will test both children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To gain experience using the EIM muscle testing device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 2 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 2 years old who have neuromuscular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have one 2-3 hour clinic visit. Researchers may request follow-up&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be tested with the EIM device. The device and small electrodes will be&#xD;
           placed on their skin. An electric current will pass through the device, but the&#xD;
           participants will not feel this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have an ultrasound test. A gel will be put on their skin, and a device&#xD;
           will be moved over the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a nerve test. Electrodes will be placed on their skin, and they&#xD;
           will feel a small shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a test where a thin needle is inserted in their muscle.&#xD;

      Synopsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title: Electrical Impedance Myography: Natural History Studies in Neuromuscular Disorders and&#xD;
      Healthy Volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: This is a natural history study examining the utility of electrical&#xD;
      impedance myography (EIM) device in the evaluation of neuromuscular disorders. This is a&#xD;
      novel device so the initial step was to establish reproducibility of the data and expected&#xD;
      normative values using the EIM device on healthy volunteers. In neuromuscular disorders, the&#xD;
      EIM device will be used to understand the results in different types of neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorders. A subset of subjects with neuromuscular disorders are studied serially as&#xD;
      preliminary evaluation of its utility as a biomarker in clinical studies. The protocol&#xD;
      includes both adult and pediatric subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: For subjects with neuromuscular disease, we aim to understand if EIM has&#xD;
      utility in differentiating neuromuscular disorders in adult and pediatric subjects. Also, to&#xD;
      perform preliminary serial studies to understand the EIM device potential use as biomarker in&#xD;
      clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy volunteers, the primary objective is reproducibility of results and the range of&#xD;
      normative values in adult and pediatric subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: The three parameters, phase, reactance, resistance will be followed&#xD;
      serially as measures of change in pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As exploratory outcome measures, we will explore correlations between EIM and ultrasound and&#xD;
      other electrodiagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy volunteers, intra and interrater reliability will be evaluated to determine the&#xD;
      utility of EIM as a reproducible biomarker. Normative values will be developed using a range&#xD;
      of ages, mixed gender, and race to be used as a basis of comparison with subjects with&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects with neuromuscular disorders, patterns of phase, resistance and reactance in&#xD;
      different types of neuromuscular disorders will be evaluated and examined for patterns&#xD;
      specific to type of neuromuscular disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three parameters, phase, reactance, resistance will be followed serially as measures of&#xD;
      change. This will be in evaluated small groups of neuromuscular disorders that are referred&#xD;
      to this protocol. A cohort of pediatric healthy volunteers will be followed for two years for&#xD;
      comparative data with pediatric subjects with neuromuscular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EIM phase, muscle ultrasound and possibly MUNIX will be compared in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 275&#xD;
&#xD;
      (150) Patients with neuromuscular disease, over age 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      (125) Healthy Volunteers; 90 adults age 18 and above; 35 children age 7 to 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:All studies will be performed in the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center. The majority of the studies will occur in the EMG Lab. The EMG Lab is an&#xD;
      AANEM-accredited EMG lab to perform diagnostic electrodiagnostic studies with experience in&#xD;
      both pediatric and adult populations. At the convenience for the subject, the EIM study can&#xD;
      be performed in other parts of the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: It is estimated that the duration of the study will be 10 years. With closure&#xD;
      in 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: For the healthy volunteers, we will be evaluating EIM along with&#xD;
      possible ultrasound and electrodiagnostic methods. A single session will be 3 hours or less.&#xD;
      Repeat studies may be performed to establish reproducibility after the initial studies are&#xD;
      completed. For subjects with neuromuscular disease, the studies will be conducted in a single&#xD;
      outpatient session of 3 hours or less, unless a follow-up study is requested by the primary&#xD;
      team. For children, the session will be 2 hours or less.&#xD;
