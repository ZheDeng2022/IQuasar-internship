  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of surgical fixation (cancellous screws&#xD;
      versus sliding hip screws) and biologic intervention (Vitamin D versus placebo) on patient&#xD;
      important outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femoral neck fractures are a type of hip fracture associated with high complication rates and&#xD;
      poor functional outcomes. It is estimated that over 300,000 hip fractures occur in patients&#xD;
      under age 50 annually. Hip fractures in younger aged patients are particularly devastating&#xD;
      with profound impairments of quality of life and function. Virtually all patients require&#xD;
      surgical repair of their fractures and unlike elderly hip fractures, failure of surgery&#xD;
      offers few options for salvage. Arthroplasty is a successful treatment for elderly patients;&#xD;
      however, a hip replacement is not a viable option for younger patients because of their&#xD;
      higher functional demands for work and recreational activities that are not tolerated by&#xD;
      joint replacements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is more than one way to perform internal fixation for femoral neck fractures.&#xD;
      Cancellous screws have traditionally been the preferred internal fixation implant for femoral&#xD;
      neck fractures. Multiple screws (2 or more) are used during fixation, and advocates of this&#xD;
      implant promote the construct's superior torsional stability, limited disruption of femoral&#xD;
      head blood supply, minimally invasive insertion, and retention of more viable bone than the&#xD;
      larger sliding hip screw (SHS). On the other hand, sliding hip screws have been gaining&#xD;
      popularity and there is evidence to suggest that SHS provide greater fracture stability and&#xD;
      may reduce patient complications. It is currently unknown which method of internal fixation&#xD;
      provides the best outcomes for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral neck fracture treatment is further complicated by vitamin D insufficiency in as many&#xD;
      as 8 of 10 trauma patients. Vitamin D plays an important role in musculoskeletal health and&#xD;
      bone quality because it regulates serum calcium homeostasis. Laboratory research and human&#xD;
      clinical studies suggest important associations between vitamin D, musculoskeletal health,&#xD;
      and improved fracture healing. Experimental animal studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      concentration of vitamin D metabolites are higher at a fracture callus compared to the&#xD;
      uninjured contralateral bone, vitamin D supplementation leads to decreased time to fracture&#xD;
      union and increased callus vascularity, and vitamin D increases mechanical bone strength&#xD;
      compared to controls. Clinical studies have also demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      increases the callus volume of proximal humerus fractures, increases the number and diameter&#xD;
      of type II muscle fibres, and can improve wound healing, however, the effects of vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation in you patients with femoral neck fractures are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a 2x2 factorial design, participant will be randomly allocated to one of four treatment&#xD;
      arms. Participants allocated to the cancellous screw group will receive multiple threaded&#xD;
      screws (with a minimum of 3 screws and a minimum diameter of 6.5 mm) and those allocated to&#xD;
      the sliding hip screw group will receive a single larger diameter partially threaded screw&#xD;
      affixed to the proximal femur with a sideplate using a minimum of 2 screws for fixation.&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the vitamin D Group will receive a bottle of 2,000 International&#xD;
      Units (IU) vitamin D3 drops. Participants will be instructed to take two drops daily for six&#xD;
      months, for a total daily dose of 4,000 IU. Participants in the placebo group will receive an&#xD;
      identical bottle of placebo drops with no active ingredient. Similarly, they will be&#xD;
      instructed to take two drops daily for six months. All vitamin D3 supplement and placebo&#xD;
      bottles will be labeled in a blinded manner according to Health Canada and Good Manufacturing&#xD;
      Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 12 months. In-person participant follow-up visits will&#xD;
      occur at enrollment (baseline), post-surgery, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12&#xD;
      months post-surgery. Data for all outcomes and radiographs will be collected at each&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>91 patients were enrolled into the FAITH-2 pilot trial. Five of these enrolments were subsequently determined to be ineligible (not between the ages of 18-60 years, pathological fracture, no femoral neck fracture, did not provide informed consent (2 patients)). Therefore, 86 participants were included in the analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>A participant met the primary clinical endpoint if they experienced one or more of the four outcomes:&#xD;
Re-operation: any unplanned surgery related to the treatment of the femoral neck fracture;&#xD;
Femoral head osteonecrosis: any evidence of osteonecrosis on any follow-up medical imaging study (i.e., radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or other advanced imaging study);&#xD;
Severe femoral neck malunion: fracture healing with femoral neck shortening of &gt;10 mm in any plane on follow-up x-rays; or&#xD;
Nonunion: failure of the fracture to progress towards healing defined as a Radiographic Union Score for Hip (RUSH) score below a pre-determined threshold specific for nonunion at 6 months or greater post-injury.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
        <population>91 patients were randomized into the FAITH-2 pilot trial. 86 patients were deemed eligible and included in the analyses. Of the 86 participants, 43 were allocated to receive a sliding hip screw and 43 were allocated to receive CS. Regarding supplementation treatment, 45 were allocated to receive vitamin D, and 41 were allocated to receive placebo.</population>
