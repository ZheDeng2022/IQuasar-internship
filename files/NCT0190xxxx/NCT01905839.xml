      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Parkinson s disease (PD) affects half a million Americans, causing slow movements, tremors,&#xD;
      stiffness, and trouble walking. Currently, these symptoms are measured by physical exam, but&#xD;
      this is unreliable and requires an office visit. Researchers want to study a different way to&#xD;
      measure PD symptoms, using a home-testing machine called a QMAT device. It can test how&#xD;
      quickly someone moves doing different tasks. Researchers will study how this testing compares&#xD;
      to physical exam testing and whether the device can detect changes in PD symptoms over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if a home testing device can be used to evaluate Parkinson s disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults at least 18 years old with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have about 22 clinic visits over 5 years. Each visit will take up to 3&#xD;
           hours. Visits will be scheduled along with visits for another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At visit 1, participants will learn to use the QMAT device and how to send testing&#xD;
           information to the clinic by computer. The device has a computer screen, some buttons,&#xD;
           and some pegs. Participants will get a device to take home and any accessories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will learn 2 QMAT tests. For one, they will press keys as fast as possible.&#xD;
           For the other, they will move pegs into holes. The tests will take a total of about 20&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take both tests at home, 2 times on the same day each week, once&#xD;
           before their medication, once after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study coordinator will monitor the participant s computer data and discuss the at-home&#xD;
           testing at the clinic visits.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      movement disorders and to assess movement in Parkinson s disease by performing small&#xD;
      behavioral exercises and objectively measuring movements utilizing the QMAT at home testing&#xD;
      device. These devices will be provided by the Kinetics Foundation. We have developed a series&#xD;
      of motor tasks that can be performed with the QMAT, a home-based computer module, so that&#xD;
      data on patient s movement can be collected frequently and prospectively without obligating&#xD;
      the patient to come to a medical center. The study is designed to be observational in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QMAT device is being implemented to respond to the interest in objectified tests to&#xD;
      monitor, analyze, and further understand the physiological aspects of Parkinson s disease. We&#xD;
      will conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training to patients to perform tasks on the QMAT device and transmit data at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training to investigators who do not have prior experience using the system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing using the QMAT device that may increase knowledge of a disease process,&#xD;
           responsiveness of treatment or be helpful in patient progress evaluations by analyzing&#xD;
           data collected from the at home tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol includes only non-invasive techniques with minimal risk to the participants.&#xD;
      The technique has been piloted as part of the 10-N-0009 protocol, Physiological&#xD;
      Investigations in Movement Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study patients with diagnosis of Parkinson Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll up to 60 participants in order to obtain 48 patients who complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assign and train study participants to use the QMAT device at home. This is a&#xD;
      portable device with a simple keyboard and pegboard interface, storing data from patient&#xD;
      performance at home. There are 2 tasks that are performed using the device. The pegboard task&#xD;
      involves transferring pegs from holes on one side of the device to the opposite side of the&#xD;
      device. The finger tapping test and the digitography tasks involve having the subject press&#xD;
      keys on the keyboard. At enrollment into this study, a time schedule will be discussed with&#xD;
      the participant regarding the schedule that these at home tests require to be conducted. We&#xD;
      will provide the device, all the components, and a data storage thumb-drive to each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Bradykinesia (fine motor movements):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The component of the apparatus that will test fine motor control will involve finger pads&#xD;
      that will be tapped in alternating fashion by the patient for 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable will be mean keystroke velocity (completed alternating&#xD;
      cycles/testing period, expressed as cm/sec. Secondary outcomes will be mean frequency&#xD;
      expressed as Hz, mean strike duration, expressed as m/sec and temporal variation of the&#xD;
      duration of finger strike and frequency (issues of fatigue) expressed as the coefficient of&#xD;
      variation (SD/mean). Variation in velocity will be expressed as the SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Complex movements: (Pegboard or plugging device):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The At-Home device also contains plugging tasks. Primary outcome: mean movement velocity&#xD;
      expressed as seconds per plugging cycle. This measure can be analyzed statistically for all&#xD;
      movements to correct for outlier responses and errors. A secondary outcome will also be&#xD;
      defatigation (i.e., the linear change of speed during a testing session, expressed as percent&#xD;
      of the cycle-time. The variance of speed will be provided by the standard deviation. A&#xD;
      regression analysis will allow estimates of the part of the variance that is declared by&#xD;
      linear change over the complete task.&#xD;
