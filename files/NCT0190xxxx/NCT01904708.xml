  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited genetic disorder, can cause irreversible brain damage,&#xD;
      declined executive function, and autistic tendencies unless a phenylalanine (Phe) restricted&#xD;
      diet is consistently maintained throughout life. Promoting anabolism, the uptake of free&#xD;
      amino acids from the extracellular space, is a key component to maintaining plasma&#xD;
      phenylalanine concentrations within treatment range among patients with PKU. Exercise&#xD;
      promotes muscle protein synthesis and anabolism, but the effect on blood phenylalanine&#xD;
      concentrations in patients with PKU has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to assess the impact of an acute bout of moderate intensity exercise on&#xD;
      protein oxidation and plasma amino acid concentrations, as a potential adjunctive therapy for&#xD;
      patients with PKU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that moderate intensity exercise decreases amino acid&#xD;
      oxidation, increases muscle protein synthesis, and promotes tissue uptake of essential amino&#xD;
      acids, thereby lowering plasma phenylalanine concentrations in patients with Phenylketonuria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The indicator amino acid oxidation technique utilizes a carbon labeled isotope (L-[13C])&#xD;
      tracer that is ingested orally and is measured in expired breath. This method is based on the&#xD;
      theory that if one essential amino acid is deficient, all other amino acids will be oxidized&#xD;
      until a break-point is reached and at that time all amino acids will be incorporated into&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis. Using a randomized crossover design the investigators plan to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of an acute bout of moderate intensity treadmill exercise versus&#xD;
      sedentary activities on plasma amino acids in four subjects with PKU. The long-term goal of&#xD;
      this novel research is to determine if exercise could be used as an adjunctive therapy to&#xD;
      improve the management of plasma phenylalanine levels and promote a normal, healthy quality&#xD;
      of life among patients with PKU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment: Four post-pubertal participants ranging from 14-17 years of age with&#xD;
      classical phenylketonuria (PKU), treated at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, will&#xD;
      participate in this pilot study. Participants will be recruited during their routine clinic&#xD;
      visit at Doernbecher Children's Hospital Metabolic clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This randomized crossover clinical trial will compare the effects of moderate&#xD;
      intensity exercise and sedentary activities on amino acid oxidation and plasma amino acid&#xD;
      pools using the indicator amino acid oxidation technique. Each participant will be studied on&#xD;
      two separate occasions over a one-month period.&#xD;
