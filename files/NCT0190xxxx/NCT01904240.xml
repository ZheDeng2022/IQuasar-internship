  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently unknown. Both environmental and genetic&#xD;
      factors have been found to contribute to PD pathogenesis. The pathology of PD is distributed&#xD;
      throughout the entire nervous system including the central, peripheral, and enteric nervous&#xD;
      system. There is evidence that inflammation plays a major role in neurodegeneration in PD. In&#xD;
      both the striatum and substantia nigra of PD patients activated microglia were found and&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1B, IL-6, iNOS) are increased in the CSF. An&#xD;
      inflammation-driven animal model has emerged and has been widely accepted as a model of the&#xD;
      disease based on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neurotoxicity. LPS is an endotoxin found on&#xD;
      the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and humans are exposed to LPS through the&#xD;
      intestinal tract. The intestinal tract and thus the enteric nervous system serve as a conduit&#xD;
      to the central nervous system. It has been posited that the inflammatory process could gain&#xD;
      access to the lower brainstem via the vagal nerve and then ascend through the basal mid- and&#xD;
      forebrain until it reaches the cerebral cortex, producing various pre-motor and motor&#xD;
      symptoms of PD along the way. LPS may be one of the inflammatory triggers involved in this&#xD;
      process. Systemic exposure to bacterial endotoxin can be determined by measuring plasma LPS&#xD;
      binding protein (LBP). A study of 9 patients with early PD (median Hoehn and Yahr stage 2)&#xD;
      and age matched controls found that the PD subjects had a significantly lower mean level of&#xD;
      plasma LBP compared to control subjects. The aim of the research plan is to establish LBP as&#xD;
      a potential biomarker for PD across a spectrum of disease severity.&#xD;
