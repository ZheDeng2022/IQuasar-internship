  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although ACTHAR gel is approved for the treatment of acute relapses, it is currently not&#xD;
      widely used. Thus, we propose to conduct a small open-label proof-of-concept trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the response to ACTHAR gel therapy in patients who have failed to make a&#xD;
      satisfactory recovery after treatment with high dose IVMP. Documentation of the clinical&#xD;
      course as well as any adverse events related to IVMP use will be made. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to study the potential benefit of a 14-day course (the dose historically used since&#xD;
      the landmark clinical trial of Rose et al1) of subcutaneous ACTHAR gel in 10 patients who&#xD;
      have demonstrated inadequate improvement after a course of IVMP, 1000 mg daily, for 5&#xD;
      treatments (over a maximum of 8 days). These would be patients for whom PLEX would be&#xD;
      considered as a treatment possibility. The primary outcome measure will be improvement in the&#xD;
      targeted neurological deficit, as measured on the appropriate functional system score (FSS)&#xD;
      of the EDSS.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, small, proof-of-concept study examining the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      extent of recovery of a two-week course of subcutaneous Acthar Gel therapy in patients with&#xD;
      MS relapse who have failed to make a satisfactory recovery after treatment with high dose&#xD;
      methylprednisolone. Eligible patients will be given 80 units of Acthar for 14 days. Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated at baseline, at 1 week of Acthar treatment, at completion of Acthar&#xD;
      treatment, and 1 week after completion of treatment. For those who do not undergo&#xD;
      plasmapheresis an additional evaluation will be conducted 2 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      treatment. Monitoring will include blood pressure determination and blood sugar&#xD;
      determination.&#xD;
