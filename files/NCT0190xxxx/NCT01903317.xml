      Study Design Subjects will be recruited from an outpatient population of subjects with&#xD;
      psoriasis from Dr. Jennifer Soung's clinic at the Gottschalk Medical Plaza at the University&#xD;
      of California, Irvine. Subjects with the requisite diagnosis of psoriasis who are starting a&#xD;
      new form of therapy will be candidates for enrollment. Subjects who choose not to participate&#xD;
      in the study will receive their standard of care treatment without any monitoring for vitamin&#xD;
      D level. The protocol for this study is as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened and consented. Upon entry into the study, the study subject's&#xD;
      severity of disease will be evaluated by the investigator, using the Psoriasis Area and&#xD;
      Severity Index (PASI), Body Surface Area (BSA), and Physician's Global Assessment (PGA).&#xD;
      These assessments will be repeated at all future study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive whichever standard of care treatment for their psoriasis as if they&#xD;
      were not participating in this study. Subjects will have their disease severity evaluated and&#xD;
      a vitamin D level drawn at Baseline (prior to initiating treatment), Week 12, Week 24, and&#xD;
      Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study procedures will take place at the UCI Dermatology Research Center and Institute for&#xD;
      Clinical and Translational Research (ICTS) located at 843 Health Sciences Road, Irvine, CA&#xD;
      92697. The subject will be informed of his or her vitamin D level results at any time. Should&#xD;
      the level be dangerously low (per the laboratory reference point), the subject will be&#xD;
      treated for vitamin D deficiency as necessary per standard of care. Subjects will be&#xD;
      categorized as starting topical therapy, phototherapy and systemic therapy, or biologic&#xD;
      therapy. For all Vitamin D level testing in this protocol, the Vitamin D 25-hydroxy level&#xD;
      will be drawn, which involves 0.5mL of blood per draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Baseline: This visit will take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performance of any protocol-specific&#xD;
      procedures. The following procedures will be performed at Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent at the first Screening visit only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be allocated a sequential identification number. After such assignment,&#xD;
           all subjects including drop-outs will be accounted for and fully documented through&#xD;
           withdrawal or study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of psoriasis diagnosis and confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of concomitant medication and therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PASI, BSA, PGA assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory testing: Vitamin D level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 12: This visit will take approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PASI, BSA, PGA assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory testing: Vitamin D level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of concomitant medication and therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 24: This visit will take approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PASI, BSA, PGA assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory testing: Vitamin D level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of concomitant medication and therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 52: This visit will take approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PASI, BSA, PGA assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory testing: Vitamin D level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of concomitant medication and therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy assessment&#xD;

      Clinical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)&#xD;
      quantifies the severity of a subject's psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the&#xD;
      percent of body surface area (BSA) affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator&#xD;
      of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of four body&#xD;
      regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the&#xD;
      proportion of the body region to the whole body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Surface Area (BSA) Assessment of body surface area with psoriasis will be performed&#xD;
      separately for four body regions: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and&#xD;
      groin), and lower limbs (including buttocks). The percent surface area with psoriasis is&#xD;
      estimated by means of the handprint method, the full palmar hand of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) The Physician's Global Assessment of psoriasis is scored&#xD;
      on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration and scaling&#xD;
      across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration and scaling are scored separately&#xD;
      over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 to 4) as defined by morphologic&#xD;
      descriptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Laboratory Tests Blood samples will be collected at the timepoints indicated above.&#xD;
      All tests will be performed by UCI Pathology Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy Assessment Female subjects of child-bearing potential will be asked if she is&#xD;
      pregnant or not. As the risks to a pregnant woman for participating in this study are minimal&#xD;
      (blood draw and breach of confidentiality), no pregnancy test will be done. However, should a&#xD;
      female subject declare herself to be pregnant, she will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
