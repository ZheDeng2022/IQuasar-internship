      This clinical Trial is proposed to explore whether preconditioning chemotherapy of&#xD;
      Paclitaxel+cisplatin(TP)regimen combined with autologous adoptive CIK cell immunotherapy&#xD;
      could benefit NSCLC patients with a better clinical outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has become one of the leading causes of cancer related death, with increasing&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. And non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of all&#xD;
      lung cancer patients. Although more and more molecule target therapies has been in clinical&#xD;
      use, the overall treatment effects do not come up to expectations. It is urgent that to&#xD;
      explore new treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is the main modality for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, however, the effect of&#xD;
      chemotherapy in NSCLC has reached to a plateau. Combination of chemotherapy with other&#xD;
      therapies is the most prospective orientation in the cancer treatment research. It was widely&#xD;
      accepted that there was a conflict relationship between chemotherapy and immunotherapy as&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics could destruct the immune system. However, it was convinced that&#xD;
      chemotherapy could modulate the suppressive immune microenvironment and up-regulate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of cancer cells, thereafter enhance anti-tumor effects of immune system.&#xD;
      Traditional chemotherapeutics are not just cytotoxic drugs, but also immunity regulators.&#xD;
      Increasing evidences indicate that combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy would show&#xD;
      more effective anti-tumor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoptive cell immunotherapy is one of the most prospective treatments in the battle against&#xD;
      cancer. CIK cells are heterogeneous cell populations derived from human peripheral blood or&#xD;
      mice spleen after in vitro expansion with interferon-γ, interleukin-2 and anti-CD3&#xD;
      antibodies. CIK cells mediate potent major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted&#xD;
      cytotoxicity against a variety of tumor cells and can recognize and kill tumor cells without&#xD;
      prior exposure or priming. There are two main subpopulations can be distinguished within the&#xD;
      bulk culture of in vitro expanded CIK cells, one co-expressing the CD3 and cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 56(CD56) molecules (CD3+CD56+) while the other presenting a CD3+CD56-&#xD;
      phenotype. The antitumor activity of CIK cells has been reported to be mainly restricted to&#xD;
      the CD3+CD56+ cells. Adoptive CIK cells transfer, one of the adoptive immunotherapy&#xD;
      represents a promising nontoxic anticancer therapy in the treatment of solid tumors&#xD;
      refractory to conventional therapies. However in clinical studies, the therapeutic activity&#xD;
      of CIK cells transfer is not as efficient as anticipated, which might be caused by the tumor&#xD;
      abnormal microenvironment, impeding CIK cell infiltration and cytotoxicity. Thus it is urgent&#xD;
      to find an effective therapy to enhance the adoptive CIK cell efficacy so as to improve&#xD;
      clinical effect of cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor immunotherapy is facing numerous challenges such as systemic immune tolerance and tumor&#xD;
      local immune escape. In the development of immune system, all the T cells with high affinity&#xD;
      to self-antigen are cleared by the negative selection in thymus, as well as the T cells&#xD;
      binding to self-antigen expressed by tumor cells. However, the immune suppression cells are&#xD;
      more important for tumor immune evading, in which regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play&#xD;
      central role. T regulatory cells are a component of the immune system that suppress immune&#xD;
      responses of other cells. This is an important &quot;self-check&quot; built into the immune system to&#xD;
      prevent excessive reactions. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well&#xD;
      understood being those that express cluster of differentiation 4(CD4), cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 25(CD25), Foxp3, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated molecule-4 (CTLA-4) and&#xD;
      glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR). As far as now, Treg cells'&#xD;
      precise mechanisms of action are still unclear, which is supposed including cell-cell contact&#xD;
      and secreted cytokines (IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β). In addition, there are&#xD;
      some other immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor (MDSC), playing&#xD;
      important role in cancer immune escape. Tumor cells self could also inhibit the anticancer&#xD;
      immunoreaction through low expression of tumor associated antigen, low expression of MHC-I&#xD;
      molecular, defect of co-activating signal for the activation of Cytotoxic T lymphocytes&#xD;
      (CTL), secreting immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β, expressing Fas ligand,&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and inducing the apoptosis of&#xD;
      effect cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel (PTX) is a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy. Paclitaxel stabilizes&#xD;
      microtubules and as a result, interferes with the normal breakdown of microtubules during&#xD;
      cell division. Together with docetaxel, it forms the drug category of the taxanes. PTX can&#xD;
      enhance antigen presentation by inducing tumor cell immunogenic apoptosis. PTX also can&#xD;
      activate dendritic cells through the toll-like receptor signaling pathways to initiate innate&#xD;
      immune response. PTX has also been reported to induce T helper Type I cytokine production&#xD;
      contributing to effective cytotoxic T-cell responses. While cisplatin (DDP) can up-regulate&#xD;
      the expression of NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) on tumor cells, thus sensitizing tumor cell to lysis&#xD;
      of NKG2D-expressing lymphocytes. DDP may also increase tumor cell expression of Fas, thereby&#xD;
      increasing their vulnerability to Fas ligand (FasL)-positive immune effectors. It has been&#xD;
      reported that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with PTX could induce infiltration of tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) cells in the breast cancer, which was related to the clinical&#xD;
      effects. Our previous work also indicated that the frequencies of intratumoral and splenic&#xD;
      regulatory T cells (Treg cells) were significantly decreased and intratumoral accumulation of&#xD;
      CD3+ T lymphocytes was enhanced after chemotherapy pretreatment in lung cancer models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our previous works, this clinical Trial is proposed to explore whether&#xD;
      preconditioning chemotherapy of TP regimen (PTX+DDP) combined with autologous adoptive CIK&#xD;
      cell immunotherapy could benefit NSCLC patients with a better clinical outcome.&#xD;
