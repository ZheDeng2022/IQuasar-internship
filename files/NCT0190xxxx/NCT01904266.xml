      This research project intends to look at the effect that a certain type of freezing&#xD;
      injection, called a paravertebral block, has on the pain after an operation for breast&#xD;
      cancer, the amount of pain relief that is needed and the side effects from this pain relief.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the paravertebral block, in combination with a general anesthetic will&#xD;
      reduce both pain scores and the amount of strong pain killers (opioids) that is needed. This&#xD;
      will reduce the side effects of the pain killers such as nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be assessed by comparing it a general anesthetic with pain killers given through&#xD;
      the intravenous (IV) as is routine practice. Patients requiring breast cancer surgery, who&#xD;
      agree to be involved in the trial, will be randomly allocated into two groups: both groups&#xD;
      will receive a block, then a standardised and optimised general anesthetic. In one group&#xD;
      however the block is simply a small injection under the skin (a sham block), whereas the&#xD;
      other group will receive a proper paravertebral block prior to this. Both groups will receive&#xD;
      opioids as necessary, depending on both their bodies reaction during the surgery and their&#xD;
      pain scores when they wake up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paravertebral block is a very safe procedure with a very low side effect profile, and&#xD;
      many studies have shown a benefit in breast cancer surgery. The investigators would like to&#xD;
      assess this in our own practice. The block is normally inserted under some light sedation,&#xD;
      with freezing into the skin initially. It is normally very well tolerated. The sham block&#xD;
      will also be performed under light sedation and freezing into the skin. The patients will not&#xD;
      be able to tell whether they are having the sham block or the paravertebral block, because&#xD;
      both are very well tolerated. There are no potential complications from the sham block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Surgery for breast cancer can lead to a number of issues in the perioperative&#xD;
      period. Both acute and chronic post-surgical pain are commonly encountered problems, with&#xD;
      evidence that the degree of acute pain influences the likelihood of chronic pain.&#xD;
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are also common, given the predominantly female&#xD;
      surgical population and the requirement for opioid analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block (PVB) is an effective means of providing analgesia for mastectomy. A&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis5 suggested that there is considerable evidence that paravertebral blocks&#xD;
      with or without a general anesthetic (GA) provide superior post-operative analgesia to breast&#xD;
      surgery operations done with a GA alone. There is also a reduced need for rescue analgesia&#xD;
      and reduced opioid-related side effects. The results of this meta-analysis may be influenced&#xD;
      by publication bias, and the results are difficult to interpret because the lack of&#xD;
      standardisation of technique (single level injection, multi-level injection or continuous&#xD;
      blockade via a catheter inserted into the paravertebral space) and the variety of the type&#xD;
      and dosage of the local anesthetics used for the PVB. The meta-analysis does suggest that PVB&#xD;
      is an effective technique for mastectomy with a minimal complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our institution, the most common form of analgesia for mastectomy patients is systemic&#xD;
      opioid analgesia. However, in the last two years, single level PVBs have been used with&#xD;
      increasing frequency and reliable success. This is due in part to the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guidance for placement of the PVB, which is a relatively simple technique with a&#xD;
      well-defined end-point. The investigators have been using 0.2% ropivacaine, which was only&#xD;
      mentioned in one study of the meta-analysis and was used with a multiple injection technique.&#xD;
      The majority of studies used 0.5% bupivacaine, and most of these studies used PVB as the sole&#xD;
      anesthetic technique. The next most common local anesthetic used was ropivacaine 0.5%, and&#xD;
      this was more frequently used with multi-level injections. As the investigators use a single&#xD;
      level injection in combination with a GA, these studies are not completely relevant to our&#xD;
      current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will compare PVB using Ropivacaine 0.2% combined with a GA,&#xD;
      to GA alone with systemic analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The purpose of this study is to compare GA with systemic analgesia to GA with PVB.&#xD;
      The parameters examined will be pain scores, perioperative opioid analgesia requirement, and&#xD;
      PONV. Complications of PVB will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis GA plus PVB will reduce pain scores at rest and on movement, the need for rescue&#xD;
      analgesia, and the incidence of PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Breast Cancer listed for surgery at the University Hospital of Alberta and the&#xD;
      Cross Cancer Hospital. The study will commence following ethical approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations are required to determine recruitment numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be identified by the breast surgeons in their clinic, and potential&#xD;
      recruits will be provided with information regarding the study protocol and techniques on&#xD;
      that day. Patient consent will be obtained by the investigating team (study coordinator or&#xD;
      anesthesiologist) on the day of surgery. Randomisation of participants will also occur at&#xD;
      this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those randomised to the PVB group, a block will be placed under sedation by one of the&#xD;
      Acute Pain Service experienced in paravertebral blocks. The sham block group will receive&#xD;
      some subcutaneous saline under ultrasound guidance, mild sedation and local anesthetic skin&#xD;
      infiltration. All patients will receive a standard GA and post-operative protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not wish to enrol in the study will receive a general anesthetic plus&#xD;
      appropriate analgesia according to the operating room anesthesiologist. No data will be&#xD;
      recorded, apart from the fact that they declined to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Post-operative analgesia requirement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maximum pain score in the 24 hours following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of PONV requiring additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maximum pain score in recovery at rest and on shoulder abduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of perioperative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Intraoperative opioid requirement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Concerns:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral blocks have been used for many years. Major complications are rare. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that ultrasound should reduce these complications further as&#xD;
      anatomical structures are directly visualized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major concerns:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pleural puncture and pneumothorax&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Paravertebral hematoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intrathecal local anesthetic injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Local anesthetic toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Paravertebral infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor concerns:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Block failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epidural spread of local anaesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Horner's Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Injection site hematoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Paravertebral block The patient will be reviewed by the study investigator then moved to&#xD;
           the block area.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Paravertebral block will be sited following intravenous access, commencement of IV&#xD;
           crystalloid, and standard patient monitoring. A time out will confirm side of surgery&#xD;
           which will be marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sedation and oxygen will be commenced prior to insertion of the block. The patient will&#xD;
           be positioned in the seated position with the side of surgery clearly marked. The level&#xD;
           between the transverse processes of T2 and T3 will be identified using ultrasound, then&#xD;
           injection of 1% lidocaine to skin. Tissue movement and hydrolocation will confirm block&#xD;
           needle position, with anterior movement of the pleura being the end point. Once this is&#xD;
           reached, 20cc of ropivacaine 0.2% will be injected. The patients will progress to the&#xD;
           standard anesthetic protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sham block The patient will be taken to the block area, where the IV and monitors will&#xD;
           be connected as usual. Sedation and oxygen will be commenced. The sham block will occur&#xD;
           as described for the true paravertebral block, including injection of lidocaine to&#xD;
           anesthetize the skin, except that a small amount of normal saline (volume of which will&#xD;
           be left to the anesthesiologist's discretion) will be injected subcutaneously instead of&#xD;
           injection of ropivacaine next to the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the operating table, routine plus Bispectral (BIS) monitoring will be attached. If no&#xD;
           midazolam has been administered, 0.03mg/kg will be given intravenously (IV). Fentanyl 1&#xD;
           microgram per kilogram IV will be given. Propofol will be titrated to allow insertion of&#xD;
           a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), unless intubation is necessary. This will be at the&#xD;
           discretion of the operating room anesthetist. Propofol via pump will be given at&#xD;
           200mcg/kg/min, aiming for a BIS score between 35 and 50. Phenylephrine or ephedrine can&#xD;
           be titrated as necessary to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure above 60, or greater&#xD;
           than 75% of the starting mean pressure. Spontaneous ventilation with pressure support&#xD;
           will be used to maintain an end tidal carbon dioxide level of less than 50mmHg. Fentanyl&#xD;
           (25mcg boluses) will be titrated to a respiratory rate of 8 - 15 breaths per minute.&#xD;
           Ketorolac 15mg and Ondansetron 4mg IV will be given unless contra-indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-operative Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will receive standard post-operative orders:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will receive tramacet 3 tablets PO. Morphine 2mg IV will be given every 5&#xD;
           minutes as required for pain reported on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of greater than&#xD;
           5. If intolerant of morphine, hydromorphone 0.4mg IV will be used. Further Ondansetron&#xD;
           4mg followed by 2 doses of Dimenhydrinate 25mg will be given for nausea and/or vomiting.&#xD;
           Oxygen will be used to maintain saturations greater than 93%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acetaminophen 975mg 6 hourly and Ibuprofen 400mg with meals three times daily will be&#xD;
           given.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Failure of this regime to control pain will trigger the addition of rescue analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rescue analgesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tramadol - 50 - 100mg po Q6h prn Oxycodone 5 - 10mg po Q3h prn Hydromorphone - 1mg sc&#xD;
           Q2h PRN The patients will be assessed prior to PARR discharge regarding their pain&#xD;
           scores at rest and on movement, and again on the morning following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data Collection Data will be collected on a study sheet. Information will be kept&#xD;
           confidential with no patient identifiers on the form, apart from a study number. This&#xD;
           will reference a list kept securely by the investigators containing the patients' ULI&#xD;
           numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre- and intra-operative data recorded will be: demographic (age, weight, height), the&#xD;
      surgical procedure, the amount of fentanyl, ephedrine and phenylephrine and propofol used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovery data recorded will be: the amount of morphine or hydromorphone required, any&#xD;
      anti-emetics given, the maximum pain score in recovery at rest and on shoulder abduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from recovery, the data recorded will be: anti-emetic use, rescue analgesia&#xD;
      use, maximum pain score in the first 24 hours at rest and on movement.&#xD;
