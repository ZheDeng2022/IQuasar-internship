  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In internal medicine, assessment of spleen size on physical examination is an extremely&#xD;
      important part of the overall evaluation of patients with many illnesses. Examination of the&#xD;
      spleen is also one of the core competencies that the investigators expect the students and&#xD;
      residents to learn as part of their training. Unfortunately, the sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of examination of the spleen at the bedside is not very good. The investigators wish to&#xD;
      determine if medical residents can be taught to use hand carried ultrasound to accurately&#xD;
      assess spleen size. Doing so would make physical examination of the spleen obsolete and&#xD;
      transform training objectives for medical trainees.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of splenomegaly is extremely important in managing patients with blood&#xD;
      disorders and other medical conditions, such as cirrhosis. The ability to recognize an&#xD;
      enlarged spleen in a timely manner can impact patient outcomes. Although the physical exam&#xD;
      can be confidently used to diagnosis massive enlargement of the spleen, evaluating lesser&#xD;
      degrees of splenomegaly at the bedside proves more difficult. In current practice, the gold&#xD;
      standard for diagnosis of splenomegaly is the conventional abdominal ultrasound. The&#xD;
      prevalence of splenomegaly in patients with blood conditions and other medical disorders is&#xD;
      relatively high. Therefore, the demand for abdominal ultrasound is growing and similarly the&#xD;
      cost of caring for patients with these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, examination of the spleen is one of the core competencies that the investigators&#xD;
      expect the students and residents to learn as part of their training. This physical diagnosis&#xD;
      maneuver is frequently used to examine residents at the Royal College level and determine&#xD;
      their fitness to practice. Unfortunately, the sensitivity and specificity of examination of&#xD;
      the spleen at the bedside is not very good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the introduction of hand carried ultrasound (HCU) devices, rapid bedside assessment of a&#xD;
      patient is now possible. The Visual scan (VScan) (GE Healthcare, USA) allows for 2D imaging&#xD;
      on a 3.5 inch display and has shown to have comparable image quality to standard ultrasound&#xD;
      for some applications. The VScan and other HCU have been used at point of care to evaluate a&#xD;
      number of conditions and can greatly impact treatment decisions in medical patients at the&#xD;
      bedside. The ability to recognize splenomegaly in a timely manner can impact patient&#xD;
      outcomes. In addition, the use of this technology could significantly impact training&#xD;
      standards for students and residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains unclear whether bedside evaluation with the VScan is able to accurately measure&#xD;
      spleen size. The investigators conducted an extensive literature review and the investigators&#xD;
      were unable to find any studies attempting to accurately assess spleen size with HCU. The&#xD;
      investigators recently demonstrated that trained ultrasonographers can reliably assess spleen&#xD;
      size at the bedside using a VScan. The current study aims to determine the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of the VScan when used by medical residents who have been trained in its use, in&#xD;
      patients with varying degrees of splenomegaly, including normal spleen size. If the&#xD;
      investigators can show that medical residents can accurately characterize spleen size at the&#xD;
      bedside with a hand carried device, the next stage of the study will be to determine how the&#xD;
      investigators can integrate HCU with physical examination at the bedside to assess spleen&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, Specification of Endpoints, and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a validation study in 50 patients who have medical conditions that&#xD;
      may result in varying degrees of splenomegaly (including normal spleen size) and who are&#xD;
      looked after in the hematology clinics at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited based on information provided in the charts in the private offices of hematologists&#xD;
      at VGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also enroll 20 first year medical residents. First year residents will&#xD;
      be sent a letter by email describing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each medical resident will undergo a one hour training sessions by an ultrasonographer&#xD;
      regarding the use of HCU to assess spleen size. At the end of the session, they will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the sonographer to make sure they know how to use the HCU to acquire images of&#xD;
      the spleen. If they are not proficient they will undergo a subsequent one hour training&#xD;
      session. On a separate day, a trained ultrasonographer will perform a conventional ultrasound&#xD;
      on each patient to accurately measure their spleen size. This information will be provided to&#xD;
      the patients hematologist. Subsequently residents will attempt to measure the size of the&#xD;
      patient's spleen using the VScan. Each patient will be scanned 5 times by 5 different&#xD;
      residents. Each resident will be blinded as to the patient's underlying medical conditions&#xD;
      and the results of previous scans. Variables of interest include: adequacy of the study,&#xD;
      findings on 2D imaging, overall diagnosis of presence of splenomegaly, confidence level in&#xD;
      diagnosis and time to complete test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to determine if medical residents can use a hand carried ultrasound device to&#xD;
      accurately assess spleen size.&#xD;
