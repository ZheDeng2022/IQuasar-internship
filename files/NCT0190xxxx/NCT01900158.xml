      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an uncommon adenocarcinoma arising from the neoplastic&#xD;
      transformation of cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells lining the intra-hepatic and&#xD;
      extra-hepatic bile ducts. CCA accounts for about 3% of all digestive tumours and 10-15% of&#xD;
      the hepatobiliary tumours. It has an annual incidence of 1-2 cases per 100,000 in the Western&#xD;
      World, but rates of CCA have been steadily rising worldwide over the past several decades. On&#xD;
      a global scale, CCA is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy These tumours have a&#xD;
      poor overall survival with a 5-year survival of about 5%. Over 50% of patients present with&#xD;
      advanced-stage disease, and the prognosis is poor with the survival of between 6-12 months&#xD;
      for unresected patients, even after biliary decompression. CCA may arise anywhere in the&#xD;
      biliary tree, from the small, peripheral hepatic ducts to the distal common bile duct.&#xD;
      Commonly used classification systems utilise anatomical location to group tumours into three&#xD;
      main categories: intra-hepatic (20-25%), perihilar (also including hilar/Klatskin tumour -&#xD;
      50%) and distal (20-25%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hilar CCA is an adenocarcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary tree arising from the main left or&#xD;
      right hepatic ducts or their confluence. There has a been a growing recognition that hilar&#xD;
      CCA disease actually has a distinct biological behaviour and natural history compared to that&#xD;
      of (distal) extra-hepatic CCA, and increasing acknowledgment that different therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies are required. At initial presentation of patients with extra-hepatic CCA, 30-50%&#xD;
      will have local lymph node involvement and 10-20% metastatic spread typically to the liver&#xD;
      and peritoneum. With hilar CCA due to the long asymptomatic course, only 20% are resectable&#xD;
      at time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment options for CCA include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, dependent&#xD;
      upon if the CCA is intra- or extra-hepatic. Tumour resection is the only potential cure for&#xD;
      CCA. Recent advances in transplantation using stringent selection criteria and utilization of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation have demonstrated encouraging results with 5 year survival rates&#xD;
      of over 70%, with even one series from The Mayo Clinic yielding a 5-year survival rate of&#xD;
      82%. For the 80% who present with unresectable disease, the utility of these modalities&#xD;
      combined with biliary decompression interventions only provided a median survival time of 3-6&#xD;
      months from the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these patients with inoperable advanced CCA the main treatment aim is palliative to&#xD;
      relieve local symptoms such as pain and jaundice. Surgery for these patients is primarily for&#xD;
      creating a bypass in patients who cannot be stented. CCA is remarkably resistant to&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy, but activity has been seen using chemotherapy; mainly gemcitabine&#xD;
      given either as monotherapy or paired with either a platin derivative or a fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
      as a doublet treatment and more recently docetaxel, these give partial response (PR) rates of&#xD;
      0-9% and an average survival advantage of 2-12 months. Concerning biological therapy, the&#xD;
      ongoing studies using sorafenib, lapatinib or bevacizumab have yielded some promising&#xD;
      results, with sorafenib demonstrating therapeutic benefit in a single arm Phase II study. For&#xD;
      patients who are unsuitable for curative resection, the current systemic combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy is with cisplatin plus gemcitabine. This was established in the largest&#xD;
      randomized phase III study to date in non-operable biliary tract cancer which demonstrated a&#xD;
      response rate of 81.4% and a median overall survival (OS) of 11.7 months; notably there was&#xD;
      no statistically significant increase in toxicity when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy.&#xD;
      The recent advances in interventional and endoscopic technology have seen a rise in highly&#xD;
      specialized centres that are able to deliver very precise local control treatments aimed at&#xD;
      gaining local control; these include local ablation and embolization, brachytherapy,&#xD;
      radio-frequency ablation and, most significantly, photodynamic therapy which (PDT), with its&#xD;
      favourable adverse-event profile, is recommended by most recent review articles for&#xD;
      non-resectable patients.&#xD;
