  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it makes sense to test people for celiac disease who&#xD;
      have a first or second degree relative (parent, sibling, child, grandparent, aunt or uncle)&#xD;
      with celiac disease. The investigators will check to see what differences there are in the&#xD;
      health and quality of life between those who know they have celiac disease and start the&#xD;
      gluten free diet and those who do not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our overall hypothesis is that first and second degree relatives of individuals with celiac&#xD;
      disease benefit from screening and diagnosis of celiac disease. Secondary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number needed to test and cost to benefit one person though celiac disease screening&#xD;
           are within acceptable ranges of 33 tested and &lt; $10,000 spent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment does not lead to adverse metabolic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intestinal biopsy is unnecessary for accurate diagnosis in a substantial subset of&#xD;
           adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Determine the effect of screen detected celiac disease on health related quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate change in health related quality of life at one year in participants randomized&#xD;
           to the screen detected, early diagnosis cohort compared to the screen detected, delayed&#xD;
           diagnosis, clinically detected and non-celiac control cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate change in symptoms, psychological well-being and burden of treatment at one&#xD;
           year in the screen detected, early diagnosis cohort compared to the screen detected,&#xD;
           delayed diagnosis, clinically detected and non-celiac control cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the cost per diagnosis and the number needed to test for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           individuals who will have a clinically meaningful improvement in health related quality&#xD;
           of life attributable to treatment of celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the effect of screen detected celiac disease on nutritional and metabolic&#xD;
      indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare changes bone density, body mass index, Reynolds Cardiovascular Risk Score, and&#xD;
           nutritional indices at one year in the screen detected, early diagnosis cohort compared&#xD;
           to the screen detected, delayed diagnosis, clinically detected and non-celiac control&#xD;
           cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the reliability of using serologic tests in combination with intestinal fatty&#xD;
      acid binding protein vs. intestinal biopsy to confirm celiac disease diagnosis in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospectively assess the sensitivity and specificity of a novel non-invasive celiac&#xD;
           diagnostic algorithm in comparison to the current gold standard of small intestinal&#xD;
           biopsy histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model the cost of modified, non-invasive celiac testing vs. classical testing with&#xD;
           endoscopic biopsy in both screen-detected and clinically identified celiac disease.&#xD;
