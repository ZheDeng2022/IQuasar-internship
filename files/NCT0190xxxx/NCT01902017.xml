  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injured joints, especially at the elbow, are at risk for permanent motion loss, also known as&#xD;
      joint contractures. Joint contractures limit the function of an elbow and are a recognized&#xD;
      complication that occurs often after a traumatic injury. The benefits of early motion after&#xD;
      injury has helped in preventing joint contractures but there are still several patients that&#xD;
      develop debilitating joint contractures. Current research suggests that mast cells, which are&#xD;
      found in the joint, are key in causing joint contractures. Research has been done using a&#xD;
      medication called Ketotifen. Ketotifen has been linked to stabilizing mast cells and&#xD;
      preventing the joint contracture. It is hoped that short-term use of this medication after an&#xD;
      injury will prevent the contracture from occurring.&#xD;

      Individuals ≥ 18 years old with isolated distal 1/3 humerus and/or proximal 1/3 ulna and/or&#xD;
      proximal 1/3 radius fractures and/or elbow dislocations (open fractures with or without nerve&#xD;
      injury may be included) and presented to Peter Lougheed Centre (PLC), Foothills Medical&#xD;
      Center (FMC), or South Health Campus (SHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were required to take Ketotifen 5mg by mouth twice a day for 6 weeks or placebo&#xD;
      twice a day by mouth for 6 weeks. Neither the participant nor the physician knew if the&#xD;
      participant was taking Ketotifen or placebo. Sometimes this type of injury requires surgery.&#xD;
      This study invited both patients that do and do not require surgery to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We took a sample of blood to measure tryptase (normally found in the body). We predicted&#xD;
      people with high levels of tryptase were more likely to develop stiffening in the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were asked to return for follow up visits 2, 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery or date of initial injury if surgery was not required. These visits were part of&#xD;
      normal care for this type of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the visit participants were asked to do the following, some of which was not part of&#xD;
      normal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit: Range of motion of the elbow was assessed, DASH score was completed- form&#xD;
      helping the research group understand the level of disability from this injury, X-rays until&#xD;
      the fracture was considered healed (this was normal treatment), SF12 - questionnaire about&#xD;
      how the patient was feeling and coping with their injury, Additional information was&#xD;
      collected about how the injury was healing and weight was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant was required to have physiotherapy which is normal treatment for this injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant was contacted by telephone at week 1, 3, 4 and 5 while taking the study&#xD;
      medication. During these times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant was asked about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any problems with the study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any new conditions or concerns that have developed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant was reminded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  of next visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to continue to take study drug as instructed&#xD;
&#xD;
      During these telephone contacts, if any problems were detected that could not be rectified or&#xD;
      figured out during the telephone interview, then participant was asked to attend the Cast&#xD;
      Clinic to see their doctor in person.&#xD;
