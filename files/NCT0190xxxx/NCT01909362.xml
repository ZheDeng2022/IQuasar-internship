      Patients are being asked to participate in this study who have colorectal cancer that has&#xD;
      come back after initial treatment. The investigators want to improve treatment in patients&#xD;
      with this disease. In other types of cancers, it has been possible to improve treatment by&#xD;
      studying the gene mutations (called biomarkers) in a patient's cancer and &quot;matching&quot; these to&#xD;
      existing cancer therapies or study drugs which target that specific mutation. Colorectal&#xD;
      cancers have not been routinely tested in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will determine whether mutational testing can be successfully&#xD;
      done on colorectal cancers and how often mutations are detected for which there are existing&#xD;
      drugs (or drugs in development). The results will be used to determine if treating physicians&#xD;
      use this information in planning subsequent treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a short-term, prospective, feasibility study to determine how effectively&#xD;
      investigators can obtain biomarker analysis on patients with mCRC from whom informed consent&#xD;
      and authorization will be obtained. The study will be done in partnership with Quintiles.&#xD;
      Investigators will be collecting data on the number of clinically actionable biomarkers that&#xD;
      can be detected in each population and the number of trial actionable markers that can be&#xD;
      detected in these populations. Patients with recurrent metastatic disease (ie, first&#xD;
      diagnosis of metastatic disease following resection, last radiation, or last chemotherapy in&#xD;
      the adjuvant setting) will have their primary specimen sent for a biomarker analysis.&#xD;
      Actionable markers or genomic alterations will be FDA-approved companion diagnostic markers&#xD;
      and markers used for trial enrollment in metastatic colorectal cancer. Additional information&#xD;
      regarding FDA-approved companion diagnostic markers and markers used for trial enrollment in&#xD;
      indications other than mCRC will also be collected and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biospecimens from 25 patients who have had early recurrence (≤ 12 months) and 25 patients who&#xD;
      have had late recurrence (&gt; 12 months) of their metastatic colorectal cancer will be&#xD;
      appropriately collected, processed, shipped, and tested. The frequency and sites of mutation&#xD;
      may be hypothesis generating to help identify those patients at higher risk for early&#xD;
      recurrence and aid in identifying future treatment options and in selecting better treatment&#xD;
      options for this poor prognostic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGISTRATION PROCEDURES Written documentation of full, noncontingent IRB approval must be on&#xD;
      file before a patient can be registered. The registration process begins when the coordinator&#xD;
      has obtained a signed informed con-sent. Patient demographics will be into the Clinical Trial&#xD;
      Management System (CTMS); this is the Web-based intranet system for the delivery of trial&#xD;
      information across USOR. A unique patient number (UPN) will be assigned to the patient at&#xD;
      that time. Entering a patient into CTMS does not signify that the patient has been registered&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has a UPN number, the coordinator can go to the Patient Report and select&#xD;
      the patient to be registered. Located to the left of the patient's UPN will be the letters&#xD;
      &quot;Reg&quot; in blue. The coordinator will click on the blue &quot;Reg&quot; to open up that patient's&#xD;
      information. Each page that needs to be completed will be in yellow. The site will answer the&#xD;
      questions on the Inclusions, Exclusions, and Prestudy Assessment pages. Once all questions on&#xD;
      each page are answered, that page will turn green. An ID number and study arm will be&#xD;
      directly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES USOR study sites will be supplied with tumor collection kits&#xD;
      through the US Oncology Investigational Product Center (IPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biospecimens will have a date of shipment within 4 weeks of the patient signing the consent&#xD;
      in order to be enrolled in the study. Tissue will be sent to a central laboratory. Details&#xD;
      for shipping will be provided in the Clinical Trials Information (CTI) provided separately by&#xD;
      USOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference laboratory manual for tissue preparation and shipment instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE ANALYSIS AND CONFIDENTIALITY It is the intention of USOR and Quintiles that patient&#xD;
      confidentiality will be maintained throughout the procedure. USOR maintains rigorous&#xD;
      standards of confidentiality for clinical studies by coding samples with patient initials and&#xD;
      a unique identifier (UPN number/patient/study ID number) and study number. A patient is in&#xD;
      screening upon signing the ICF and registered in CTMS. A patient will be considered enrolled&#xD;
      in the study if a standard of care biospecimen is available for biomarker testing with a&#xD;
      shipment date within 4 weeks of ICF signature. If a standard of care biospecimen is&#xD;
      unavailable, for any reason, within 4 weeks the patient is deemed a screen failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOSPECIMEN ASSESSMENT High throughput sequencing utilizing the Life Technologies Ion Torrent&#xD;
      platform or similar alternative will be used. This methodology provides high-quality deep&#xD;
      sequencing coverage ideally suited for SNP detection and mutational analysis. Point mutation&#xD;
      identification analysis will include targeted whole exome sequencing of tumor tissue that&#xD;
      will cover several hundred human protein-coding exons. Results from the profiling will be&#xD;
      compiled and arranged according to relevancy to clinical practice. All clinically actionable&#xD;
      results will be provided back to the physician using the same identifiers referenced above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE TESTING FAILURES Samples submitted for analysis will be from archived FFPE tissue.&#xD;
      Ability to perform the AmpliSeq testing may be limited based on the quality and quantity of&#xD;
      the sample available. Reasons for testing failures may be due to an inability to extract&#xD;
      sufficient quality and quantity of DNA, inability to create a sequencing library or inability&#xD;
      for a sample to sequence. Should a testing failure occur, the reason for the testing failure&#xD;
      will be recorded by the laboratory and reported back to the clinician. A patient will have&#xD;
      the opportunity, in discussion with their study physician, dependent on space in the study&#xD;
      and approval from the US Oncology Clinical Project Manager, be allowed to re-submit one&#xD;
      additional sample for sequencing. If a sample from a patient is a testing failure after 2&#xD;
      testing attempts, the patient is considered a permanent testing failure and will not be&#xD;
      offered an opportunity to submit any additional samples.&#xD;
