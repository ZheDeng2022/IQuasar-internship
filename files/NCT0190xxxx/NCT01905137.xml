      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a change in patient-reported&#xD;
      pelvic pain following pelvic floor injections of 200 units of Botox compared with 20cc of&#xD;
      normal saline.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate the change in patient-reported pelvic pain following pelvic&#xD;
      floor injections of 200 units of Botox compared with 20cc of normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To evaluate the change in patient-reported pelvic pain following Botox&#xD;
      injections in conjunction with pelvic floor physical therapy compared to saline injections&#xD;
      with physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that women in the Botox treatment arm, compared with those in the&#xD;
      saline arm, will have a greater decrease in patient-reported pain on palpation of their most&#xD;
      painful levator ani muscle group at two weeks after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis we will measure patient-reported pain on palpation of each levator&#xD;
      ani muscle group at baseline and two weeks following the injection. Pain will be assessed on&#xD;
      a 10-point visual analog scale. We will compare the baseline and two-week pain measurements&#xD;
      for the most painful muscle group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that with the addition of physical therapy, women in the Botox treatment arm,&#xD;
      compared with those in the saline arm, have a greater decrease in patient-reported pain on&#xD;
      palpation of their most painful levator ani muscle group at 12 weeks after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis we will measure patient-reported pain on palpation of each levator&#xD;
      ani muscle group at baseline and 12 weeks following the injection. Pain will be assessed on a&#xD;
      10-point visual analog scale. We will compare the baseline and 12-week pain measurements for&#xD;
      the most painful muscle group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be screened for eligibility during their routine office visit. If they meet&#xD;
      all eligibility criteria, they will be offered enrollment. At this visit, all patients will&#xD;
      be counseled about conservative treatment options for dealing with irritative voiding&#xD;
      symptoms, bowel symptoms, and pain. The counseling offered will be standardized for all&#xD;
      patients. After patients are consented, they will undergo an initial evaluation with a pelvic&#xD;
      floor physical therapist. Patients will then return for an office visit to receive their&#xD;
      treatment. The patients will be pretreated with 100mg of topical Lidocaine hydrochloride&#xD;
      jelly, 2%, in the vagina for 15 minutes prior to their injections. A designated medical&#xD;
      assistant will open an opaque sealed envelope to determine whether the patient is randomized&#xD;
      to the Botox or saline arm. The medical assistant will draw up the appropriate&#xD;
      solution-either 20mL of saline or 200 units of Botox A diluted in preservative-free saline,&#xD;
      to achieve a concentration of 10 units per mL. Both the Botox and saline will be drawn into 2&#xD;
      unlabeled 10mL syringes in order to ensure the physician remains blinded to treatment arm&#xD;
      assignment. The saline or Botox will be injected to the coccygeus, piriformis, obturator&#xD;
      internus, puborectalis, iliococcygeus, and pubococcygeus muscles bilaterally for a total of&#xD;
      1-2mL per muscle group. Using digital vaginal palpation, the muscles to be injected will be&#xD;
      located with care taken to locate tender and contracted points on the muscle fibers. The&#xD;
      index finger is used for palpation as the 20-gauge pudendal block needle with the guide is&#xD;
      advanced to the target site piercing through the vaginal mucosa to the intended muscle&#xD;
      groups. The needle is placed into the intended muscles under direct palpation for injection&#xD;
      of 1-2mL aliquots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either Botox or saline in a ratio of 1:1 using computer-generated block randomization. The&#xD;
      statistician will create the sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes to conceal group&#xD;
      assignment.Study visits Baseline visit Once determined eligible, patients will be offered&#xD;
      enrollment into the study. After consent forms are signed, we will obtain study data.&#xD;
      Participants will then see a physical therapist at a designated pelvic floor physical therapy&#xD;
      center to evaluate their pelvic floor prior to any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection visit Following the pelvic floor physical therapy assessment, participants will&#xD;
      return to the urogynecology office for their injection of saline or Botox as specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-week post-injection visit At two weeks, patients will return for outcome assessments.&#xD;
      Four-week post-injection visit Patients will return at 4 weeks for the same outcome&#xD;
      assessment they had at 2 weeks. After the 4-week visit, participants will start pelvic floor&#xD;
      physical therapy. They will go to physical therapy for a total of 8 sessions, done as close&#xD;
      to weekly as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve-week post-injection visit At 12 weeks patients will return for outcome assessments.&#xD;
      After all outcome data are collected, the provider and the patient will be unblinded.&#xD;
      Patients who were randomized to the placebo group will be offered 200 Units of Botox&#xD;
      injection at no cost. These 32 patients will be encouraged to continue with weekly physical&#xD;
      therapy for 8 weeks following the Botox injection. We will ask these participants to return&#xD;
      at 2 weeks and 12 weeks after the injection for outcome assessments. During these visits we&#xD;
      will collect the same data as for the 2-week and 12-week visits.&#xD;
