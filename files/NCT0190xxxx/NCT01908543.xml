  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Managing iron deficiency is important for more than 1 billion individuals worldwide, to avoid&#xD;
      blood transfusions, or excessive strain on vital organs that depend on iron-containing&#xD;
      haemoglobin to deliver oxygen to the tissues. Iron deficiency is a particular problem for&#xD;
      people with the inherited condition hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Their iron&#xD;
      deficiency and anaemia results from blood losses, especially from the nose (nosebleeds, and&#xD;
      they often need additional iron to replace that lost through bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to stratify HHT patients into high/low absorbers of iron; to define what extra&#xD;
      iron they need to adjust for their current and likely future blood losses; and to work out&#xD;
      how to achieve this most safely for each individual to improve their later health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis that informed assessment of iron intake and post absorption&#xD;
      cellular profiles changes the recommendations for iron intake for HHT patients.&#xD;

      Relevant patients due to come to clinic or the programmed investigation unit will be offered&#xD;
      the opportunity to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 consenting individuals will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have an additional 15 mls of supplementary research bloods taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive a single tablet of ferrous sulphate 200mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fill in questionnaires that formally evaluate their nosebleed losses and dietary iron&#xD;
           intake in the preceding 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have a second blood sample later that day (20 mls of blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the change in serum iron levels post iron tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome measures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematinic indices indicating whether their iron requirements have been met previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional predicted iron intake requirements to adjust for haemorrhagic iron losses&#xD;

    <description>INTERVENTION: Ferrous sulphate 200mg oral tablet&#xD;
This is a single arm study. Individuals in this arm will&#xD;
have an additional 15 mls of supplementary research bloods taken with their usual clinic bloods&#xD;
receive a single tablet of ferrous sulphate 200mg&#xD;
fill in questionnaires that formally evaluate their nosebleed losses and dietary iron intake in the preceding 12 months&#xD;
have a second blood sample later that day (20 mls of blood&#xD;
