  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons undergoing cardiac rehabilitation often have difficulties transferring the learned&#xD;
      health behaviors into their daily routine which decreases their health status. Computer-based&#xD;
      tailored interventions have been shown to be effective in increasing physical activity as&#xD;
      well as fruit and vegetable consumption. The aim of this study is, to support people in&#xD;
      transferring these two learned behavior changes and their antecedents into their daily life&#xD;
      after cardiac rehabilitation in Germany, the Netherlands and China. The primary goal of the&#xD;
      study is to analyze the effectiveness of a rehabilitation aftercare program with regard to&#xD;
      the level of physical activity and nutrition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For cardiac patients, medical rehabilitation after severe medical incidents (e.g., bypass&#xD;
      surgery, heart attack, heart failure) is a central part in the recovery process. Health&#xD;
      behavior change is an important subject within rehabilitation, and patients have to learn how&#xD;
      to improve their eating habits and increase their physical activity. Back home, the adoption,&#xD;
      maintenance and transfer into daily life of the behavior change is difficult. Until now it is&#xD;
      unclear how such a complex behavior change actually takes place and how it can be supported&#xD;
      effectively. On basis of theoretical assumptions (health action process approach, HAPA,&#xD;
      Schwarzer, 1992, and compenÂ¬satory carry-over action model, CCAM, Lippke, 2010) multiple&#xD;
      behavior change will be observed and supported in an online intervention. To its effects, an&#xD;
      intervention will be provided firstly targeting physical activity, secondly nutrition and&#xD;
      compared with a waiting-list control group. Furthermore, very little is known about&#xD;
      intercultural differences and therefore will be tested with rehabilitation patients with&#xD;
      various cultural backgrounds. This all will be archived in the study RENATA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RENATA is an online based intervention for post-rehabilitative medical care, with the aim to&#xD;
      integrate skills and behavior patterns, which were gained during the rehabilitation, into&#xD;
      daily life of the participants. The goal is to maintain learning results for a long period of&#xD;
      time, improve rehabilitation effects at a sustained basis and support the return to the labor&#xD;
      market i.e. to work. The objective of this research project is to increase the&#xD;
      self-regulatory abilities of participants to the extent that they are able to be regularly&#xD;
      and autonomously physically active and eat healthy, so that they will increase their quality&#xD;
      of life and become resilient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the fact that there is only a limited number of evaluated programs, the present&#xD;
      research project has the aim (1) to offer such a program and to test the effectiveness.&#xD;
      Moreover, compared on an international level it will be considered (2) if such an aftercare&#xD;
      program helps participants equally in different countries with rehabilitation systems varying&#xD;
      in intensity. This question will be investigated by comparing Germany, the Netherlands and&#xD;
      China. Due to the demographic changes, there are rising numbers of older employees in the&#xD;
      labor market who will and should be kept in. Within this context, the last research aim is&#xD;
      (3) to examine age effects in detail: Is it possible to determine age-specific differences in&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the different interventions?&#xD;
