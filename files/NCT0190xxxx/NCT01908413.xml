  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of CUDC-427 in patients with advanced or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. CUDC-427 is a drug that is designed to antagonize&#xD;
      proteins that prevent or interfere with cell death. The study is designed to assess the&#xD;
      safety, including the maximum tolerated dose, the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer&#xD;
      activity of CUDC-427.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CUDC-427 as a single agent administered orally, in subjects with advanced and&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential dose escalation cohorts of oral CUDC-427 are planned. Subject enrollment and dose&#xD;
      escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design. In the absence of intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, each subject will receive a minimum of 1 cycle (21 days) of study treatment, and&#xD;
      may continue to receive additional cycles until disease progression has been documented or&#xD;
      other treatment discontinuation criteria have been met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intrasubject dose escalation will be allowed. During the dose escalation phase, up to 3&#xD;
      additional subjects may be enrolled at previously cleared dose levels to better define the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and activity of the study treatment. Similarly, an MTD expansion cohort&#xD;
      of up to 12 evaluable subjects may also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events as&#xD;
      assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03). A Safety Review&#xD;
      Committee comprised of the Medical Monitor, Principal Investigators, and Sponsor&#xD;
      representatives, will be convened to review safety information and to decide upon dose&#xD;
      escalation and further subject enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to the Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), or the Revised Response Criteria for&#xD;
      Malignant Lymphoma as appropriate for each subject's tumor type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory biological markers of CUDC-427 activity will be assessed in tumor samples (where&#xD;
      available), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma.&#xD;
