  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional phase I/II clinical trial with concomitant local hyperthermia&#xD;
      and proton beam radiotherapy in patients with primary or recurrent unresectable soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcomas of the extremities, trunk, retroperitoneum (except intrabdominal). The primary&#xD;
      purpose would be to assess the safety and efficacy of this approach along with local tumour&#xD;
      regressions and subsequent tumour downstaging, thereby enabling a near total removal of these&#xD;
      tumours following the hyperthermia and proton beam therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperthermia would be delivered at Kantonsspital Aarau (KSA) with superficial or deep&#xD;
      hyperthermia treatment units as may be appropriate. All patients would undergo a&#xD;
      pre-hyperthermia treatment planning and a temperature of around 41.5 Centigrade to 42.5&#xD;
      Centigrade would be aimed during hyperthermia sessions.Hyperthermia would be delivered once a&#xD;
      week and the treatment sessions would last for around 60 minutes of active heating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton bean therapy would be carried out at Center of Proton Therapy, Paul Scherrer Institute&#xD;
      (PSI), Villigen using scanning beam proton therapy. A preoperative dose of 55 - 60 Gray&#xD;
      equivalent (GyE) or those considered for radical treatment, 72-76 GyE would be delivered, 5&#xD;
      days a week at 1.8 - 2 Gy/fr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days of both hyperthermia at KSA and proton therapy at PSI, the time interval between the&#xD;
      two treatments could be 90 to 150 minutes, taking into consideration the time to travel&#xD;
      between the two institutions. Hyperthermia in these days would follow proton beam therapy.&#xD;

             classification (2002). For all primary tumours, biopsy would be done within 2 months&#xD;
             prior to registration and reviewed by the study pathologist. For all recurrent&#xD;
             tumours, if prior biopsy has been done elsewhere, the histopathology would be reviewed&#xD;
             by the study pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
