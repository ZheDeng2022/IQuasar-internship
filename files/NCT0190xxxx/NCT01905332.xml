      This study's aim is to validate a parent-completed brief literacy screening tool (Early&#xD;
      Literacy Screener) at the 4 year well child check using the Get Ready to Read- Revised&#xD;
      screening tool as a gold standard. Four year old children who fall below the cutoff score for&#xD;
      the GRTR-R will be randomized to either receive current standard of care (control group) or a&#xD;
      referral to receive a 6 month home based literacy promoting program (intervention group).&#xD;
      After 6 months, both groups will be retested using the GRTR-R. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      change in raw scores on the GRTR-R in the intervention group after 6 months will be greater&#xD;
      than the change in raw scores in the control group.&#xD;

      Children's reading success can be predicted from their emergent literacy skills, which begin&#xD;
      to develop during the preschool years. Early identification of delays in the development of&#xD;
      emergent literacy skills offers the opportunity for targeted intervention. The Early Literacy&#xD;
      Screener (ELS) is a 5-item parent questionnaire that was developed for use as a rapid tool to&#xD;
      screen preschool children for early indicators of reading problems. The verbally administered&#xD;
      ELS was previously validated on 4 and 5 year old children using the Revised Get Ready to Read&#xD;
      (GRTR-R) as the gold standard. The investigators are now seeking to validate the ELS when&#xD;
      parents fill it out themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GRTR-R screener was developed in 2001 by Whitehurst et al at the National Centre for&#xD;
      Learning Disabilities to address the need for a reliable, evidence based screening tool for&#xD;
      use in preschool children. Its reliability and predictive validity have been established in&#xD;
      previous studies carried out in preschools and Head Start programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The logical next step after screening for reading problems is to establish literacy promoting&#xD;
      interventions. Different literacy intervention programs aimed at improving school readiness&#xD;
      exist within different communities. The interventions vary widely in intensity and content,&#xD;
      and the efficacy of these programs has not yet been well established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently standard care within the Primary Care Network includes the Reach Out and Read&#xD;
      Program. Reach Out and Read (ROR) is a clinical based pediatric literacy program that&#xD;
      partners with pediatricians who prescribe new books to children 6 months to 5 years of age&#xD;
      during routine well-child visits. By integrating literacy into each well-child visit,&#xD;
      pediatricians promote the acquisition of spoken and written language skills in young&#xD;
      children. Starting at 6 months of age, each child coming in for their well-child visit&#xD;
      receives a new age appropriate book from their pediatrician. Pediatricians use the book to&#xD;
      assess language, motor, and cognitive development while discussing with the parent the value&#xD;
      of reading together at home. In addition, at each 4 year old visit instead of a book the&#xD;
      family will receives a parent take home toolkit. This toolkit will contain kindergarten&#xD;
      readiness activities and a book that will help parents prepare their child for kindergarten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Columbus Metropolitan Library (CML) has an early childhood literacy program, known as&#xD;
      Ready to Read. This program reaches out into the community through the Ready to Read Corps&#xD;
      who goes into at-risk communities and works with agencies such as pediatric health centers,&#xD;
      food pantries and benefits offices. It aims to reach parents and caregivers of children birth&#xD;
      to five and share easy literacy-building activities that parents can use at home with their&#xD;
      children. Parents and caregivers receive a kit that includes puppets, board books, and easy&#xD;
      tips for parents to support them in their role as their child's first teacher. Parents are&#xD;
      able to enroll in the Ready to Read home visitation program. Ready to Read Corp members offer&#xD;
      5-6 home visits at no cost, educating parents on early literacy activities in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPARK (Spheres of Proud Achievement in Reading for Kids) is a home-based, family-focused&#xD;
      kindergarten-readiness program that is available in many communities in Ohio. It works&#xD;
      collaboratively with families, schools, and the community. Each month, children receive a new&#xD;
      book, a lesson activity, and educational supplies, and participate in home- or group-based&#xD;
      learning opportunities-all with the goal of increasing the child's success in school and&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These community based literacy intervention programs aim to improve Kindergarten literacy&#xD;
      skills and school readiness. The Ohio Department of Education utilizes an assessment tool&#xD;
      known as the KRA-L (Kindergarten Readiness Assessment - Literacy) to identify children in&#xD;
      need of intervention. This test is administered statewide to all children entering&#xD;
      kindergarten in public and community school districts for the first time. The investigators&#xD;
      are using the KRA-L scores as one of the outcome measures in this study. This assessment is&#xD;
      broken down into three bands which guides decisions about further assessment and instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Band 1 (0-13) assess broadly for intense instruction Band 2 (14-23) assess for targeted&#xD;
      instruction Band 3 (24-29) assess for enriched assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      By law, it must be administered no sooner than four weeks prior to the start of school but&#xD;
      not later than October 1. It tests the following skills:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Answering When and Why Questions - A child who can accurately respond to questions has a&#xD;
           better understanding of what he or she is learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Repeating Sentences - A child who can repeat back a spoken sentence can remember&#xD;
           information&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identifying Rhyming Words - A child who can recognize rhyme patterns in words has a good&#xD;
           understanding of sound in language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Producing Rhyming Words - A child who can play with sounds will be more comfortable with&#xD;
           reading and writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Recognizing Capital and Lower Case Letters - The ability to name the letters of the&#xD;
           alphabet is a strong predictor of reading success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To scientifically validate a system of pediatric office based literacy screening and&#xD;
      assess efficacy of community based literacy interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate the use of the 5-item Early Literacy Screener questionnaire in screening&#xD;
           preschool children for reading problems&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the efficacy of referrals by the doctor to various community-based&#xD;
           interventions available to 4-year-old children identified as having a risk of later&#xD;
           reading problems using a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the efficacy of the community-based interventions themselves in improving&#xD;
           emergent literacy skills in 4-year-old children identified as having a risk of later&#xD;
           reading problems using a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: All 4 year old children who are typically developing and English speaking&#xD;
      attending well child care at the Main Campus Primary Care Clinic at Nationwide Children's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Known developmental delays, visual/auditory or cognitive deficits that&#xD;
      preclude child's participation, lack of proficiency in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be recruited from the Main Campus at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Age&#xD;
      eligible families will be identified at the time of check-in and the research assistants (RA)&#xD;
      will approach them and explain the study to them and obtain informed consent. Parents will&#xD;
      also be asked for permission to obtain KRA-L (Kindergarten Readiness Assessment - Literacy)&#xD;
      scores from the school districts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent for participation in a randomized control trial of interventions will be obtained&#xD;
      from families with 4-year-old children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will complete the 5-item Early Literacy Screener (ELS) questionnaire and the children&#xD;
      will be screened with the 25-item Get Ready to Read-Revised (GRTR-R) Screener. The scores for&#xD;
      the ELS and GRTR-R will be computed and conveyed to the parents. All children participating&#xD;
      in the study will receive a Literacy Toolkit, with literacy information and activities and a&#xD;
      list of community and library resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 4 years 0 months to 4 years 11 months, who fail the GRTR-R will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in a randomized control trial to assess the efficacy of available interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families that consent to participate in this part of the study will be randomized into two&#xD;
      groups. The children in the first group will receive the Literacy Toolkit alone, and will&#xD;
      serve as the control group. The children in the second group will receive information about&#xD;
      Ready to Read Corps and will be offered a referral in addition to the Literacy Toolkit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be invited for follow up after a period of 6 months, when the GRTR-R assessment&#xD;
      will be repeated. KRA-L scores will be obtained from school districts after the children are&#xD;
      enrolled in Kindergarten. At the 6 month follow-up, if a child within our intervention group&#xD;
      fails the GRTR-R a second time, then they will undergo a detailed developmental assessment.&#xD;
      After this assessment, if a developmental delay is not recognized, they will receive a&#xD;
      referral to SPARK.&#xD;
