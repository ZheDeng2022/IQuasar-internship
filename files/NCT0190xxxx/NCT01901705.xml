  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common, chronic skin disease for which only remissive, as opposed to curative,&#xD;
      treatments are available. Traditional Chinese medicine is one of the most frequently chosen&#xD;
      alternative therapies in China and Taiwan, and psoriasis has been treated for centuries with&#xD;
      topical and oral herbal preparations. Topical indigo naturalis ointment has been reported to&#xD;
      exhibit potential anti-psoriatic efficacy. The study objective is to investigate&#xD;
      pharmacological effect and explore targeting mechanisms of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)&#xD;
      Indigo Naturalis topical ointment as a single treatment agent in Chinese subjects with mild&#xD;
      to moderate plaque-type Psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single site, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study of topical&#xD;
      indigo naturalis vs. vehicle alone (placebo) to treat mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis&#xD;
      during an 8-week period. Pharmacological effect will be evaluated by biomarker evaluation and&#xD;
      clinical evaluation. The trial was conducted at the China Medical University Hospital (CMUH),&#xD;
      Taichung, Taiwan. All patients provided written informed consent before inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of CMUH.&#xD;

      Estimated enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 24 subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      mild to moderate psoriasis patients will be randomized into treatment group (n=16) placebo&#xD;
      group (n=8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline and end of the study evaluation on the patients will be performed, including&#xD;
      physical examination, hemogram and blood biochemical analysis (including glutamic-oxaloacetic&#xD;
      transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, and creatinine measurement). The baseline and&#xD;
      end of the study of total body surface area involvement and Psoriasis Area Severity Index&#xD;
      (PASI), PGA, OTPSS scores will be also calculated.&#xD;
