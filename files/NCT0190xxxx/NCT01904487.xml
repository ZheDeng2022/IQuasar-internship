      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This study is being done to examine the role of a chemical GABA in the brain of alcohol&#xD;
      dependent patients. GABA is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous&#xD;
      system. It helps induce relaxation and sleep and balances the brain by inhibiting&#xD;
      over-excitation. Several studies have reported that anxiety disorders such as panic attacks,&#xD;
      seizure disorders, and numerous other conditions including addiction, are all related to low&#xD;
      GABA activity. Therefore, we will examine differences in GABA levels between healthy controls&#xD;
      and subjects with alcohol addiction. Studies such as this are important to the understanding&#xD;
      of the role of GABA in alcohol addiction.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - By comparing the two PET scans (before and after tiagabine) done in the same day, we can&#xD;
      understand more about how much GABA your brain makes and about the activity of your GABA&#xD;
      receptors in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18-45 years of age who are heavy drinkers or healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedures to determine if you are eligible to take part in a research study are called&#xD;
           &quot;screening procedures&quot;. This will require you to come to the investigators office for&#xD;
           approximately ½ day. For this research study, the screening procedures include&#xD;
           comprehensive psychiatric and medical evaluations. Participants be asked to abstain from&#xD;
           drugs and alcohol for the duration of the study and will be required to make trips&#xD;
           several times a week for two weeks to provide clean urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During one of the visits prior to the PET scans, participants will have a magnetic&#xD;
           resonance image (MRI) taken of their brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will be using a technology called Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which is a&#xD;
           method used to take pictures of the body, in this case, the brain. We will be injecting&#xD;
           you with a radiotracer called [11C]flumazenil. A radiotracer is a small amount of a drug&#xD;
           with radioactivity attached. Because the radiotracer temporarily sticks to the GABA&#xD;
           receptors in the brain, the PET scan can then measure the activity at GABA receptors by&#xD;
           measuring the amount of the radiotracer. You will undergo two PET scans with&#xD;
           [11C]flumazenil on one day for this study. After the first PET scan, you will be given&#xD;
           an oral dose of tiagabine (Gabitril®), which is a medication approved for the treatment&#xD;
           of seizure disorder. Tiagabine raises levels of GABA in the brain. It is used in this&#xD;
           study so that we can measure the changes in GABA levels. Blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
           during the PET scans.&#xD;
