  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to test the effectiveness of an investigational imaging technique for detecting&#xD;
      cardiac injury after the administration of certain chemotherapies, such as doxorubicin.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the imaging technique is still being studied and that research&#xD;
      doctors are trying to find out more about it- such as whether the technique can detect lower&#xD;
      levels of cardiac injury after treatment with doxorubicin. It also means that the FDA (the&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved the use of gadolinium or approved the&#xD;
      use of CMR studies for detection of cardiac toxicity after doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy drug that you have been scheduled to be treated with, doxorubicin, has been&#xD;
      associated with the development of heart failure in some patients. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      (CMR) is a type of MRI scan that uses a magnetic field to produce pictures of the heart. The&#xD;
      CMR scan has been used in other studies and information from those other research studies&#xD;
      suggest that this imaging technique may help to better detect differences in the structure of&#xD;
      the heart muscle after treatment with doxorubicin. In this research study, we hope that we&#xD;
      can better detect changes in the heart muscle after treatment with doxorubicin with a CMR&#xD;
      scan in the hopes that cardiac injury can be detected and treated earlier to ultimately&#xD;
      prevent the possible development of heart failure&#xD;

      If you choose to take part in this study, we will ask you to sign this consent form before we&#xD;
      do any study procedures. All participants will come in for a CMR scan prior to their first&#xD;
      treatment with doxorubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Visit 1 Visit 1 will take place prior to starting chemotherapy. The visit will take about&#xD;
      1.5 hours. We will ask you to come to the Shapiro Cardiovascular Center at the Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital or Massachusetts General Hospital for your study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects that qualify, we will bring you for the heart CMR scan, an echocardiogram and&#xD;
      some blood work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood testing: Before your CMR scan we will take some blood via the IV cannula. We will take&#xD;
      about 4 tubes of blood. This is equivalent to 2 ½ tablespoons of blood. From this blood we&#xD;
      will test for blood markers of cardiac injury and compare these results to your other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR Scan: For the CMR scan, you will be asked to lie still on the scanner table that slides&#xD;
      into a tunnel-shaped machine. Four electrocardiogram (EKG) patches with wires attached will&#xD;
      be placed on your chest or your back to check your heart rate. We will place an intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) catheter in one of your arms. An IV catheter is a thin plastic tube that is put into a&#xD;
      vein with a needle. The IV catheter will be used to give you a CMR contrast dye (gadolinium).&#xD;
      The dye will help us to identify subtle changes within the heart muscle. This dye,&#xD;
      gadolinium, is used routinely in CMR studies. We will also draw a sample of blood from the IV&#xD;
      catheter to measure your red blood cell count. Then, the scanner table will move slowly into&#xD;
      the tunnel-shaped CMR machine so the pictures can be taken. The machine is slightly wider&#xD;
      than your body and there may be little room to move. If you feel any discomfort or need to&#xD;
      stop the test, you will be able to tell this to the research staff. You will be able to speak&#xD;
      to them while you are having the CMR and they will be able to speak to you. If you think that&#xD;
      you might be too anxious about being inside the narrow CMR scanner for a long period of time,&#xD;
      we may prescribe a drug called to help relax you if you think it might be helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CMR scan will take one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiogram: An echocardiogram is a test used by doctors to monitor heart function. An&#xD;
      echocardiogram is a safe test that uses ultrasound to image the heart. After completion of&#xD;
      the CMR test, you will have an echocardiogram. This test will take place in the same area as&#xD;
      the CMR test. The echocardiogram test will take 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Visit 2: Visit 2 will take place about 2-4 weeks after your last cycle of doxorubicin&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you come back for Visit 2, you will have the same type of CMR scan, echocardiogram and&#xD;
      blood testing that you had during Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Visit 3: At visit three we will perform an exercise test on a bicycle. The test is designed&#xD;
      to test the oxygen consumption of your body when exercising. It provides a way of quantifying&#xD;
      the ability of the body to exercise. This test will take 30 minutes. During this test&#xD;
      subjects sit on the bicycle for at least 3 minutes pedaling at a rate of 60 cycles per minute&#xD;
      and slowly the work-load is increased until peak exercise is obtained. We define peak&#xD;
      exercise as being tired or breathless. Heart rate and blood pressure are recorded during the&#xD;
      test. During the test you will breathe through a mouthpiece from which we will measure oxygen&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
