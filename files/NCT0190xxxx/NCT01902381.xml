    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid (CPI-613) in treating&#xD;
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who failed previous therapy. Sometimes when&#xD;
      chemotherapy or biological therapy is given, it does not stop the growth of tumor cells. The&#xD;
      tumor is said to be resistant to treatment. 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid may interfere&#xD;
      with the growth of tumor cells and may be an effective treatment for myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes that did not respond to previous therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activities of CPI-613 in myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) patients who have failed previous agents (such as decitabine [Dacogen], azacitidine&#xD;
      [Vidaza], growth factors or lenalidomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 6, 8-bis (benzylthio) octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days&#xD;
      1 and 4 of weeks 1-3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.&#xD;
