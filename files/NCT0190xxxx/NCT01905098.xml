  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of sauna use on polychlorinated&#xD;
      biphenyls (PCB) in the blood of healthy human adults, as well as to assess safety,&#xD;
      feasibility, and tolerability, and effects on quality of life and wellness. We hope to&#xD;
      determine if there is a link between lower PCB levels in blood and sauna use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, 2-Arm randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will actively undergo sauna intervention sessions and observation&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time between Phone Screen and the End of Study Visit will vary by individual schedule.&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, a participant will be considered 'actively enrolled' when&#xD;
      s/he has signed the Full Study Consent Form on the first sauna or observation visit (SV1 or&#xD;
      OV1). Each participant will be actively enrolled for at least 7 weeks, but no more than 22&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo Phone Screen for eligibility prior to participating in any&#xD;
      study-related visits. Candidates will first be asked for their oral consent to be screened,&#xD;
      and if granted, questioning will continue. If the participant meets pre-screening criteria&#xD;
      assessed on the phone, they will be asked to schedule an In-Person Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, all participants will participate in an In-Person Screening Visit at&#xD;
      the Bastyr University (BU) Clinical Research Center (CRC) for: informed consent, to have a&#xD;
      blood draw for screening lab analysis, anthropomorphic measurements, a 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      assessment, provide demographic data, and medical history assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants remain interested and eligible, they will be randomized into either&#xD;
      Sauna-First Arm or Observation-First Arm within 2 weeks of eligibility ascertainment using&#xD;
      block randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will know that they are in an intervention, but will not know their PCB levels,&#xD;
      or the results of questionnaire assessments until approximately three months after the end of&#xD;
      the study. The PI will review monitoring and AE data, but will be blinded to PCB data during&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, randomization, and informed consent, study participants in either Arm will&#xD;
      either complete a 3-week observation period followed by a 3-week medically monitored&#xD;
      sauna-based detoxification intervention; or will first complete a 3-week medically monitored&#xD;
      sauna-based detoxification intervention, followed by a 3-week observation period. Each&#xD;
      participant will also have an End of Study Visit at least 7 days after the last study visit&#xD;
      (Sauna or Observation Visit -depending on the Arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sauna will be pre-warmed to 160 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity set to 25% +/- 5%.&#xD;
      Participants will have a scheduled 10-min break every 30 minutes of sauna, during which time&#xD;
      vital signs, symptoms, and fluid intake will be assessed and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Sauna Visits weekly lab assessments will be performed to compare participants'&#xD;
      baseline lab values with those during the sauna intervention, and to monitor for safety. In&#xD;
      addition, weekly serum samples will be taken for PCB assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each Observation Visit a blood draw for Complete Blood Count with Differential&#xD;
      (CBC/D), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), and PCBs analysis will be performed, as well as&#xD;
      query for symptoms and MOSES questionnaire will be assessed.&#xD;
