      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Parents of a child with an undiagnosed medical condition face a lot of uncertainty. They&#xD;
      may not know how to take care of their child or how the illness will affect their family&#xD;
      life. Researchers want to study how these parents cope with and adapt to their child s&#xD;
      condition in light of this uncertainty. Being uncertain can make it hard for parents to&#xD;
      adapt. But it also might give them hope. Researchers want to study how uncertain the parents&#xD;
      think their situation is and how that affects the way they think they can cope. Personality&#xD;
      traits, like being able to handle uncertainty and being resilient, might also affect coping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand how having a child with an undiagnosed illness affects the way their parents&#xD;
      think they can cope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults with a child who has a medical condition that has not been diagnosed for at least 2&#xD;
      years and involves at least 2 parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer survey questions for about 30 minutes. The questions are about&#xD;
           their thoughts and feelings about having a child with an undisclosed illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can take the survey on paper or online.&#xD;

      The proposed study aims to test the effect of the degree of perceived uncertainty on coping&#xD;
      efficacy among parents of children with undiagnosed medical conditions. There are many&#xD;
      dimensions to uncertainty when there is no identified cause for a condition that affects one&#xD;
      s child. They include illness identity, management, longevity and life planning, the meaning&#xD;
      of the child s condition for the family and both the child s and the family s social&#xD;
      connections. How parents of children with undiagnosed medical conditions appraise, cope and&#xD;
      ultimately adapt to their child s condition in light of this uncertainty is largely&#xD;
      unexplored. While high levels of perceived uncertainty may be seen as a threat to adaptation,&#xD;
      there is evidence that parents find hope and opportunity in the uncertainty. The literature&#xD;
      suggests that many factors affect how uncertainty is appraised, and higher levels of coping&#xD;
      self-efficacy are associated with more effective coping and ultimately better adaptation.&#xD;
      There is no research that systematically assesses the dimensions of uncertainty perceived by&#xD;
      parents and whether overall perceptions of uncertainty or particular subsets are associated&#xD;
      with coping efficacy. Further, personality traits, such as tolerance of uncertainty and&#xD;
      resilience, may moderate these unexplored relationships. This study s conceptual framework is&#xD;
      based on Lazarus and Folkman s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping and Mishel s&#xD;
      Perceived Uncertainty in Illness Theory. A cross-sectional survey design will be used to&#xD;
      quantitatively assess the relationships between dimensions of uncertainty and coping&#xD;
      efficacy. Participants will be recruited through online support groups, website postings, and&#xD;
      listservs. They will have the option of completing either a paper or online version of the&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
