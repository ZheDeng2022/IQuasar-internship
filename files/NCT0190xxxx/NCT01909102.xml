  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine whether a brief intervention program based on Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy can be effective for the reduction of modifiable risk factors and&#xD;
      improvement of psychological well-being in patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a mindfulness-based intervention which efficacy has&#xD;
      been proven in the treatment of depression and anxiety, in stress reduction and in the&#xD;
      modification of health- related behaviors in patients with several physical conditions. The&#xD;
      application of an acceptance-based program in cardiac patients has revealed high treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction and initial evidences of effectiveness in increasing heart-healthy behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief group-administered program&#xD;
      based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in improving patients' ability to address&#xD;
      modifiable multiple cardiovascular risk factors and overall psychological well-being,&#xD;
      compared with the usual care.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline Health-related quality of life. The Short Form-36 questionnaire for evaluation of Quality Of Life is widely used and gives valuable information on Quality Of Life related to health. The patients' Quality Of Life will be assessed through the following eight fractions: physical function, physical role, general health, social function, experience of pain, mental health, emotional role and vitality.</description>
