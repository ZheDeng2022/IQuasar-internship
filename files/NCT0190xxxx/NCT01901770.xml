      This clinical trial studies an educational intervention for parents and providers in&#xD;
      increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in younger girls in Ohio Appalachia.&#xD;
      Educational interventions may be effective in increasing the number of participants whose&#xD;
      daughters receive HPV vaccination.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Implement a multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention directed at 3 levels within&#xD;
      participating 12 Ohio Appalachia counties that includes information about cervical cancer,&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening, HPV, the HPV vaccine, communication skills training to improve&#xD;
      parent-health care provider conversations about the HPV vaccine, and organizational level&#xD;
      components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention in a&#xD;
      group randomized controlled trial in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Parents and health care providers receive educational materials about HPV vaccination&#xD;
      by mail or in-person review with project staff including a culturally tailored HPV and&#xD;
      cervical cancer educational video and brochures, a question and answer (Q &amp; A) fact sheet,&#xD;
      and a HPV and cervical cancer resource list. Clinics receive waiting and exam room posters&#xD;
      and brochures, tabletop cards, reminder cards to mail to participants, an information&#xD;
      resource list, newsletter, vaccine tracking system, and &quot;invitation to be vaccinated&quot; letter&#xD;
      to mail to parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Parents and health care providers receive educational materials about influenza&#xD;
      vaccination by mail or in-person review with project staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
