      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This research is being done to describe the types of bacteria found in the mouths of&#xD;
      patients who have severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and are treated with drugs that suppress the&#xD;
      immune system or with stem cell transplant. People with SAA who receive these treatments are&#xD;
      more likely to get infections. Studies show that there might be a link between the bacteria&#xD;
      in your mouth and those bacteria that can cause infections. The bacteria found in the mouths&#xD;
      of patients with SAA will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand the changes in mouth bacteria that are related to treatment and to describe&#xD;
      the oral bacterial environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults at least 18 years of age who are going to be treated for SAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their medical history and dental care. Their&#xD;
           mouths will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with SAA will be tested during treatment for their disease, over the course&#xD;
           of 1 year. All participants with SAA will be tested at 3 scheduled appointments. Any&#xD;
           participants who require a breathing tube will receive additional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will be tested during 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give two samples each time. A saliva sample will be taken with a&#xD;
           disposable padded tool. Skin cells will be collected from the tongue with a small&#xD;
           plastic brush.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mouth is a complex biological ecosystem normally containing over 700 different species of&#xD;
      bacteria. Some of these bacteria live in an exopolysacchride matrix biofilm and occupy&#xD;
      specific niches in this complex oral environment. Understanding the oral environment and the&#xD;
      microbiota that inhabit it will assist in determining their impact on health and disease.&#xD;
      There are several studies in critically ill patients demonstrating changes in oral bacteria&#xD;
      related to acute illness. Identification of respiratory pathogens in the mouth has led&#xD;
      researchers to hypothesize that a relationship exists between the oral cavity and pulmonary&#xD;
      infections. This descriptive study will characterize the oral microbiota of patients who have&#xD;
      severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Patients will be followed for 1 year after treatment for&#xD;
      development of respiratory symptoms that require intubation. A difference in the oral&#xD;
      microbiome will be identified in specimens collected before and after treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  All adult patients who are scheduled to receive treatment for SAA will be screened for&#xD;
             this protocol. These patients will be recruited from the numerous protocols that are&#xD;
             actively accepting new research participants at the Clinical Center, NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any adult patient (greater than or equal to18 years of age), diagnosed with SAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any SAA patient found to have significant tooth loss from decay or is edentulous are&#xD;
        excluded. This exclusion criteria will be assessed by the PI or her representative prior to&#xD;
        signing the informed consent.&#xD;
