      The goal of this investigator-initiated study is to determine whether the fortification of&#xD;
      orange juice with vitamin D, vitamin A, and vitamin E will enhance the vitamin D, vitamin A,&#xD;
      and vitamin E status children ages 6-10 that are seen at the Division of Pediatrics at Boston&#xD;
      University Medical Center. Circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D],&#xD;
      vitamin A, and vitamin E before, will be measured at mid-intervention (week 6), and after a&#xD;
      period of twelve weeks. This study plans to recruit 180 male and female subjects between the&#xD;
      ages of 6 and 10. An informed consent will be explained and discussed with the subjects and&#xD;
      their parents/guardians willing to participate in the study. The study will be twelve weeks.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn during the initial visit, mid-intervention (week 6), and week 12. Dietary&#xD;
      intake will be assessed at baseline and at the conclusion of the 12-week intervention using a&#xD;
      3-day food record. The subjects will be randomized in a double-blinded manner via an&#xD;
      electronically shuffled listed. Subjects will be randomized to receive one of three&#xD;
      beverages: (1) calcium plus vitamin D fortified orange juice (intervention A), (2) calcium&#xD;
      plus vitamins D, A, and E fortified orange juice (intervention B) or (3) calcium-only&#xD;
      fortified orange juice (controls). Subjects in all groups will drink two 8-oz. glasses of&#xD;
      juice at least six hours apart (morning and afternoon) per day for a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to intervention A will receive 200 IU vitamin D and 700 mg of calcium per&#xD;
      day in 2 glasses of juice, intervention B will receive 200 IU vitamin D, 12 IU vitamin E,&#xD;
      2000 IU vitamin A as beta carotene, and 700 mg of calcium per day in 2 glasses of juice,&#xD;
      while controls will receive 700 mg of calcium per day in 2 glasses of juice. A blood sample&#xD;
      will be obtained before the subjects begin drinking the orange juice and at week 12 to&#xD;
      determine levels of 25(OH)D which is a measure of vitamin D status. Blood will also be used&#xD;
      for determining osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus,&#xD;
      calcium, C-telopeptide (CTX), albumin, vitamin A, and vitamin E. A blood sample will also be&#xD;
      obtained at week 6 for 25(OH)D and PTH.&#xD;

      This is an investigator-initiated double-blinded study in which one hundred and eighty male&#xD;
      and female subjects ages 6 to 10 will be recruited from the Division of Pediatrics at Boston&#xD;
      University Medical Center. Potential volunteers will undergo a screening process to ensure&#xD;
      that inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. A general medical history will be taken before&#xD;
      the study starts. A baseline biochemical profile (blood) including calcium, phosphorus,&#xD;
      osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, C-telopeptide (CTX), 25(OH)D, PTH, albumin, vitamin A, and&#xD;
      vitamin E will be determined after the study is completed. The amount of blood estimated to&#xD;
      be drawn on the first visit is 27 ml. Dietary intake will be assessed from 3 day food records&#xD;
      via NDS-Minnesota Database by Dr. Christine Economos, Friedman School of Nutrition Science&#xD;
      and Policy at Tufts University. Once the subject has met the inclusion criteria, he/she will&#xD;
      receive two gallons of orange juice via a delivery service to their home. He/she will be&#xD;
      instructed to drink two 8 oz. glasses of orange juice a day and record each glass of juice&#xD;
      that was drunk; stickers and calendars will be provided. A delivery service will be used to&#xD;
      deliver juice to parents/caregiver biweekly. Signature and log sheets of deliveries will be&#xD;
      maintained. A glass that has a mark designating eight ounces will be provided to the subject&#xD;
      so that the amount of orange juice that is drunk is measured. Sixty subjects will receive&#xD;
      intervention A, sixty subjects will receive intervention B, and sixty subjects will receive&#xD;
      intention C. Subjects randomized to intervention A will receive juice that contains 200 IU of&#xD;
      vitamin D and 700 mg of calcium per day. Subjects randomized to intervention B will receive&#xD;
      200 IU vitamin D, 12 IU vitamin E, 2000 IU vitamin A as beta-carotene, and 700 mg of calcium&#xD;
      per day. Subjects randomized to intervention C will receive 700 mg calcium per day. A venous&#xD;
      blood sample of 27 ml [two red top tubes (10ccs each) and one purple top tube (7ccs)] will be&#xD;
      obtained at the initial and final visits. 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, phosphorus, osteocalcin,&#xD;
      C-telopeptide(CTX), alkaline phosphatase, albumin, vitamin A, and vitamin E will be measured&#xD;
      from the blood samples. During the mid-intervention blood draw (week 6) 10mL of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn and 25(OH)D and PTH will be measured. The study will consist of 12 weeks of drinking&#xD;
      two eight-ounce glasses of orange juice a day (one in the am and one in the pm).&#xD;
