      Participants : This study was conducted prospectively at the outpatient clinic, Department of&#xD;
      Obstetrics and Gynecology, Songklanagarind Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria : The women who had abnormal uterine bleeding and indication for&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria : included 1) contraindications to NSAID or Lidocaine - known sensitivity&#xD;
      to these drugs; 2) pregnancy; 3) genital tract infection; 4) coagulation disorder; and 5)&#xD;
      unstable vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation : Sample size was calculated by assuming the different mean pain&#xD;
      score of each groups performing the endometrial biopsy to be 1. To evidence this difference&#xD;
      with a power of 80% and a 5% level of significance, a need was calculated with 36 women in&#xD;
      each group and for total was 108 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Z α/2 = Type I error(alpha error) α = 0.05 &gt;&gt; 1.96 Z β = Type II error(beta error) β = 0.2 &gt;&gt;&#xD;
      0.84&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variance of mean pain score between procedure and post procedure 15 minutes = 1.5 µ0 =&#xD;
           Mean pain score in group 1 µ1 = Mean pain score in group 2 µ0 - µ1 = Different of mean&#xD;
           pain score in between each groups = 1 **N = 2(1.5)2(1.96 + 0.84)2/(1)2 = 35.3 N = 36 per&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explain the steps of the procedure to the patient and counseling regarding rational and&#xD;
           risks/benefits. Obtain consent for the procedure. Perform bimanual exam to determine&#xD;
           uterine size and position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After signing a written informed consent, the women were randomly allocated to 3 groups.&#xD;
           All women will receive Acetaminophen 500 mg and Ibuprofen 400 mg before procedure 30&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first groups receive paracervical block with 1%lidocaine and 0.9%NSS spray(placebo),&#xD;
           the second groups receive 10%lidocaine spray and paracervical block with&#xD;
           0.9%NSS(placebo) and the third groups receive placebo both paracervical block and spray.&#xD;
           Both women and researcher associate were blinded to group allocation. The 1%lidocaine,&#xD;
           10%lidocaine spray and both placebos were prepared in sequentially numbered sealed&#xD;
           opaque envelops according to the table of random numbers by an independent pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The time that start oral medication and vital signs before starting procedure were&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Starting procedure by using largest appropriate speculum for maximum cervical exposure.&#xD;
           Cleanse the cervix with povidone iodine. Then administer paracervical block by using&#xD;
           local anesthetic drug 5 ml. injects at cervical area 3 and 9 O'clock, depth 0.5-1 cm.,&#xD;
           2.5 ml. each sides. After that use anesthetic spray sprays at cervix for 1 times and&#xD;
           wait for 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Endometrial biopsy was performed by using a 3-mm EndosamplerTM (MedGyn EndosamplerTM,&#xD;
           MedGyn Product Inc, IL, USA). If insertion of EndosamplerTM failed, a tenaculum was&#xD;
           applied to the anterior cervix to help for stabilization and counter-traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After get the endometrial tissue sample, remove all equipments, checked and stopped&#xD;
           bleeding. And record vital signs after finish the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The form contained a visual analog scale for women to report their responses of pain at&#xD;
           immediately after procedure and after that 15 minutes by using Numerical Rating&#xD;
           Scale(NRS) were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The women were assessed for adverse side effects or complications of procedure e.g. such&#xD;
           as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pelvic pain or others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Follow up appointment the women for pathological report result at PSU hospital and&#xD;
           consider further management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine effectiveness of paracervical block, lidocaine spray and only oral analgesic&#xD;
      drugs for pain relief during endometrial biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table. Pain score(NRS) immediately after procedure and 15 minutes Group 1(1%Lidocaine) Group&#xD;
      2(10%Lidocaine spray) Control group(Placebo) Pain score immediately Pain score 15 minutes A&#xD;
      secondary goal of this study was to determine the adverse effects of these methods(such as&#xD;
      dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pelvic pain, bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are presented as median (range) for quantitative variables and frequency for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. Comparison between both groups was made by using the Chi-square test, Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test and Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate with p&lt;0.05 considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS 17.0 package program&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform consent will be obtained before study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will not detrimental patients or treatment outcomes.&#xD;
