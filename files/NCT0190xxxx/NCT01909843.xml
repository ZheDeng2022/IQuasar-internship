  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-centre, open label study to evaluate the occurrence and subsequent&#xD;
      reversibility and prevention, of bronchoconstriction following single and repeated oral&#xD;
      inhalations of ALX-0171 in adults with hyperresponsive airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I study is an exploratory study and serves to evaluate the occurrence and&#xD;
      reversibility of bronchoconstriction upon inhalation of ALX-0171. The study is an open label&#xD;
      trial with a sequential administration regimen of placebo and verum in all planned study&#xD;
      subjects. Each subject will start the treatment with a single dose of ALX-0171 placebo (=&#xD;
      formulation buffer) followed by escalating doses of ALX-0171 verum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventually a second administration of ALX-0171 placebo may take place at the end of the study&#xD;
      (as defined per protocol).&#xD;
