    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to take advance of the presence of two different cohorts of SCA&#xD;
      patients in one country, the first group included SCA patients from Bedouin Arab origin that&#xD;
      lives in Israel for more than one century and originally comes from African countries or&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia, those patients lives in north east Israel and are treated at the Hematology&#xD;
      Unit of the Emek Medical Center, the second group are SCA patients from African origin that&#xD;
      come to Israel in the last decades and belong to original African population, this group&#xD;
      receive treatment at the Pediatric Hematology Unit, Dana Children's Hospital, Ichilov Medical&#xD;
      Center. A third group is a cohort of SCA patients treated at Schneider Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Hematology Unit. Those patients belong also to the Israel Arab population and patients from a&#xD;
      village that African Muslims live for many years. The characteristics of the three groups&#xD;
      will be compared to the characteristics of a fourth group, a cohort of Afro-American SCA&#xD;
      patients that are followed up and treated at the Pediatric Hematology Unit, Detroit&#xD;
      Children's Medical Center, Detroit, Michigan, USA.&#xD;

      Group 1 - Emek group - (EMC): 100 patients will be included in the study, including&#xD;
      Homozygous SCA patients and Sickle Cell β Thalassemia Patients (β0 and β+ patients will be&#xD;
      included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - Dana group - (DMC): 50 patients will be included in the study. Group 3 - Schneider&#xD;
      group - (ShMC): 50 patients will be included in the study. Group 4 - Detroit group - (WYUMC):&#xD;
      100 patients will be included in the study, Homozygous SCA patients and Sickle Cell β&#xD;
      Thalassemia Patients (β0 and β+) will be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Sickle cell hemoglobin C (SC) and Sickle cell hemoglobin D (SD) disease will&#xD;
      not be included as part of the study analysis due to the small numbers of patients expected,&#xD;
      but the investigators are encouraged to report the data of those patients for further&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age: No age limits, patients can be included since diagnosis till age 40 since teenagers and&#xD;
      young adults are often treated at pediatric hematology units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender: Males and Females will be included in the study. Pregnant patients: Pregnancy will&#xD;
      not be considered as exclusion criteria. Data about pregnancy under Hydroxyurea treatment&#xD;
      both in females and in males should be included, including malformations in the offspring. It&#xD;
      needs to be emphasized that the recommendation to the patients in both sexes is to stop&#xD;
      Hydroxyurea treatment at last three months before conception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Data will be collected from the medical files. Demographic and family&#xD;
      history and laboratory findings at diagnosis will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic mutations of the β globin gene in patients with Sickle Cell β thalassemia will be&#xD;
      included if previously analyzed and recorded in medical files. Also α globin mutations and&#xD;
      SCA haplotypes will be included if they were previously analyzed and are part of the data&#xD;
      already present in the medical files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further genetic analysis including β and α globin mutations, haplotypes and xmn1 polymorphism&#xD;
      will be included in an extension study but those analysis are not an integral part of this&#xD;
      initial study unless they were performed before this present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical complaints from the last 10 years will be summarized. Iron chelation and Hydroxyurea&#xD;
      treatment given in the last 10 years will be summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications that were diagnosed at any age will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients without sufficient data at the medical files due to lack of regular follow up&#xD;
           will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that give explicit refuse in participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the patients currently treated and followed up at the centers in Israel will be&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A similar number of patients at same age range and same diagnosis will be included from&#xD;
           the whole cohort at Detroit MC. Since at Detroit MC a significant larger number of&#xD;
           patients, the criteria for patient's selection at this center will be a cohort matched&#xD;
           for gender and age to the Israel patients.&#xD;
