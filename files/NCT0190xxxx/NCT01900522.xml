  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability profile of ITI-214&#xD;
      when administered as multiple doses of oral solution at escalating dose levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ITI-214. This study will look at how well&#xD;
      different doses of ITI-214 are tolerated in healthy people and in people with stable&#xD;
      schizophrenia. In addition, exploratory neuroimaging will be conducted in participants with&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The study will be comprised&#xD;
      of 2 parts: Multiple-Rising Dose (MRD) and Neuroimaging (NI). Approximately 40 healthy&#xD;
      participants are planned to be enrolled in the MRD part of the study and approximately 36&#xD;
      patients with stable schizophrenia are planned to be enrolled in the Neuroimaging part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the MRD (parallel design) part will be enrolled in cohorts for different dose&#xD;
      levels. In each dose cohort, participants will be randomly assigned to active dose or&#xD;
      placebo-which will remain undisclosed to participants and study doctor during the study&#xD;
      (unless there is an urgent medical need). The following dose cohorts will be enrolled: Doses&#xD;
      A, B, C, and D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to take the study drug in oral solution once daily for a total of&#xD;
      14 days while confined at the study site. Participants will be contacted by telephone 22 and&#xD;
      44 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Neuroimaging (NI) part of the study will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      six treatment sequences. Each sequence consists of 3 cross-over treatment periods. The&#xD;
      following doses will be tested: Doses E, F, G, and H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo 3 treatment periods of placebo or ITI-214 once daily dosing for&#xD;
      7 days in each of the periods. There will be a washout period of a minimum of 7 days between&#xD;
      treatment periods. Participants will be confined at the study site for 5 days of each&#xD;
      treatment period and will report to the site on other dosing days for study drug&#xD;
      administration. There will be follow-up assessments on Days 14 and 37 of Period 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study was terminated due to business decision. The study compound is being transferred to&#xD;
      Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.&#xD;
