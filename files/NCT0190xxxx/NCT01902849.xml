      Knowing the fact that the anesthetic substances can alter the immune response during the&#xD;
      surgery, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the influence of two general anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques - inhalation vs. total intravenous anesthesia on the immune response in patient&#xD;
      with colorectal surgery for neoplastic disease, evaluated by the plasma level of the&#xD;
      interleukins 6 and 10(IL6, IL10).&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors are contributing to perioperative immunosuppression such as: surgery itself,&#xD;
      general anesthesia. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that anesthesia itself may alter&#xD;
      the immune response either by direct effect on immune cells (such as natural killer and T&#xD;
      helper) ) or indirectly by the influence of anesthetic substances on pro (IL-1, IL-6, tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor alpha ) and anti-inflammatory ( IL-4, IL-10) cytokines release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the influence of two general anesthetic techniques inhalation&#xD;
      versus total intravenous anesthesia- target controlled infusion (TIVA-TCI) on the immune&#xD;
      response in patient with colorectal surgery for neoplastic disease, evaluated by the plasma&#xD;
      level of the interleukins IL6, IL10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - patients admitted to the Surgical Clinic of the Regional Institute of Gastroenterology and&#xD;
      Hepatology Prof Dr Octavian Fodor, undergoing open surgery for colorectal cancer (right/left&#xD;
      colectomy, colorectal resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written informed consent 70 ASA physical status I-III patients scheduled for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer resection are randomly allocated to 2 groups of study by computer&#xD;
      randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group I, TIVA-TCI (n=35 patient) receive total intravenous-target controlled infusion&#xD;
           anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group II (ISOFLURANE) (n=35 patients) receive inhalatory anesthesia with isoflurane and&#xD;
           remifentanil&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Premedication with midazolam 7.5 mg orally 30 min before surgery in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On arrival in the operating room a venous cannula is inserted and a blood sample for&#xD;
           interleukin measurement is performed. This cannula is designated for fluid&#xD;
           administration during anesthesia and for blood sampling for subsequent interleukin&#xD;
           measurements. A second cannula is inserted for the administration of anesthetic&#xD;
           substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group I (TIVA-TCI):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anesthesia is induced with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol with an&#xD;
           initial target plasma concentration (Cp) of 4 micrograms/ml (modified Marsh model)( Base&#xD;
           Primea™, Fresenius, France), adjusted in steps 0.2 micrograms/ml to maintain the BIS&#xD;
           values between 40-55 during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  propofol infusion stops at the end of surgery before the last 2 stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group II (ISOFLURANE):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anesthesia is induced with propofol bolus 1,5-2 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maintenance of anesthesia is achieved with isoflurane 1-1.5 MAC in order to maintain the&#xD;
           BIS value between the values of 40-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  isoflurane administration cease before the last 2 stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  remifentanil TCI mode (Minto model) (Base Primea™, Fresenius, France) is used for&#xD;
           analgesia, with an initial Cp of remifentanil set at 4 ng/ml at induction, and a Cp&#xD;
           between 3-8 ng/mL during maintenance(increments of 0.5 ng/ml) depending on the painful&#xD;
           moments of surgery and the patient's analgesic needs assessed by changes in heart rate,&#xD;
           blood pressure (more than 20% of the previous value of induction), sweating, tearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  remifentanil infusion ceases after suturing the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  muscle relaxation is achieved with atracurium, 0.5-0.6 mg/kg at induction, and further&#xD;
           maintained on top up doses as needed. At the end of surgery the residual neuromuscular&#xD;
           blockade is reversed with atropine 0.02mg/kg and neostigmine 0.0 5mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the lungs are ventilated with an air/oxygen mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  morphine patient controlled analgesia(PCA ) with boluses of 1 mg to 5 min interval to&#xD;
           maintain the VAS ˂ 4 on 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS). The first dose of morphine&#xD;
           0.1 mg/kg is administered 40 minutes before completing the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in addition to morphine, is given paracetamol intravenous, 1g every 8 hours. The first&#xD;
           dose of paracetamol is administered intra-operatively before the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ASA basic monitoring: continuous monitoring ECG, heart rate (HR), arterial blood&#xD;
                pressure (BP), pulse oximetry (SpO2), CO2 concentration in expired gases (Et CO2),&#xD;
                concentration of isoflurane in exhaled gases (Et Iso), minimum alveolar&#xD;
                concentration (MAC) of isoflurane, and core temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  depth of anesthesia - bispectral index (BIS) (BIS Vista -Aspect Medical System,&#xD;
                USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Systolic, diastolic blood pressure and HR are recorded every minute at induction time&#xD;
           and every 5 minutes after endotracheal intubation, until the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotension (defined as a decrease of mean arterial blood pressure by over 20% of&#xD;
           baseline values) is treated with higher rate of infusion solutions and intravenous&#xD;
           boluses of ephedrine 5 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inadequate anesthesia (hypertension, tachycardia, lacrimation, sweating) is treated by&#xD;
           adjusting the remifentanil infusion as previously mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  opioid analgesic requirement in the first 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pain score on the visual analog scale (VAS 0-10)in the first 24 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting episodes requiring the&#xD;
                administration of antiemetic drug (metoclopramide 20 mg or ondansetron 4 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling to determine interleukins IL6 , IL10 plasma levels are drawn at the following&#xD;
      moments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0- before the induction of anesthesia (venous cannula insertion time)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1- after induction but before starting surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  in group I (TIVA -TCI) when the plasma concentration of propofol is 3-3.5&#xD;
                micrograms/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  in group II (ISOFLURANE) when concentration of isoflurane in exhaled air (Et&#xD;
                Isoflurane) is between 0.3-0.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2, T3 - at 2 and 24 hours after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected blood samples are centrifuged at 2500 rpm / min for 10 minutes and the&#xD;
      resulting plasma is stored at -70 ° C until the interleukins assay is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If intraoperatively is revealed local extension of colorectal cancer (tumor invades adjacent&#xD;
      organs) or distant metastasis the patient is excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is done longitudinally prospective, for each patient the following variable&#xD;
      are registered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantitative: - weight, plasmatic or brain concentration of the anesthetics used in&#xD;
           TIVA-TCI mode, BIS value, plasmatic concentration of the interleukins on 4 intra- and&#xD;
           post-operatory moments, the duration of the surgery and anesthesia, number of episodes&#xD;
           of nausea and vomiting, opioid analgesic requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  qualitative: ASA score, sex, post-operatory pain score (VAS) Collected data are&#xD;
           introduced in a database using the Excel Office programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA). Quantitative variables will be expressed as mean ± SD, and qualitative variables as&#xD;
      absolute and relative frequencies. Given multiple measurements at different time intervals,&#xD;
      area under curve (AUC) is calculated for each IL and the results will be compared between&#xD;
      groups.A p less 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
