  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glenoid component loosening is the most common complication of total shoulder arthroplasty.&#xD;
      Loosening is associated with malposition of the implant as well as the quality of the glenoid&#xD;
      bone. Past studies from our research group have addressed these problems by investigating&#xD;
      novel surgical technologies to increase the accuracy of glenoid implant placement. Over the&#xD;
      course of multiple IRB approved clinical trials, use of our preoperative planning software in&#xD;
      combination with patient specific instrumentation (PSI) or intelligent reusable&#xD;
      instrumentation (IRI) has proven to more accurately place the glenoid guide pin than&#xD;
      conventional standard of care techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuing the investigator's work, the investigators propose a clinical case series to&#xD;
      evaluate a new surgical instrumentation technique that combines the features of PSI with the&#xD;
      IRI technology that investigators have termed Real Time Instrumentation (RTI). Investigators&#xD;
      will measure implant placement with RSA and 3D CT imaging. Investigators will measure&#xD;
      pre-operative bone quality using quantitative CT to measure trabecular bone volume and&#xD;
      correlate these findings with bone samples removed from the glenoid and measured by microCT&#xD;
      and mechanical testing of the bone samples. These bone samples will be obtained as part of&#xD;
      the routine preparation of the glenoid bone for implant placement. This bone tissue is&#xD;
      normally removed and discarded as part of the standard of care for preparation of the bone&#xD;
      for placement of the glenoid. Investigators have performed all of the work required to define&#xD;
      both the safety of all components of the proposed study in the completed PSI study and the&#xD;
      ongoing IRI study. Since application to the IRB for study of the IRI technology Custom&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Solutions has received in April 2013 FDA approval for this technology.&#xD;

      The study will enroll 20 patients directly into the RTI group. Investigators will have two&#xD;
      surgeons with experience in shoulder arthroplasty and the RTI and SmartBones technology.&#xD;
      Investigators will require a minimum of five patients from any one surgeon. All patients will&#xD;
      have the standard of care indications for an anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and will&#xD;
      give informed consent for both the surgery and participation in this study. Consent and&#xD;
      enrollment will be obtained by the surgeon during a routine office evaluation. All patients&#xD;
      will get standard of care pre operative x-rays and CT scan at least three weeks prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Scan quality must meet study specific criteria and investigators expect that the&#xD;
      scans will be performed at the Cleveland Clinic. The preoperative CT scan will be placed&#xD;
      within our preoperative planning software (OrthoVis, Cleveland Clinic). The surgeon will use&#xD;
      this software to assess the glenoid bone pathology and select the optimal implant and&#xD;
      placement of that implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have standard of care indications for primary anatomic arthroplasty and be able&#xD;
      to get a preoperative shoulder CT scan at the Cleveland Clinic or at an outside facility so&#xD;
      long as the study includes the entire scapula and has 1 mm or thinner sections. These&#xD;
      parameters are required for accurate preoperative planning as well as comparison with the&#xD;
      post operative CT scans. Standard of care pre- and post-operative x-rays (AP and axillary&#xD;
      views) will also be obtained and can be performed at the Cleveland Clinic or acquired from&#xD;
      another health care facility. In all patients the standard x-rays and CT images provided by&#xD;
      the radiology department will be available to the surgeon before and during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the Smartbone surrogate model, the surgeon visually compares the exposed glenoid&#xD;
      surface to the Smartbone model to ensure that the two match for size and shape. Any&#xD;
      adjustments to the surgical site may be done by the surgeon to optimize the match between the&#xD;
      model and the exposed glenoid surface. Prior to molding the bone cement, bone wax is wiped&#xD;
      onto the model to ensure proper release of the cement mold. The surgeon will then mold bone&#xD;
      cement around the pin in the Smartbone, capturing the trajectory of the pin and the unique&#xD;
      contours of the glenoid rim. A small pin sleeve is inserted over the pin to be embedded&#xD;
      within the cement model. Once the bone cement has cured, it is removed from the model and&#xD;
      placed onto the patients glenoid surface. The bone morphology captured in the mold aligns the&#xD;
      mold to the patient's anatomy. When surgeon feels that the model has good fit of the glenoid&#xD;
      surface, he may continue with pin placement. After placement of the guide pin, the RTI mold&#xD;
      is removed and the remainder of the procedure is completed using the implant manufacturer's&#xD;
      equipment and standard surgical protocols. Any adjustments in guide pin position can be&#xD;
      performed by the surgeon based upon surgical judgment. The surgeon can make any change needed&#xD;
      and use any means or instrument that would otherwise be used for standard of care surgery to&#xD;
      place the guide pin in any position that the surgeon believed to be best for the patient. If&#xD;
      the pin is changed without the use of the RTI then the patient will be excluded from this&#xD;
      study and the reasons for failure of the RTI technology to provide accurate pin placement&#xD;
      based upon the surgeons sole determination of accuracy will be recorded and later analyzed as&#xD;
      a failure to treat. These patients will not receive postoperative CT Scans as investigators&#xD;
      would not be able to use the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hollow core drill bit will be used to prepare the bone in a standard manner to obtain bone&#xD;
      cores for study. Prior to implanting the glenoid component, three 1 mm tantalum beads will be&#xD;
      inserted into the backside pegs of the component. Investigators have developed methods to&#xD;
      place the beads in a manner that has been used by other investigators and validated in the&#xD;
      investigators' own experience in 22 cases enrolled in the ongoing IRI clinical study. The&#xD;
      desired implant will be placed into a holding device and using a drill guide, a 0.9 mm hole&#xD;
      measuring 2 mm deep will be placed in each of the three peripheral pegs of the implant. A 1&#xD;
      mm tantalum bead (RSA biomedical, Umsa Sweden) supplied by the company will then be press fit&#xD;
      into the component hole. The implant will then be placed in the glenoid, aligned with the&#xD;
      previously drilled peg holes. As standard of care, these peg holes are cemented, thus locking&#xD;
      the beads within the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using manufacturer (RSA biomedical, Umsa Sweden) provided beads and injector gun, four to&#xD;
      five 1 mm tantalum beads will be placed in the coracoid, acromion and glenoid. Exact&#xD;
      placement of these beads is at the discretion of the surgeon. Patient anatomy and operative&#xD;
      exposure will guide the surgeon to the best places to inject the beads; however the surgeon&#xD;
      will not be confined to a specific amount of beads in a specific location. The beads just&#xD;
      need to be spread out amongst the coracoid, acromion, and glenoid to establish reference&#xD;
      points for the RSA imaging. Prior studies looking at shoulder joint kinematics and implant&#xD;
      position have used this methodology of bead placement with successful study related outcomes.&#xD;
      Investigators have successfully placed bone beads in 22 patients currently treated in the&#xD;
      ongoing IRI clinical study without any difficulty or adverse events during or after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, all patients will receive a CT with Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR)and RSA&#xD;
      (if chosen) within 3 weeks of surgery. This will be a CT Scan performed with the patient's&#xD;
      arm by the side in a supine position using metal artifact reduction techniques. In addition&#xD;
      patients will receive a second CT scan and RSA imaging, provided they originally got RSA,&#xD;
      performed 1 year (Â± 1 month) from surgery. The second CT scan will be performed with MAR&#xD;
      techniques and with the patient in the lateral decubitus position with their arm in the&#xD;
      overhead position, again using metal artifact reduction techniques. The second set of images,&#xD;
      produced with a different body and arm position, also decreases metal artifact than those&#xD;
      obtained with the arm placed by the side. This position cannot be comfortably obtained until&#xD;
      3- 6 months after surgery and require healing of the tissues and rehabilitation of the&#xD;
      shoulder. Investigators have shown that in a small number of patients the glenoid component&#xD;
      can shift in position within the first 3-6 months after surgery making the first CT Scan more&#xD;
      accurate for implant position. The images obtained from the postoperative CT scans are placed&#xD;
      back into the surgical software and the 3D reconstruction of the postoperative scapula with&#xD;
      the implants is compared to the preoperative plan. Using measurement tools within the&#xD;
      software, developed at the Cleveland Clinic, investigators will compare the position of the&#xD;
      actual glenoid component placed in the patient with the desired position specified by the&#xD;
      plan. The use and validation of these imaging methods to precisely measure implant position&#xD;
      has been performed at the Cleveland Clinic in a prior IRB approved clinical trial (IRB&#xD;
      10-582).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, the high resolution quantitative CT will measure volumetric bone mineral&#xD;
      density and the trabecular network of the glenoid. When available, this will be applied to&#xD;
      the preoperative CT for those patients at Cleveland Clinic, Main Campus. Patients who have&#xD;
      their preoperative CT completed at non Main Campus facilities will have the standard of care&#xD;
      preoperative CT. This will be done at the same visit for the standard of care preoperative&#xD;
      CT. Micro CT imaging, which creates a 3D reconstruction of the fine bone structure, in&#xD;
      addition to microarchitecture analysis and mechanical testing, will allow assessment of the&#xD;
      bone tissue taken from the bone core sample. Between the preoperative imaging and the bone&#xD;
      tissue analysis, investigators will have data to properly determine the quality of the bone&#xD;
      stock surrounding the implant. Further correlating these data with RSA and 3D CT imaging of&#xD;
      implant movement, investigators can fully develop cause and effect of bone quality on glenoid&#xD;
      component loosening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating surgeons will be Drs. Joseph Iannotti and Eric Ricchetti. Patients may have&#xD;
      surgery at either Cleveland Clinic main campus or at Euclid Hospital. If the procedure is&#xD;
      performed at Euclid Hospital, post operative CT scan and RSA (if chosen), will need to be&#xD;
      taken at main campus within 3 weeks. The patient will be made aware of this at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment and consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing the computer-generated preoperative plan to postoperative component placement,&#xD;
      investigators will be looking at three outcomes. First, the overall difference in component&#xD;
      placement between standard of care instrumentation, intelligent reusable instrument&#xD;
      (IRB#12-997), patient specific instruments (IRB #10-582) and real time instrumentation will&#xD;
      be compared. Secondly, investigators will compare the placement between the technologies&#xD;
      within and between surgeons. Thirdly, investigators will evaluate the difference in implant&#xD;
      position between technologies based on severity of pathology. The quality of the bone core&#xD;
      sampled will be correlated to the possible loosening of the implants.&#xD;
