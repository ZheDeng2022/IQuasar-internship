  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the antidepressant effects of Cranial Electrotherapy&#xD;
      Stimulation (CES) in the depressed phase of bipolar II disorder.; to examine the safety of&#xD;
      daily CES in bipolar II patients; and to examine the effects of 20 minutes of daily CES on&#xD;
      EEG reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The CES will reduce symptom severity more than sham (placebo) CES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. That CES administered for 20 minutes daily for four weeks is safe and well tolerated&#xD;
           when treating bipolar II patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. That CES will shift the alpha and beta power fractions of EEG downward, and that this&#xD;
           shift correlates with a decrease in level of anxiety and depression&#xD;

      I. ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cranial electrical stimulation (CES) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technology that uses&#xD;
      a small alternating current (1-2mA) applied to the scalp to affect brain function. The&#xD;
      strength of the current is similar to that used by transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS); the only difference is that in the case of CES the current is alternating. CES has&#xD;
      been FDA sanctioned for the treatment of depression, anxiety and insomnia since 1978. CES was&#xD;
      never subjected to the level of regulatory review now required for new technologies because&#xD;
      it was &quot;grandfather-ed&quot; based on a device that predated the current FDA regulations. As a&#xD;
      consequence, although hundreds of thousands of people have been treated with CES since its&#xD;
      development in the 1950's, claims for its effectiveness have been largely anecdotal and the&#xD;
      studies have been hampered by poor study design and inadequate blinding. It is important to&#xD;
      study under well-controlled conditions whether this product, already in widespread use, is&#xD;
      truly effective. This study will examine the efficacy of CES in treating the depressive phase&#xD;
      of bipolar II disorder using a rigorous controlled design. It will be the first study of the&#xD;
      use of CES in bipolar II disorder, and the first well controlled study of the antidepressant&#xD;
      effects of CES. Because CES is already clinically available and large numbers of patients&#xD;
      have received it (usually as an at-home, self treatment), it is important to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial rather than to merely replicate the anecdotal reports that&#xD;
      already exist in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. RESEARCH PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regulatory Status of CES&#xD;
&#xD;
           CES is currently FDA sanctioned and may be marketed for the treatment of depression,&#xD;
           anxiety and insomnia. The Fisher-Wallace Cranial Stimulator (model SBL500-B), which&#xD;
           became FDA sanctioned for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and depression in 1990&#xD;
           (510K approval), uses 0.5-2 mA (milliampere) of alternating currents in three&#xD;
           frequencies (15Hz, 500 Hz, 15,000Hz) and is the same device as the Liss Cranial&#xD;
           Stimulator (model SBL201-M), a class III device, which has been marketed since the&#xD;
           1970's for treatment of depression, anxiety and insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           State of the Evidence on the Clinical Efficacy of CES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although CES has been in wide usage both in Europe and the United States for more than&#xD;
           50 years; there are few well controlled studies published which demonstrate its&#xD;
           efficacy. Its mechanism of action is unknown, though recent EEG studies suggest an&#xD;
           effect on brain oscillations (Marshall et al., 2006. Schroeder et al., 2001). It appears&#xD;
           to be benign, and no adverse events have been reported in the literature except for mild&#xD;
           headache and tingling under the electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results of a 1992 meta-analysis by the Harvard School of Public Health of the&#xD;
           effectiveness of CES concluded that published studies on CES are hampered by poor study&#xD;
           design and inadequate blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using as their gold standard a randomized controlled trial comparing CES with sham in a&#xD;
           double-blind manner, they rejected studies from the former Soviet Union, which were only&#xD;
           uncontrolled. Searching human studies in English they found 18 randomized controlled&#xD;
           trials of CES vs. sham, using a variety of CES devices to treat depression, anxiety,&#xD;
           drug addiction, insomnia, headache and pain. In this analysis, they did not analyze&#xD;
           differences in signal parameters or treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Purpose of the Present Study&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a single-blind, randomized, sham controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
           CES in treating the depressive phase in patients with bipolar II disorder. This will be&#xD;
           the first well controlled study of the role of CES in treating depression as well as the&#xD;
           first well controlled study of the role of CES in treating bipolar II disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We decided to focus on depression in the context of bipolar II disorder because there is&#xD;
           a need to increase the number of effective treatments for the depressive phase of&#xD;
           bipolar II disorder, and to identify effective antidepressants that do not promote a&#xD;
           switch to mania. To this end, we will assess risk of hypomania or mania using&#xD;
           standardized scales. Of note, there have been no reported cases of hypomania or mania&#xD;
           with CES. Furthermore, we wanted to increase sample homogeneity by limiting the study to&#xD;
           bipolar II patients, and have therefore excluded unipolar depressive disorder as well as&#xD;
           bipolar I disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will recruit 20 bipolar II patients aged 18-85 who are currently in a depressive&#xD;
           phase of their illness (mixed and manic episodes will be excluded). They will be&#xD;
           randomly assigned to two groups: a placebo group and an active group, for the first two&#xD;
           weeks of the study. The CES device which we will use will be the Fisher-Wallace Cranial&#xD;
           Stimulator, which uses 1mA (milliampere) of alternating current in three frequencies&#xD;
           (5Hz, 500Hz, and 15,000Hz). In this study, patients will receive CES for 20 minutes a&#xD;
           day, five days a week. Patients will be able to remain on their medications to avoid the&#xD;
           risk to subjects by withdrawing them from medication, but the dosages must be kept&#xD;
           stable for at least two weeks prior to entering the study and for the first month of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients likely to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited from the&#xD;
           inpatient and outpatient units at Beth Israel Medical Center via advertisements in&#xD;
           newspapers and other media, or by physician referral from sites participating in the&#xD;
           registry. Outpatients will also be screened at Beth Israel Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample Description&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient recruitment will reflect the referral patterns to the outpatient clinic&#xD;
           participating in the study. Given the gender distribution in the prevalence of bipolar&#xD;
           II disorder, it is expected that approximately half the sample size will be female and&#xD;
           half will be male. It is expected that the sample composition will be approximately 80%&#xD;
           Caucasian, 10% African American, 5% Hispanic, and 5% Asian or other ethnic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will screen patients based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria after a written&#xD;
      informed consent, and general medical and psychiatric histories, are obtained. At enrollment,&#xD;
      a general medical history and comprehensive physical and neurological examinations will be&#xD;
      obtained, along with screening laboratory analysis of blood and urine (for medical&#xD;
      exclusions, drug screen, and pregnancy screen if appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline period (after informed consent) but prior to treatment with CES&#xD;
      participants' physical functioning, emotional well being, life satisfaction, depression and&#xD;
      manic symptoms will be assessed. And documentation of prior and current mood disorder&#xD;
      treatments; documentation of other regularly-used, prescribed, and over-the-counter&#xD;
      medications and supplements/botanicals; and the neuropsychological battery (described below)&#xD;
      will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be maintained on the same dosage of their antidepressant medication beginning&#xD;
      two weeks prior to entering the study (four weeks for fluoxetine). During phase I (two weeks)&#xD;
      and phase II (two weeks), patients will be asked to keep their medications and dosages&#xD;
      stable. In phase III of the study, medications and dosages may be adjusted as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG recording&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record a standard 64 channel EEG for five minutes before the first CES session and&#xD;
      for five minutes after the first CES session, as well as after the 8th week to evaluate acute&#xD;
      and long term effects of CES on EEG. The electrodes are given 25 minutes to stabilize and a&#xD;
      CES sensation threshold is determined for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I, Randomization Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either the active CES or control group on a 1:1 basis.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked about changes in medical state, medication or caffeine or alcohol&#xD;
      intake, change in sleep patterns prior to beginning study procedures at each visit. CES&#xD;
      sessions will be performed 5 days a week for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham CES is performed by turning the current on until the patient experiences a tingling&#xD;
      sensation on the scalp, then decreasing the current to just below threshold. This is the sham&#xD;
      procedure described in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Treatment Continuation / Discontinuation (Phase I):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each week, a blinded rater will administer the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (HRSD 17 item), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Clinical Global Impression (CGI). At&#xD;
      the end of Phase 1, patients will be classified into one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stable remission: HRSD17 ≤ 7 at the end of the second week. These patients go to Phase 3&#xD;
           and enter naturalistic follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-improving: Less than 30% decrease in the Hamilton Depression rating Scale (HRSD)&#xD;
           from baseline. These patients will be crossed over to the open-label CES in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improving: 30% or greater decrease in the HRSD from baseline. These patients will also&#xD;
           be crossed over to receive open label CES in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II, Open-Crossover Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II is the open label phase in which subjects will receive active CES for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III, Naturalistic follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-month naturalistic follow-up for all study participants is included to examine whether&#xD;
      antidepressant effects of CES persist beyond the acute, active treatment phase. Patients will&#xD;
      be maintained on their medications unless changing types and dosages of medication is&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be rated weekly, up to 2 months (8 follow up visits). The following assessments&#xD;
      will be performed at the weekly follow-up visits: symptoms of depression and global&#xD;
      assessment of functioning. Neuropsychological Testing will be done at baseline, two weeks,&#xD;
      four weeks and eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-out Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient has a CGI Global Improvement score of 6 or higher (i.e. &quot;Much Worse&quot; or &quot;Very&#xD;
      Much Worse&quot; compared to baseline) sustained across 2 assessments they will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study and referred to appropriate treatment. Additionally, if a patient develops&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms, develops acute suicidal intent and/or plan, needs psychotropic&#xD;
      medications to be changed or increased to treat clinical worsening, or requires inpatient&#xD;
      psychiatric admission, or develops manic symptoms; they will be withdrawn from the study and&#xD;
      referred to appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      An n of 20 was selected based on the precedent set by a previous CES study where a 50%&#xD;
      reduction in GAD symptoms was observed with an n of 12 (p =0.01) (Bystritsky, Kerwin, &amp;&#xD;
      Feusner, 2008). We expect similar effect size in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be mentioned by name. Research records, like other medical and clinical&#xD;
      records, will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. Any information obtained&#xD;
      during this study will only be available to the research staff, institutional personnel, or&#xD;
      to federal and New York State regulatory personnel. There are legal advocacy organizations&#xD;
      that have the authority under state law to access otherwise confidential research records,&#xD;
      though they cannot re-disclose this information without subject's consent. All information&#xD;
      will be stored in locked files and will not have subject's name or any other identifying&#xD;
      information associated with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data (written and electronic) will be coded. A master list matching the subject with&#xD;
      codes will be kept under lock and key, separate from any research records or the computer&#xD;
      database, with access restricted to research staff, to the extent permitted by law. Only&#xD;
      staff directly involved in this project will have access to the master list linking subject's&#xD;
      name to code numbers. Subject's name and other personal identifying information will be&#xD;
      stored in files and in an electronically secure database at the hospital.&#xD;
