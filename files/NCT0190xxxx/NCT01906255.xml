  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of HIV-1 negative individuals who participated in&#xD;
      demonstration projects or clinical studies and took daily Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil&#xD;
      Fumarate (FTC/TDF, Truvada®) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). All individuals were&#xD;
      enrolled and followed as described in the parent PrEP demonstration project or clinical study&#xD;
      protocol until study completion, HIV-1 infection, discontinuation due to an adverse event,&#xD;
      lost to follow-up, or administrative censoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the protocols of the parent PrEP observational or clinical studies, participants had&#xD;
      follow-up visits on average every 3 months for evaluation of adherence, renal and bone&#xD;
      adverse events, and HIV-1 infection status. Adherence was determined by the specific FTC/TDF&#xD;
      drug level measurement(s) outlined in the parent protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gilead had collected data from 21 global PrEP demonstration projects and clinical studies for&#xD;
      over 7,000 Truvada for PrEP users who had at least one measurement of adherence. Data from&#xD;
      the different contributing studies were pooled for statistical analyses by Gilead.&#xD;
