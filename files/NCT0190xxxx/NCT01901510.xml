      This study first is designed to see what dose of indigo carmine ingested orally mixed with&#xD;
      the standard colonoscopy prep is needed to provide adequate staining of the right colon. It&#xD;
      then will use this adequate staining concentration of Indigo Carmine to study whether this&#xD;
      dye will increase the detection of polyps during colonoscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colon cancer occurs in 5% of the US population. Currently colon cancer screening is&#xD;
      recommended at the age of 50 years old for all patients who are at average risk. Colonoscopy&#xD;
      is considered the gold standard test for colon cancer screening. This is partly because&#xD;
      colonoscopy not only can detect polyps which are cancer precursors but also can remove them,&#xD;
      and thereby detecting cancer and its precursors and preventing cancer. Unfortunately recent&#xD;
      data suggest that colonoscopy can miss a significant percentage of polyps, especially on the&#xD;
      right side of the colon. It is thought that one of the major reasons for missing polyps in&#xD;
      the right side of the colon is the fact that they are flat or sessile serrated adenoma, both&#xD;
      of which are more difficult than protruding polyps to identify with ordinary colon&#xD;
      preparation and colonoscopes. Chromoendoscopy is the application of dye during colonoscopy to&#xD;
      enhance detection of polyps. It has been shown that it improves the detection of polyps and&#xD;
      thus has the potential of improving the performance of colonoscopy and increasing the&#xD;
      detection of these difficult to detect polyps. It is however cumbersome and time consuming,&#xD;
      which has discouraged its use. Indigo carmine, one commonly used dye, is actually FDA&#xD;
      approved as a food colorant and can be consumed orally. It is minimally absorbed. In addition&#xD;
      it is used intravenously for diagnosis of injuries of the urinary system because it is very&#xD;
      rapidly excreted by the kidneys. The investigators believe that taking it orally will be well&#xD;
      tolerated, and that any of the dye that is absorbed will be rapidly excreted by the kidneys&#xD;
      and thus quickly eliminated without any side effects. Effective staining of the colon with&#xD;
      indigo carmine and increased detection of polyps could change the current standard of care&#xD;
      for screening for colon cancer.&#xD;

0 = Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared.&#xD;

= Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well.&#xD;
