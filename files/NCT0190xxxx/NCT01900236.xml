    <textblock>
      iENGAGE is a 4 session, in-clinic behavioral intervention that is delivered to new clinic&#xD;
      patients during the first year of HIV care on a flexible delivery schedule, with intervention&#xD;
      visits scheduled to coincide with HIV medical care visits. Interventionists from each&#xD;
      participating collaborating site will be trained centrally to implement the iENGAGE protocol.&#xD;
      Following study enrollment and baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      treatment as usual and intervention groups. For intervention-arm participants, each iENGAGE&#xD;
      intervention session includes: interventionist-delivered educational content for managing HIV&#xD;
      medical care appointment-keeping and information sessions for learning to manage HIV&#xD;
      medications. The intervention will have a tailored, interactive agenda for each of the 4&#xD;
      sessions based on behavioral motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. The goal of this&#xD;
      intervention is for the participant to establish early behaviors that help him/her to arrive&#xD;
      at scheduled medical appointments and learn to take medications as prescribed during the&#xD;
      initial year of HIV care in order to improve overall health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control's Retention In Care (CDC RIC) and the Participating and&#xD;
      Communicating Together (PACT) antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence interventions have shown&#xD;
      success in the literature, and they are well suited to target the two essential HIV adherence&#xD;
      behaviors needed to achieve better overall health: HIV medical visit adherence and ART&#xD;
      adherence. While these original interventions target each of these behaviors separately, the&#xD;
      comprehensive iENGAGE intervention combines these two approaches to address the experience of&#xD;
      an individual who is initiating HIV care. Upon entry to care, knowledge, motivation, and&#xD;
      skills for adherence to HIV medical visits and ART must be learned rapidly. Jointly targeting&#xD;
      these behaviors offers a distinct advantage over addressing them separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iENGAGE integrates CDC RIC and PACT through their common intervention targets with the&#xD;
      assistance of trained interventionists, who will maintain contact with the new patient to&#xD;
      educate and assist with reinforcing the importance of adherence to care. While the actions&#xD;
      required to attend HIV medical care appointments and take medications properly are distinct,&#xD;
      each is influenced by an individual's personal motivation and skills for self-management of&#xD;
      HIV infection and overall health; these principles are the focus of the intervention sessions&#xD;
      for this protocol .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this intervention, our team will make every effort to protect all participants'&#xD;
      confidential and private information in order to minimize possible study-associated risks. In&#xD;
      addition, the follow up measurement plan for this study is unique, as it aims to utilize the&#xD;
      X060831001: Unsolicited R24 for the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated&#xD;
      Clinical Sciences, (CNICS), PI Michael Saag) secure electronic data infrastructure, which has&#xD;
      existing defined protocols for the protection of human subjects data, including a data&#xD;
      management core that is housed at the collaborating site at the University of Washington.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stigma Supplement (Michael J. Mugavero, Janet M. Turan, Bulent Turan)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this supplement, the research team has incorporated multi-item questionnaire&#xD;
      measures of stigma into baseline and final data collection for the iENGAGE trial. The goal of&#xD;
      Aim 1 is to examine the longitudinal associations and potential causal mechanisms in the&#xD;
      relationships between dimensions of HIV-related stigma and HIV visit adherence,&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and viral load suppression, among control&#xD;
      participants in the study. In addition, in Aim 2, we will examine the effects of the iENGAGE&#xD;
      intervention on dimensions of stigma, by comparing changes in stigma in the two arms of the&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 3, after participants have completed the 48-week iENGAGE intervention, we will&#xD;
      conduct up to 40 individual in-depth face-to-face qualitative interviews with selected&#xD;
      participants using a separate informed consent process. Topics to be explored in these&#xD;
      interviews include qualitative exploration of how HIV-related stigma and other intersectional&#xD;
      stigmas affect engagement in HIV care, as wells as exploring how participation in the iENGAGE&#xD;
      intervention may have influenced the participant's experiences of anticipated, internalized,&#xD;
      and experienced stigma; as well as disclosure concerns and actual disclosure behavior.&#xD;
