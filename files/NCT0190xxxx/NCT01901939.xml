  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed preliminary study from this interdisciplinary team will provide important&#xD;
      information about the feasibility and safety of bedside low intensity pedaling exercise&#xD;
      during hospitalization. The findings from this study are essential to develop high-value,&#xD;
      effective treatments that can be used by any hospital setting throughout the country. The&#xD;
      program that investigators are proposing may provide important changes in how disability can&#xD;
      be prevented in elderly patients who are hospitalized because of an acute illness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study design includes 2 phases (10 months each) for development and evaluation of the&#xD;
      testing and intervention protocol. The last 4 months of the study will be devoted to&#xD;
      preparation of a larger randomized controlled clinical trial grant submission. Mixed methods&#xD;
      will be used in both phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will focus on developing, testing and refining the measurement protocol and bedside&#xD;
      tailored low intensity pedaling exercise (Ex) program using mixed methods. During this&#xD;
      10-month phase, researchers plan to enroll 10 participants who are admitted to a medical&#xD;
      surgical (MS) unit and meet study eligibility criteria. Investigators will implement our&#xD;
      proposed testing and intervention protocol,obtain feedback and make modifications as&#xD;
      necessary. For this purpose the study team will use a process improvement framework with&#xD;
      rapid cycle improvements. The outcome for Phase I will be development of a manual of&#xD;
      operations for the testing and Ex protocol that will be implemented in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (10 months) will randomly assign 60 patients over the age of 65 years who meet&#xD;
      medical criteria and are admitted to a medical surgical (MS) hospital unit at the VA Palo&#xD;
      Alto Health care system (VAPA HCS) to one of two groups, 1) low intensity bedside pedaling&#xD;
      exercise or 2) usual care. All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires, undergo&#xD;
      a Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), cognitive testing and a blood draw prior to&#xD;
      participation in the Ex program (baseline). All testing and blood draw will be repeated&#xD;
      within 24 hours prior to discharge (release from the hospital to home or other facility,&#xD;
      indicating that their condition has been resolved or adequately treated or is stabilized&#xD;
      during their hospital stay) from the hospital(approximately at 5-6 days). Participants will&#xD;
      be followed for the duration of the hospital stay, an expected average length of 5-6 days.&#xD;
      Additionally, all participants will be asked to continue to exercise after discharge to home&#xD;
      for 4 weeks. All tests will be performed at baseline (prior to intervention), within 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to discharge (release from the hospital to home or other facility, indicating that&#xD;
      their condition has been resolved or adequately treated or is stabilized during their&#xD;
      hospital stay)from the hospital, on average 5-6 days) and again at 4 weeks post discharge.&#xD;
      The focus of Phase II is safety and feasibility of the intervention and association with&#xD;
      outcome measures. The length of stay (LOS) at VAPA HCS is approximately 6 days. Thus, the&#xD;
      study investigators anticipate that each individual will be enrolled approximately 5 days and&#xD;
      participate in an average of 8 training sessions. Investigators will also examine the&#xD;
      association between physical activity levels at baseline (pre Ex) and myokines and associated&#xD;
      changes in myokines after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A description of the Ex program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individually tailored, low intensity bedside pedaling exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants complete the testing protocol they will be instructed in the bedside Ex&#xD;
      program. Exercise intensity and duration will be individualized to the subject's physical&#xD;
      limitations and tolerance. The PI is an Adult Nurse Practitioner (ANP), and will supervise&#xD;
      and monitor exercise response including Heart Rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), Rating of&#xD;
      Perceived Exertion (RPE), and symptoms (intensity, duration). Exercise will be terminated&#xD;
      according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria. Ex will consist of&#xD;
      progressively increased pedaling exercise performed initially for one-two minutes, three&#xD;
      times or more daily as tolerated. Pedaling exercise will be progressively increased as&#xD;
      tolerated and appropriate. Cycle ergometry has been shown to be an effective exercise&#xD;
      modality to maintain muscle strength and aerobic capacity in a variety of age groups. While&#xD;
      inpatient exercise prescriptions utilize walking as the primary mode of exercise, recent&#xD;
      studies show that despite known benefits of ambulation, multiple barriers prevent routine&#xD;
      implementation in practice settings. The study investigators propose to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a portable bedside pedaling device for exercise. This modality eliminates&#xD;
      dependence on hospital staff to supervise ambulation and allows patients greater access to&#xD;
      optimal treatment recommendations to maintain functional independence. This exercise modality&#xD;
      is not new, but bedside use is novel. The pedaling device is sturdy and portable and will be&#xD;
      placed at the foot of an anchored chair. Subjects will be able to pedal without fear of&#xD;
      falling or interference from other devices. This exercise will be performed in addition to&#xD;
      their normal ambulation requirements. All catheters and other devices will be secured so that&#xD;
      accidental removal will not occur during the Ex session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence is a key component of this study and will be monitored during both phases of the&#xD;
      pilot study. Adherence will be assessed by direct observation from PI/staff. Investigators&#xD;
      will also examine potential barriers and facilitators to exercise training adherence by&#xD;
      obtaining qualitative feedback from study participants. The qualitative information will&#xD;
      provide greater depth of understanding to improve the delivery of the intervention as well as&#xD;
      assist in optimizing adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study team will also ask participants if they are willing to be contacted regarding&#xD;
      future research that may be of interest to them.&#xD;
