    <textblock>
      The health of the immune system in HIV infected people is currently determined from a blood&#xD;
      test measuring the number of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T lymphocytes. These cells&#xD;
      play a critical role in an immune response. Studies have shown that low numbers (below the&#xD;
      normal range) of CD4 T lymphocytes indicates a defect in the immune system. Conversely, the&#xD;
      number of CD4 T lymphocytes within the normal range generally indicates a normal immune&#xD;
      system. When a person is infected with HIV the CD4 T lymphocytes are attacked and destroyed&#xD;
      and the numbers decline meaning that the immune system can no longer effectively protect the&#xD;
      body from infection or cancers. However, when the HIV infected person is successfully treated&#xD;
      with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) the CD4 T lymphocytes numbers increase and&#xD;
      may end up in the normal range but the immune system may still not function properly as a&#xD;
      number of these cells are incapable of functioning properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be interesting to know how functional the immune system is rather than the number of&#xD;
      cells. For this, the QuantiFERON® Monitor (QFM or CST007) test is an experimental diagnostic&#xD;
      test used in this study to measure the immune function from people infected with HIV. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the QFM test in HIV infected people&#xD;
      compared with uninfected people by measuring the function of the immune system. The QFM test&#xD;
      measures interferon-gamma released in the plasma following incubation of heparinised whole&#xD;
      blood with a combination of stimulants. As immune function is directly influenced by cells&#xD;
      with actively replicating HIV an additional research test called the HIV Reservoir Test will&#xD;
      be included to better understand the level of immune function in each study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How long will it take? One visit for about 1 hour with Dr. Gatpolintan and his Clinical Study&#xD;
      Coordinator to answer questions, then about 10 minutes for a blood draw (nine blocks from Dr.&#xD;
      Gatpolintan' office).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome measures (Correlation between QFM and CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios) will be&#xD;
      assessed, including data presentation, within an average period of 1 year after study subject&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;

      Routine virologic and immunologic tests to monitor HIV-1 in infected individuals on highly&#xD;
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) include CD4 T-cell enumeration, HIV-1 plasma viral&#xD;
      load, and HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing at baseline for treatment-naive patients and&#xD;
      following virologic failure during HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CD4 T-cell count is a measurement of the number of T helper lymphocytes and, in&#xD;
      conjunction with the CD4/cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) ratio, are surrogate markers to&#xD;
      evaluate the status of the immune system and used to monitor the progression and define&#xD;
      stages of HIV disease in infected subjects either on or off treatment. An increasing or high&#xD;
      CD4 count and CD4/CD8 ratio between 1 and 4 suggests control of virus replication as a result&#xD;
      of HAART (or from inherent immune activity in untreated subjects) while a decreasing or low&#xD;
      CD4 count and a CD4/CD8 ratio &lt;1 suggests HAART failure and/or a deteriorating immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-1 plasma viral load measures the number of HIV-1 RNA copies derived from virus particles&#xD;
      in plasma. A detectable plasma viral load indicates HIV-1 replication while an undetectable&#xD;
      plasma viral load suggests control of HIV-1 replication. Nevertheless, with the lower limit&#xD;
      of detection of 50 copies HIV-1 RNA/mL for commercial assays, lower levels of plasma virus&#xD;
      can remain undetected by these assays but detectable in approximately 70% patients on HAART&#xD;
      using research assays with a cutoff of &lt;50 copies HIV-1 RNA/ml. Such research based plasma&#xD;
      viral load assays are never used for routine monitoring in the clinical care of infected&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While CD4 counts and HIV-1 plasma viral load are inextricably related in the context of HIV-1&#xD;
      disease and currently the approved tests to determine HIV-1 response to HAART these assay&#xD;
      have significant shortcoming for the effective treatment of HIV as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4 counts and immune dysfunction. Increasing or high CD4 counts or normal CD4/CD8&#xD;
           ratios as a result of HAART may not necessarily represent an uncompromised immune system&#xD;
           but can represent a state of immune dysfunction as a result of immune activation from&#xD;
           continued HIV replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV Cellular reservoirs: Low levels of cell associated HIV replication undetected in&#xD;
           plasma by standard plasma viral load assay. Cell associated HIV replication is&#xD;
           determined by HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from extracted and purified total cell&#xD;
           associated RNA or in-situ hybridization to cell associated HIV-1 RNA in intact cells,&#xD;
           and detected in approximately 62% to 80% patients on HAART with a plasma viral load of&#xD;
           &lt;50 copies HIV-1 RNA/mL. Targeted treatment, cell associated HIV drug efficacy, cell&#xD;
           associated HIV resistance and identification of the cellular source of HIV can be&#xD;
           determined by HIV cell reservoirs assays and not by plasma viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional immune response differences based on cell associated HIV-1 transcriptional&#xD;
           activity and not undetectable plasma viral load. Immune responses in patients on HAART&#xD;
           with chronic, low level HIV replication in circulating T lymphocytes and undetectable&#xD;
           plasma viral load include significant in-vitro proliferation to HIV-1 p24 antigen, no&#xD;
           significant response to recall antigen tetanus toxoid and higher responses to pathogen&#xD;
           antigens compared to patients on HAART with undetectable HIV replication in memory T&#xD;
           lymphocytes and undetectable plasma viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence of plasma derived HIV-1 virions to erythrocytes. Erythrocytes sequester plasma&#xD;
           associated HIV-1 virions in whole blood from some patients on HAART. While these&#xD;
           patients have undetectable plasma viral load, the corresponding whole blood has viral&#xD;
           load values ranging from 234 to 82,878 copies HIV-1 RNA/mL whole blood. These patients&#xD;
           with detectable whole blood viral load but with undetectable plasma viral load display&#xD;
           clinically advanced HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4 counts and inexplicable response to HAART. A decrease in CD4 counts with an&#xD;
           undetectable plasma viral load may be explained by the sequestering of HIV plasma virus&#xD;
           to erythrocytes or low levels of cell associated HIV replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defective/non-infectious virions: HIV-1 plasma viral load assays cannot be used to&#xD;
           differentiate between infectious and non-infectious or defective virus particles as &lt;0.2&#xD;
           % circulating HIV-1 virions (or from 1:477 to 1: 117,803) are infectious. Consequently,&#xD;
           those genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance assays, and HIV-1 tropism assays that&#xD;
           utilize HIV-1 RNA derived from plasma virus HIV-1 RNA will generate results from mostly&#xD;
           non-infectious or defective virus. Difference in nucleic acid sequences between&#xD;
           infectious and non-infectious or defective virus has not been appropriately investigated&#xD;
           in relation to diagnostic and monitoring tests. The implications of utilizing viral&#xD;
           sequences from predominantly non-infectious or defective viral particles opposed to&#xD;
           infectious virus particles for drug resistance and tropism tests in the clinical care of&#xD;
           HIV infected patients is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, increasing evidence demonstrates that CD4 counts and plasma viral load cannot&#xD;
      be used to fully interpret the response of HIV to HAART. Moreover, mounting data proves that&#xD;
      continued HIV-1 replication in the absence of detectable plasma viral load generates HIV and&#xD;
      viral antigen resulting in immune activation thereby enabling HIV pathogenesis as&#xD;
      demonstrated from increased levels of T cell turnover and proliferation, apoptosis of&#xD;
      uninfected T cells as well as polyclonal B cell, natural killer (NK) cell and monocyte&#xD;
      activation. Various cell based markers have been associated with HIV pathogenesis including&#xD;
      immune activation markers Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-Cell Surface Receptor (DR) (HLA-DR),&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38), cluster of differentiation 69 (CD69), cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 71 (CD71), senescence marker cluster of differentiation 57 (CD57),&#xD;
      proliferation marker Ki67 and apoptosis marker cluster of differentiation 95 (CD95) (FasR).&#xD;
      Altogether these markers of HIV pathogenesis enable inflammatory responses, reseeding&#xD;
      reservoirs, HIV-1 evolution and drug resistance, and non-opportunistic diseases with a&#xD;
      gradual deterioration of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune function tests evaluate the functionality of a component of the immune system. They&#xD;
      are generally in-vitro based assays and are designed to measure an outcome following exposure&#xD;
      of lymphocytes to specific antigens or mitogens. The outcome may be the measurement of an&#xD;
      immune stimulation marker such as secretion of gamma interferon, incorporation of tritiated&#xD;
      thymidine into cellular genomic DNA as a result of a lymphoproliferative cell response to&#xD;
      recall antigen and/or mitogen or, in the case of the in-vivo based Tuberculin Skin Test, the&#xD;
      size of skin induration at the site of tuberculin purified protein derivative administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellestis Limited - A Qiagen Company, has recently developed the QuantiFERON® Monitor (QFM or&#xD;
      CST007) test based on the patented QuantiFERON® Technology to provide a measure of the&#xD;
      cell-mediated immune function. It is an in vitro diagnostic test that uses a combination of&#xD;
      stimulants to specifically stimulate different immune cells in the whole blood and measures&#xD;
      the interferon-gamma released in the plasma by ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).&#xD;
      Therefore, the aims of this study will address the utility of QFM in the HIV&#xD;
      immunocompromised setting and as cell associated markers HIV pathogenesis influence immune&#xD;
      function the HIV Viral Reservoir assay blood test will be included to better understand the&#xD;
      level of immune function within and between cohorts.&#xD;
