  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors have shown a superior efficacy compared to tamoxifen in the treatment of&#xD;
      hormonal receptor positive breast cancer in postmenopausal patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects like osteoporosis, bone fractures and muscle/bone pain are however more frequent&#xD;
      using of aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen. These side effects compromise the&#xD;
      patients' well being in a significant way and may favour the use of Tamoxifen in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore there is evidence that polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 Gene might be associated with&#xD;
      an improved efficacy of Tamoxifen that is equieffective to aromatase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the pharmacogenetics of aromatase inhibition there are known polymorphisms of the&#xD;
      CYP19A1 gene that are associated with altered peripheral sex hormone levels and altered&#xD;
      prognosis in breast cancer patients. One study could even associate a polymorphism in the&#xD;
      CYP19A1 gene with a prolonged time to progression in patients with metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      who have been treated with letrozol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the aim of this study is to identify biomarkers that could predict the efficacy of&#xD;
      an adjuvant Letrozol treatment in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.&#xD;

    <description>All patients are treated with letrozole 2.5 mg for 5 years for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal patients with a hormone receptor positive primary breast cancer. Patients are treated according to the authorities' approval of the drug. Of all patients a germline DNA sample will be obtained before the treatment starts and serum samples will be taken at months 0, 6 and 12. Furthermore the paraffin embedded tissue block will be sent to a central pathology laboratory for central assessment of tumor biomarkers.</description>
