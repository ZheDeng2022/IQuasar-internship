  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eggs contain an essential nutrient called choline and adequate levels of choline are required&#xD;
      for good health. Studies in mice have demonstrated that high levels of choline may increase&#xD;
      risk of heart disease through a process that involves the breakdown of choline by gut&#xD;
      bacteria. Previous research did not show that human consumption of eggs increases risk of&#xD;
      heart disease. This study is designed to investigate whether the number of eggs in the diet&#xD;
      affects blood and urine markers for heart disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diets low in choline have adverse health consequences, while observations in humans and&#xD;
      experiments in mouse models suggest that a diet containing too much choline or&#xD;
      phosphatidylcholine may activate inflammatory pathways and increase cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      risk through bacterial conversion of choline to trimethylamine (TMA) and its subsequent&#xD;
      oxidation to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the liver. What is unclear is whether choline&#xD;
      and phosphatidylcholine in eggs is a source of TMAO formation, and if so how many eggs must&#xD;
      be eaten before enough TMAO is generated to cause increased oxidized LDL (a biomarker for&#xD;
      atherosclerosis mechanisms). We hypothesize that TMAO will only be formed from eggs when very&#xD;
      large quantities are ingested and that TMAO formation will vary greatly between individuals&#xD;
      for any given dietary exposure. This variability will be determined by 1) the dose at which&#xD;
      dietary choline or phosphatidylcholine exceeds the absorptive capacity of the volunteer's&#xD;
      small intestine and therefore spills into large intestine where gut bacteria have access to&#xD;
      it and 2) the bacterial populations that constitute the volunteer's microbiome.&#xD;
