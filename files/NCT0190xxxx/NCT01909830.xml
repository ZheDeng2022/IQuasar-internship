      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, non randomized, open label phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Gemcitabine/Pemetrexed combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment period: 18 months. Treatment period: maximum for 24 weeks for each patient (12&#xD;
      cycles lasting 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the study: 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 38 subjects will be enrolled on study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - First stage:12 patients enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 1 or 0 responses were observed, the trial had to be terminated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Second stage: an additional of 23 patients were to be enrolled. If 5 or less responses were&#xD;
      observed in 35 patients, the combination would not be considered worthy of further study,&#xD;
      while if 6 or more responses were observed, the combination would be considered sufficiently&#xD;
      active to warrant further testing. Taking into account an invalidity rate of 5%, 38 patients&#xD;
      will be needed for this step.&#xD;

      A Phase II Study to evaluate activity and toxicity of Gemcitabine in Combination with&#xD;
      Pemetrexed long term infusion in the Treatment of pretreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, non randomized, open label phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Gemcitabine/Pemetrexed combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment period: 18 months. Treatment period: maximum for 24 weeks for each patient (12&#xD;
      cycles lasting 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the study: 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - objective response rate (ORR: CR+PR+SD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  safety profile of the drugs combination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 38 subjects will be enrolled on study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - First stage:12 patients enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 1 or 0 responses were observed, the trial had to be terminated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Second stage: an additional of 23 patients were to be enrolled. If 5 or less responses were&#xD;
      observed in 35 patients, the combination would not be considered worthy of further study,&#xD;
      while if 6 or more responses were observed, the combination would be considered sufficiently&#xD;
      active to warrant further testing. Taking into account an invalidity rate of 5%, 38 patients&#xD;
      will be needed for this step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimax two-stage Simon design will be employed. A 10% response will preclude further&#xD;
      study, whereas a 30% response rate will indicate that further study would be warranted. Using&#xD;
      α and β errors of 0.10 and 0.10, respectively, 12 patients will be enrolled in the first&#xD;
      stage, and if 1 or 0 responses were observed, the trial had to be terminated. Otherwise, an&#xD;
      additional of 23 patients were to be enrolled, and if 5 or less responses were observed in 35&#xD;
      patients, the combination would not be considered worthy of further study, while if 6 or more&#xD;
      responses were observed, the combination would be considered sufficiently active to warrant&#xD;
      further testing. Taking into account an invalidity rate of 5%, 38 patients will be needed for&#xD;
      this step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 6 enrolled patients will be closely controlled for safety and further patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled only in absence of severe toxicity resulting in discontinuation 1 month after the&#xD;
      first cycle of the six patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT (Intention To Treat) population. PFS and OS&#xD;
      will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The HR for PFS and OS will be estimated&#xD;
      according to the Cox model, with its relative 95% confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary analysis will be performed on the PP (per-protocol) population. The Overall&#xD;
      Response Rate to study treatment will be reported on the ITT and PP population with 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval. Results will be tabulated and not evaluable patients will be included as&#xD;
      additional category.&#xD;

             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Recovery from all prior treatment-related toxicities to CTC &lt;= grade 1 (except&#xD;
             alopecia)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. The effects of Gemcitabine and Pemetrexed on the developing human fetus at the&#xD;
             recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because therapeutic&#xD;
             agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, female participants of child&#xD;
             bearing potential and male participants whose partner is of child bearing potential&#xD;
             must be willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) during the study and for 3&#xD;
             months thereafter. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the&#xD;
             study. Voluntary signed and dated written informed consent form in accordance with&#xD;
             regulatory and institutional guidelines obtained before the performance of any&#xD;
             protocol-related procedures not part of normal patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational agents within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous treatment with Gemcitabine or Pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Gemcitabine and/or Pemetrexed or other agents used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Past or current history of neoplasm other than colorectal carcinoma with a&#xD;
             disease-free interval of less than 5 years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to interrupt aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents 2 days&#xD;
             before, the day of, and 2 days after the dose of pemetrexed single agent or pemetrexed&#xD;
