      1. To determine if BCG immunisation at birth, compared to no BCG immunisation, leads to a&#xD;
           reduction in measures of allergy and infection in the first 12 months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the immunological mechanisms underlying the non-specific effects of BCG by&#xD;
           comparing markers of immunity between the BCG and non-BCG groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a dramatic rise in allergic diseases worldwide since the 1980s. Asthma rates&#xD;
      increased first, followed by eczema, allergic rhinitis and, more recently, food allergy -&#xD;
      especially in infants and young children. In Australia, the prevalence of allergic disease is&#xD;
      particularly high: up to 30% of children are affected, and eczema and asthma are among the&#xD;
      most common chronic diseases of childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventing allergic disease by an immunomodulatory intervention early in life would be a&#xD;
      major advance with significant implications for individual health and public health&#xD;
      resources. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunisation is a potential intervention with an&#xD;
      established safety profile. This vaccine has powerful non-specific effects on the cellular&#xD;
      immune response that potentially prime host immunity away from an allergic pathway.&#xD;
      Observational data and one small randomised controlled trial (RCT) suggest that BCG&#xD;
      immunisation at birth leads to a substantial reduction in allergic disease - however, there&#xD;
      is an absence of level 1 evidence.&#xD;
