  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a hospital pharmacy team (pharmacy&#xD;
      technicians and pharmacists) together with (recently admitted) patients are able to diminish&#xD;
      the number of drug related problems including adverse drug events, made before, during and&#xD;
      after admissions resulting in reductions of re-hospitalizations and costs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In its 2006 report &quot;Preventing Medication Errors,&quot; the Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimated&#xD;
      that more than 1.5 million adverse drug events (ADEs) occur annually in the United States. On&#xD;
      average, every hospital patient is subjected to at least one medication error every day.&#xD;
      Medication errors are a frequent cause of ADEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADEs are usually defined as 'any injury due to medication use, including omission'. This may&#xD;
      occur as an unavoidable result of the pharmacological action (better known as side effect or&#xD;
      adverse drug reaction (ADR)) or by the manner the drug is applied (medication error or&#xD;
      preventable ADE). ADEs can be regarded as the top of the iceberg containing all problems&#xD;
      associated with drug therapy also known as Drug-Related Problems (DRPs). This means that&#xD;
      besides ADEs, DRPs include other medication related problems like ADRs, medication errors,&#xD;
      non-adherence and inadequate use of the medication by the patient. All these events can&#xD;
      result in harm for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wide variation of prevalence of ADEs found in the literature can be explained by&#xD;
      differences in study setting, study population, outcome (ADRs, ADEs or both) and data&#xD;
      collection method. Anticipating who will suffer an ADE, when, and from what medication is&#xD;
      difficult. Research has not yet identified any valid predictors of the event. Patient&#xD;
      characteristics currently are no useful predictors of an ADE because patients who have&#xD;
      suffered ADEs are a non homogeneous group. Although older age, severity of illness, intensity&#xD;
      of treatment, and poly-pharmacy have been associated with ADEs, no cause and effect&#xD;
      relationship is known to exist between patients who suffer ADEs and age, comorbidity, or&#xD;
      number of drugs received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around the time of hospitalization 15 to 72% of harmful events is attributed to ADEs and&#xD;
      medication errors. ADEs are associated with substantial morbidity, increased mortality and&#xD;
      longer length of stay in hospital and other direct costs. Nearly 1% (0,946) of patients who&#xD;
      died during admission on an internal medicine department, were associated with the use of one&#xD;
      or more drugs during this admission. Furthermore, a recent investigation among 21 Dutch&#xD;
      hospitals by Hoonhout et al. revealed an excess length of stay of 6,2 days (95% CI 3.6,8.8)&#xD;
      as a result of medication related adverse events. This figure is comparable to that of the&#xD;
      American situation. Patients suffering from less severe ADEs (those that required a change in&#xD;
      therapy or a longer hospital stay) had an average stay of 13 days, and patients who did not&#xD;
      suffer an ADE had an average stay of 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, common reasons for admission include avoidable ADEs. Gillespie et al.&#xD;
      investigated the effect of a ward based pharmacist on hospital admissions amongst 80 year old&#xD;
      patients and over. After 12 months the risk on medication related readmissions had been&#xD;
      reduced in the intervention group with 80% OR 0.20 (95% CI 0.10, 0.41). However, the total&#xD;
      number of readmission (including medication related) showed a very balanced outcome in both&#xD;
      intervention and control group. Generally spoken, very few studies have shown a statistical&#xD;
      significant impact of pharmacist intervention(s) on hospital readmission. Factors influencing&#xD;
      (re) hospitalization are complex and comprise at least medical conditions and age. The&#xD;
      pharmacist has shown to be very effective in reducing the number of DRPs and ADEs but only&#xD;
      few studies have established an effect on healthcare utilization so far. A recent Cochrane&#xD;
      review on discharge planning revealed that a structured discharge plan tailored to the&#xD;
      individual patient probably brings about small reductions in hospital length of stay and&#xD;
      readmission rates for older people admitted to hospital. This is in line with the results of&#xD;
      the Institute for Healthcare Improvement survey: a multi faceted program comprising close&#xD;
      coordination of care in the post-acute period, early post-discharge follow-up, enhanced&#xD;
      patient education and self-management training, reduced the number of rehospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that reason we designed a multifaceted program comprising a series of interventions: on&#xD;
      admission, during hospital stay and at discharge counseling and information transfer for&#xD;
      other healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key in this intervention process is medication reconciliation. Medication reconciliation is&#xD;
      described as the &quot;process of obtaining a complete and accurate list of each patient's current&#xD;
      home medications-including name, dosage, frequency, and route of administration-and comparing&#xD;
      the physician's admission, transfer, and/or discharge orders to that list&quot;, with the goal to&#xD;
      provide the patients correct medications. The Joint Commission International (JCI),&#xD;
      accrediting authority of World Health Organization (WHO) has mandated medication&#xD;
      reconciliation as a key towards reduction of medications errors related to transition in&#xD;
      healthcare settings. In line with overseas regulations, Dutch authorities have commanded a&#xD;
      comparable protocol since January 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacy driven medication reconciliation interventions are often practised by (clinical)&#xD;
      pharmacists and trained technicians. The efficacy of these interventions is assessed in&#xD;
      various constitutions of teams: only technicians or only pharmacists and in-between these&#xD;
      forms as well as in ambulatory and hospital setting. Many of these studies were found to be&#xD;
      successful regarding significant reduction in medication errors and impact on clinical&#xD;
      outcome. Other settings, with small samples and interventions particular without transition&#xD;
      of information, appeared to be less flourishing specifically regarding economic outcomes.&#xD;
      Interestingly, although the Dutch authorities have mandated medication reconciliation as an&#xD;
      obligatory part of healthcare, few studies have been performed to measure the effect of this&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, effects of interventions of a hospital based pharmacy team on number of unplanned&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations and ADEs or frequency of medication related harms as a result of ADEs,&#xD;
      are mixed or unknown. Furthermore, no studies have addressed the extent to which ADRs and&#xD;
      ADEs amongst both acutely and electively admitted patients can be detected and diminished by&#xD;
      pharmacists. Also, very limited data exist regarding differences in prevalence of ADRs and&#xD;
      ADEs between study wards. It thus appears that these subjects still have to be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a study is performed to establish the impact of a hospital pharmacy team on number&#xD;
      and economic impact of unplanned re-hospitalizations. To determine independent contributions&#xD;
      of various factors to the primary endpoint, age, sex, Charlson Co-morbidity index,renal&#xD;
      function, hospital site, ward type, being admitted 6 months before index admission, quality&#xD;
      of live (EuroQoL D5), culture on the ward, patient and healthcare professionals satisfaction&#xD;
      and use of high risk drugs will be included in the logistic regression analysis. Also,&#xD;
      occurence of DRPs and ADEs, with a focus on reduction of the frequency of ADEs and time spend&#xD;
      by the pharmacy team with subsequent costs per prevented ADE and DRP as compared to usual&#xD;
      pharmaceutical care will be calculated. Other healthcare uses like emergency department&#xD;
      visits, length of stay, general practitioner consultations and drug consumption during post&#xD;
      discharge period will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the introduction of protocolised medication reconciliation and discharge service by&#xD;
           a hospital pharmacy team influence the number of unplanned re-hospitalizations and ADEs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What DRPs occur and how often do DRPs occur? Which DRPs are highly correlated with&#xD;
           unplanned readmissions and ADEs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the introduction of protocolised medication reconciliation by a hospital pharmacy&#xD;
           team influence insurance costs caused by reduction of length of hospital stay, number of&#xD;
           unplanned re-hospitalizations or readmissions, emergency visits, general practitioner&#xD;
           visits, direct medicine cost within 14 days, 3 and 6 months after index admission? Can&#xD;
           we extract from this information what the costs are per prevented ADE?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the satisfaction with information about medicines of included patients changed&#xD;
           compared to control?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the satisfaction with the introduction of a pharmaceutical team for medication&#xD;
           reconciliation of healthcare professionals changed compared to control?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which patients or circumstances are at high risk for DRP or ADEs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the time spend on patient centred medication reconciliation, discharge&#xD;
           counselling, intermediate medication review?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A multi - centre prospective, before-after study will be performed. Each of the 4-6&#xD;
      participating centers have selected a predefined ward, namely emergency department, internal&#xD;
      medicine, neurology, surgery, or cardiology. Per ward type 300 patients are planned to be&#xD;
      included, comprising both before- and after period. Thus, 150 patients per arm per ward are&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, over a 3 to 4 month period baseline assessments in each hospital in the participating&#xD;
      wards will be performed (control or usual care group). Secondly, the intervention is&#xD;
      implemented on all included study wards, after a brief education of hospital pharmacy teams.&#xD;
      Finally, during the 3 to 4 months intervention phase, patients are included. Both groups have&#xD;
      a follow-up period of 6 months.&#xD;
