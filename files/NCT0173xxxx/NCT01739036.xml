    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-centre phase I/IIa sporozoite-challenge trial to assess the&#xD;
      safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of two combination ChAd63-MVA heterologous prime-boost&#xD;
      vaccination regimens. All volunteers recruited will be healthy, malaria naïve adults aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of each of two combinations of heterologous prime-boost&#xD;
      immunisation strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP combined with ChAd63-MVA CS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP combined with ChAd63-MVA CS and ChAd63-MVA AMA1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the University of Oxford's Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and&#xD;
      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford, UK and the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility in&#xD;
      Southampton, UK. The malaria challenge will take place at the insectary at Imperial College&#xD;
      (Infection and Immunity Section) in London, UK.&#xD;

    <description>To assess the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost immunisation of malaria-naïve individuals with ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP combined with ChAd63-MVA CS or with ChAd63-MVA CS plus ChAd63-MVA AMA1.&#xD;
The safety of the vaccine regimens will be assessed by analysing actively and passively collected data from clinical review of volunteers and laboratory measurements. The ability of the vaccines to induce malaria-specific immune responses immunogenicity) will be assessed by the following laboratory tests; (A) Interferon gamma ELISPOT. (B) Flow cytometry to measure T cell responses. Other laboratory investigations including microarray analysis may be performed.</description>
