  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specific rules which generic drug&#xD;
      companies must follow to get a generic copy of a seizure medication approved. Currently, FDA&#xD;
      approves generic drugs by requiring studies on normal volunteers who don't have epilepsy and&#xD;
      who take just one dose of the generic drug followed by a series of blood tests. Some people&#xD;
      with epilepsy and their physicians have complained about side effects or loss of seizure&#xD;
      control when taking generic drugs, but no one knows if these complaints are truly because of&#xD;
      problems with the generic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is to determine whether several different generic versions and the brand&#xD;
      version of the medication lamotrigine perform in a similar way when given to people with&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug Lamictal® (lamotrigine) and both of the generic forms of lamotrigine to be&#xD;
      tested are approved by the FDA for the treatment of seizures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study proposed in this protocol will determine if bioequivalence testing performed for&#xD;
      the FDA translates into similar bioequivalence in a population of people with epilepsy when&#xD;
      switching among different generics of the anti-epileptic drug (AED). Based on a variety of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) data and clinical reports of concern, the example anti epilepsy drug&#xD;
      (AED) used for this study will be lamotrigine (LTG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single dose study, people with epilepsy taking AEDs, but not currently taking the&#xD;
      test medication, lamotrigine, will be studied. We will use an order-randomized three-sequence&#xD;
      six-period replicate design with the two most disparate generics studied in two replicate&#xD;
      periods each and the brand (reference) product studied in two additional periods. A standard&#xD;
      single dose of the test drug (lamotrigine 25mg) will be administered under controlled&#xD;
      conditions (fasting with subsequent standardized meals) with a 12-hour in-facility blood&#xD;
      sample collection followed by a collection every 24 hours for a total of a 96 hour sample&#xD;
      collection that will be used to establish the pharmacokinetic measures of Cmax, AUC96 and&#xD;
      AUC∞. Each period will be separated by at least a 12 day washout interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The replicate studies will be used to determine the intra-individual variability of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic responses of the brand and the two generic products, as well as&#xD;
      subject-by-formulation interaction variances. The data will also be used to calculate&#xD;
      simultaneously all parameters that are needed to compare the 3 products in average and&#xD;
      individual bioequivalence and outlier analyses. The differences between the disparate&#xD;
      generics will be used to establish if the current standards translate to equivalence within&#xD;
      the limits of the brand intra-subject variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factors we will use to determine the most disparate generics include the results from the&#xD;
      in vivo data from the ABE studies submitted to the FDA in the ANDA and in vitro chemical&#xD;
      assay (potency) and dissolution data performed on several currently available lots. The&#xD;
      intent is to study the specific lot of the generic product predicted to result in the lowest&#xD;
      levels and compare it to the specific lot from another generic product predicted to result in&#xD;
      the highest levels. Similarly, if multiple lots of the brand products are available, we will&#xD;
      perform in vitro testing to establish the most desirable lot to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that alter metabolism, including concomitant AEDs that may have hepatic enzyme&#xD;
      induction effects will be tracked but not excluded, as long as the dose remains constant, as&#xD;
      the goal is to reproduce the 'real life' situation as closely as possible within the&#xD;
      practical limits of funding and study size. Subjects receiving valproate as concomitant&#xD;
      medication will be excluded because the prolongation of half life would not allow LTG to&#xD;
      reliably be completely cleared by 13 days. The criteria that establish an enriched population&#xD;
      will also be tracked and used in a secondary analysis, but will not be used as an inclusion&#xD;
      requirement. The enriched population is defined as people who experienced an otherwise&#xD;
      unexplained increase in seizures or adverse effects, or a substantial change in AED level&#xD;
      after a switch in AED products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discovery of any subject-by-formulation interaction outliers (i.e. subjects with&#xD;
      differential pharmacokinetic reactions to a pair of formulations) will raise considerable&#xD;
      concerns about equivalence. Recently established methods in the statistical analysis of&#xD;
      outliers in crossover studies will be used to determine if any outliers are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified subjects will be screened and upon fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      signing the informed consent will be enrolled in the study and enter the randomization phase&#xD;
      (2-30 days). Subjects will be randomized according to a sealed allocation list that will be&#xD;
      balanced for sequence and provided to each site prior to the first subject enrollment.&#xD;
      Subjects that withdraw prior to completing the third period will be replaced in a randomized&#xD;
      manner. The randomization list will be generated by the study statistical group. There are&#xD;
      six test periods in three sequences for a sequence-randomized study. During two test periods&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single dose of the brand AED and during the other four test periods&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single dose from one of the two investigated generics (each twice).&#xD;
      The single doses will be administered in the fasting state during an in-facility 12-hour&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic session to collect samples to determine Cmax and AUCs. Four additional&#xD;
      samples will be drawn at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the dose as an outpatient (making&#xD;
      each pharmacokinetic test last for 4 days). Each in-facility pharmacokinetic testing will be&#xD;
      separated by a 12-23 day washout period; consistent washout periods of 14 days will be&#xD;
      preferred. A final follow-up phone evaluation will be conducted 12-16 days (target 14 days)&#xD;
      after the last dose. During the study the subjects will continue their usual concomitant&#xD;
      medications, including AEDs, without change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare the AED levels as measured by Cmax and AUC in each group using&#xD;
      average bioequivalence (ABE) and individual bioequivalence (IBE) criteria. Average&#xD;
      bioequivalence will be established if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of&#xD;
      Cmax and AUCs for the most disparate generic products compared to each other are entirely&#xD;
      within the 80%-125% range (the FDA criteria for bioequivalence) using the two one-sided&#xD;
      standard analyses. Otherwise the products will be considered to not be bioequivalent.&#xD;
      Similarly, the products will be considered to not be bioequivalent if the criteria for IBE&#xD;
      for each generic product compared to the brand product are not met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Approximately 54 subjects (45 subjects to completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers: 3 sites enrolling approximately 18 subjects each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: Approximately 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Not donated blood within the past 56 days before the first pharmacokinetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Agrees not to donate blood at any time during the trial and for 56 days after the&#xD;
             final PK in-facility admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has epilepsy for at least one year based on site PIs assessment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Have the ability to understand the informed consent form and be willing to provide&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willing to remain on same AED regimen through entire study. Subjects will be&#xD;
             responsible to supply all of their concomitant medications (except for the study&#xD;
             medication, lamotrigine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willing to stay approximately 14 hours in the research facility on six separate&#xD;
             occasions for pharmacokinetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willing to fast overnight and the morning of each of the six pharmacokinetic testing&#xD;
             sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Willing to have at least 23 blood samples collected during the pharmacokinetic testing&#xD;
             including the in-facility session and each of the following four mornings for 96 hours&#xD;
             post the study medication dose to complete the sample collection for each of the 6&#xD;
             periods. The in-facility blood collections will mainly be performed using an inserted&#xD;
             catheter. In the event of difficulty with the catheter, samples may be drawn by&#xD;
             venipuncture. The outpatient collections will be drawn by venipuncture. The total&#xD;
             amount of blood during each PK session will be equal to about 14 teaspoons (66.5&#xD;
             milliliters). The total amount of blood drawn throughout the entire study will be&#xD;
             about 96 teaspoons (478.5 milliliters) or less. For reference, this amount is&#xD;
             approximately equal to the quantity of blood drawn during a standard blood donation by&#xD;
             the Red Cross.&#xD;
