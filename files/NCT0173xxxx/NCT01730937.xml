    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies sorafenib tosylate and stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy to see how well they work compared to sorafenib tosylate alone in treating patients&#xD;
      with liver cancer. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send&#xD;
      the radiation dose directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving&#xD;
      sorafenib tosylate together with stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves overall survival in&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the difference in time to progression (TTP) and progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) in HCC patients treated with sorafenib compared to SBRT followed by sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure differences in toxicity in HCC patients treated with sorafenib versus SBRT&#xD;
      followed by sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure vascular thrombosis response post sorafenib versus SBRT followed by&#xD;
      sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure differences in health related quality of life (QOL) and quality-adjusted&#xD;
      survival in HCC patients treated with sorafenib compared to SBRT followed by sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Collection of biospecimens for future correlative studies to investigate differences in&#xD;
      potential biomarkers in patients treated with sorafenib versus SBRT followed by sorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients undergo SBRT every 24-72 hours for a total of 5 fractions over 5 to 15 days.&#xD;
      Within 1-5 days post-SBRT, patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed weekly during SBRT, monthly during sorafenib tosylate and on the&#xD;
      following schedule as a whole from study entry: every 3 months for 3 years, then every 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years and then annually.&#xD;
