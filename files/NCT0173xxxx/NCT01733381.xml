  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise impacts bodily processes implicated in the pathophysiology of major&#xD;
      depression. Consistent with these effects, aerobic exercise in general, and running in&#xD;
      particular, has been repeatedly shown to have both immediate mood elevating and longer-term&#xD;
      antidepressant effects. To the investigators' knowledge, all studies of running as a&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention for mood have had subjects run in standard running shoes, despite&#xD;
      increasing evidence that running barefoot or in shoes with minimal effect on foot strike&#xD;
      (i.e. &quot;minimally shod&quot;) leads to marked changes in how people run in ways that might have&#xD;
      physiological effects of relevance to health. Thus, nothing is currently known about&#xD;
      differences in effects on depression-relevant physiological or emotional functioning between&#xD;
      running either barefoot or minimally-shod vs. running in standard running shoes (hereafter&#xD;
      called &quot;shoed). The current pilot study is designed to begin addressing these issues by&#xD;
      examining effects of minimally shod vs. shoed running on non-invasive measures of autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system (ANS) functioning and mood state.&#xD;

      Aerobic exercise impacts bodily processes implicated in the pathophysiology of major&#xD;

      differences in effects on depression-relevant physiological or emotional functioning between&#xD;
      running either barefoot or minimally-shod vs. running in standard running shoes (hereafter&#xD;
      called &quot;shoed). The current pilot study is designed to begin addressing these issues by&#xD;
      examining effects of minimally shod vs. shoed running on non-invasive measures of autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system (ANS) functioning and mood state. The investigators have selected the ANS as&#xD;
      the physiological focus of the current study for several reasons including: 1) running&#xD;
      acutely alters ANS activity; 2) running (and aerobic fitness in general) is associated with&#xD;
      increased parasympathetic and reduced sympathetic activity at rest; 3) increased&#xD;
      parasympathetic tone in the body has been repeatedly associated with emotional well-being and&#xD;
      stress resilience, whereas reduced parasympathetic tone has been reliably associated with&#xD;
      major depression; 4) given increasing evidence that ancestral humans may have run&#xD;
      exceptionally long distances to hunt prey to exhaustion, it is likely that such running was&#xD;
      conducted under fairly significant parasympathetic tone to reduce energy expenditure; 5)&#xD;
      ancestral humans ran barefoot or minimally shod suggesting that the type of foot strike&#xD;
      pattern encouraged by these styles of running may have enhanced parasympathetic tone compared&#xD;
      to running with heel strike such as occurs when running shoed; and 6) therefore minimally&#xD;
      shod running might differentially impact parasympathetic tone in ways that would make it more&#xD;
      effective as a treatment for depression than running shoed.&#xD;
