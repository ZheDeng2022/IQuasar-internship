  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilated ICU patients frequently have sepsis and the majority have delirium, a form of&#xD;
      brain dysfunction that is an independent predictor of increased risk of dying, length of&#xD;
      stay, costs, and prolonged cognitive impairment in survivors. Universally prescribed sedative&#xD;
      medications-the GABA-ergic benzodiazepines-worsen this brain organ dysfunction. The available&#xD;
      alternative sedation regimens, the shorter acting GABA-ergic propofol, and the alpha2&#xD;
      agonist, dexmedetomidine, have both been shown to be superior to benzodiazepines, and yet are&#xD;
      different with regard to their effects on innate immunity, bacterial clearance, apoptosis,&#xD;
      cognition and delirium. The MENDS2 study will compare propofol and dexmedetomidine, and&#xD;
      determine the best sedative medication to reduce delirium and improve survival and long-term&#xD;
      brain function in our most vulnerable patients- the ventilated septic patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) secondary to sepsis is the leading cause of&#xD;
      admission to the intensive care unit, often necessitating sedation for patient safety and&#xD;
      comfort. Recently, we have learned that these sedative medications contribute to iatrogenic&#xD;
      injury, such as prolonging ventilator time and ICU length of stay and exacerbating acute&#xD;
      brain dysfunction. This acute brain dysfunction, manifested as delirium and coma, occurs in&#xD;
      50%-70% of MV septic patients and is a significant contributor not only to death but also to&#xD;
      functional and cognitive decline, which can persist for years after recovery of lung and&#xD;
      other organ function, levying significant costs to patients and society. Despite advances in&#xD;
      the management of acute respiratory failure and sepsis, few clinical trials have examined the&#xD;
      effects that supportive therapies, like sedation, may have on both short- and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes in this vulnerable population. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, in particular, have been shown to increase brain dysfunction, promote&#xD;
      infection, and prolong MV. Therefore, the short-acting GABA-ergic sedative propofol and the&#xD;
      alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine are becoming widely used to sedate septic MV patients. There&#xD;
      are only a few randomized trials, however, to guide clinicians when selecting between these&#xD;
      and other sedatives, and none have explored the mechanisms underlying the differences in&#xD;
      outcomes, though some data indicate that GABA-ergic and alpha2 agonist agents have very&#xD;
      different effects on innate immunity, apoptosis, arousability, and respiratory drive. In&#xD;
      early animal and human studies, dexmedetomidine had more anti-inflammatory effects than the&#xD;
      GABA-ergic agents; dexmedetomidine improved bacterial clearance, whereas propofol impaired&#xD;
      it. In addition, sedation with dexmedetomidine instead of benzodiazepines reduces delirium by&#xD;
      20%-30% and improves arousability, cognition, and attentiveness in ventilated patients.&#xD;
      Alpha2 agonists induce unconsciousness at the brainstem-more akin to natural sleep-which may&#xD;
      improve autonomic function and immunity. All these factors converge to suggest that sedation&#xD;
      with an alpha2 agonist rather than a GABAergic agent may improve outcomes, including brain&#xD;
      function, MV, and survival, for septic MV patients. We therefore propose the MENDS2&#xD;
      (Maximizing the Efficacy of Sedation and Reducing Neurological Dysfunction and Mortality in&#xD;
      Septic Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure) study, in which we will test the hypotheses&#xD;
      that sedation of MV severely septic patients with an alpha2 agonist (dexmedetomidine) rather&#xD;
      than a GABAergic agent (propofol) will (Aim 1A) increase days alive without delirium or coma,&#xD;
      (Aim 1B) increase ventilator-free days, (Aim 2A) improve 90-day survival, (Aim 2B) decrease&#xD;
      long-term cognitive impairment, and (Aim 3) reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade&#xD;
      following sepsis. We will randomize 420 ventilated, severely septic patients requiring&#xD;
      goal-directed sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol, giving the study 85% power to detect&#xD;
      a difference of 1.5 delirium/coma-free days and an absolute difference in mortality of 12%&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;

    <description>The analysis of DCFDs will be conducted using Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who were randomized and received study drug. We chose a 14 day evaluation period for delirium, because it represents the best balance of gaining valuable clinical information, while maximizing resource utilization, given the average study drug infusion to be 7 days and maximum duration to be 14 days. Thus our follow-up period will cover 7 additional days of delirium monitoring after the study drug is stopped in the majority of our patients.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consecutive patients will be eligible for inclusion in the MENDS2 study if they are: [1]&#xD;
        adult patients (≥18 years old) [2] in a medical and/or surgical ICU and [3] on MV and&#xD;
        requiring sedation and [4] have suspected or known infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded (i.e., not consented) for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Rapidly resolving organ failure, indicated by planned immediate discontinuation of MV,&#xD;
             at time of screening for study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe dementia or neurodegenerative disease, defined as either impairment that&#xD;
             prevents the patient from living independently at baseline or IQCODE &gt;4.5, measured&#xD;
             using a patient's qualified surrogate. This exclusion also pertains to mental&#xD;
             illnesses requiring long-term institutionalization, acquired or congenital mental&#xD;
             retardation, severe neuromuscular disorders, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's&#xD;
             disease. It also excludes patients in coma or with severe deficits due to structural&#xD;
             brain diseases such as stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, cranial trauma, malignancy,&#xD;
             anoxic brain injury, or cerebral edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of 2nd or 3rd degree heart block, bradycardia &lt; 50 beats/minute, pacemaker for&#xD;
             bradyarrythmias or uncompensated shock.If patient has a pacemaker for bradyarrythmias,&#xD;
             then patient does not meet this exclusion criterion and may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Benzodiazepine dependency or history of alcohol dependency based on the medical team's&#xD;
             decision to institute a specific treatment plan involving benzodiazepines (either as&#xD;
             continuous infusions or intermittent intravenous boluses) for this dependency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active seizures during this ICU admission being treated with intravenous&#xD;
             benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Expected death within 24 hours of enrollment or lack of commitment to aggressive&#xD;
             treatment by family/medical team (e.g., likely to withdraw life support measures&#xD;
             within 24 hrs of screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to understand English or deafness or vision loss that will preclude delirium&#xD;
             evaluation. The inability to understand English (for example in Spanish-only or&#xD;
             Mandarin-only speaking patients) will not result in exclusion at centers where the&#xD;
             research staff is proficient and/or translation services are actively available in&#xD;
             that particular language; these patients will not be followed in the long-term&#xD;
             follow-up phase of the trial since the testing materials are primarily available only&#xD;
             in English. Patients with laryngectomies and those with hearing deficits are eligible&#xD;
             for enrollment if their medical condition permits them to communicate with research&#xD;
             staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to obtain informed consent from an authorized representative within 48 hours&#xD;
             of meeting all inclusion criteria, i.e., developing sepsis and qualifying organ&#xD;
             dysfunction criteria for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Attending physician refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient and/or surrogate refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patient unable to consent and no surrogate available.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. 48-hour period of eligibility was exceeded before the patient was screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Prisoners.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Medical team following patient unwilling to use the sedation regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Documented allergy to propofol or dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Current enrollment in a study that does not allow co-enrollment or that uses delirium&#xD;
             as a primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who are on muscle relaxant infusions at time of screening with plans to&#xD;
             maintain paralysis &gt;48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Greater than 96 hours on mechanical ventilation prior to meeting all inclusion&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;

Patients will only receive study drug while in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation, and thus will be monitored with continuous telemetry as per usual ICU practice.&#xD;
Dosing Range. Study drug dose will be titrated in a double-blind manner according to clinical effect to achieve a &quot;goal&quot; or &quot;target&quot; Richmond Agitation Sedation Score set by the managing clinical team. For patients in the dexmedetomidine group, dose will range from 0.15-1.5 mcg/kg/hr.&#xD;
Dexmedetomidine: For patients in the dexmedetomidine group, dose will range from 0.15-1.5 mcg/kg/hr. For example, a 70 kg patient would receive 10.5 mL of study drug per hour, which would provide 0.75 mcg/kg/hr of dexmedetomidine. This dose range have been selected after literature review and discussions with critical care practitioners, investigational pharmacists, and the MENDS2 study steering committee.</description>

          <description>The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline (IQCODE) Short Form is a 16 question self-reported measure of cognitive functioning evaluating the degree of decline from baseline. Surrogates in the study must know participant for at least 10 years. Each question includes the prompt, &quot;Compared to 10 years ago how is the patient faring now&quot;? Questions range in score from 1 to 5, with a minimum total survey score of 16 and maximum of 80. An average question score of 3 means the subject is rated as 'no change'. An average score of 4 means 'a bit worse', and an average score of 5 is 'much worse'.</description>

          <title>Charlson Comorbities index score</title>
          <description>The Charlson Comorbidity Index categorizes comorbidities of participants based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes found in administrative data (e.g., hospital records). Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use. The sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity index score for participants ranging from 0 to 37. A score of zero indicates no comorbidities. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use.</description>

        <title>Delirium/Coma Free Days (DCFDs)</title>
        <description>The analysis of DCFDs will be conducted using Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who were randomized and received study drug. We chose a 14 day evaluation period for delirium, because it represents the best balance of gaining valuable clinical information, while maximizing resource utilization, given the average study drug infusion to be 7 days and maximum duration to be 14 days. Thus our follow-up period will cover 7 additional days of delirium monitoring after the study drug is stopped in the majority of our patients.</description>

For example, a 70 kg patient would receive 10.5 mL of study drug per hour, which would provide 25 mcg/kg/min of propofol. This dose range has been selected after literature review and discussions with critical care practitioners, investigational pharmacists, and the MENDS2 study steering committee.</description>
