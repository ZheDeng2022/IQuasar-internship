  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Approximately 50%&#xD;
      of subjects aged ≥65 have diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, a pre-diabetic state.&#xD;
      Purpose: In the proposed study, the investigators will test the hypotheses that the decrease&#xD;
      in fat oxidation that occurs in muscle from older human subjects is secondary to an&#xD;
      age-mediated reduction in AMPK signaling, in vivo, and that upregulating AMPK signaling&#xD;
      through exercise training will result in (and correlate with) increased fat oxidation,&#xD;
      reduced intramyocellular lipids, and improved insulin action.&#xD;

      Aging is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Approximately 50%&#xD;
      of subjects aged ≥65 have diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, a pre-diabetic state.&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle is the main site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and aging is&#xD;
      characterized by muscle insulin resistance. It has been suggested that the insulin resistance&#xD;
      of aging results from an age-related accumulation of intramyocellular lipids which impair&#xD;
      insulin action. However, the molecular basis for the accumulation of intramyocellular fat and&#xD;
      insulin resistance in the elderly remains unknown. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an&#xD;
      energy-sensing enzyme whose activation results in increased fatty acid oxidation. Purpose: In&#xD;
      the proposed study, we will test the hypotheses that the decrease in fat oxidation that&#xD;
      occurs in muscle from older human subjects is secondary to an age-mediated reduction in AMPK&#xD;
      signaling, in vivo, and that upregulating AMPK signaling through exercise training will&#xD;
      result in (and correlate with) increased fat oxidation, reduced intramyocellular lipids, and&#xD;
      improved insulin action. Using a primary human muscle cell culture system, also we will test&#xD;
      that hypotheses that reduced AMPK signaling in old myotubes leads to lower fat oxidation (in&#xD;
      vitro) and that chemical activation of AMPK in old myotubes to the same level as young muscle&#xD;
      cells will restore insulin action and help prevent fat-induced insulin resistance. To test&#xD;
      these hypotheses the following specific aims (objectives) are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1) To determine whether reduced AMPK signaling in muscle from older subjects, in&#xD;
      vivo, is associated with lower fat oxidation rates and insulin resistance, and whether&#xD;
      physical activity improves glucose homeostasis in older subjects by upregulating AMPK&#xD;
      signaling in muscle. We will test the hypotheses that (i) reductions in AMPK signaling in&#xD;
      muscle from older subjects will be associated with (predict) lower fat oxidation rates and&#xD;
      insulin resistance, in vivo; and (ii) training-induced increases in AMPK signaling in older&#xD;
      subjects will be associated with (predict) increases in fat oxidation, reductions in&#xD;
      intramyocellular lipids, and improvements in insulin action/sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2) To determine whether age-related declines in AMPK signaling are involved in&#xD;
      the reductions in fat oxidation and insulin resistance that occur in aging. Using an in vitro&#xD;
      primary muscle cell culture system, we will test the hypotheses that (i) reduced AMPK&#xD;
      signaling in myotubes from older subjects leads to decreased mitochondrial fatty acid&#xD;
      oxidation; and (ii) reduced AMPK signaling and fat oxidation in myotubes from older subjects&#xD;
      will result in increased susceptibility to fat-induced insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3) To examine whether the age-related reductions in fat oxidation and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in old muscle cells can be reversed by upregulating AMPK signaling. We will test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that chemical activation of AMPK in old myotubes (in vitro) to the same level&#xD;
      as young muscle cells will restore insulin signaling and help prevent fat-induced insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
