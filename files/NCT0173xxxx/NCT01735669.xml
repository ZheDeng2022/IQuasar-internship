      Objectives: The objective is to demonstrate the superiority of remifentanil versus nitrous&#xD;
      oxide as adjuvant analgesic treatment to increase the chances of success of external cephalic&#xD;
      version in the management of non-cephalic presentation in women with singleton pregnancy at&#xD;
      term. Another objective is to compare their safety, tolerability and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: single-center clinical trial, randomized, open, parallel-group and sequential&#xD;
      design, with active comparator. Pragmatic approach. Sequential design of O'Brien-Fleming with&#xD;
      two interim analysis. Analysis by intention to treat. Comparison of the rate of successful&#xD;
      version, referred to analgesic effect, safety, caesarean rates and acceptability rate of the&#xD;
      procedure for pregnant women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      External cephalic version is a procedure with clear benefits, but its realization is painful&#xD;
      for the patient. Studies have shown that this pain limits external cephalic version efforts&#xD;
      and therefore it negatively influences its success rate. In addition, any painful procedure&#xD;
      has worse acceptance by patients so that its implementation is slow and not always universal.&#xD;
      In this context, measures to reduce this pain could improve the success rate and acceptance&#xD;
      of the procedure. All studies that have focused on reducing pain in external cephalic version&#xD;
      have been made with regional anaesthetic techniques, epidural or spinal analgesia. Given the&#xD;
      heterogeneity and the small number of studies there is still no conclusive data to make&#xD;
      recommendations for regional anaesthesia in the external cephalic version. The introduction&#xD;
      of regional anaesthesia can bring benefits to the version but it is not without drawbacks.&#xD;
      This is an invasive anaesthetic technique that can reduce the security of the procedure and&#xD;
      lead to longer hospital stay for the patient by the blockade that produces in the lower&#xD;
      extremities. This in turn is associated with increased discomfort and costs of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cruces University Hospital has wide experience in carrying out external cephalic version&#xD;
      procedures, being one of Spanish leading hospitals in terms of number of procedures and&#xD;
      success rate. Currently external cephalic version procedures include analgesic support using&#xD;
      nitrous oxide due to the combination of moderate analgesic activity and substantial ease of&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators belief is that the use of an opioid with advantageous pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      properties and powerful analgesic effect as an adjunctive therapy during the course of&#xD;
      external cephalic version procedures may become an efficacious and safe alternative, leading&#xD;
      to increased pain relief and improved external cephalic version success rates. Its use&#xD;
      requires, however, specific personnel and organizational facilities such as access to&#xD;
      anesthetic support that can impede its widespread use. Therefore, the investigators is&#xD;
      committed to explore feasibility and practical implementation factors as well as comparative&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of this approach in non-cephalic presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a study to evaluate the effect of nitrous oxide as an adjunctive&#xD;
      to external cephalic version and we observed a slight decrease in patient reported pain&#xD;
      (visual analogous scale), with no effect on the rate of success. Currently, in the protocol&#xD;
      of Cruces University Hospital the administration of nitrous oxide during the manoeuvres of&#xD;
      the external cephalic version is routine practice. The investigators consider that the&#xD;
      analgesic remifentanil is a better option for the external cephalic version than nitrous&#xD;
      oxide by the combination of rapid onset of effect, with analgesic potency similar to regional&#xD;
      anaesthesia and rapid metabolism that prevents their accumulation in tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of existing evidence on this issue, hence, prompts the investigators to conduct this&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial aimed to assess scientific as well as logistical aspects involved in the&#xD;
      performance of external cephalic version in non-cephalic presentation.&#xD;
