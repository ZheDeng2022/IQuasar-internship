      The study is to determine the feasibility, safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerated (safe)&#xD;
      dose of human spinal derived neural stem cell transplantation for the treatment of&#xD;
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).&#xD;

      These stem cells are called Human Spinal Stem Cells (HSSC) and have been engineered from the&#xD;
      spinal cord of a single fetus electively aborted after 8 weeks of gestation. The tissue was&#xD;
      obtained with the mother's consent. The cells will be transplanted into the ALS patient's&#xD;
      spinal cord after laminectomy, an operation that removes bone surrounding the spine. After&#xD;
      the spinal cord is exposed, a device manufactured for this purpose will be mounted onto the&#xD;
      patient and will hold a syringe filled with the cells. The syringe will have a needle&#xD;
      attached and the needle will enter the spinal cord at 5-10 locations injecting the cells. The&#xD;
      device will minimize trauma to the spinal cord by the needle by making the puncture precise&#xD;
      and steady and injecting the material at a slow and steady speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALS is a universally fatal neurodegenerative condition that causes weakness leading to&#xD;
      paralysis and death. Life expectancy is 2-5 years. The cause is unknown and there is no&#xD;
      effective treatment. Previous research has shown that on autopsy, ALS patients are found to&#xD;
      have increased levels of the amino acid glutamate accumulated in the brain and spinal cord.&#xD;
      This increase is thought to be caused by a decrease in the glutamate transporter which&#xD;
      normally &quot;cleans up&quot; glutamate from the cells. HSSC are known to express amino acid&#xD;
      transporters and it is hoped that this action will reduce the toxicity of accumulated&#xD;
      glutamate and benefit ALS patients. There is a second hypothesized benefit of the HSSC and&#xD;
      that is their ability to secrete neurotrophic support factors. Neurotrophic factors support&#xD;
      the health of nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 5 sequential cohorts (Groups A - E) with 3 subjects in each cohort. New&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled into each group. No control group is included. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive spinal cord injections of HSSC. All subjects will also be ambulatory with respiratory&#xD;
      function greater than or equal to 50% supine and 60% seated of predicted normal and will&#xD;
      receive bilateral injections at the C3 through C5 cervical segments. Subjects in Group E will&#xD;
      receive bilateral injections at the L2 through L5 lumbar segments and then return&#xD;
      approximately one-three months later to receive bilateral injections at the C3 through C5&#xD;
      cervical segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation plan is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to&#xD;
           receive bilateral C3 through C4 injections of 2x106 cells (10 injections x 2x105 cells/&#xD;
           injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to&#xD;
           receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 4x106 cells (20 injections x 2x105 cells/&#xD;
           injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group C: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to&#xD;
           receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 6x106 cells (20 injections x 3x105 cells/&#xD;
           injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group D: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to&#xD;
           receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections x 4x105 cells/&#xD;
           injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Group E: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to&#xD;
           receive bilateral L2 through L5 injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections of 4x105 cells/&#xD;
           injection) and then approximately 4-12 weeks later to receive bilateral C3 through C5&#xD;
           injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections of 4x105 cells/ injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transition from one group to the next will be determined by review of available safety data&#xD;
      by a Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) which will occur approximately one month post surgery of&#xD;
      the last subject in the group. The study data will be collected for 6 months post stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation of each study subject. However, all subjects will be followed clinically&#xD;
      until death and all SAEs and post-study data will be collected and reported. Autopsy will be&#xD;
      strongly encouraged for evaluation of pathology and presence of transplanted cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment consists of laminectomy or laminoplasty of approximately two to three vertebral&#xD;
      segments overlying either L2 through L4 (for Group E only) or C3 through C5 cord segments&#xD;
      (for all Groups) in order to allow intraspinal injections of HSSC. Each injection will&#xD;
      administer approximately 2, 3, or 4 x 105 cells in approximately 8.5 - 10 µL volume. The&#xD;
      subjects will receive 5 or 10 injections at approximately 4 to 5mm intervals on each side of&#xD;
      the cord, in total 10 or 20 injections. Each injection is completed in approximately 3&#xD;
      minutes. The total surgical time is expected to be approximately 3 to 5 hours. After the&#xD;
      surgery, subjects will receive routine standard of care for laminectomy subjects who undergo&#xD;
      an intradural procedure. Prior to and after the transplant, subjects will be required to&#xD;
      remain on immunosuppressive therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy will consist of: 1)&#xD;
      basiliximab (Simulect®) 20mg intravenously (IV) when the dura is opened, then again at day 4&#xD;
      post transplantation; 2) tacrolimus (Prograf®) initially dosed at a maximum of 0.1 mg/kg&#xD;
      divided approximately every 12 hours by mouth (po) on post transplant day 1, and then&#xD;
      maintained at a dose that provides a trough serum level of 4 to 8 ng/ml (adjusted for IV use&#xD;
      as necessary); and 3) mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®) started on post transplant day 1 at&#xD;
      500 mg approximately every 12 hours and progressively increased over 2 weeks to 1.0 gram by&#xD;
      mouth (po) twice a day as tolerated. Dose escalation may be modified at the discretion of the&#xD;
      site Principal Investigator (PI). Subjects will also receive an initial bolus dose of&#xD;
      methylprednisolone 125 mg IV approximately 2 hours prior to the first injection. Beginning on&#xD;
      post-operative day 1, the subject will receive oral prednisone 60 mg po daily (QD) for 7 days&#xD;
      postoperatively, then progressively decreased over the next 21 days as follows: 40 mg/day for&#xD;
      7 days, 20 mg/day for 7 days, then 10 mg/day for 7 days. At 28 days, prednisone will be&#xD;
      discontinued. All pre- and post-surgery immunosuppressive drugs will be administered as noted&#xD;
      above, at the discretion of the site PI. If these subjects have previously discontinued&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil and/or tacrolimus, they may be re-challenged as per the dosing&#xD;
      described above, at the discretion of the site PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to continue immunosuppression therapy will be at the discretion of the site PIs.&#xD;
      Mycophenolate mofetil may be dosed down to half or discontinued prior to the end of the study&#xD;
      period if the subject experiences adverse reactions to the immunosuppressive agents. If&#xD;
      adverse reactions still persist, tacrolimus dose can be further reduced in half and then&#xD;
      further considered to be discontinued. Any or all of the immunosuppressive agents may be&#xD;
      reduced or stopped at the discretion of the site PI if it is suspected or determined that the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agent is the cause of toxicity and if symptoms of toxicity cannot be&#xD;
      managed adequately with symptomatic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will proceed successively from Group A to Group E with a 4-week interval between&#xD;
      Groups. The Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) will be convened at the end of the 4-week interval&#xD;
      and review all available safety data. Based on the safety outcomes from the 3 subjects in&#xD;
      each Group, the SMB will recommend, according to a predetermined rule, whether to enroll 3&#xD;
      new subjects into the next Group, to continue to collect additional information from the same&#xD;
      Group, to enroll additional subjects into the same Group, or to suspend the study. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited for the study but put on a waiting list until SMB approval of&#xD;
      their treatment. The SMB will consist of 3 neurologists with expertise in ALS, 1 spinal&#xD;
      neurosurgeon, 1 neurooncologist, 1 transplant immunologist, and the scientific director of&#xD;
      the ALS Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed for adverse events including pain and infection, motor function,&#xD;
      and quality of life. Additional assessments will be made to measure any postoperative changes&#xD;
      from baseline in neurologic deficits, imaging studies, bladder or bowel function, allodynia,&#xD;
      and neuropathic pain (see schedule of activities). Subjects will also undergo serial&#xD;
      assessments of respiratory function (vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force&#xD;
      (NIF)), motor function (Ashworth Spasticity Scale, hand-held dynamometry and electrical&#xD;
      impedance myography (EIM)), and respiratory function (diaphragm ultrasound). All subjects&#xD;
      will undergo cardiac autonomic function testing at Day -14 to Day -2 pre-operatively, and at&#xD;
      1 and 3 months post-operatively to monitor for potential cardiac autonomic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a lead-in period of at least 1 month period of clinical evaluations before&#xD;
      surgery to estimate the slope of decline of clinical status. Measures during this lead-in&#xD;
      time will be the ALSFRS-R, hand-held dynamometry/grip strength, Ashworth Spasticity Scale, VC&#xD;
      and NIF, EIM, and diaphragm ultrasound.Subjects will be followed postoperatively at 2 and 4&#xD;
      weeks, and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months, and then at every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter until death.&#xD;
