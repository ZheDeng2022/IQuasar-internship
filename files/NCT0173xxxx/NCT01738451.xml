  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, 2-part study with Part 1 designed as a safety lead-in and&#xD;
      Part 2 designed to evaluate the effect of GSK2118436 on cardiac repolarization (corrected QT&#xD;
      interval [QTc] duration) as compared with placebo in subjects with V600 BRAF&#xD;
      mutation-positive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each part of the study will consist of screening (14 days prior to the start of the study&#xD;
      treatment), treatment and follow-up period (14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1 in Cohort 1 six subjects will receive GSK2118436 225 mg twice a day (BID) on study&#xD;
      days 1 to 7 and a single 225 milligram (mg) dose on morning of Day 8. Based on the safety&#xD;
      data of subjects in Cohort 1 subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2 and the dose of GSK2118436&#xD;
      will be escalated to 300 mg BID. If the 225 mg dose of GSK2118436 is not well tolerated in&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (i.e., 2 or more dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs]), then Cohort 2 of Part 1 will not&#xD;
      be initiated and a dose of 150 mg BID of GSK2118436 will be administered in Part 2 of the&#xD;
      study. In Cohort 2 six subjects will receive GSK2118436 300 mg BID on Study Days 1 to 7 and a&#xD;
      single 300 mg dose on the morning of Day 8. Based on the safety data of subjects in Cohort 2&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. If the 300 mg BID dose level of GSK2118436 is not well&#xD;
      tolerated, then the highest tolerated dose will be selected for Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1 of the study the decision to proceed to the next cohort or Part 2 of the study will&#xD;
      be based on the safety data of at least 6 evaluable subjects (&lt;=1 DLTs during the 14 days&#xD;
      following the first dose of GSK2118436).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2 of the study eligible subjects will receive a single dose of GSK2118436/placebo (4&#xD;
      capsules of 75 mg/highest tolerated dose) orally on the first 2 days of the study followed by&#xD;
      2 doses daily for 6 days and a single dose on the 9th day. There will be 1 day when a placebo&#xD;
      will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the parts of the study serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis for&#xD;
      GSK2118436 and its metabolites (GSK2285403, GSK2298683 and GSK2167542) will be obtained at&#xD;
      the same time points on the first and last day of dosing (2nd day of dosing also included for&#xD;
      Part 2). Safety electrocardiogram (ECG)s will be performed at several timepoints during the&#xD;
      study. In Part 2 Holter ECG monitoring will be performed for 24 hours on the 1st, 2nd and 9th&#xD;
      days of dosing.&#xD;
