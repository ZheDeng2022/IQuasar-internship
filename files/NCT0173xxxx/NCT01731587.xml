      Phase Ib study investigating whether liposome BLP25 mucin-1 (MUC1) peptide-specific&#xD;
      immunotherapy (L-BLP25) administered as weekly subcutaneous doses over 8 weeks following a&#xD;
      single dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide (CPA) induces a reproducible cytokine pattern&#xD;
      measured in the serum of unresected Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects&#xD;
      after first-line chemo-radiation therapy.&#xD;
