      The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in quality of life and degree of tremor&#xD;
      for patients with essential tremor or Parkinsonian tremor who are treated by stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery (SRS). This is a questionnaire-based study. Please see Detailed Description&#xD;
      below for more information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tremor is the most common of all movement disorders. Patients with essential tremor (ET) or&#xD;
      Parkinsonian tremor (PT) may be severely disabled by their tremor. When the tremor is&#xD;
      inadequately controlled by medications, surgical options are often offered. However, some&#xD;
      patients may prefer a noninvasive treatment approach and some patients are not surgical&#xD;
      candidates for medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment that uses high-energy highly-focused radiation&#xD;
      (X-rays) to destroy a tiny region in the brain that causes tremor to occur. This region is&#xD;
      known as the ventral intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and is the same area targeted by&#xD;
      surgical deep brain stimulator (DBS) treatment or neurosurgical operation (thalamotomy).&#xD;
      Multiple case series publications using Gamma Knife stereotactic radiation have been reported&#xD;
      that show stereotactic radiosurgery is safe and effective treatment for ET and PT, making it&#xD;
      a standard treatment for inoperable and inadequately controlled tremor patients. However,&#xD;
      radiation treatment by linear accelerator machines are much more common than Gamma Knife&#xD;
      treatment machines in the United States, and there are no reports of large series of ET and&#xD;
      PT patients treated using linear accelerator-based SRS using a noninvasive mask-based&#xD;
      targeting system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial asks the question of whether linear accelerator-based SRS is as safe and&#xD;
      effective as that reported for Gamma Knife procedures, and whether it is a valid alternative&#xD;
      to surgical thalamotomy or implantation of a deep brain stimulator (DBS) device. The primary&#xD;
      measurements are quality of life related to tremor before and after stereotactic radiosurgery&#xD;
      treatment, and secondary measurements are degree of tremor severity and usage of&#xD;
      tremor-related medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is a standard-of-care treatment for patients with severe&#xD;
      tremor. This clinical trial is a questionnaire-based trial that only involves completion of 2&#xD;
      questionnaires at the consultation appointments with neurology and radiation oncology. The&#xD;
      questionnaires only take a few minutes and will provide us with valuable information about&#xD;
      how severe the patient's tremor is before and after SRS treatment at 3-month intervals for 1&#xD;
      year. Currently we are only performing SRS treatment on one side of the brain (effects one&#xD;
      side of the body) so the side with the worst tremor is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial: All associated steps listed below are considered the Standard of Care to receive&#xD;
      SRS treatment for tremor and are billed to the patient's insurance per the usual routine.&#xD;
      Patients can receive this treatment without participating in the clinical trial&#xD;
      questionnaires. There is no financial support, no compensation, and no travel stipend&#xD;
      available to patients who participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What to expect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients interested in SRS treatment for tremor must be evaluated by a movement&#xD;
           disorder neurologist. The neurologist will assess the severity of the tremor. Your&#xD;
           primary physician or outside neurologist must make a referral to the Vanderbilt Movement&#xD;
           Disorder Clinic for initial assessment. For clinical trial participation, a&#xD;
           questionnaire will be completed as a baseline measurement (this takes a few minutes). If&#xD;
           the patient is an appropriate candidate for SRS and there may be additional evaluations&#xD;
           and discussion with the entire Movement Disorder group at monthly meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ** Please note: for Parkinson's disease patients, please come to the neurology&#xD;
           evaluation &quot;functionally off medication&quot;, which means do NOT take the morning dose of&#xD;
           Parkinson's related medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient will undergo a neuropsychological evaluation prior to SRS treatment, which&#xD;
           is the standard of care for patients considering DBS or SRS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient will meet with a neurosurgeon who will be involved in the SRS planning and&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients referred for SRS treatment will be evaluated by a radiation oncologist, Dr.&#xD;
           Austin Kirschner or Dr. Anthony Cmelak. At this appointment, discussion will include&#xD;
           descriptions of the procedure in detail and review of the risks and benefits of&#xD;
           treatment. For clinical trial participation, a questionnaire will be completed as a&#xD;
           baseline assessment of the patient's tremor-related quality of life (this takes a few&#xD;
           minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If the patient chooses to proceed with SRS, in the department of radiation oncology a&#xD;
           tight-fitting thermal plastic mask will be custom made to fit around the patient's head&#xD;
           and a CT scan of the head will be performed in radiation oncology. This step takes about&#xD;
           45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A specialized MRI of the brain will be obtained for treatment planning. This step takes&#xD;
           about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Approximately 2 weeks after completing all the consultation appointments and obtaining&#xD;
           the imaging for treatment planning, the single stereotactic radiation treatment will be&#xD;
           performed. The SRS procedure takes approximately 2.5 hours. It is entirely outpatient&#xD;
           and does not require anesthesia. The procedure is noninvasive and painless (X-ray&#xD;
           treatment). During the entire treatment, the head is held tightly in the plastic mask.&#xD;
           Oral anti-anxiety medication may be given to relax the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. At 3 month intervals for 1 year, the patient will have follow-up appointments with&#xD;
           radiation oncology and neurology. A brain MRI may be performed at some of these&#xD;
           intervals to document the treatment effect on the brain tissue. For participation in the&#xD;
           clinical trial, at these follow-up appointments the quality of life questionnaire will&#xD;
           be completed at the radiation oncology visit and the severity of tremor questionnaire&#xD;
           will be completed at the neurology visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. At 6 months after SRS treatment, a neuropsychological evaluation will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients interested in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or participating in this&#xD;
      questionnaire-based clinical trial should feel free to call the contact phone numbers listed&#xD;
      below or have their physician refer the patient for consultation with the Movement Disorder&#xD;
      Clinic in the neurology department at Vanderbilt.&#xD;
