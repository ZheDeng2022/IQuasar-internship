      The purpose of the study is to investigate the long-term (24 weeks) effects of coffee&#xD;
      consumption on insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coffee is a major source of the phenolic acid chlorogenic acid and a substantial source of&#xD;
      trigonelline, niacin, lignans magnesium, and potassium. Several of these compounds have been&#xD;
      shown to improve glucose metabolism in animal models. Consumption of coffee was inversely&#xD;
      associated with the risk of type-2 diabetes in prospective cohort studies across the world.&#xD;
      Consumption of 3 to 4 cups of coffee per day was associated with an approximately 25% lower&#xD;
      risk of type-2 diabetes. However, direct evidence of the efficacy of coffee to reduce blood&#xD;
      glucose and insulin resistance parameters in humans from randomized trials is still lacking.&#xD;
      In recent small trials of short duration (up to 6 weeks) coffee consumption increased levels&#xD;
      of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin, but did not significantly improve insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity These results suggest that a larger longer-term trial of the effects of coffee&#xD;
      consumption on directly measured insulin sensitivity is warranted.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects classified as being insulin-resistant in the screening visit. Subjects should&#xD;
             have a non-diabetic fasting plasma glucose concentration (&lt; 7.0 mM) and a HOMA-IR &gt;&#xD;
             2.2. The HOMA-IR was demonstrated as a reliable indicator of insulin resistance&#xD;
             strongly correlated with values obtained by clamp (4). The cut-off value of the&#xD;
             HOMA-IR was defined according to data obtained in the Singapore cohort. It corresponds&#xD;
             to the 75th percentile of the population. The HOMA-IR cut-off was subsequently revised&#xD;
             to ≥ 1.3 to increase recruitment rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: ≥ 35 to ≤ 69 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index : ≥ 22.5 to ≤ 35.4 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Users of at least 1 cups of caffeinated coffee per day who are willing to be&#xD;
             randomized to any of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should be willing to stop consuming caffeinated soft drinks or supplements&#xD;
             during the study and to drink coffee with non-dairy creamer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers (&lt; 1 cigarette per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants have been weight stable for at least -8 weeks pre-ceding the screening&#xD;
             visit (± 2.5 kgs).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects representing one or more of the following criteria are excluded from participation&#xD;
        in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition/illness that may affect the study outcomes or would make participation&#xD;
             potentially harmful such as pregnancy or breastfeeding, diabetes mellitus, heart&#xD;
             disease, stroke, hypertension, malabsorption syndromes, GERD, a history of ulcer,&#xD;
             clotting or bleeding disorders,allergy to the test beverage, allergy to insulin,&#xD;
             according to a detailed medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are allergic to foods may be excluded based on the investigator's&#xD;
             discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants consume &gt; 2 alcoholic servings/day on a regular basis and &gt; 8 caffeinated&#xD;
             servings (based on tea and coffee)/day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present drug abuse or use of medications that could interfere with the treatment&#xD;
             including bronchodilators, quinolone antibiotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors,&#xD;
             anxiolytics, ranitidine, corticosteroids, growth hormone, anti-hypertensives. These&#xD;
             conditions will be screened based on subject reporting. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
             bring in their current medications at the time of screening, and these will be checked&#xD;
             by the study-staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is taking traditional medications, herbal or dietary supplements that may&#xD;
             affect the study outcome in the opinion of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who cannot be expected to comply with the study procedures in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently participating or having participated in another clinical trial during the&#xD;
             last 12 weeks prior to the beginning of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal women with self-reported irregular menstrual cycles or peri-menopausal&#xD;
             women (participants who stopped getting their menses for less than 48 weeks ).&#xD;
