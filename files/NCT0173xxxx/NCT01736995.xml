      Research has provided support for the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral and family&#xD;
      interventions for adolescent substance use disorders (SUD), HIV-risk behaviors, and related&#xD;
      problems. Despite support for these interventions, substantial heterogeneity in treatment&#xD;
      outcomes and high relapse rates has been consistently found across studies. Such variability&#xD;
      highlights the need for innovative strategies to broaden the impact and strengthen the&#xD;
      durability of effects of adolescent substance abuse treatments. Over the past two decades,&#xD;
      research has shown the positive effects of contingency management (CM) methods on reductions&#xD;
      in substance use and other problem behaviors. When combined with evidence-based practices,&#xD;
      emerging research suggests that CM integration may also be effective for adolescent substance&#xD;
      abusers. The proposed Stage II efficacy trial examines the integration of CM with two&#xD;
      empirically-supported interventions: group MET/CBT and FFT. By comparing two intervention&#xD;
      modalities (group vs. family, the study provides a unique opportunity to examine the&#xD;
      robustness of the effects of CM across established adolescent treatments, and to compare&#xD;
      change mechanisms that may account for treatment outcomes. In the proposed research,&#xD;
      substance abusing adolescents (n = 160) will be randomly assigned either to FFT or group&#xD;
      MET/CBT. Random assignment will also be used to determine whether or not youth will receive a&#xD;
      CM condition that provides incentives for abstinence (i.e., clean urine screens) and&#xD;
      treatment participation. The primary aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of an&#xD;
      integrated CM intervention for the two evidence-based treatments for adolescents, MET/CBT and&#xD;
      FFT, compared to these treatments without CM on drug abuse abstinence (a) during treatment&#xD;
      (i.e., speed of effects) and (b) at post-treatment follow-up assessments (i.e., durability of&#xD;
      effects). A second aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of CM on hypothesized&#xD;
      mediators of the intervention effects in the MET/CBT and the FFT conditions. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that the CM conditions, compared to the nonCM conditions, are more&#xD;
      likely to accelerate the adolescent's motivation (1) to achieve abstinence, to attend and&#xD;
      participate in treatment, and to complete homework assignments. The investigators will also&#xD;
      examine the effects of the interventions on HIV-risk behaviors and expect that CM will&#xD;
      demonstrate the largest reductions in HIV-risk behaviors compared to the nonCM conditions.&#xD;

      Research has provided support for the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral and family&#xD;
      interventions for adolescent substance use disorders (SUD), HIV-risk behaviors, and related&#xD;
      problems. Despite support for these interventions, substantial heterogeneity in treatment&#xD;
      outcomes and high relapse rates have been consistently found across studies. Such variability&#xD;
      highlights the need for innovative strategies to broaden the impact and strengthen the&#xD;
      durability of effects of adolescent substance abuse treatments. Over the past two decades,&#xD;
      research has demonstrated the positive effects of contingency management (CM) methods on&#xD;
      reductions in substance use and other problem behaviors such as HIV-risk, primarily with&#xD;
      adults. CM has been shown to improve outcomes when combined with evidence-based practices and&#xD;
      research is emerging to suggest that such integrations may also be effective for adolescent&#xD;
      substance abusers. The proposed Stage II efficacy trial examines the integration of CM with&#xD;
      two empirically-supported interventions: group MET/CBT and FFT. By comparing two intervention&#xD;
      modalities (group vs. family, the study provides a unique opportunity to examine the&#xD;
      robustness of the effects of CM across established adolescent treatments, and to compare&#xD;
      change mechanisms that may account for treatment outcomes. In the proposed research,&#xD;
      substance abusing adolescents (n = 160) will be randomly assigned either to FFT or group&#xD;
      MET/CBT. Random assignment will also be used to determine whether or not youth will receive a&#xD;
      CM condition that provides incentives for abstinence (i.e., clean urine screens) and&#xD;
      treatment participation. Thus, participants will receive one of four intervention conditions,&#xD;
      two with an integrated CM intervention (MET/CBT-CM, FFT-CM) and two without CM (MET/CBT,&#xD;
      FFT). The study will employ a 2 (Incentives: CM, nonCM) x 2 (Modality: MET/CBT, FFT) x 5&#xD;
      (Time: Baseline, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 12-months post-randomization) factorial design. The primary&#xD;
      aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of an integrated CM intervention for the two&#xD;
      evidence-based treatments for adolescents, MET/CBT and FFT, compared to these treatments&#xD;
      without CM on drug abuse abstinence (a) during treatment (i.e., speed of effects) and (b) at&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up assessments (i.e., durability of effects). A second aim of the study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effects of CM on hypothesized mediators of the intervention effects in the&#xD;
      MET/CBT and the FFT conditions. The investigators anticipate that the CM conditions, compared&#xD;
      to the nonCM conditions, are more likely to accelerate the adolescent's motivation (1) to&#xD;
      achieve abstinence, to attend and participate in treatment, and to complete homework&#xD;
      assignments. Exploratory analyses will examine differences between modalities (MET/CBT vs&#xD;
      FFT) on the presumed mediators. The investigators expect that MET/CBT will produce greater&#xD;
      improvements in adolescents' drug avoidance self-efficacy and FFT will produce greater&#xD;
      improvements in family relationships. The investigators will also examine the effects of the&#xD;
      interventions on HIV-risk behaviors and expect that CM will demonstrate the largest&#xD;
      reductions in HIV-risk behaviors compared to the nonCM conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study addresses the question of whether adding a Contingency Management (CM) approach, in&#xD;
      which adolescents are provided with a monetary incentive for providing clean urine, enhances&#xD;
      the efficacy of two research-proven interventions for adolescent substance use. Specifically,&#xD;
      the investigators compare if Functional Family Therapy (FFT) and Motivational&#xD;
      Enhancement/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT) combined with CM are better than either&#xD;
      intervention alone. The investigators also explore the extent to which the addition of CM&#xD;
      increases the speed with which adolescents achieve abstinence as well as the durability of&#xD;
      these effects over time. The inclusion of two distinct forms of therapy also permits the&#xD;
      investigation of how the interventions achieve their effects on adolescent drug use (e.g.,&#xD;
      improvements in family functioning in FFT vs. improvements in drug avoidance and&#xD;
      self-efficacy skills in MET/CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of CM versus nonCM conditions delivered in the&#xD;
      context of either group (MET/CBT) or family (FFT) treatments for substance abusing&#xD;
      adolescents. The investigators will use two substance use dependent variables. The first&#xD;
      variable assesses the presence or absence of illegal substances in urine samples collected&#xD;
      weekly beginning at baseline and continuing during the 12-14 weeks of scheduled treatment.&#xD;
      Urine samples will be collected at all post-randomization assessments. Although most of the&#xD;
      adolescents are polydrug users, marijuana is the primary drug of abuse. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that once weekly urine screens will be able to detect recent marijuana use. The&#xD;
      Time Line Follow-back (TLFB) will be used to provide weekly estimates of drug use abstinence&#xD;
      for a period from 3 months before to 12 months after randomization. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators predict that the CM versus the nonCM conditions will produce a significant main&#xD;
      effect increase in the number of weeks of drug use abstinence during the treatment phase&#xD;
      (i.e., months 1-4; Hypothesis 1a) and during the post treatment period (i.e., 4-12 months;&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of CM versus nonCM on secondary behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
      Specifically, The investigators predict that CM versus the nonCM conditions will be&#xD;
      associated with significantly lower levels of sexually risky behaviors (Hypothesis 2a) and&#xD;
      conduct problems (Hypothesis 2b) over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of CM on hypothesized mediators of the MET/CBT and&#xD;
      the FFT intervention effects. The investigators anticipate that the CM conditions are more&#xD;
      likely than the nonCM conditions to accelerate the adolescent's motivation (1) to achieve&#xD;
      abstinence, (2) to attend and participate in treatment, (3) to complete homework assignments.&#xD;
      The SOCRATES scale will assess their motivation to achieve abstinence. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators predict that youth receiving the CM versus nonCM will show higher rates of&#xD;
      motivation for change at the 2-month assessment (Hypothesis 3a) and higher rates of treatment&#xD;
      attendance and homework compliance (as measured by weekly therapist reports) over the course&#xD;
      of treatment (Hypothesis 3b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims: The investigators will conduct exploratory analyses to examine if the&#xD;
      number of continuous weeks of abstinence during treatment, adolescent's motivation to achieve&#xD;
      abstinence, attendance, and homework compliance will mediate abstinence following treatment.&#xD;
      Additional analyses will examine differences between modalities (MET/CBT vs FFT) on the&#xD;
      presumed mediators: MET/CBT will produce greater improvements in adolescent's drug avoidance&#xD;
      self-efficacy and FFT will produce greater improvements in family relationships (as measured&#xD;
      by the FES). Improvements in drug avoidance self-efficacy and family relationships will&#xD;
      mediate improvements in MET/CBT and FFT, respectively. The investigators will also explore&#xD;
      potential differences within modality to determine if adding CM enhances the effects of each&#xD;
      modalities impact on the presumed mediators of outcome. The results of these analyses will&#xD;
      help determine if there is sufficient merit to warrant additional research into mechanisms of&#xD;
      action within each modality. Finally, the investigators will conduct an informal&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis to derive preliminary estimates of the relative costs of each&#xD;
      treatment modality, particularly with respect to treatment engagement/attendance and youth&#xD;
      outplacement to restricted settings.&#xD;
