  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ilizarov external fixator is an external skeletal fixator that is used to stabilize or&#xD;
      lengthen the limb bones. Bone lengthen bone occurs through mechanical distraction on the long&#xD;
      axis of the bone, thus the method of lengthening is called distraction osteogenesis. This&#xD;
      method has been shown successful. Unfortunately, it has also been associated with a&#xD;
      substantial number of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle shortening and persistent weakness are among the most common complications seen in&#xD;
      this procedure. Muscle shortening usually occurs in strong muscle groups such as the planter&#xD;
      flexor muscles, as a result of strength imbalance between the opposing muscle groups.&#xD;
      Shortening may persist for more than a year after the removal of the fixator and may require&#xD;
      surgical intervention. Fortunately, muscular shortening can be prevented by splinting and&#xD;
      physiotherapy in the form of stretching and strengthening exercise and functional training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of different exercises in rehabilitation can help accomplishing different therapeutic&#xD;
      goals. Thus, the choice to use one or the other should depend on the desired treatment goals.&#xD;
      Weight bearing (CKC) and non weight bearing (OKC) exercise has been incorporated into&#xD;
      rehabilitation; however, the effects of these two types of exercises particularly on muscle&#xD;
      flexibility and mechanics have never been studied systematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this is to compare the effects of OKC and the CKC exercise on&#xD;
      muscle strength, architecture and flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of open kinetic or closed kinetic chain exercises will have no different effects on&#xD;
      muscle function or internal organization during tibial distraction osteogenesis by Ilizarov's&#xD;
      method Specific hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be no difference between the effects of OKC and CKC on muscle flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be no difference between the effect of OKC and CKC exercises on muscle&#xD;
           strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be no difference between the effect of OKC and CKC on the internal&#xD;
           organization of muscle specifically the pennation angle, muscle thickness and fiber&#xD;
           length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There will be no difference between the overall of OKC and CKC exercise on the&#xD;
           functional performance of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      First, personal information and history of each subject will be collected. Then, patients&#xD;
      will be informed and receive a full oral explanation of the purpose and procedures of the&#xD;
      study before they will be asked to sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial assessment will be done at the end of latent period (5-7 days) and then every 2&#xD;
      weeks thereafter for a period of 3-5cm distraction or the end of distraction period whatever&#xD;
      is earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will be divided randomly into two groups (A &amp; B). Group A&#xD;
      (OKC): will consist of 10 patients receiving open-kinetic- chain exercise program. Group B&#xD;
      (CKC) will consist of 10 patients receiving closed-kinetic- chain exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, each patient will be assessed using the Borg scale to determine the number of&#xD;
      strengthening exercise repetitions that patient can carry out. Assessment will be repeated&#xD;
      weekly, before the number of repetition is progressed. For stretching exercise, 5 repeat ions&#xD;
      will be done each session, in addition patients will be asked to repeat the exercise as a&#xD;
      home program exercise. Exercise will be given 3 times weekly, at the University of Benha&#xD;
      outpatient clinic, for a period of 3-5 cm of distraction (approximately 8 weeks) or the end&#xD;
      of distraction whatever is earlier Exercise for group (A) Knee flexion exercise Patient in&#xD;
      supine and gently bend his knee, with keeping the heel in contact with the bed. Bring the&#xD;
      heel towards bottom as far as is comfortable .Exercise will be repeated as determined by&#xD;
      patient's ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength the hamstring muscle Patient will be in prone lying position with the knee free out&#xD;
      of the bed. Patient will then be asked to bend his knee by making the heel touches his&#xD;
      bottom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength quadriceps muscle Patient will sit on the edge of bed or on chair with the thigh&#xD;
      supported. Patient will be asked to keep his trunk upright. Then, the knee will be&#xD;
      straightened and will be held with the toes pointing to the ceiling for 6 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretch hamstring from sitting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will assume the long sitting position with their non-operated extremity hanging over&#xD;
      the edge of the bed. Patients will then lean forward, grasp his/her forefoot and dorsiflex&#xD;
      the ankle while maintaining the knee extended. This position will be maintained for 20-60&#xD;
      seconds before returning to the starting position. The whole exercise will be repeated for 5&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretch hamstring from prone:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will assume a prone lying position. The legs of the operated limb will be positioned&#xD;
      in a neutral rotation and will be allowed to hang freely, over the edge of the bed, by the&#xD;
      weight of leg and apparatus as well as by the pulling effect of the gravity. This position&#xD;
      will be maintained for duration ranges from 1 minute to as long as tolerated by every&#xD;
      individual patient. Patients will also be instructed to assume this position frequently at&#xD;
      home during some daily activities e.g. while watching television or reading a book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength hip extensor and abductors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be prone with extended knee. Patient will be asked to raise the lower limb&#xD;
      upward with the knee extended. For abductor strengthening, the patient will be in a side&#xD;
      lying position on the non-operated limb and will be asked to raise the upper limb upwards&#xD;
      while the knee is kept straight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calf-muscles stretch:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To stretch the gastrocnemius, the patient's heel will be grasped while the knee is extended.&#xD;
      Then, the calcaneus will be pulled caudally, with the thumb and fingers of the therapist,&#xD;
      before the heads of the metatarsals are gently pushed upwards. The end position will be held&#xD;
      for 20-60 seconds before rest is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength exercise for dorsiflexors plantar flexors Patient in long sitting using Theraband&#xD;
      one end by his hands and the other end secure around metatarsal bone then the patient will&#xD;
      perform plantar flexion against resistance of surgical tubing repeat 10 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise for group (B) Wall slides Patient will stand with back against a wall, and feet&#xD;
      straight in front of him. Patient then slide down keeping back against the wall, until&#xD;
      becoming in a slight sitting position. Slide down only as far as patient feel comfortable.&#xD;
      For the first few times patient do this knee exercise, hold the sitting position for a few&#xD;
      seconds, then slide back up repeat 10 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot sliding from sitting While patient is sitting on a smooth surface, the patient pulls the&#xD;
      heel of involved leg toward buttocks, flexing the knee as much as tolerable. Hold and&#xD;
      straighten leg by sliding heel downward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hamstring and quadriceps co-contraction from sitting From a relaxed sitting position with&#xD;
      both knees bent to 90 degrees, the patients will be instructed to press firmly on the ground.&#xD;
      This exercise will also be done using a stepper machine. Patient was instructed to press&#xD;
      rhythmically on the feet plate of a stepper machine, while maintaining the feet in complete&#xD;
      contact with the plate, so that heels were vertical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bridging exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will assume the crock lying position. In this position, the knees were bent to 30-45&#xD;
      degrees while the feet are completely resting on the supporting surface by placing a firm&#xD;
      wedge underneath the feet to accommodate them to the supporting surface. Then, patients will&#xD;
      be instructed to raise their lower back and pelvis, while bearing weight on both lower limbs,&#xD;
      until the thighs lies in line with pelvis and trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side-to side, forward and backward weight shifting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will assume an erect standing position. Both feet will be placed slightly apart with&#xD;
      the operated limb placed parallel to, in front of and behind the sound side during&#xD;
      side-to-side, forward and backward weight shifting exercise, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitting-to-standing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will assume a relaxed sitting position. The foot of the affected extremity will be&#xD;
      placed initially in front, later, behind the other side. Patient will be instructed to assume&#xD;
      the standing positing, while bearing as much weight as they can on their affected&#xD;
      extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lunge exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will assume the forward lunge position. In this position, the affected limb will be&#xD;
      placed in front of the other. The distance through which each subject lunged forward will be&#xD;
      determined by each individual's leg length as the feet should be about 2 to 3 feet apart,&#xD;
      depending on patient's leg length. Then, each subject will move from an upright standing&#xD;
      position to the forward lunge position, and back to the starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Squatting exercise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be instructed to stand erect, between the parallel bars, with their feet&#xD;
      parallel and slightly apart. While maintaining the back erect, they will be instructed to&#xD;
      bend both knees slightly then to return back to the erect standing position by pushing&#xD;
      against the feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standing Toe Raises:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exercise is more advanced than the seated toe raise, as it places the entire weight of&#xD;
      the body on the exercised leg. Stand upright on both feet Push down through the toes lifting&#xD;
      both heels off the ground&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standing Hamstring Stretch:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will stand in front of an elevated surface. Place the operated leg on the surface,&#xD;
      Lean forward from the hips until a gentle hamstring stretch is felt on the underside of the&#xD;
      thigh. Once a gentle hamstring stretch is felt on the underside of the thigh, hold this&#xD;
      position for 30 seconds&#xD;
