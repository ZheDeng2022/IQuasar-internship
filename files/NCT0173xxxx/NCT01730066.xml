  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery in the mouth and oropharynx is performed in an area colonised by bacteria&#xD;
      non-pathogenic and pathogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics are used regularly resulting in disturbances in the intestinal microbiological&#xD;
      flora and consequently diarrhoea that can be troublesome. The use of antibiotics throughout&#xD;
      the hospital stay for these difficult cases represent a risk of development of resistant&#xD;
      strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the patients have cancer diagnoses and have radiation therapy before surgery. This&#xD;
      increases the risk of the patients having pathogenic bacteria normally present in the lower&#xD;
      GI-tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have shown for ICU patients that treatment with probiotics reduces the&#xD;
      number of emerging enteral bacteria in the oropharynx and now the investigators will perform&#xD;
      an adjusted procedure for patients planned for large ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will preoperatively gurgle a suspension of probiotics and then swallow the&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively the probiotics is given enterally and a eventually by mouth again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultures will be taken from the oropharynx and tracheal secretions and the results will be&#xD;
      compared&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Longer surgical procedures require intubation and there is a potential risk of contaminating&#xD;
      the lower airways with pathogenic bacteria from the mouth and oropharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery including the mouth and the oropharynx is performed in an area that is colonised by&#xD;
      hundreds of different bacterial species. In the healthy person there is a balance between the&#xD;
      different microbes and possible pathogens are kept under control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are subject to surgery in the mouth, oropharynx or neck area, most often have&#xD;
      cancer diagnoses. Preoperative treatment (mostly radiation) is done in most cases resulting&#xD;
      in a changed spectrum of bacteria in the mouth and oropharynx. Due to lowered appetite&#xD;
      increased difficulties to eat, in combination with cancer diagnosis, there is also a change&#xD;
      in cranial direction of the microbiological gut flora resulting in the presence of pathogens&#xD;
      such as Gram-negative bacteria. Those species may result in troublesome infections in the&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With healthy people pathogenic bacteria originating from the gastro/intestinal canal are&#xD;
      seldom found in the oropharynx, but those do occur among many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics are used prophylactic and for more extensive surgery, as micro vascular&#xD;
      procedures with free transplants of tissues, antibiotics are kept throughout the length of&#xD;
      stay (LOS) in hospital. This results in an increased risk for the development of resistant&#xD;
      bacteria and does result in changes in the GI flora in those patients. Diarrhoea occurs&#xD;
      frequently and are troublesome for the patients For ICU patients we have seen a reduction of&#xD;
      emerging enteric bacteria in patients given oral care with probiotics and this study will&#xD;
      explore the possibility of the same kind of positive effects in patients due for extensive&#xD;
      surgery performed during several hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the patients will have a tracheostomy performed as part of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised (1:1) to either no prophylaxis (standard procedure today) or to&#xD;
      preparation with a probiotic suspension fro the day before surgery until discharge from&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively the patients will gurgle a suspension of probiotics and then swallow the&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively the probiotics is given enterally and a eventually when the responsible&#xD;
      surgeon find it suitable by mouth again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultures at inclusion, after intubation, and then on predefined days postoperatively to&#xD;
      compare bacterial flora in the oropharynx and in tracheal secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infectious parameters will be followed.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be given a mixture of maltodextrin ( a starch product often used i alimentary products) and two strains of probiotic bacteria ( L. plantarum 299 and L. plantarum 299v ) dissolved in water. They will gurgle and swallow the suspension from the day before surgery. Postoperatively they will be given the probiotic mixture via a nasogastric tubing twice a day and when the responsible surgeon find it suitable also orally as described above. When they can swallow no study product is given through the nasogastric tube.&#xD;
