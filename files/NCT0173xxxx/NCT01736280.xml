      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some research studies focus on digestive disorders, such as nutritional, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
      and liver disorders. Researchers want to examine and treat people with digestive disorders in&#xD;
      order to learn more about these disorders. They also want to study how digestive disorders&#xD;
      run in some families. To do so, they will provide standard care to people with digestive&#xD;
      disorders. They will also look at relatives of people with digestive disorders, such as&#xD;
      parents, children, and siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine and treat people with digestive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate people with digestive disorders for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals of any age who have digestive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 2 years of age who are first-degree relatives of the people with&#xD;
           digestive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have at least one outpatient visit to the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health. The visit will last about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           also provide different samples for study. Samples may include blood, urine, and stool&#xD;
           samples. Saliva and hair samples may also be taken. Skin biopsies and rectal swabs may&#xD;
           be collected from adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with digestive disorders may be able to receive treatment through this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) is conducting a protocol to evaluate and&#xD;
      provide standard treatment to participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed digestive&#xD;
      conditions. Investigators of this protocol provide GI consultation at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      for a range of GI conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of this protocol is to allow digestive care specialists in&#xD;
      NINR and other institutions to provide standard of care. Evaluating and treating participants&#xD;
      will allow digestive care specialists to maintain their expertise and gain additional&#xD;
      knowledge of the course of various digestive disorders. Additionally this protocol will allow&#xD;
      for hypothesis generation and provide a resource of patients for enrollment into new research&#xD;
      protocols throughout the NINR branches. The information obtained will allow for the&#xD;
      evaluation of standard treatments of the studied digestive diseases. This understanding may&#xD;
      lead to ideas for future protocols. The protocol will also allow for trainees to receive&#xD;
      training in the management of digestive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The number of participants for this evaluation and treatment protocol will&#xD;
      be set to 500 patients with digestive disorders and their unaffected first-degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a natural history evaluation and treatment protocol of the progression and&#xD;
      physiology of multiple digestive disorders. Blood or other biologic samples (including but&#xD;
      not limited to stool, urine, saliva, hair, cheek swab, or tissue) will be obtained through&#xD;
      non-invasive means or incidentally to clinical care for future laboratory studies. In&#xD;
      addition, genetic samples may be collected from unaffected first-degree relatives and may be&#xD;
      used to identify and verify causative mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The outcome measures for this protocol are the clinical assessments of&#xD;
      enrolled participants, including their response to standard treatments. Also, causative&#xD;
      mutations may help establish pathogenic mechanisms and genotype-phenotype correlations.&#xD;
