      This is a dose finding study using a 3 + 3 dose escalation and expansion design to determine&#xD;
      a Not Tolerated Dose (NTD), Optimal Biological Effect Dose (OBE) and / or Maximum Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD). These data will be used to establish a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for the&#xD;
      combination of CC-292 and lenalidomide in subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This dose finding study uses a 3 + 3 dose escalation and expansion design to establish the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose. The starting dose is CC-292 375 mg twice daily and Lenalidomide 10&#xD;
      mg once daily. After review of the data for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the second dose&#xD;
      level will be enrolled. Doses for this second cohort are CC-292 500 mg twice daily and&#xD;
      lenalidomide 10 mg once daily. Additional doses of lenalidomide in combination with CC-292&#xD;
      may be evaluated to accurately determine the maximum tolerated dose. Once the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose and/or optimal biologic effect has been ascertained, an expansion cohort of 24&#xD;
      subjects may be enrolled.&#xD;
