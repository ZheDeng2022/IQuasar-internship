    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of subcutaneous&#xD;
      NNC0148-0000-0287 (insulin 287) in healthy subjects and in subjects with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
