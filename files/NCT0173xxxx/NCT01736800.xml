      The long-term objective of this research project is to develop chemotherapy-based approach to&#xD;
      the treatment of brain metastases. The specific purpose of this study is to obtain data on&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of combination chemotherapy with temozolomide and topotecan in patients&#xD;
      with central nervous system (CNS) metastases of solid tumors. Patients with brain metastases&#xD;
      of solid tumors have a poor prognosis, despite improvements in survival achieved with modern&#xD;
      neurosurgical and radiation techniques. Chemotherapy does not play any significant role in&#xD;
      this disease, but may have application in salvage of patients who have failed radiation&#xD;
      therapy. In patients who are not surgical candidates, do not require immediate XRT to relieve&#xD;
      symptoms and have controlled systemic disease, effective chemotherapy as an alternative to&#xD;
      XRT might decrease the risk of radiation induced neurotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in treatment of systemic disease with the use of modern chemotherapy and&#xD;
      pathobiologic agents have significantly improved overall survival of cancer patients, putting&#xD;
      them at risk for CNS metastases and radiation induced neurotoxicity. Both, temozolomide and&#xD;
      topotecan have good blood-brain barrier penetration and have shown activity in CNS&#xD;
      malignancies. Preclinical studies suggest synergy of this drug combination. This is a&#xD;
      single-arm, open-label phase II drug study. All patients will receive the chemotherapy&#xD;
      combination. Up to 35 patients will be accrued over 2-3 years and followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
      Patients will receive up to 8 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is the rate of&#xD;
      radiologic response of brain metastases and secondary endpoints are median overall survival,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, time to progression of brain metastases and toxicity. The study is&#xD;
      expected to provide data to be used in generating further research hypotheses.&#xD;
