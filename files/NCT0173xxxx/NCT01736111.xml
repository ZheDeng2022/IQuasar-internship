  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obese adults recruited from the primary care setting (n=150) will be enrolled&#xD;
      in a 6-month randomized trial of the INTERVENTION versus CONTROL. Both groups will receive&#xD;
      usual medical care, printed materials, and educational text messages. The INTERVENTION group&#xD;
      will also receive personalized coaching and feedback, as well as peer support, via text&#xD;
      message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that compared to those in the Control group, patients in the&#xD;
      Intervention group will lose more weight and demonstrate more favorable changes in fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable intake, exercise, and social support for weight loss.&#xD;

    <description>Printed handouts from the &quot;Aim for a Healthy Weight&quot; booklet, which is published by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and is frequently included in control conditions in primary care-based weight loss studies.&#xD;
Other handouts will discuss the use of prepackaged foods as well as setting goals for calorie intake, physical activity, and weight loss.&#xD;
One to three text messages per week, based on topics from &quot;Aim for a Healthy Weight&quot; and other sources. The text messages will be pre-scheduled, automated, non-tailored, and &quot;one-way&quot; (no reply will be requested). The total dose of contact will be low because each text message is limited to 160 characters. The condition is comparable in intensity to control conditions in other weight loss trials in the primary care setting.&#xD;
Usual medical care from the PCP.&#xD;
Education on symptoms of hypoglycemia, hypotension, and cardiovascular disease, with instructions to contact their PCP in the event of those symptoms.</description>
