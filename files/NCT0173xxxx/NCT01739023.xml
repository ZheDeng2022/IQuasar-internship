      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of autologous human Schwann cells (ahSC)&#xD;
      transplantation in subjects with subacute SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For humans with subacute SCI, we hypothesize that axons might show improved function if&#xD;
      myelin repair is induced with the implantation of ahSC. In addition spinal cord cavitation&#xD;
      may be reduced, and neural sprouting and plasticity may be enhanced via neurotrophic effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schwann cells are excellent candidates for transplantation into humans with SCI. Large&#xD;
      numbers of ahSC can be derived for autologous implantation after a minor surgery for&#xD;
      peripheral nerve harvesting, and purification and expansion of the cells in culture.&#xD;
      Autologous cells offer important safety advantages that include no need for immune&#xD;
      suppression, minimal risk of disease transfer, and a low risk of tumorigenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1990, scientists at the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis have generated extensive&#xD;
      preclinical data suggesting Schwann cell transplantations are successful in rodents with SCI.&#xD;
      The most recent work has focused on contusive injury models that are relevant to human&#xD;
      injury. They have also been largely responsible for developing an efficient method for&#xD;
      procuring large, essentially pure populations of human Schwann cells from adult peripheral&#xD;
      nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for implantation of ahSC in people with acute SCI is based on the evidence that&#xD;
      Schwann cells are neuroprotective and are capable of myelinating axons. Using mitogen&#xD;
      expanded human Schwann cells in SCID mice and athymic female nude rats demonstrated that&#xD;
      human Schwann cells can survive and are capable of enhancing axonal regeneration and forming&#xD;
      myelin after transplantation in animals with sciatic nerve transection or thoracic spinal&#xD;
      cord transection. The proposed clinical trial will advance knowledge about the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of a cell-based treatment strategy for human SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1 clinical trial will employ an open label, unblinded, nonrandomized and&#xD;
      non-placebo controlled dose-escalation design to evaluate the safety of transplantation of&#xD;
      ahSC transplantation in subjects with subacute SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sural nerve harvest will occur within 30 days post-injury. Standard-of-care medical&#xD;
      treatment and rehabilitation will proceed while the cells are being processed in a cGMP&#xD;
      facility. No later than 72 days post-injury, the ahSC product will be administered via a&#xD;
      single injection into the cavity of the spinal cord lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at week 1 and 2 post-transplantation and 2,&#xD;
      6, and 12 months post-transplantation.&#xD;
