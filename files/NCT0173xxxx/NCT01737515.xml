  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in surgical technique, preoperative patient evaluation and post-operative&#xD;
      care, elective colorectal surgery carries a risk of mortality of approximately 2% and a&#xD;
      morbidity rate ranging from 20-40%. Risk prediction is important for two reasons: it informs&#xD;
      decision-making in individual cases before surgery (part of informed consent) and allows the&#xD;
      comparison of actual outcome with predicted outcome. A number of scoring systems for&#xD;
      assessing risk of death after surgery have been developed. They vary from simple scores based&#xD;
      on a few variables to highly complex mathematical models requiring detailed data input.&#xD;
      Recently, the Association Française de Chirurgie conducted a multicentre study to develop and&#xD;
      validate a 4-item predictive score of mortality after colorectal resection which has good&#xD;
      predictive value and is simple to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many surgeons associate obesity with adverse outcomes, recent large, well-designed&#xD;
      studies have been unable to show that obesity (defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;30) is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for major morbidity or mortality after general abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      Recently abdominal obesity (waist measurement &gt;102cm in men and &gt;88cm in women) has been&#xD;
      shown to have better correlation with cardiovascular disease than BMI and is strongly&#xD;
      associated with a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (insulin&#xD;
      resistance, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and abdominal obesity) known as the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. Waist circumference and waist/hip ratio are measures of abdominal obesity&#xD;
      that correlate with the amount of intra-abdominal rather than subcutaneous or general body&#xD;
      fat and may be a better measure of the risk of intra-operative complications and&#xD;
      post-operative morbidity following abdominal surgery than BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be prospective and multicentred, with 28 participating units in Belgium,&#xD;
      France, Switzerland and Sweden. The coordinating centre will be UCL St Luc. The study will&#xD;
      start on 1st September 2008 and will aim to include a minimum of 1000 patients. Consecutive&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective colorectal resectional surgery for cancer or diverticulitis will&#xD;
      be included. In addition to normal preoperative assessment, waist and hip circumference will&#xD;
      be measured before surgery and specific data will be collected on intra and post-operative&#xD;
      complications and mortality. Data will be recorded using an encrypted, anonymous database&#xD;
      using variables carefully selected to assess short and long term outcomes. The study will be&#xD;
      the first of its kind to investigate abdominal obesity as a predictive risk factor for&#xD;
      colorectal surgery and will also be one of the biggest prospective studies of morbidity after&#xD;
      colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are a) to assess if waist measurement or waist/hip ratio is a better&#xD;
      predictive risk factor for complications or mortality after colorectal surgery than BMI, and&#xD;
      b) if this measurement adds accuracy to the AFC score in risk prediction.&#xD;
