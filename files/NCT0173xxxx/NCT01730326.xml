  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute migraine attack make up the majority of patients consulting the emergency&#xD;
      services due to headache. The aim of treatment in the emergency service is to achieve a&#xD;
      minimum level of undesirable side effects and to quickly relieve the pain which will not&#xD;
      repeat after discharge from the emergency service. Ideal drug treatment contraindication&#xD;
      should be at a minimum level and not trigger migraine. Paracetamol and Nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in the treatment of migraine headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although narcotic analgesics provide effective and rapid analgesia, they have such side&#xD;
      effects as hypotension, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness. In recent years, with the production&#xD;
      of parenteral forms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers, the analgesic efficacy of&#xD;
      these drugs has been one of the topics of interest to researchers. Especially intravenous&#xD;
      form of paracetamol is new yet compared to other Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and it&#xD;
      is a drug with a wide safety margin and less incidence of side effects. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      the Intravenous form of paracetamol and whether it can be an alternative to other analgesics&#xD;
      is one of the major research topics today, and more study is needed on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both drugs are often used in emergency services to treat headache caused by acute migraine&#xD;
      attack. Our aim is to compare the effectiveness of intravenous dexketoprofen with paracetamol&#xD;
      in the treatment of the headache caused by acute migraine attack.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods of Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the patients consulting the emergency service with a complaint of headache, those who&#xD;
      meet the criteria of 'International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for&#xD;
      migraine without aura' and agreed to participate in the study will form the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients forming the study group will be included in the study after they are evaluated&#xD;
      according to the criteria of inclusion or exclusion. Our research is an equivalence study.&#xD;
      Provided that the difference between the groups is 50 %, α: 99 %, and 1-β: 80 %, it has been&#xD;
      determined that each group should include at least 94 subjects, and the number of voluntary&#xD;
      subjects has been determined as 200, each group containing 100 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, in the measurement of the frequency of headaches, the standard 11-point Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS), whose reliability is proven, and 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) will be&#xD;
      used. For NRS, patients will be asked to score their pain on a scale ranging from 0 to 10,&#xD;
      scoring 0 (zero) in the absence of pain, and 10 in the case of most severe pain; whereas, for&#xD;
      VAS, they will be asked to score their pain on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, scoring 0 in&#xD;
      the absence of pain, and 100 in the case of most severe pain. Verbal rating scale (VRS) with&#xD;
      4 standard points will be used as another measurement tool. In this measurement, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to express their pain as severe, moderate, mild and no pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be divided to two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups and drug doses to be given;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. group: Dexketoprofen Trometamol (50 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. group: Paracetamol (1000 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug which will be given after randomization will be diluted in 150 ml serum physiologic&#xD;
      and will be given as intravenous rapid infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pains of the patients will be assessed in 0., 15. and 30. minutes by NRS, VAS and VRS,&#xD;
      and they will be monitored for vital signs and possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 30. minute, the study will be ended, and If the pain continues, fentanyl 1 mcg / kg will&#xD;
      be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient eligible for the study consults, after obtaining the patient's written&#xD;
      consent, the patient will be assigned to one of the study groups based on the next study&#xD;
      number. Randomization of study numbers will be prepared by someone other than a person&#xD;
      working in the emergency service with the help of a computer, and until the completion of the&#xD;
      study, which number is assigned to which drug will be known only by that person. One of the&#xD;
      nurses working in the emergency department will be responsible for preparing the study drug,&#xD;
      while the other nurse blindly will be responsible for giving the study drug. The numbers&#xD;
      belong to the previously enumerated study groups will be stored in envelopes which do not&#xD;
      show the inside (allocation concealment), and the study drug will be prepared after the next&#xD;
      envelope is opened by the study nurse. Patients eligible for the study will be taken to the&#xD;
      unit called 'observation with monitor' in the emergency department, monitored and IV vascular&#xD;
      access will be established. The study drugs will be prepared by the emergency nurse&#xD;
      responsible for the study and will be given by the other nurse. Medicines prepared for each&#xD;
      group are transparent and same.&#xD;
