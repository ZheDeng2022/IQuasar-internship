    <textblock>
      Pain following abdominal surgery is managed with the use of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA)&#xD;
      where the epidural is inserted in the spine at the level of scapula The risks due to TEA&#xD;
      include difficulty with insertion, failure in up to 40% of patient in the perioperative&#xD;
      period, fall in blood pressure and a rare devastating complication of paralysis either due to&#xD;
      bleeding or infection. Injury to spinal cord is also a feared complication. Therefore&#xD;
      alternative techniques need to be evaluated. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been documented to&#xD;
      provide pain relief following abdominal surgery using an earlier technique which posed the&#xD;
      risk of puncture of the covering to the lung (pleura) resulting in pneumothorax. The current&#xD;
      technique involves the use of curled catheters inserted using ultrasonography to lie outside&#xD;
      the pleura where the nerves travel thus reducing the chances of pneumothorax and catheter&#xD;
      migration. Objective of the current study is to compare the efficacy and safety of bilateral&#xD;
      PVB with TEA. Patients undergoing bowel surgery will be randomized to receive thoracic&#xD;
      epidural analgesia or bilateral thoracic paravertebral blocks. Pain scores during rest and&#xD;
      coughing, failure and complication rates will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the investigators is to determine whether ultrasound (US)-guided bilateral&#xD;
      thoracic paravertebral blocks (PVB) using curled catheter provides effective post-operative&#xD;
      analgesia as compared to thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing open abdominal&#xD;
      bowel surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study will be the pain scores over the first 24 hours following&#xD;
      open bowel surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analgesic consumption in the perioperative period,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Block related data (block performance time, success rate, extent of sensory block,&#xD;
           complications)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hemodynamic parameter every 6 hourly&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of side effects like nausea and pruritus scores, time to return of bowel&#xD;
           activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: Primary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral blocks provide equal analgesia in the early postoperative period (first 24&#xD;
      hours of surgery) as compared to thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing bowel&#xD;
      surgeries by laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The analgesic consumption between PVB and TEA is not different during the first 24 hours&#xD;
           following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The block performance time, success rate and extent of sensory block with PVB are not&#xD;
           different from that of TEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Side effects and complications following bilateral PVB are not different from those&#xD;
           occurring after TEA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 70 patients with ASA physical status 1 to 3, scheduled for elective bowel surgery&#xD;
      by laparotomy and deemed suitable to receive either thoracic paravertebral or epidural&#xD;
      analgesia will be included in the study. Recruitment will take place in the preoperative&#xD;
      clinic. Written informed consent for the participation in the study will be obtained at the&#xD;
      visit to the preadmission clinic or in the preparation area at least 2 hours prior to the&#xD;
      surgery. They will be randomized to one of two groups prior to the block procedure using a&#xD;
      closed envelope system. All patients will be educated regarding the VRS scores on a scale of&#xD;
      0 to 10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain ever experienced. All patients will&#xD;
      receive perioperative multimodal analgesia using naproxen, gabapentin and acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blocks will be performed in the block room using standard monitoring, sterile precautions&#xD;
      and titrated intravenous sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. During block performance one&#xD;
      anesthetist and one assistant will be present. Due to the necessity of handling the equipment&#xD;
      these staff will not be blinded. All patients will receive supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Group 1 will receive a catheter congruent TEA. The catheters will be inserted using&#xD;
      ultrasound to assess level as well as the best space to insert the epidural catheter between&#xD;
      T7 and T9. The epidural space will be identified using the loss of resistance technique.&#xD;
      After a test dose to rule out intravascular and intrathecal placement of the catheter using&#xD;
      3mL of 2% lidocaine with 5mcg/mL of epinephrine, the initial block will be made with 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine 5 mL followed by 3 mL aliquots administered every 5 minutes to establish a block&#xD;
      between T8 and T12. An infusion will be started at 8 mL/hour with 0.1 % bupivacaine with 10&#xD;
      microgram/mL of dilaudid and continued for 72 hours. Additional nurse administered boluses of&#xD;
      5-10mL of the standard solution will be allowed via the epidural catheter every 6hourly if&#xD;
      needed for pain control followed by an increase in the basal infusion rate up to a maximum of&#xD;
      14mL/hr. Patients will be allowed to self-administer additional boluses of 3mL of the&#xD;
      standard infusate every 20minutes (PCEA) as per the standard practice at this hospital. Time&#xD;
      to initiate the block and the failures will be documented. If the block fails, patients will&#xD;
      receive intravenous PCA with dilaudid and the patient will be dropped out of the study for&#xD;
      efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will have bilateral PVB catheters inserted using the ultrasound. Patients will be in&#xD;
      prone position and will receive intravenous sedation similar to Group 1. The T8 spine will be&#xD;
      identified and marked counting from the lumbar area. A high-frequency linear ultrasound probe&#xD;
      will be positioned in the T8/9 intercostal space with the transverse process and pleura in&#xD;
      the field as well as the internal intercostal membrane. (about 2.5 cm lateral to the spinous&#xD;
      process) Using ultrasound guidance and an in-plane approach, a 17 gauge Tuohy needle&#xD;
      connected to 15 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine via an extension tubing will be inserted to puncture&#xD;
      the internal intercostal membrane. Injection of local anesthetic will push the pleura away,&#xD;
      which will be the end point of needle position (the current standard technique in the the&#xD;
      investigators institution). A curved pigtail catheter will be inserted while observing its&#xD;
      delivery extrapleurally and further 5mL of local anesthetic will be injected while observing&#xD;
      further movement of pleura. A similar procedure will be done on the contralateral side at the&#xD;
      same level. The catheter will be secured to the skin and covered with dermabond and tegaderm.&#xD;
      Following this, 0.2% ropivacaine will be infused at a rate of 7 mlLhr via each catheter for&#xD;
      the next 72 hours post-operatively. They will also receive intravenous patient controlled&#xD;
      analgesia with dilaudid at a dose of 0.2mg with a lock out of 6 mins. Additional nurse&#xD;
      administered boluses of 5-10mL of ropivacaine 0.2% via the paravetebral catheters will be&#xD;
      permitted every 6 hourly to the side of maximal pain. The position of the catheter will be&#xD;
      confirmed on the routine post-operative chest x ray following the injection of contrast&#xD;
      (Isovue: 2 mL). The sensory block extent will be documented at 15 minutes after the initial&#xD;
      injection and prior to moving the patient to the OR. Time to initiate the block and the&#xD;
      failure rate will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US image of paravertebral space before and after LA injection (IIM: internal intercostal&#xD;
      membrane; TP: transverse process; LA: local anesthetic)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as the arterial line is inserted in the operating room for monitoring purposes, 10mL&#xD;
      of blood will be collected for measuring plasma ropivacaine levels. This measurement will be&#xD;
      repeated on arrival in the PACU along with routine postoperative arterial blood gas analysis.&#xD;
      Plasma ropivacaine level will be measured on postoperative day 1 at 6AM with the blood drawn&#xD;
      along with routine postoperative blood work (venous sample)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases with a failure to establish a block 30 minutes after local anesthetic injection will be&#xD;
      considered as block failure and the patient will be excluded from the efficacy part of the&#xD;
      study. These patients will receive intravenous patient controlled analgesia. Once the&#xD;
      effectiveness and level of the block is confirmed the patient will be moved to the operating&#xD;
      room for the surgery under standardized general anesthesia using fentanyl 2-3µg/Kg, propofol&#xD;
      2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.8-1.0 mg/kg for intubation followed by maintenance with desflurane&#xD;
      in air-oxygen mixture. Vasopressors (Ephedrine and phenylephrine) will be administered as&#xD;
      needed to control hemodynamics and the total dose used will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be assessed for pain during rest and coughing/activity immediately after&#xD;
      the surgery, every 15 minutes for first 2 hrs and 6 hourly thereafter until 24 hours after&#xD;
      the removal of epidural or block catheters. Patients whose VRS scores are higher than 5/10 in&#xD;
      PACU, apart from getting a bolus in the epidural or PVB may also receive IV Hydromorphone 0.2&#xD;
      mg every 5 minutes till pain subsides to a score of 3/10. Nausea will be documented using a&#xD;
      categorical scale (none, mild, moderate and severe), pruritus scores will be recorded every&#xD;
      12 hours (categorical scale, none, mild, moderate and severe). Time to onset of bowel sounds,&#xD;
      time to first flatus and time to first bowel movement would also be recorded with time 0&#xD;
      being the arrival time in PACU. Post-operative hemodynamic changes, blood pressure and urine&#xD;
      output will be documented every 6 hours. Duration of significant hypotension will be computed&#xD;
      from the nursing chart, significant hypotension being systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction will be documented on a visual analogue scale where 0 is totally dissatisfied&#xD;
      and 100 is totally satisfied. Adverse events such as local anesthetic toxicity, wound&#xD;
      infection, dehiscence, urinary retention, cognitive dysfunction and neurological deficits&#xD;
      will be prospectively collected. The failure rate of both the techniques and the number of&#xD;
      attempts will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label study to document the effectiveness of bilateral PVB in bowel&#xD;
      surgeries. The investigators plan to do a double blind study following the present study if&#xD;
      the results are encouraging. The second concern is that 2 different local anesthetics are&#xD;
      used for the 2 limbs but at equianalgesic concentrations for the infusion.&#xD;
