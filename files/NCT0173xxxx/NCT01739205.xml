      The major objective of this project is to determine if compared to Standard Care (SC), a&#xD;
      Community Approach to Lifestyle Modification for Diabetes (CALM-D) program including diet,&#xD;
      exercise and coping skills training, can decrease depression, weight and HbA1c and improve&#xD;
      medication adherence in low income, primarily Black and Latino/Hispanic, depressed,&#xD;
      overweight, Type 2 diabetic patients seen in a large, comprehensive, community health center.&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Obesity, poor&#xD;
      glycemic control, depression, low socioeconomic status (SES) and being a member of a&#xD;
      racial/ethnic minority group all increase this risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will compare 100 CALM-D and 100 SC participants. Following 3 run-in sessions&#xD;
      assessment sessions to determine eligibility, given to both SC and CALM-D participants, SC&#xD;
      patients will be treated in accordance with ADA Clinical Practice Guidelines (2005) and also&#xD;
      assessed by project staff at baseline, 6 months and 1 year. The CALM-D participants will&#xD;
      receive 2 individual stress management and lifestyle sessions followed by 2 weekly group&#xD;
      sessions. Then 4 bi-weekly sessions will be followed by 9 monthly sessions for a total of 17&#xD;
      sessions. Secondary objectives of the project are to determine if compared to SC, CALM-D can&#xD;
      improve glucose tolerance to challenge, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation,&#xD;
      procoagulation, lipid profile, endothelial function resting blood pressure, cardiac and&#xD;
      vascular function, cardiac morphology, psychosocial functioning and health quality of life.&#xD;
      As many of the participants will already have been prescribed aspirin, statins, oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemics and other medications, an important objective of the project will be to assess&#xD;
      the extent to which improved adherence to medications - a goal of the CALM-D program - can&#xD;
      account for improved intervention effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will be conducted on type 2 diabetic patients. Patients meeting eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized to SC or the CALM-D condition, which includes diet and exercise&#xD;
      counseling and coping skills training that in part is intended to facilitate medication&#xD;
      adherence. Both CALM-D and SC patients will be prescribed antidepressant as well as other&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because patient retention and adherence to protocol will be a major emphasis in this project,&#xD;
      we intend to use a 3 session &quot;run-in&quot; prior to randomization. Patients who appear to be&#xD;
      medically eligible, meet study criteria for major depression, and who express willingness to&#xD;
      participate return for a session in which the patient completes a medical history form,&#xD;
      undergoes a brief physical exam, takes a maximum exercise stress test, is given a&#xD;
      standardized dietary assessment, and is taught how to use a food diary and activity monitor.&#xD;
      At the beginning of the third run-in session, the patient returns the completed food diary,&#xD;
      and data from the activity monitor is recorded. The patient then takes a 2 hour oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT) during which time he or she answers questions about health habits,&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and health quality of life. After a brief rest and snack the patient&#xD;
      is escorted to the Ultrasound Laboratory for assessment of echocardiography, carotid artery&#xD;
      imaging and brachial artery endothelial functioning. Patients who satisfactorily complete all&#xD;
      three run-in sessions, meet eligibility requirements and are interested in participating, are&#xD;
      then asked to provide informed consent and are randomized into the CALM-D or SC conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be implemented using a stratified randomized block design. Eight strata&#xD;
      will be designated on the basis of age (&lt;50 vs ≥ 50 years), severity of depression (&lt;24 vs ≥&#xD;
      24 on the HRSD), and glycemic control (&lt;8 vs ≥ HbA1c) at baseline. Within each stratum,&#xD;
      random sequences will be generated in blocks of sizes 2, 4 or 6. The block size will also be&#xD;
      randomly chosen. In this manner the resulting sequence will look purely random, but will be&#xD;
      fairly closely balanced with respect to the critical variables of age, depression and&#xD;
      severity of diabetes (Piantadosi, 1997). Elements in the random sequences will be paired with&#xD;
      the subject number of participants assigned to each stratum. The number of sequences&#xD;
      generated for each stratum will vary depending on the number of eligible participants in that&#xD;
      stratum. These sequences will be concealed until the treatment conditions are actually&#xD;
      assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SC patients will be treated in accordance with ADA Clinical Practice Guidelines (2005),&#xD;
      which will include at least 2 HbA1c tests, lipid profile, test for microalbuminuria, dilated&#xD;
      retinal eye exam, complete foot exam and influenza immunization each year plus prescribed&#xD;
      aspirin therapy, and a screen for readiness to stop smoking if they smoke. Smokers are&#xD;
      encouraged to stop, using ADA recommendations in the Guidelines. In addition, each patient's&#xD;
      physician will receive after baseline, 6 months and 1 year, a report including OGTT, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid profile, endothelial function, resting&#xD;
      blood pressure, cardiac and vascular function, cardiac morphology, psychosocial functioning&#xD;
      and health quality of life. Participants in the CALM-D condition will receive all of the&#xD;
      above, but also 2 individual counseling sessions on (a) getting started, being active, losing&#xD;
      weight and managing stress; and (b) negative thoughts and emotions including a discussion of&#xD;
      ways to curb emotional eating. Following the 2 individual sessions there will be 2 weekly&#xD;
      group sessions followed by 4 bi-weekly sessions and then 9 monthly sessions. Each session in&#xD;
      CALM-D will be 1 hour long and will include deep breathing relaxation (5 min), homework&#xD;
      review including medication adherence, activity level, and fat and caloric intake (10 min),&#xD;
      session topics and homework assignment (45 min). The group topics include such issues as&#xD;
      &quot;Where's the Fat?/Three Ways to Eat Less Fat&quot; and &quot;Taking Your Medications/Stress and You.&quot;&#xD;
      Although participants and interventionists will be aware of the patient's treatment&#xD;
      assignment, all staff who collect, verify or classify end point data or follow-up assessments&#xD;
      will be masked as much as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of the study will be: a) depression; (b) weight and waist circumference;&#xD;
      (c) HbA1c; and (d) medication adherence. Secondary outcomes will include: (a) glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, (b) insulin resistance, (c) inflammation, (d) fibrinolysis, (e) lipid profile, (f)&#xD;
      oxidative stress, (g) endothelial function, (h) resting blood pressure, (i) cardiac and&#xD;
      vascular function, (j) cardiac morphology, (k) psychosocial functioning, and (l) health&#xD;
      quality of life. The above variables will be assessed at baseline, after 6 months and after 1&#xD;
      year. Data will be analyzed using mixed-model analyses to determine change over time as a&#xD;
      function of experimental condition. This will be done using the PROC Mixed module of SAS&#xD;
      software (Littell, Milliken, Stroup, &amp; Wolfinger, 1996). This methodology is useful for&#xD;
      intent to treat analyses in that it does not require complete data across multiple time&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of the patients we intend to recruit are likely to be Latino/Hispanic;&#xD;
      based on our previous experience, most of these Latino/Hispanic participants will prefer to&#xD;
      speak, write, and answer questions in Spanish. All of the instruments proposed are available&#xD;
      in Spanish. To a large extent, the CALM-D intervention developed for the present project is&#xD;
      based on both the DPP and ENRICHD protocols. We recognize, of course, that language and&#xD;
      ethnicity are not the same. However, there is a great deal of diversity among&#xD;
      Latino/Hispanics in the patient sample we have enrolled from the Jackson Health Care System&#xD;
      including Cubans, Colombians, Puerto Ricans, Nicaraguans, Dominicans, Mexicans, Peruvians and&#xD;
      Guatamalans among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 2 hour OGTT the participant will complete questionnaires including: a) Medical&#xD;
      History Form (e.g., demographics, risk factors, comorbid illnesses, medications); (b) health&#xD;
      habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol use; physical activity); (c) psychosocial functioning (e.g.,&#xD;
      BDI, DISH); and (d) health quality of life. In addition to providing measures of blood&#xD;
      glucose and plasma insulin, the blood draw will permit assessment of HbA1c, inflammation,&#xD;
      fibrinolysis, and lipids. After the OGTT the assessor will provide the participant with a&#xD;
      snack and allow for a brief rest period. Then the RD will conduct a dietary assessment and&#xD;
      record the data from the activity monitor. The participant will then be escorted to the&#xD;
      Ultrasound Laboratory for assessment of echocardiography, carotid artery imaging and brachial&#xD;
      artery endothelial function. At the completion of the session the participant will report to&#xD;
      the Assessors, review the days events, be thanked for participating and paid $100&#xD;
      reimbursement for his or her time and transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical measures. Activity monitor. Between the second and third week of the run-in&#xD;
      (Baseline) and 1 week before the 6 month and 12 month assessments all participants will wear&#xD;
      activity monitors for physical activity. The participants will also complete the Blair (1984)&#xD;
      questionnaire for the same one-week period. Participants in the CALM-D condition will be&#xD;
      reminded one week prior to each of 17 intervention sessions to wear the accelerometer daily&#xD;
      and bring it to the next session. We intend to use the New Lifestyle NL-2000 activity&#xD;
      monitor. This device weighs .25 ounce, count steps and estimates calories burned. The caloric&#xD;
      estimate subtracts calories burned in maintenance and adjusts for intensity based upon steps&#xD;
      per unit of time. This device has a 7 day automatic memory that starts each midnight at zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albuminuria. Albumin and creatinine will be measured during the 2nd run-in/assessment&#xD;
      /Baseline session by urine sample (see Core B). Serum creatinine will also be measured.&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if there is evidence of renal disease (i.e., urine dipstick protein&#xD;
      4+; serum creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women or 1.5 mg/dL in men; or currently receiving&#xD;
      dialysis). In those patients who meet criteria for entry into the study, the incidence and&#xD;
      progression of microalbuminuria or greater level of excretion will be assessed using an&#xD;
      albumin/creatinine ratio at both 6 month and 12 month follow-up. Serum creatinine will also&#xD;
      be measured at these times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory fitness. Fitness will be evaluated at Baseline (second run-in/assessment&#xD;
      session) and at 6- and 12-month follow-up with a maximal treadmill test (see Core C). The&#xD;
      Baseline symptom-limited maximum stress test represents the current standard of care for an&#xD;
      exercise prescription. The primary measure for assessing change will be change in maximal&#xD;
      oxygen uptake (VO2 max). Heart rate, ECG changes, blood pressure and VO2 max will be&#xD;
      determined during the exercise test. For the maximum exercise stress tests the participant&#xD;
      will be continued on any prescribed medication for cardiovascular disease. The following 3&#xD;
      abnormalities classify an individual at moderate to high risk for cardiac complication during&#xD;
      exercise and will result in study exclusion: 1) 2 or more previous myocardial infarctions;&#xD;
      (2) previous episode of primary cardiac arrest; (3) exercise capacity &lt; 6 METS, (4) ischemic&#xD;
      horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression ≥ 4.0 mm, or (5) angina during exercise (see&#xD;
      Core C for details).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes control. CALM-D will include measurement of HbA1c, fasting glucose, and response to&#xD;
      oral glucose challenge at Baseline (run-in/assessment session 2), and at both 6- and 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up. Patients will be excluded at Baseline if HbA1c &gt; 11%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial measures Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI (Beck, 1967) taps several&#xD;
      domains of depression. Of the 21 items on the scale, 11 deal with cognition, 2 with affect, 2&#xD;
      with overt behavior, 1 with interpersonal symptoms and 5 with somatic symptoms. In&#xD;
      overweight, type 2 diabetic patients, somatic symptoms may reflect physical disease processes&#xD;
      (e.g., fatigue or inflammation rather than primary depression. For this reason, subanalyses&#xD;
      separating out effects of the intervention on somatic vs nonsomatic items will be important.&#xD;
      The BDI has been used extensively in English, Spanish and various European speaking&#xD;
      populations with internal reliability between α = .85-.93 (e.g., Sanz &amp; Vázquez, 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS (Cohen, S. &amp; Williamson, G., 1988) is a 10 item scale&#xD;
      that measures the degree to which situations in people's lives are perceived as stressful&#xD;
      (unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming) and has good reliability (α = .85).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cook-Medley Hostility Scale (Ho). The Ho scale (Cook &amp; Medley, 1954) is composed of 50&#xD;
      true-false items taken from the MMPI that measures cynicism and mistrust of others and has&#xD;
      adequate test -retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity (Smith,&#xD;
      1992). It has been shown in a number of large scale prospective studies to be associated with&#xD;
      increased risk for CHD (Miller et al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coping. The Brief Cope (Carver, 1997) will be used to assess coping strategies that may be&#xD;
      moderating CALM-D intervention effects. This instrument has demonstrated high internal&#xD;
      consistency, adequate stability over time and substantial convergent validity. Based on our&#xD;
      previous studies using the Cope, we shall be looking at the following 2 item subscales: (1)&#xD;
      active coping; (2) using emotional support; (3) using instrumental support; and (4)&#xD;
      behavioral disengagement. Subscales 1, 2, and 3 will also be used as a composite measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS). The PSSS (Blumenthal et al., 1987) is a 12-item scale&#xD;
      that addresses perceived support from family, friends and significant others. It has&#xD;
      established reliability and is related to CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health quality of life Health Status Questionnaire, Short Form (SF-36). The SF-36 (Ware &amp;&#xD;
      Sherbourne, 1992) is a 36-item instrument with 8 multi-item scales: (1) physical functioning;&#xD;
      (2) social functioning; (3) role limitations due to physical health problems; (4) role&#xD;
      limitations due to personal or emotional problems; (5) general mental health; (6) vitality;&#xD;
      (7) bodily pain; and (8) general health perceptions. Subscale reliabilities have been above&#xD;
      0.8 in multiple population studies conducted on adults. It has successfully been used to&#xD;
      evaluate functional status in depressed, chronically ill, and healthy individuals (Wells et&#xD;
      al., 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. In the present project all participants: (a) will meet diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      major depressive disorder, unless currently prescribed an antidepressant medication and have&#xD;
      both a prior diagnosis of depression and current BDI score &gt;11. It should be noted that a&#xD;
      patient with type 2 diabetes has approximately the same risk of an MI as a patient who has&#xD;
      already had an MI but does not have diabetes (Haffner et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study half of the participants, all of whom are depressed, will be randomized to&#xD;
      the CALM-D intervention and half into standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CALM-D intervention consists of 17 sessions. The first 4 sessions meet weekly. Sessions 1&#xD;
      and 2 are individual sessions in which counselor and participant get to know one another and&#xD;
      build rapport. They also provide the participant with the opportunity to ask questions,&#xD;
      describe potential barriers and express reservations. Sessions 3 and 4, which also meet&#xD;
      weekly, encourage participants to get to know one another and deal with issues concerning&#xD;
      diet and medication adherence. After the first 4 weekly sessions, participants meet for 4&#xD;
      biweekly sessions followed by 9 monthly sessions. One week prior to each bi-weekly and&#xD;
      monthly session, the therapist will call to remind the participant of the next meeting and&#xD;
      request that the participant wear the accelerometer and fill-out the food diary daily until&#xD;
      the upcoming session. Immediately prior to each CALM-D intervention session, the participant&#xD;
      is weighed, accelerometer results are recorded and the food diary is turned in. Upon initial&#xD;
      randomization into the intervention condition and again during session 1, the participant is&#xD;
      told that he or she is invited to ask a partner, family member living in the household or a&#xD;
      friend to come to the intervention sessions. The topic for each session are shown in Table&#xD;
      D.3.9.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The objectives of the intervention are for participants to: a) lose 7% of their weight&#xD;
      through healthy eating; (b) do 2.5 hrs of brisk, physical activity each wk (e.g., walk&#xD;
      briskly for 30 min 5x per week); (c) manage stress better (e.g., through coping strategies;&#xD;
      deep breathing); and (d) always take their medication. Participants are also taught how to&#xD;
      fill out a food diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the outset of the intervention the counselor will discuss the effects of excess weight on&#xD;
      diabetes and how complications of diabetes can be decreased with improved diet and increased&#xD;
      activity level. In terms of diet, participants are taught how to: use a fat counter and read&#xD;
      labels; weigh and measure foods; eat less fat; change eating habits to better match the food&#xD;
      pyramid; choose healthy eating behaviors; make healthy food choices when eating out; and&#xD;
      relate calorie balance to weight loss. To promote physical activity participants discuss:&#xD;
      current activity level; benefits of being more active; possible activities that can be&#xD;
      undertaken regularly; how to overcome barriers to activity; and ways to prevent injury. The&#xD;
      participants also learn how to use an accelerometer. Later in the program patients learn the&#xD;
      definition of aerobic fitness and its relationship to frequency, intensity, time and type of&#xD;
      activity. Ways to add interest and variety to activity plans are also discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a precursor to learning how to manage stress, participants are taught how to identify&#xD;
      types of negative thinking and the relationships among thoughts, emotions and ways to curb&#xD;
      emotional eating. The counselor also stimulates discussion on how failure to take prescribed&#xD;
      antidepressants can lead to mood related physical inactivity and other unhealthy health&#xD;
      behaviors (e.g., excessive alcohol use; overeating). Participants are taught how to: assess&#xD;
      if negative thoughts are accurate; replace inaccurate negative thoughts with accurate&#xD;
      thoughts; handle situations in which one can't fix the problem; identify sources of emotional&#xD;
      and tangible support and use them effectively; prevent stress; and cope with stress. The&#xD;
      intervention also deals with the need for handling lapses and relapses regarding diet,&#xD;
      physical activity, depression, and medication adherence. Participants are taught to identify&#xD;
      high-risk situations and early warning signs as well as how to use adaptive coping&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific strategies to achieve the weight loss goal. A weight loss goal of 7% is set, which&#xD;
      should lead to a loss of 7-21 lbs within 24 weeks. Participants will be weighed in private at&#xD;
      each session and this will be recorded on the weight graph in each participant's notebook.&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged, if possible, to weigh themselves outside of the study&#xD;
      venues. A total fat intake goal will be set based upon 25% total calories from fat. A total&#xD;
      caloric intake goal will also be set. Daily self-monitoring of food intake (fat and calories)&#xD;
      will be requested of participants with food measuring tools and a fat and calorie counter&#xD;
      will be provided. A more simplified form of self-monitoring will be provided for participants&#xD;
      with very limited reading and math skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific strategies to achieve the physical activity goal. A physical activity goal of 700&#xD;
      kilocalories per week (or 2.5 hours of moderate activity) is set in a step-wise fashion to be&#xD;
      reached in 5-weeks. Another goal is to reach 10,000 steps per week recorded on the&#xD;
      accelerometer. Participants will be asked to maintain daily physical activity records in&#xD;
      their diaries based on information from the accelerometer. Sites at which physical activity&#xD;
      can be safely and effectively undertaken will be identified for each participant, based on&#xD;
      their residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific strategies to achieve the medication adherence goals. Participants list all of the&#xD;
      medications they take and keep this list in a notebook. The purpose of each medication is&#xD;
      explained to the participant as well as the reasons for always taking the medication each day&#xD;
      as prescribed. Participants are encouraged to develop the habit of taking their medications&#xD;
      as prescribed at the same time each day. Discussions about handling weekends, going on&#xD;
      vacation, etc. are discussed during intervention sessions. Reminders about taking medications&#xD;
      are offered at each session and each phone call. Refills of medications are carefully&#xD;
      tracked. When participants report that they are running low on a medication they are&#xD;
      encouraged to obtain refills promptly. Reported side effects of medications are carefully&#xD;
      monitored and attempts made to determine if the side effects are easily remedied (e.g., take&#xD;
      just before bedtime, take with breakfast) or are due to not following instructions correctly.&#xD;
      If necessary the participant is referred to his or her physician for consideration of a&#xD;
      change in medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counselors and their supervision. The counselors we propose to use in this intervention are&#xD;
      licensed Ph.D. Clinical psychologists, who have served as counselors in the post-MI project&#xD;
      and in the adolescent intervention project of the present program project. Supervision is&#xD;
      carried out by Dr. Patrice Saab, Ph.D., who helped to develop both of our intervention&#xD;
      protocols, and received supervisory training from the Beck Institute in conjunction with the&#xD;
      ENRICHD trial and by Dr. Ronald Goldberg, M.D., who was the P.I. of the Miami site for the&#xD;
      DPP. Based on weekly reviews of audiotaped sessions, Dr. Saab will determine, using a&#xD;
      protocol check list, intervention adherence to the manual, point out any drift or lack of&#xD;
      fidelity to the protocol and offer professional suggestions on how to remediate problems.&#xD;
      Using standards developed in DPP, Dr. Goldberg will assure that counselors are adhering to&#xD;
      protocol with regard to such issues as using a fat counter, weighing and measuring foods,&#xD;
      using the food pyramid and supervising exercise and food diary homework. Weekly supervision&#xD;
      is an institutionalized component of all of our intervention programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses related to Primary aims and their association. In accordance with the&#xD;
      specific aims it is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (From Primary Aim 1). Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show&#xD;
      significantly greater improvement in BDI depression scores compared to participants in the SC&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater improvement in BDI score in the CALM-D than in the SC condition will be mediated&#xD;
      by increased medication adherence and improved coping skills by CALM-D participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (From Primary Aim 2). Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show&#xD;
      significantly greater weight loss than participants in the SC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater weight loss in the CALM-D than in the SC condition will be mediated by decreased&#xD;
      depression, increased adherence to dietary instructions and increased physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (From Primary Aim 3). Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show&#xD;
      significantly lower HbA1c in the SC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater decrease in HbA1c in the CALM-D than in the SC condition will be mediated by&#xD;
      greater weight loss, improved nutrition and increased exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (From Primary Aim 4). Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show&#xD;
      significantly greater medication adherence than participants in the SC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater increase in anti-depressant medication adherence in the CALM-D than in the SC&#xD;
      condition will be mediated by improved coping skills and an increase in perceived social&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater increase in adherence to prescribed medications other than anti-depressants in&#xD;
      the CALM-D than in the SC condition will be mediated by decreased depression and improved&#xD;
      coping skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses related to secondary aims. In accordance with the study's secondary aims it&#xD;
      is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show significantly improved insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and tolerance to oral glucose challenge compared to participants in the SC&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show improved procoagulation and&#xD;
      endothelial function and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress compared to participants&#xD;
      in the SC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show improved lipid profiles compared&#xD;
      to participants in the SC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show lower resting blood pressure and&#xD;
      improved cardiac and vascular function as well as cardiac morphology compared to participants&#xD;
      in the SC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show improved psychosocial functioning&#xD;
      compared to participants in the SC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the CALM-D intervention will show improved health quality of life&#xD;
      compared to participants in the SC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greater improvement in improved tolerance to oral glucose challenge, insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      procoagulation, oxidative stress, lipid profile, endothelial function, resting blood&#xD;
      pressure, cardiac and vascular function, cardiac morphology and health quality of life will&#xD;
      each be associated with decreased waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses. Preliminary analyses. All data will be inspected employing quality&#xD;
      control procedures. Descriptive statistics will be computed for every study variable to&#xD;
      ensure that all data values are within expected ranges and to eliminate any data errors that&#xD;
      may have occurred. If needed, in the event that some of our variables are not normally&#xD;
      distributed, we will transform these variables using log transformations or use&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics. A mixed model analysis program (using SAS Proc Mixed) for growth&#xD;
      models will be used to assess our 4 primary hypotheses. Missing data will be handled using&#xD;
      the full information likelihood algorithm, which uses all the data available for all&#xD;
      participants. To assess our secondary hypotheses, structural equation models will be used.&#xD;
      The secondary analyses will be conducted across several domains, modeled as latent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control variables. The stratified randomized block design should lead to comparable groups&#xD;
      with respect to key variables of interest, namely age, depression level and diabetes control&#xD;
      at baseline. To the extent that our groups are heterogeneous with respect to these variables,&#xD;
      they will be included as model covariates to reduce within group variability and increase&#xD;
      power. Gender and ethnicity may also be included in our models as dummy coded variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test of our Primary Hypothesis. Because this project involves a longitudinal design with 2&#xD;
      conditions measured at multiple times we will use mixed modeling to test our primary&#xD;
      hypothesis. This approach will allow us to compare the SC and CALM-D conditions on the&#xD;
      trajectory of change on our primary (i.e., BDI, weight, HbA1c, medication adherence)&#xD;
      variables. Additionally, the mixed model allows us to incorporate relevant covariates into&#xD;
      our specified models. (See Core D, for a fuller description of our modeling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to mixed models, we will use latent growth modeling to assess indirect paths to&#xD;
      test potential mediators of the relationship between our conditions and outcome variables.&#xD;
      The program that will be used for these analyses is Mplus (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 1998). We will&#xD;
      use hypothesis driven tests of mediation. Briefly, we will compare nested models: one with&#xD;
      direct and indirect paths, and the second with indirect paths only (but without the direct&#xD;
      path). If the difference between the models (using the χ2 difference test) is not significant&#xD;
      than we don't need the direct path, and this will support the hypothesis of mediation. For&#xD;
      example, we will assess whether a significant CALM-D effect on decreasing depression is due&#xD;
      to increased medication adherence. In Core D we specify how we will combine data across&#xD;
      projects for tests of mediation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analyses Power calculations for the specific aims are included below. All power&#xD;
      calculations were done using the statistical software nQuery (Elashoff, 2000). Power is&#xD;
      presented for a two group (intervention vs. control design). In addition to needing to&#xD;
      calculate the effect of our intervention on the primary endpoint, we are also concerned with&#xD;
      the need for calculating power for our mediation hypothesis, which we consider to be&#xD;
      exploratory.&#xD;

    <description>Participants (Pts) randomized to the lifestyle intervention received a yr long, 17 session intervention. Pts were asked to wear a pedometer and record their food intake for at least the week prior to each session. The first 4 sessions were delivered weekly, followed by 4 sessions delivered biweekly and finally 9 sessions delivered monthly. Each session was approximately 1-2 hrs. At the beginning of each session anthropometric, physical activity and dietary data were collected. Participants were lead in a 5 min deep breathing exercise before the didactic portion of the session began. Sessions targeted a broad range of material related to diet, physical activity, and psychosocial well-being. Participants were given homework assignments to incorporate covered material into their daily lives. Participants randomized to the intervention arm received follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months post randomization.</description>
