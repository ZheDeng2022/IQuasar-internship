    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a novel non-invasive method to estimate&#xD;
      coronary blood flow (FFRct) is applicable to evaluate the functional significance of coronary&#xD;
      stenoses in non-culprit vessels in a population of patients with recent STEMI (ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction) and multivessel disease. The diagnostic performance and&#xD;
      reproducibility of FFRct as well as the qualitative and quantitative correlation between&#xD;
      FFRct and the regional coronary blood flow will be examined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (cCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that&#xD;
      provides high-resolution images of coronary lesions. cCTA shows good diagnostic performance&#xD;
      in detecting or excluding coronary artery stenoses, but the severity of the lesions is often&#xD;
      overestimated. With invasive coronary angiography (ICA) the hemodynamic consequences of&#xD;
      obstructive lesions can be estimated using Fractional Flow Reserve measurement (FFR). There&#xD;
      is a good correlation between FFR and non-invasive ischemia tests such as stress&#xD;
      echocardiography, exercise tolerance test or Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography&#xD;
      (SPECT). Measurement of FFR during ICA represents the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessment of the&#xD;
      hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions. The major disadvantage of FFR is that it&#xD;
      is an invasive measurement, and consequently there is a risk of complications. Recently a&#xD;
      non-invasive method to determine FFR has been developed (FFRct). FFRct is performed using&#xD;
      standard cCTA images, and is based on computational fluid dynamics. The hemodynamic&#xD;
      consequence of stenotic lesions is determined at rest and under simulated condition of&#xD;
      hyperemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is divided into STEMI and NSTEMI on the basis of ECG&#xD;
      changes. In Denmark patients with STEMI are treated with primary percutaneous intervention&#xD;
      (PPCI) of the culprit lesion. Any non-culprit lesions are typically assessed with FFR after&#xD;
      3-4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the rate of complications during ICA with FFR is low, these complications can be&#xD;
      severe. Also the procedure is quite resource demanding. Thus it would be desirable if it in&#xD;
      these patients could be non-invasively evaluated whether further revascularisation is&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;

        Patients with STEMI admitted at Aarhus Universtity Hospital and treated with primary PCI,&#xD;
        and where the operater finds one or more residual stenoses in non-culprit vessels that&#xD;
        needs to be assessed at a later time with ICA and FFR.&#xD;
