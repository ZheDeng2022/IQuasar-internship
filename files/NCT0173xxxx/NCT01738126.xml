      This K01 application is designed to prepare the applicant with the skills necessary to&#xD;
      establish an independent research program on pain--related processing in the cerebellum.&#xD;
      Although pain studies using functional imaging in humans consistently find cerebellar&#xD;
      activation, the role of this structure during pain is unknown. In such studies, speculation&#xD;
      regarding the cerebellum's function during a painful event is often influenced by its&#xD;
      reputation as a coordinator of motor function, though animal studies have indicated that it&#xD;
      may also modulate the neural encoding of noxious stimuli. The candidate has published work&#xD;
      that indicates a functional dichotomy in the way the cerebellum responds to experimental pain&#xD;
      in healthy subjects and neuropathic pain patients. This suggests that the cerebellum has been&#xD;
      overlooked as a potential pain processing area, and research into this area could lend&#xD;
      invaluable insight into the basic physiological circuitry involved with pain and its&#xD;
      modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this project is that the cerebellum serves as an integrator of aversive&#xD;
      stimuli and adaptive motor behavior, and may modulate the emotional and cognitive experience&#xD;
      that distinguishes the perception of pain from the appreciation of innocuous sensory&#xD;
      stimulation. A human trigeminal model of experimental pain will be used, as all the&#xD;
      pain---related circuitry involved can be imaged along with the cerebellum at the same time.&#xD;
      The specific aims are (1) to map cerebellar activations related to sensory coding of noxious&#xD;
      stimuli and to correlate functional activity with anatomical connectivity using functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); (2) to distinguish&#xD;
      between pain and its anticipation based on cerebellar responses and connectivity; and (3) to&#xD;
      determine whether physical pain and aversive images engage similar circuitry in the&#xD;
      cerebellum. To accomplish these aims, the candidate will need to expand his background in&#xD;
      fMRI of cortical and brainstem pain processing to encompass cerebellar physiology, become&#xD;
      proficient in DTI analysis, and learn the white matter connectivity to and from the&#xD;
      cerebellum. The research environment at McLean Hospital and the other affiliates of the&#xD;
      Harvard Medical School system will provide the candidate with the resources to reach his aims&#xD;
      within 4 years.&#xD;
