    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies radioembolization and ipilimumab in treating patients with&#xD;
      uveal melanoma with liver metastases. Radioembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the&#xD;
      blood flow to the tumor and keeping radioactive substances near the tumor. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or&#xD;
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving radioembolization together with ipilimumab may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells in patients with uveal melanoma&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the safety and efficacy of sequential hepatic radioembolization and systemic&#xD;
      ipilimumab in patients with uveal melanoma metastatic to liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate effects on regulators of tumor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radioembolization with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres via hepatic arterial&#xD;
      infusion on day 1. Beginning on day 29, patients also receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 90 minutes. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>A number of correlative studies will be performed. Data will be analyzed longitudinally using methods such as repeated measures ANOVA; however, the primary analyses will be at specific time points (e.g., pre-treatment, post-hepatic radioembolization, post ipilimumab), and these analyses will be conducted using primarily non-parametric methods (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank or rank sum test). All tests will be two sided with a significance level of .05, and no adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made due to the exploratory nature of these studies.</description>
