      The investigators will be assessing the efficacy of a Model Based Iterative Reconstruction&#xD;
      algorithm (MBIR) as a noise reduction tool in computed tomographic (CT) examinations for&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease. MBIR is computer adapted mathematical calculation technique that generates&#xD;
      CT images with less picture degradation (noise) than traditional computer reconstruction&#xD;
      techniques such as FBP (Filtered Back Projection) and ASIR (Adaptive Statistical Iterative&#xD;
      Reconstruction), for enteric Crohn's Disease findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research involves collection of data from subjects standard of care diagnostic CT scan&#xD;
      and from a research low radiation dose scan performed immediately following their diagnostic&#xD;
      scan. We will determine the impact on image quality, interpretability, and Crohn's Disease&#xD;
      findings of the low dose scan compared to the standard of care scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FBP, MBIR, and ASIR are post processing tools that do not alter the scan acquisition itself.&#xD;

      1. PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a new model based iterative&#xD;
           reconstruction algorithm as a noise reduction tool and to compare its sensitivity for&#xD;
           the findings of enteric Crohn's Disease with the sensitivity of FBP or ASIR CT&#xD;
           Enterography findings in enteric Crohn's Disease.&#xD;

           Iterative reconstruction: A computer adapted mathematical calculation technique that&#xD;
           allows the ability to generate CT images with less image noise (picture degradation)&#xD;
           than traditional image reconstruction techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reconstruction algorithms are computer adapted mathematical calculations applied to raw&#xD;
           data during image reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of different CT reconstruction algorithms will allow the quantitative assessment&#xD;
           of small bowel Crohn's Disease (CD) while exposing patients to lower radiation doses.&#xD;
           MBIR and ASIR will provide images with lower noise and similarly accurate quantification&#xD;
           of CD. Additionally, MBIR will allow acquisition of CT data at very low radiation doses,&#xD;
           with comparable image quality and quantitative assessment of CD compared to higher&#xD;
           radiation dose acquisitions performed utilizing FBP and ASIR. MBIR will not be inferior&#xD;
           to FBP or ASIR in assessing findings related to Crohn's Disease on CT enterography&#xD;
           (CTE).&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Computed tomography imaging traditionally relied upon filtered back projection (FBP) for&#xD;
           image reconstruction. This technique uses relatively little computing power, but&#xD;
           requires a number of assumptions be made about the data acquisition itself that result&#xD;
           in an increase in image noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of iterative reconstruction techniques has recently started to take place in CT&#xD;
           imaging. The major benefit of iterative reconstruction techniques is the ability to&#xD;
           generate CT images with less image noise. This noise reduction allows for tube current&#xD;
           reduction with IR images, limiting radiation dose in a linear manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Model based iterative reconstruction (MBIR), is replacing the older iterative technique,&#xD;
           adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR). MBIR utilizes more accurate&#xD;
           modeling and early research suggests MBIR images may be reconstructed from CT&#xD;
           acquisitions that use significantly decreased radiation dose, with similar image quality&#xD;
           compared to both ASIR and FBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           FBP, MBIR, and ASIR are post processing tools that do not alter the scan acquisition&#xD;
           itself. Iterative reconstruction algorithms have garnered increased interest, especially&#xD;
           with elevated public concern about radiation dose . MBIR techniques have not yet been&#xD;
           validated in CT examinations acquired for evaluation of Crohn's Disease (CD).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical history, physical examination, laboratory investigations and endoscopy have&#xD;
           been used to identify and evaluate the extent and severity of Crohn's Disease along with&#xD;
           imaging studies to assist in the evaluation of the small bowel involvement of CD. CT&#xD;
           Enterography has become the preferred imaging modality for assessing small bowel&#xD;
           involvement in inflammatory bowel disease. The dose reduction properties of MBIR are&#xD;
           particularly appealing in this area of CT imaging as multiple scans may be performed&#xD;
           over time to assess progression or relapse of disease and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Calprotectin is a protein found inside the cytoplasm of the immune cells within the&#xD;
           intestine known as neutrophils, granulocytes and macrophages. Under conditions of&#xD;
           mucosal inflammation as seen in inflammatory bowel disease, calprotectin is released&#xD;
           into the lumen of the bowel and excreted in the stool. Fecal Calprotectin levels can be&#xD;
           measured and serve as a biological marker of the degree of mucosal inflammation in the&#xD;
           bowel. Fecal calprotectin levels have not been previously correlated with the degree of&#xD;
           mucosal inflammation seen on CT Enterography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine the impact on image quality, interpretability, and Crohn's Disease findings&#xD;
           of low dose computed tomography enterography (CTE) images acquired with a new model&#xD;
           based iterative reconstruction algorithm as compared to standard image reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. RESEARCH METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research is a prospective non randomized study of 163 consecutive patients who are&#xD;
           clinically referred for CT Enterography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using sensitivity of the CTE to calculate sample size, the planned sample size for this study&#xD;
      is 163 subjects. The study will be powered at 80% to demonstrate that the lower radiation CTE&#xD;
      (ASIR and MBIR) is non-inferior (type I error rate of 2.5%, one sided) to the standard CTE.&#xD;
      The sensitivity of the standard CTE is assumed to be 0.77 based on a pooled estimate [7]. 0.1&#xD;
      is chosen as the non-inferiority margin. The correlation between the two procedures is&#xD;
      considered in the sample size calculation. We assume that the prevalence of Crohn's Disease&#xD;
      is 80% among the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the nQuery statistical program, with the assumption that the proportion of discordant&#xD;
      examinations is 0.15(or the conditional probability of positive finding in standard CTE is&#xD;
      0.90 if given a positive finding on the ASIR or MBIR CTE), the sample size needed to detect&#xD;
      no more than 0.1 difference in sensitivity of the two procedures for patients with disease is&#xD;
      118, with a 80% power and a type I error of 0.025, one sided. Assuming that 80% of target&#xD;
      population will have disease, approximately 148 subjects will need to be recruited. We have&#xD;
      factored in a 10% drop out rate ( patients who leave the study for any reason) bringing the&#xD;
      total number of patients to be recruited to 163.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image quality scores and quantitative analysis will be compared using both standard and the&#xD;
      novel reconstruction algorithms. These results will also be compared to the acquired FC&#xD;
      levels. Because each patient examination will receive multiple reconstructions, a mixed-model&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted to account for repeated observations within patients. Repeated&#xD;
      measures analysis of variance will be conducted separately for each outcome (signal, noise,&#xD;
      SNR, proportion of interpretable segments, and image quality) against the type of&#xD;
      reconstruction used. A 0.05 significance level will be used for all repeated measures and&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FBP, ASIR and MBIR will each be compared to the reference standard described below. The&#xD;
      endpoint will be the ability of each method to accurately identify the presence or absence of&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease (CD) as compared to the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference Standard:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. B. Bressler, the principal investigator, is a gastroenterologist with an expertise in&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dr. Bressler will review all of the available clinical&#xD;
      parameters including history and physical exam findings, ileocolonoscopy findings if&#xD;
      available and laboratory parameters including bloodwork and Fecal Calprotectin levels. The&#xD;
      gastroenterologist will not be blinded to the subject's identity. Based on his review of the&#xD;
      above parameters, he will rate the presence of small bowel CD as definitely active, probably&#xD;
      active, inactive (remission) or absent.&#xD;
