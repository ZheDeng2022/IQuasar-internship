      Major changes in the epidemiological characteristics of bacterial meningitis have been&#xD;
      observed as a result of changes in behaviour, human interventions (use of antibiotics,&#xD;
      prophylactic vaccinations), as well as poorly elucidated mechanisms responsible for epidemic&#xD;
      outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to identify the determinants of in-hospital mortality of&#xD;
      bacterial meningitis in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : the standardized data collection concerning cases of bacterial meningitis in&#xD;
      adults with telephone follow-up would allow analysis of the determinants of mortality and&#xD;
      neurosensory sequelae, description of the psychosocial impact and proposal of new treatment&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;

      Introduction: Bacterial meningitis is a rare (about 1,200 cases per year in France, 50%&#xD;
      occurring in adults) and serious disease (20% mortality during the acute phase; neurosensory&#xD;
      sequelae in 30% of survivors). Major changes in the epidemiological characteristics of&#xD;
      bacterial meningitis have been observed as a result of changes in behaviour, human&#xD;
      interventions (use of antibiotics, prophylactic vaccinations), as well as poorly elucidated&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible for epidemic outbreaks. No standardized clinical, microbiological and&#xD;
      prognostic data collection concerning bacterial meningitis in adults is available in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Standardized data collection concerning cases of bacterial meningitis in adults&#xD;
      with telephone follow-up would allow analysis of the determinants of mortality and&#xD;
      neurosensory sequelae, description of the psychosocial impact and proposal of new treatment&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To identify the determinants of in-hospital mortality of bacterial&#xD;
      meningitis in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of community-acquired&#xD;
      bacterial meningitis in adults, changes in these characteristics and their relations with the&#xD;
      vaccine status of the affected adult and his/her family; to characterize clinical and&#xD;
      microbiological failures and their determinants (pharmacological, microbiological,&#xD;
      immunological, etc.); to analyse the determinants of neurosensory sequelae and failure to&#xD;
      return to work after 1 month, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: In-hospital mortality (D30). Secondary endpoints: History including&#xD;
      vaccination of the case and the family, clinical, microbiological (species, susceptibility,&#xD;
      virulence factors, cerebrospinal fluid CSF) culture on D0 and H48), imaging characteristics;&#xD;
      treatments, CSF antibiotic concentrations, neurological sequelae (modified Rankin, Glasgow&#xD;
      Outcome Scale, IQCODE) at M1, M6 an M12, quality of life test SF12, WHO QoL, CESD) at M1, M6,&#xD;
      M12, hearing loss (audiometric tests, hereditary hearing impairment (HHI), telephone speech&#xD;
      test in noise) at M1, M6, M12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology, study design: National observational cohort study with comprehensive recruitment&#xD;
      in participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legal classification of the project: Epidemiological study. Number of subjects required: The&#xD;
      inclusion of 150 cases of meningitis per year would allow the collection of about 450 cases&#xD;
      over a period of 3 years. For a mortality rate of 20%, we would be able to estimate this&#xD;
      percentage with a confidence interval of ± 3.7% (95% confidence interval: 16.3-23.7). With 90&#xD;
      deaths, a power of 80% and a level of significance of 5% (two-tailed), this sample size would&#xD;
      demonstrate relative risks of 1.8 for a prevalence of the risk factor of 25% and 2.6 for a&#xD;
      prevalence of the risk factor of 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Adult with community-acquired bacterial meningitis defined by the&#xD;
      presence of at least one of the following criteria: 1/ Positive CSF culture and/or positive&#xD;
      soluble antigen in CSF with or without cell reaction; 2/ Positive PCR in CSF; 3/ Purpura&#xD;
      fulminant (with or without positive CSF culture); Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in&#xD;
      blood and/or positive blood culture AND CSF cell reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non inclusion criteria: Age less than 18 years old or refusal to participate. Inclusion&#xD;
      period: 3 years. Duration of participation for one patient: 12 months. Number of&#xD;
      participating centers: Constitution in participating centers of a dual investigator team&#xD;
      comprising a clinician (infectious diseases physician, intensive care physician, or&#xD;
      neurologist) and a microbiologist (participating in the national network of &quot;OBSERVATOIRES&#xD;
      REGIONAUX DU PNEUMOCOQUE&quot; [Regional Pneumococcal Observatories]). Declaration by the&#xD;
      microbiologist to the data management centre. On-site validation of cases by the dual&#xD;
      investigator team and then by a national multidisciplinary validation unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean number of inclusions per month and per centre: 0.5&#xD;
