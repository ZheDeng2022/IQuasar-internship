      The short-term goal of this project is to conduct a feasibility study at Winthrop University&#xD;
      Hospital to determine how well extremely obese (BMI &gt; 99%tile corrected for age) children and&#xD;
      adolescents can be recruited into an exercise program and evaluated in an efficient fashion,&#xD;
      and to identify particular strategies (e.g., medical examination feedback) that can serve as&#xD;
      potential benefits to research subjects and their families. In addition investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the exercise program on physical fitness, insulin resistance, and&#xD;
      neurocognitive functioning as well as the relationship between insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      neurocognitive function among adolescents who participate in the exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this project is to evaluate a large, multi-ethnic sample of&#xD;
      adolescents, 14 to 19 years of age, to systematically assess cognitive function and school&#xD;
      performance, fitness and examine the relationship between performance on those outcome&#xD;
      variables and a variety of biomedical and psychosocial factors that may directly or&#xD;
      indirectly influence brain function and test-taking performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High body mass index (BMI) among children and adolescents continues to be a public health&#xD;
      concern in the United States. The most recent figures from the National Health and Nutrition&#xD;
      Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2007-2008 report that 18.1% (95% CI, 14.5%-21.7%) of 12-&#xD;
      through 19-year-old adolescents were at or above the 95th percentile of BMI for age. Children&#xD;
      with high BMI often become obese adults, and obese adults are at risk for many chronic&#xD;
      conditions. High BMI in children may also have immediate consequences, such as elevated lipid&#xD;
      concentrations and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It now appears that neurocognitive dysfunction is also more common in obese children and&#xD;
      adolescents. In a large population study of 2,519 children, 8 to 16 years of age, a brief&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessment showed a statistically significant, albeit modest relationship&#xD;
      between cognitive test scores and BMI that persisted after adjusting for confounding&#xD;
      variables. Obesity is also associated with several conditions which known to affect brain&#xD;
      function, including sleep apnea, insulin resistance, hypertension, and chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      factors (e.g., by these variables cannot be determined, unfortunately, because those&#xD;
      variables were not measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note, however, that there is not complete agreement on linkages between&#xD;
      obesity and cognition.&#xD;
