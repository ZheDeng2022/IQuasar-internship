    <textblock>
      Nodding Syndrome (NS) is a novel form of epilepsy seen predominantly among children aged 5-15&#xD;
      years and characterized by head nodding, progressively worsening seizures, and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. To date, the cause of NS remains unclear. A recent assessment by the Uganda&#xD;
      Ministry of Health (MOH), World Health Organization (WHO), and US CDC conducted in Kitgum&#xD;
      District in northern Uganda documented that the nodding episodes themselves resulted from&#xD;
      atonic seizures, and that the children also exhibit multiple different seizure types, both&#xD;
      clinically and electrographically. The investigation also found that there was significantly&#xD;
      greater sero-positivity for onchocerciasis among children with NS compared with control&#xD;
      children, and demonstrated low serum concentrations of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) among both&#xD;
      cases and controls. Vitamin B6 is involved in neurotransmission and has been an effective&#xD;
      treatment of seizures for certain rare type of epileptic syndrome. Children with nodding&#xD;
      syndrome in Kitgum have been episodically treated with multivitamins, ivermectin, and&#xD;
      anti-epileptic medications including phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate,&#xD;
      but the possible beneficial or harmful effects of any of these medications for nodding&#xD;
      syndrome has not been systematically assessed, and reports from parents and guardians about&#xD;
      apparent effectiveness are varied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized blinded four group clinical trial with crossover&#xD;
      design to study the effect and response to therapeutic doses of oral pyridoxine (vitamin B6)&#xD;
      and treatment with currently used conventional anti-epileptics including phenytoin and sodium&#xD;
      valproate, among children with nodding syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nodding Syndrome (NS) is described as an epileptic seizure disorder and has been documented&#xD;
      in various geographic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Jilek et al, 1962, first described several&#xD;
      children with attacks of 'nodding head' in Mahenge, a region in southern Tanzania (1,2,3). A&#xD;
      missionary doctor described children in southern Sudan in the mid-1990s, where it was first&#xD;
      noted in the Lui and Amadi villages of East Mundri county and the Lui region of western&#xD;
      Equatoria; a medical NGO then reported the condition to WHO in 1997. An estimated 300 cases&#xD;
      were reported in 2003 from this region (4, 5). Winkler et al., using data from Tanzania&#xD;
      provided a clinical classification of seizures, semiology and socio-cultural aspects&#xD;
      suggesting it was a syndrome (referred to as &quot;head-nodding syndrome&quot;) and a form of epilepsy&#xD;
      (6, 7). In 2008 and 2009, reports of an illness consistent with NS were reported in Kitgum&#xD;
      and Pader districts, northern Uganda. Kaiser et al, in 2009, referred to the phenomenon of&#xD;
      head nodding as possibly constituting a feature of an epileptic syndrome caused by O.&#xD;
      volvulus (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptions of the features of NS appear similar between reports (Appendix A). Nodding is&#xD;
      frequently described as occurring in response to some stimulus, frequently being the presence&#xD;
      of food or exposure to cold (4, 5, 6, 7). The nodding consists of repetitive bobbing or&#xD;
      nodding of the head, sometimes associated with loss of muscle tone in the trunk and upper&#xD;
      extremities (6, 7). Consciousness may or may not be impaired during the nodding episodes. The&#xD;
      syndrome has been described to be progressive, with gradual neurological deterioration and&#xD;
      development of additional seizure types, developmental regression, cognitive decline, and&#xD;
      sometimes reportedly resulting in serious injuries or death both due to accidental falls into&#xD;
      fires or wells during seizure episodes. Treatment with conventional antiepileptic medications&#xD;
      has anecdotally been reported to result in some symptomatic improvement of both nodding and&#xD;
      other seizure types. Health workers in southern Sudan report that children who start&#xD;
      treatment early and on regular basis have seizures less frequently (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of NS is unknown. Various factors and exposures have been postulated to cause NS,&#xD;
      including exposure to munitions, prior history of measles infection, consumption of baboon&#xD;
      meat and sorghum, and others. Two recent case-control investigations, one conducted among&#xD;
      children with NS in Uganda during 2009 - 2010 and another conducted in S. Sudan in 2011&#xD;
      (below) have not supported these associations. One risk factor that appears to consistently&#xD;
      demonstrate an association with NS is evidence of infection, past or present, with the&#xD;
      microfilarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus, or a similar microfilarial parasite that is&#xD;
      serologically cross-reactive with Onchocerca. O. volvulus is transmitted by black flies.&#xD;
      Clinical manifestation of onchocerciasis is mainly ocular, with resultant vision loss due to&#xD;
      inflammatory keratitis (&quot;River Blindness&quot;). A significant association of NS with detection of&#xD;
      O. volvulus microfilariae in skin snips was observed in a case-control investigation in Sudan&#xD;
      in 2001 - 2002, and in an assessment in Tanzania (84% of 62 children with NS had&#xD;
      microfilariae or O. volvulus nucleic acid in skin snips). Various studies and reviews have&#xD;
      identified an association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy in general (5, 10, 11, 12, 13,&#xD;
      14, 15, 16, 17, 44, 46). A high prevalence of seizure disorders in onchocerciasis endemic&#xD;
      areas was noted in Western Equatoria in 1946.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the WHO investigations conducted in southern Sudan in late 2001, skin snip positivity and&#xD;
      higher microfilaria loads of O. volvulus were found in children with NS when compared to&#xD;
      children without the condition, consistent with similar observations of a possible&#xD;
      association between seizures and onchocerciasis from other studies (5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,&#xD;
      15, 16, 17, 44, 46). These, and subsequent investigations in 2002 by WHO could not identify&#xD;
      any environmental pollutants, chemical agents or food toxins, nor several infectious agents,&#xD;
      as possible causes for the seizures. EEG among 31 children assessed showed progressive&#xD;
      epileptic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 2009, a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#xD;
      assisted the Uganda Ministry of Health and the WHO in the investigation of the occurrence of&#xD;
      NS in Kitgum / Pader regions of northern Uganda. A total of 51 cases with reported NS, and 93&#xD;
      household or friend controls were identified for the case control investigation and&#xD;
      additionally, 23 subjects with reported NS were enrolled in a case series that underwent&#xD;
      thorough medical and neurological assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unpublished data from the assessment demonstrated that NS is a seizure disorder, and that the&#xD;
      nodding episodes are due to atonic seizures resulting in loss of tone associated with changes&#xD;
      on electroencephalography (EEG) including multiple other clinical and subclinical seizure&#xD;
      types. The surveillance data showed that the prevalence of NS in parts of Kitgum region is&#xD;
      many-fold higher than what would be expected for comparable forms of epilepsy, based upon&#xD;
      data from North America and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case-control investigation, while skin snip positivity for the presence of O. volvulus&#xD;
      microfilariae was not associated with NS cases, seropositivity for antibodies to O. volvulus&#xD;
      was, with 95% of cases positive for onchocerciasis serology compared with 54% of controls&#xD;
      (p=0.03). The investigation also showed low serum vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) levels (&lt;20) among&#xD;
      the population of children between the ages of 5 and 15 in the region as a whole, both cases&#xD;
      and controls. Deficiencies in vitamin A, selenium, and zinc, among both cases and controls&#xD;
      were also noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ministry of Health, Government of Southern Sudan (MoH-GoSS), further investigated for NS&#xD;
      in the Witto internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in Witto Payam in western Equatoria in&#xD;
      September 2010. A total of 96 cases were registered, most aged between 5-20 years (highest in&#xD;
      the age group 10-15 years). Head nodding, tonic-clonic partial seizures with secondary&#xD;
      generalization and generalized seizures were reported. Based on the past two investigations,&#xD;
      and available data, it was concluded that NS is a form of epilepsy with causes remaining&#xD;
      obscure (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In May and June of 2011, a team from the CDC assisted the South Sudan Ministry of Health and&#xD;
      the WHO with an investigation of NS in Western Equatoria State in South Sudan. A total of 38&#xD;
      case-control pairs matched by age- and village- were identified for the case control&#xD;
      investigation and separately, 25 subjects with reported NS were enrolled in a case series and&#xD;
      underwent thorough medical and neurological evaluations (17). The findings from this&#xD;
      investigation were consistent with the unpublished findings from investigations in Uganda in&#xD;
      2009-10, with the cause of Nodding syndrome continuing to remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, parents and caregivers of children with NS report that children respond to locally&#xD;
      available anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) differently; some reporting that there is a response&#xD;
      and others not. These locally available AEDs include carbamazepine, phenytoin,&#xD;
      phenobarbitone, and valproate. However, this information is anecdotal and it remains unclear&#xD;
      whether children receive medications on a regular basis, what doses are administered or&#xD;
      adhered to, or whether they achieve therapeutic levels of AEDs. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      additionally propose two AED treatment arms with conventional anti-epileptic therapy&#xD;
      including sodium valproate and phenytoin, in order to validate the reported response to&#xD;
      conventional anti-epileptic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on investigations done so far, children with NS appear to suffer from multiple clinical&#xD;
      and electrographic seizure types, including generalized tonic-clonic, partial complex,&#xD;
      atypical absence, and atonic seizures. Seizures are classified as partial generalized, and&#xD;
      unclassified based on the clinical features and associated electroencephalographic findings&#xD;
      (Appendix Y). There are many causes for seizures, including infectious, metabolic, drugs,&#xD;
      genetic, nutritional, endocrinal, and trauma. In some cases, an etiology is not known, and&#xD;
      the seizures are referred to as idiopathic or cryptogenic. Currently, because an etiology for&#xD;
      NS has not been identified, the children suffer from multiple different seizure types, and&#xD;
      many children demonstrate cognitive impairment, NS could be considered a form of cryptogenic&#xD;
      epileptic encephalopathy. This is important because such epilepsies can be very difficult to&#xD;
      control with standard AEDs, and in some cases, may be exacerbated with certain AEDs (e.g.,&#xD;
      carbamazepine) (18, 19, 20, 21, 22). Thus, a formal assessment of the effects of AEDs on&#xD;
      children with NS is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The finding of low pyridoxine levels among children assessed, in the population of Kitgum&#xD;
      District as well as in the children assessed in Western Equatoria in South Sudan is notable,&#xD;
      in the light of a condition known as pyridoxine-dependent seizures (PDS) and&#xD;
      pyridoxine-responsive seizures. Hunt et al, (1954) first described pyridoxine dependent&#xD;
      seizures (PDS) (23) with an autosomal recessive inheritance. PDS is due to defective binding&#xD;
      of pyridoxine to its apoenzyme, glutamate decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of&#xD;
      glutamic acid, a critical nutrient, into gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory&#xD;
      central nervous system neurotransmitter. The resultant reduced levels of GABA lower the&#xD;
      seizure threshold, leading to intractable seizures (24, 25,26, 27, appendix Z).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDS commonly manifests among infants as intractable seizures, generally beginning within&#xD;
      hours of birth. Classically multiple types of clinical and electrographic seizures are&#xD;
      described among individuals with PDS (24, 28, 29, 30). Prolonged seizures and recurrent&#xD;
      episodes of status epilepticus are typical, also reported are recurrent self-limited events&#xD;
      including partial seizures, generalized seizures, atonic seizures, myoclonic events, and&#xD;
      infantile spasms (27, 30, 31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly seen in neonates and infants, atypical presentations are known to occur with seizure&#xD;
      onset later in childhood including report in a child of 6 years (26, 27, 32, 33, 34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDS is a diagnostic consideration in such instances among infants when the seizures are&#xD;
      intractable and may not be controlled with conventional anticonvulsants but that respond both&#xD;
      clinically and electrographically to pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine (27, 35).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trial of therapeutic doses of B6 (administration of 100 mg or more of pyridoxine) is&#xD;
      indicated in infants / children with intractable seizures unresponsive to standard&#xD;
      anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment (24, 25, 26, 35, 36, 37, 38). Intravenous or&#xD;
      intramuscular administration is recommended in infants with ongoing seizures or status&#xD;
      epilepticus, in order to achieve immediate resolution of seizures and clinical seizures&#xD;
      generally cease over several minutes to hours (29). If responsive, oral maintenance dose of&#xD;
      2-500mg/day PO (15-18mg/kg/day optimally and sometimes as high as 680mg initially and 200&#xD;
      mg/day subsequently) has to be followed indefinitely (33, 35). Clinical seizures generally&#xD;
      cease over several minutes to hours. Recommended daily allowance (RDA) for pyridoxine is 0.5&#xD;
      mg for infants and 2.0 mg for adults or 50-100 mg of pyridoxine per day (38, 39, 40) with&#xD;
      dosage adjustment for age, intercurrent illnesses and to allow greatest intellectual&#xD;
      performance but not exceeding 500 mg/day (27, 28, 36, 38, 41). The chance to identify&#xD;
      specificity is lost if pyridoxine is given together with or after, many anticonvulsant drugs&#xD;
      (27). Daily supplementation with pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine is the accepted treatment&#xD;
      for this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The seizures as reported to occur among children with NS appear to share several features&#xD;
      with PDS, namely multiple seizure types. However, NS does not represent PDS in its typical&#xD;
      form; any relationship between NS and pyridoxine deficiency is only suspected in light of the&#xD;
      presence of the deficiency in the population. However, unpublished findings from two&#xD;
      investigations undertaken separately in Uganda (2010) and South Sudan (2011) show that&#xD;
      deficiency of B6 has been noticed among this population of children (both cases and controls)&#xD;
      raises the possibility of a contributory role of B6 deficiency in NS. Since the entire&#xD;
      population, including both children with and without NS, appears to be pyridoxine-deficient,&#xD;
      the illness cannot be attributed to B6 deficiency alone; however, the possibility that low B6&#xD;
      levels may be a contributory factor remains and therefore a treatment trial with pyridoxine&#xD;
      is proposed because PDS is a therapeutic diagnostic consideration in such settings. Because&#xD;
      the seizures in children with NS appear to have a gradual onset, and are intermittent with&#xD;
      significant interictal periods, intravenous administration of pyridoxine is not necessary and&#xD;
      oral supplementation will be most appropriate. B6 treatment is safe. There are few reports of&#xD;
      significant side effects of B6 treatment. Apnea, lethargy and hypotonia among infants soon&#xD;
      after starting B6 have been reported (3 out of 5 infants by Mikati, et al), but these are&#xD;
      rare (29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the diagnosis of PDS is based upon a response to the therapeutic intervention and&#xD;
      requires a trial of the treatment, and such replacement may provide a safe, efficacious&#xD;
      treatment for PDS, we propose to assess the possible efficacy of B6 supplementation for NS in&#xD;
      the form of oral pyridoxine treatment to evaluate the response and efficacy on the cessation&#xD;
      or reduction of seizures. Dosing for pyridoxine is 30 - 50 mg/kg/day in a single daily dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there appears to be growing data that NS is a seizure disorder and some of the&#xD;
      various current treatment approaches have focused on use of antiepileptic medications. For&#xD;
      most Ugandan children with this disorder, the current standard is no treatment or episodic&#xD;
      treatment with multivitamins and/or antiepileptic medications, which are typically&#xD;
      administered by psychiatric nurses with no or limited physician oversight. Information about&#xD;
      the effectiveness of this treatment approach is based on anecdotal reports, and there are no&#xD;
      reliable systematically collected data about dosage or frequency of medication use. In&#xD;
      addition to the lack of scientific data on the effectiveness of these treatment approaches,&#xD;
      there are important questions that need to be addressed regarding possible adverse effects of&#xD;
      use of antiepileptic medications in children with NS. Anecdotal reports from caregivers and&#xD;
      local treating physicians suggest that NS seizures appear to respond variably to locally&#xD;
      available anti-epileptic drugs; however, for the reasons outlined above, this has not been&#xD;
      clearly demonstrated. In addition, several aspects of treatment remain undetermined&#xD;
      including, whether children are given medications on a regular basis, are given appropriate&#xD;
      doses of antiepileptic drugs per weight, or are achieving therapeutic doses of drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is not clear whether the children with NS are obtaining clinical benefit or&#xD;
      are being harmed from AED treatment. Given the knowledge on the nature of the seizure types&#xD;
      seen in NS, it is possible that NS will be difficult to manage with conventional AED&#xD;
      approaches. In fact, certain antiepileptic medications may in some cases paradoxically&#xD;
      exacerbate certain seizure conditions (18, 19, 20, 21, 22). Such exacerbation is particularly&#xD;
      true in epileptic encephalopathies. For children with cryptogenic generalized epileptic&#xD;
      disorders, the AED sodium valproate (valproic acid) has been found to be often effective, has&#xD;
      fewer side effects than many other AEDs, and is considered the drug of choice (42). Valproic&#xD;
      acid is currently listed as a recommended AED by WHO. The investigators therefore propose a&#xD;
      simultaneous assessment of pyridoxine, valproic acid, as well as an AED that is currently&#xD;
      being utilized in the community for children with NS (phenytoin) and compare them with&#xD;
      response if any to a placebo controlled intervention group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: All children identified at clinic level and/or community level in the&#xD;
        study region will be eligible to enter into the study if they meet the following inclusion&#xD;
        criteria after completing the screening form (Appendix H):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical head nodding episodes with or without other types of seizure activity with a&#xD;
             frequency of at least 1 per day (7 episodes per week). [The seizures must be frequent&#xD;
             enough so that a change/decrease in that frequency is measurable.] Children will be&#xD;
             stratified into those with high frequency or observed nodding (with 3 or more episodes&#xD;
             daily), and lower frequency events (more than one but fewer than 3 episodes per day&#xD;
             reported).&#xD;
&#xD;
