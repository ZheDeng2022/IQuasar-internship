      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line treatments for malaria.&#xD;
      ACTs are highly effective, but malaria caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite is&#xD;
      becoming resistant to some ACTs. ACT-resistant malaria has shown up in some parts of&#xD;
      Cambodia, but not yet in other parts of the country. This has been shown by treating patients&#xD;
      with ACTs, checking the amount of parasites in the patient s blood every 6 hours, and&#xD;
      calculating the rate of parasite clearance. The parasite clearance rate in response to ACTs&#xD;
      is getting slower in western Cambodia and may be the first sign of ACT resistance.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study how effective ACTs are in different regions of Cambodia. This study&#xD;
      will look at the extent of ACT resistance and how widespread ACT-resistant malaria has&#xD;
      become.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the prevalence of ACT-resistant malaria in western, northern and eastern&#xD;
      Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 2 and 65 years of age who have uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      malaria and have not taken any antimalarial drugs for their symptoms in the previous 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recruited from clinics and hospitals in three Cambodian provinces.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be informed about the study and their consent to participate in the&#xD;
           study will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A venous blood sample will be obtained from patients before treatment and used for&#xD;
           laboratory experiments to measure parasite and patient factors that might affect the&#xD;
           parasite clearance rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with malaria will be treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ),&#xD;
           the standard first-line treatment for malaria in Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood samples obtained from a finger prick.&#xD;
           The amount of malaria parasites in each blood sample will be counted and followed until&#xD;
           they are no longer detectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have weekly follow-up visits for up to 9 weeks. Finger-prick blood&#xD;
           samples will be taken at each visit to see if the parasites reappear after treatment&#xD;
           with ACT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line treatments for Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum malaria worldwide. In Western Cambodia,artemisinin resistance has been defined as&#xD;
      a long half-life of parasite clearance (T1/2) in response to an artemisinin, given orally for&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria. We hypothesize that this artemisinin resistance phenotype compromises&#xD;
      the efficacy of ACTs. The primary objective of this study is to compare P. falciparum&#xD;
      recrudescence rates in Western, Northern and Eastern Cambodia, following&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) treatment. The secondary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to determine whether parasite recrudescence is associated with long T1/2. In the Parasite&#xD;
      Recrudescence Study, patients with uncomplicated malaria will receive directly-observed&#xD;
      treatment with DHA-PPQ over 3 days. We will follow these patients weekly for 9 weeks to&#xD;
      identify those with recurrent parasitemia and use genotyping methods to distinguish&#xD;
      recrudescences from reinfections. We will enroll a subset of these patients who have an&#xD;
      initial parasite density greater than or equal to 10,000/microL in the Parasite Clearance&#xD;
      Rate Study and follow their parasite densities more intensively by examining 6-hourly finger&#xD;
      prick blood samples until parasites are undetectable by microscopy. With these data we will&#xD;
      calculate and compare T1/2 values from patients with and without recrudescent parasitemia.&#xD;
      Using various laboratory assays, we will also explore the contribution of host factors to&#xD;
      T1/2 variation, and whether naturally-acquired immunity reduces the risk of drug-resistant&#xD;
      parasite recrudescence.&#xD;
