    <textblock>
      This is a single center, non-randomized phase IIa study to determine the tolerance and safety&#xD;
      of Abraxane (ABX) in combination with cisplatin (DDP) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients in whom the standard therapy had failed or had been&#xD;
      infeasible will be eligible.The safety and efficacy will be evaluated according to NCI-CTCAE&#xD;
      V4.0 and RECIST 1.1 respectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is most commonly seen in Southeast Asia, especially in&#xD;
      southern and southeastern China, where the incidence rate has been documented between 10 and&#xD;
      150 cases per 100,000 population per year. For advanced or metastatic NPC, chemotherapy&#xD;
      remain the mainstay of treatment. The 130-nm albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel&#xD;
      ([Abraxane, ABX ];Celgene,Summit,NJ) is a promising new agent with more efficient entry to&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment via caveolae-mediated transcytosis and preferential uptake by&#xD;
      cancer cells. Superior activity of ABX-based regimens without the necessity for&#xD;
      antianaphylactic pretreatments been shown in various solid tumors compared with the&#xD;
      traditional solvent-based paclitaxel-based ones. However, the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      combination of ABX and cisplatin (DDP) has not been determined in patients with advanced NPC.&#xD;
      In this single center, non-randomized phase IIa study, investigators seek to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of ABX-DDP, and perform an&#xD;
      exploratory study of its efficacy as measured by tumor response.&#xD;
