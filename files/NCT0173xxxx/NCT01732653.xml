  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of treadmill training&#xD;
      augmented with virtual reality on fall risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 older adults with a history of falls will be recruited to participate in this study. This&#xD;
      will include older adults (n=100), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=100), and&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)(n=100). Subjects will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention group (treadmill training with virtual reality) or to the active-control group&#xD;
      (treadmill training without virtual reality). Each person will participate in a training&#xD;
      program set in an outpatient setting 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Assessments will take&#xD;
      place before, after, and 1 month and 6 months after the completion of the training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled trial with 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up will be employed to investigate the effects of treadmill training augmented with&#xD;
      virtual reality on fall risk. The study will include 300 older participants who have&#xD;
      experienced two or more falls in the previous 6 months. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive 18 sessions of&#xD;
      Treadmill Training with Virtual Reality (TT+VR) and the active control comparison will&#xD;
      receive 18 training sessions of treadmill training alone (TT) without the VR simulation All&#xD;
      interventions will be delivered by therapists trained in the standard protocols. All subjects&#xD;
      will be trained 3 times a week for 6 weeks, each session will last approximately 45&#xD;
      minutes.Training progression will be based on increasing both motor and cognitive challenges,&#xD;
      individualized to the participant's level of performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of the study is fall rate for 6 months post intervention.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include gait speed and gait variability under usual and dual&#xD;
      task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles will be measured. Endurance will be&#xD;
      assessed using the 2 Minute Walk Test and mobility will be assessed using the Four Square&#xD;
      Step Test (FSST), The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the mini-Balance&#xD;
      Evaluation Systems Test (mini-BESTest). Community ambulation will be assessed using a&#xD;
      tri-axial accelerometer ('Axivity' Ltd.)which will be worn by the participants for 7 days.&#xD;
      Cognitive function will be assessed using a computerized neuropsychological test battery&#xD;
      (Mindstreams, 'NeuroTrax' Corp., NJ) as well as standardized neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      (Montreal Cognitive Assessment,The Trail Making Test; Verbal Fluency). Quality of life will&#xD;
      be evaluated using the SF-36 Health Survey&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure of the study is fall rate. Participants will keep a falls calendar for 6 months post intervention. Each time the participant falls he/she will tick the date on the calendar. These calendars will be returned to the researchers once a month in a pre-addressed envelope.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed and gait variability under usual and dual task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles will be measured. Participants will be asked to walk in a well-lit corridor under 3 conditions each of 1 minute: i) walking in a comfortable speed, ii) walking while subtracting 3s from a predefined number (dual task), iii) walking while negotiating two obstacles placed on the floor at specific locations. Spatial-temporal gait characteristics (e.g., gait speed (m/s), stride length (m), stride time (s), swing time (%), asymmetry, and step width (cm)) will be determined. Endurance will be assessed using the 2 Minute Walk Test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed using a computerized neuropsychological test battery (Mindstreams, NeuroTrax Corp., NJ). In addition, we will also include standardized neuropsychological tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); The Trail Making Test (TMT) and the Verbal Fluency test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance and mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Four Square Step Test (FSST), The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (mini-BESTest) will be used to assess mobility. Community ambulation will be assessed using The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity Ltd.) which will be worn by the participants for 7 days to quantify and monitor stepping and physical activity.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 Health Survey, a generic self-report questionnaire designed to address health related quality of life will be used. Fear of Falling will be evaluated using the Falls Efficacy Scale-International.</description>

    <description>subjects will be walking on a treadmill while negotiating virtual obstacles provided by a computer simulation. The virtual environment will consist of obstacles, different pathways, narrow corridors and distracters, requiring modulations of step amplitude in two planes (i.e., height and width) coordinated with walking behaviour. The speed, orientation, size, frequency of appearance and shape of the targets will be manipulated according to individual needs following a standardized protocol.</description>
