      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - One form of the influenza vaccine is a nasal spray. It uses a live but weakened flu virus.&#xD;
      Researchers want to better under how the live vaccine interacts with the body s immune&#xD;
      system. They will test the nasal spray flu vaccine (called FluMist) against a saline (salt&#xD;
      water) nasal spray. They will then look at blood and nasal cell samples to see how the&#xD;
      vaccine affects these cells immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look at immune changes in nasal and blood cells in people who receive live flu vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 49 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have five outpatient visits for this study. Each visit will last up to&#xD;
           2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They&#xD;
           will give blood and urine samples. Nasal cell samples will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A week later, participants will have either the nasal spray flu vaccine or a saline&#xD;
           spray. They will know which spray they will receive. Blood samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two days after the vaccination, they will have another physical exam. Blood and nasal&#xD;
           cell samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the final two visits (1 week and 1 month after the vaccination), more blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who had the saline spray will be able to have the actual vaccine spray at the last&#xD;
           study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ratio of participants who receive vaccine to those who receive saline will be 4:1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two types of influenza vaccines are currently licensed in the US, trivalent inactivated&#xD;
      vaccine (TIV), administered by intramuscular injection, and LAIV, administered by nasal&#xD;
      spray. Both vaccines are safe and effective in their approved age groups. Neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody in the serum has been found to be a correlate of protection for TIV, but the immune&#xD;
      correlates of protection for LAIV are not known. Defining the origin and nature of&#xD;
      transcriptional responses to LAIV in URT in infected and bystander epithelial and lymphocyte&#xD;
      cells in healthy adults will be a highly informative first step in a systems approach toward&#xD;
      understanding the molecular basis of viral replication restriction and the regulation of the&#xD;
      local mucosal immune responses following LAIV administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This natural history study will use a systems biology approach to identify LAIV replication&#xD;
      niches among a variety of URT cell types and characterize the host immune response to LAIV.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers aged 18-49 years will be prescreened for low (&lt;1:10) serum HAI titer&#xD;
      against the component influenza vaccine virus strains (influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, and&#xD;
      influenza B) of the licensed seasonal LAIV. Ten HAIlow or -negative individuals will be&#xD;
      vaccinated intranasally with LAIV (n=8) or will receive saline intranasally (n=2). One week&#xD;
      prior to and 2 days after vaccine administration, an NP specimen will be collected using&#xD;
      flocked NP swabs. A blood sample will be collected at the time of NP swabbing and on Days 7&#xD;
      and 28 after vaccination. Total subject participation time from enrollment/baseline to the&#xD;
      final study visit will be 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to recover cells from NP swab samples and sort individual cells of different&#xD;
      subsets based on specific surface phenotypic markers. We will then utilize&#xD;
      microfluidics-based real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to&#xD;
      quantify transcripts from bulk and single cells. These transcripts will include&#xD;
      strand-specific influenza RNA for determining virus replication, genes for assigning cells to&#xD;
      specific epithelial or lymphocyte subpopulations, selected genes in the IFN signaling&#xD;
      pathways to determine innate immune responses, and genes involved in activation and effector&#xD;
      functions of different immune cell subsets. Results will be analyzed with several&#xD;
      bioinformatics tools, with an emphasis on the differential signaling responses between&#xD;
      various cells types. The mucosal transcriptional data will be correlated with B and T cell&#xD;
      immunity markers and traditional serology (HAI and neutralization assays) before and after&#xD;
      vaccination to identify key factors affecting the immune response to LAIV.&#xD;
