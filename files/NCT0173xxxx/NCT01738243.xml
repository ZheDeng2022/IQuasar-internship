  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune disease that affects the eye area. The disease&#xD;
      presents with a variety of physical findings, including bulging of the eyes (proptosis),&#xD;
      upper and lower eyelid retraction, and swelling/inflammation of the eye itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease passes through two phases: active and inactive. The active phase lasts between 18&#xD;
      and 24 months. During this phase, TED signs and symptoms generally worsen and then often&#xD;
      improve. The inactive phase follows, during which the signs and symptoms of TED cease to&#xD;
      improve and usually stabilize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lid retraction is a cardinal sign of TED. In addition to potentially causing cornea damage&#xD;
      due to improper lid closure, lid retraction is also very troublesome for patients due to its&#xD;
      cosmetic appearance. The precise pathophysiology of lid retraction is poorly understood, but&#xD;
      a leading hypothesis is that it occurs due to scarring and fibrosis in the muscles that lift&#xD;
      the eyelid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the definitive treatment for lid retraction is surgery, which can be used to&#xD;
      lengthen the lid itself or remove inflamed tissue from behind the eye, thus causing the eye&#xD;
      to bulge less. In cases when patients first present to their physician with corneal&#xD;
      ulceration or compression of the optic nerve, surgery may be performed immediately. However,&#xD;
      in most instances, surgical procedures are delayed until the active stage of the disease has&#xD;
      passed. Thus, most patients must endure the cosmetic and irritant symptoms of TED for up to&#xD;
      two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronic Acid Gels (HAG) have been FDA approved for the treatment of facial rhytids&#xD;
      (wrinkles). They are injected under the skin and work by increasing volume. Recently, some&#xD;
      smaller retrospective research studies have shown that HAG is also effective in correcting&#xD;
      upper and lower eyelid retraction in TED. Hence, HAG may be for patients with active stage&#xD;
      TED. It is also thought that if employed early in active phase disease, HAG may also help to&#xD;
      decrease the severity of associated symptoms and reduce the need for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current investigation is to define the clinical utility of HAG correction&#xD;
      of upper eyelid in active TED in terms of anatomic (lid position), quantitative (corneal dry&#xD;
      eye signs) and qualitative effects (symptom severity and thyroid related quality of life).&#xD;

          1. Active stage TO as determined by symptom onset of under 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Upper eyelid retraction of 1mm or greater in one or both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Complaints of either significant ocular symptoms (despite appropriate use of ocular&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age less than 21 years: due to lack of data on safety for HAG fillers in pediatric&#xD;
             population&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age over 65 years of age: as HAG filler effect may be different in this population&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are pregnant or nursing: as there is little safety data on potential teratogenicity of&#xD;
             HAG fillers&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a demonstrated allergy to HAG fillers or lidocaine&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a current infection, skin sore, pimple, rash, hive or cyst over the injection&#xD;
             site: to avoid worsening the infection or transmitting it&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a bleeding disorder or currently taking blood thinning medications such as&#xD;
             Coumadin, heparin or acetylsalicylic acid on a daily basis.&#xD;
