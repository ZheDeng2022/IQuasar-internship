      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a severe viral infection of the brain.&#xD;
      It is caused by JC virus. Many people have this virus in their bodies all their life, but it&#xD;
      is usually kept in check by their immune system. If the immune system does not work right&#xD;
      because of a disease or medication, the virus becomes active and can damage cells in the&#xD;
      brain. Not much is known about PML or how it affects the immune system. Researchers want to&#xD;
      study people with PML to better understand the natural history of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the natural history of PML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 2 years of age who have PML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and imaging&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have several visits to the National Institutes of Health Clinical&#xD;
           Center. There will be an initial visit, monthly visits for the next 6 months, a 12-month&#xD;
           visit, and possible visits afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the initial visit, participants will give blood, urine, and spinal fluid samples.&#xD;
           They will also have neurological tests and imaging studies of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the next five visits, participants will give blood and urine samples. They will also&#xD;
           have neurological tests and imaging studies of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 6-month and 12-month visits will repeat the tests from the initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other optional procedures include bone marrow samples and skin biopsies. Additional&#xD;
           blood tests and imaging studies may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the risk factors and natural course of JCV&#xD;
      infection and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a devastating,&#xD;
      demyelinating neurological disease affecting the brain of patients with a compromised immune&#xD;
      system. It is caused by reactivation of JC virus (JCV), a small DNA virus that infects the&#xD;
      majority of the population without clinical significance. There are currently no treatments&#xD;
      available for PML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study patients with suspected or confirmed PML with different underlying&#xD;
      conditions including patients on immune-modulatory therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS),&#xD;
      rheumatologic diseases or other autoimmune diseases, as well as patients with HIV infection&#xD;
      or other conditions leading to a compromised immune system. Patients will be seen at defined&#xD;
      time points during their disease course and detailed assessments will be performed to collect&#xD;
      clinical and imaging data. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will also be collected at&#xD;
      these time points to evaluate the behavior and biology of the JCV and the patients immune&#xD;
      responses to the infection. These tests will lead to a better understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PML and the course of this disease in different patient groups.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will recruit a patient control cohort represented by patients with impaired&#xD;
      immune function for any cause and considered at risk for development of PML, and a healthy&#xD;
      volunteer cohort. The purpose of these additional cohorts is to explore and validate&#xD;
      biomarkers for risk of development of PML and early diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this detailed characterization will be used to help identify:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical imaging and/or laboratory features pathognomonic of JCV infection and disease&#xD;
           course that may aid in earlier diagnosis and intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical imaging and/or laboratory features of the disease course that is predictive of&#xD;
           clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will be integrated to develop a clinically relevant, disease-specific&#xD;
      assessment scale of PML, which is currently not available. Such a scale would be a useful&#xD;
      tool for the clinical management of patients (i.e., for development of standards of care), as&#xD;
      well as for clinical trial design and interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objectives of this study are to improve the understanding of the disease course&#xD;
      and underlying pathophysiology, to identify subgroups with different prognosis and/or&#xD;
      susceptibility to interventions, and to help identify therapeutic targets and/or intervention&#xD;
      strategies. Equally important, these efforts will allow development of a repository of&#xD;
      cryopreserved biological samples that will be used for validation of candidate biomarkers in&#xD;
      future studies; this data and biological bank will be made available to outside laboratories.&#xD;
