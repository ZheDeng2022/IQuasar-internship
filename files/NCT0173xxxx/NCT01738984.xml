      This Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR) project will develop and test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an interactive web program optimized for use on a Internet connected&#xD;
      television(TV), titled Moms Exercising or (MomZing) that is designed specifically for women&#xD;
      with infants 2-8 months old. Moms will select from a menu of 98, 10-minute exercise videos&#xD;
      demonstrating yoga, aerobics, and strengthening exercises. They select and sequence together&#xD;
      exercise videos personalized to their fitness level, form of exercise, and the choice to&#xD;
      actively exercise with her baby or alone. The primary health goal of the MomZing Program is&#xD;
      to increase home-based Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MPVA) minutes per week in new&#xD;
      mothers and to maintain their exercise increases over time as their baby grows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that women that use the MomZing Program will have greater&#xD;
      increases in physical activity and fewer will return to cigarette smoking or alcohol use,&#xD;
      compared to women who use a standard &quot;mommy and me&quot; exercise DVD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Becoming a mother is a significant transition in a woman's life, and while this is a positive&#xD;
      experience for many, there can be significant decreases in healthful behaviors such as&#xD;
      physical activity and increases in unhealthy behaviors including sleep deprivation, stress,&#xD;
      and depressive symptoms. Increasing postpartum physical activity can have multiple health&#xD;
      benefits including risk reduction for chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, and improvement in psychological health including decreased stress and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. Improvements in mental health outcomes can prevent substance use since&#xD;
      psychological stress is a risk factor for substance use and abuse. The postpartum period also&#xD;
      represents a critical period to prevent a return to substance use, including tobacco and&#xD;
      alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR)- Phase II project will develop and test an&#xD;
      interactive web-enabled television program, titled Mothers Exercising or (&quot;MomZing). Features&#xD;
      include the ability to select one to five 10-minute videos demonstrating yoga, aerobics, and&#xD;
      strengthening exercises for mothers with infants 2 to 8 months of age. Women will select and&#xD;
      sequence together videos personalized to their fitness level, preference for exercise type,&#xD;
      and the choice to actively exercise with her baby or alone. Exercises with a baby will be&#xD;
      tailored to the infant's weight and include interactions that promote cognitive development&#xD;
      and mother-child bonding. MomZing is designed for viewing on a television taking advantage of&#xD;
      new technologies that allow viewers to watch streaming video (including movies) from the&#xD;
      internet on a television. The television can also be connected to the internet via a&#xD;
      web-enabled console such as an internet-connecting device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the MomZing web-enabled Program is to increase home-based&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes per week in new mothers. Phase II&#xD;
      activities will include: 1) programming the MomZing multimedia web enabled Program, a&#xD;
      recruitment website, and online survey; 2) producing 98,10-minute video segments showing&#xD;
      women exercising with or without an infant; 3) conducting iterative usability testing of the&#xD;
      features and content of the Program; and, 4) conducting a randomized trial of the efficacy of&#xD;
      the Program with 572 new mothers recruited from across the U.S. New mothers will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either the MomZing web-enabled TV Program or a standard exercise DVD&#xD;
      designed for new mothers. The primary outcome will be minutes per week of leisure-time&#xD;
      moderate to vigorous physical activity measured at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include changes in fatigue, sleep, depressive symptoms, tobacco and alcohol use at&#xD;
      12 weeks. Process evaluation will also determine extent to which the technology is utilized&#xD;
      (frequency of use and time per access) over 12 weeks in both conditions. We will investigate&#xD;
      whether key demographic (i.e., weight of infant, number of children) physiological (i.e.,&#xD;
      body mass index), and lifestyle factors (sleep quality, fatigue) act as mediators or&#xD;
      moderators of any change in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MomZing Program will allow Moms to tailor a range of exercise options to meet their needs&#xD;
      and those of their infant. As their infant grows and progresses through different cognitive&#xD;
      and developmental stages the Program can grow with them, allowing the Mom to change her&#xD;
      preferences unlike any exercise multimedia(DVD or website) currently available on the market.&#xD;
