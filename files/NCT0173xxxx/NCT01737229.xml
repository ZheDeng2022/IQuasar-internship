      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre and open-label study comprises six groups corresponding to the six&#xD;
      indications tested. No placebo or reference product is involved. No randomization is required&#xD;
      as the indication will define the patient selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The six indications studied are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct pulp capping following carious pulp exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct pulp capping following dental trauma injury to healthy pulp (partial pulpotomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repairing perforated root canals and/or the pulp chamber floor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrograde endodontic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulpotomy in primary molars&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apexification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study start: October 2009&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period: 1/10/2009 to 30/06/2011&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial objective is to illustrate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of RD94 in the&#xD;
      indications described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to show that RD94 can be easily applied in the claimed indications&#xD;
      and to evaluate its efficacy. This can be defined after a 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of RD94 after a two year follow-up which&#xD;
      is important for safety and the longevity of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL POPULATION AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients in three French study centers, 10 per indication studied. Depending on the&#xD;
      indication, children (from 3 years onwards), and/or adults will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product is applied on D0 (Inclusion) of the study. The follow-up period includes 2 years&#xD;
      with six visits: Visit1 - Week 1, Visit 2 - Month 1, Visit 3 - Month 3, Visit 4 - Month 6,&#xD;
      Visit 5 - Year 1, Visit 6 - Year 2.&#xD;
