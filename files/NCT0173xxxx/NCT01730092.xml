      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - High blood pressure in the lungs, known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is a rare&#xD;
      disorder. Some people have disease-associated PAH and some have PAH from an unknown cause.&#xD;
      Researchers want to follow the natural history of all PAH patients to understand how PAH&#xD;
      progresses in order to discover targets for future research into new treatments. To further&#xD;
      identify treatment targets, they will compare healthy volunteers to patients with PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the natural history of PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with PAH will have periodic visits to the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
           Clinical Center. After the first visit, they will return in 6 months and then yearly or&#xD;
           every other year for as long as the study continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first visit will take up to 3 days. It will involve the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and lung function tests and imaging studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six-minute walk test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about exercise and physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will have only one visit to the Clinical Center, during which they&#xD;
           will undergo screening tests, and complete many of the same tests as patients with PAH&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder associated with poor survival.&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction resulting from 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a triggering&#xD;
      stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, the two-hit hypothesis, appears to play a&#xD;
      central role both in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH. Inflammation appears to drive&#xD;
      this dysfunctional endothelial phenotype, propagating cycles of injury and repair in&#xD;
      genetically susceptible patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and patients with&#xD;
      disease-associated PAH. However, despite mounting evidence of vascular inflammation in&#xD;
      patients with PAH, detailed phenotypic studies are lacking on the temporal evolution of this&#xD;
      process and its contribution to right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary vascular remodeling. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a detailed characterization of the temporal evolution of vascular&#xD;
      inflammation in PAH and its impact on RV and pulmonary vascular function will add prognostic&#xD;
      value to traditional measures of disease severity and suggest novel therapeutic targets for&#xD;
      future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IPAH and disease-associated PAH will be recruited to the NIH and enrolled in&#xD;
      this natural history study investigating the ability of circulating markers of vascular&#xD;
      inflammation as well as high-resolution cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to&#xD;
      accurately stage severity of disease and/or predict clinically relevant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total population for the study will be 150 PAH subjects and approximately 55 age and&#xD;
      gender matched controls (i.e. each healthy volunteer is matched to less than or equal to 3&#xD;
      PAH subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH subjects will undergo 1) standard clinical examinations including 6-minute walk distance&#xD;
      and echocardiography; 2) cardiopulmonary exercise testing; 3) markers of coagulation and&#xD;
      fibrotic disease; 4) plasma profiling of inflammatory&#xD;
&#xD;
      markers; 5) gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs); 6)&#xD;
      high-resolution MRI-based determination of pulmonary vascularand RV structure and function&#xD;
      and 7) Cardiac CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma markers of endothelial inflammation, PBMC expression profiles, and high-resolution&#xD;
      cardiac MRI will also be studied in age and gender matched controls to define normal ranges&#xD;
      and variability for each of these novel assessments. Comparison of these results to PAH&#xD;
      subjects at baseline will be used to determine the degree to which these investigative tests&#xD;
      distinguish PAH patients from healthy subjects. Likewise, baseline clinical evaluations of&#xD;
      PAH subjects will be used to examine whether any novel test (inflammatory markers, or cardiac&#xD;
      MRI), accurately classifies patients according to their disease severity. In addition, these&#xD;
      tests will be investigated prospectively for their ability to predict PAH disease&#xD;
      progression. Disease progression will be defined prospectively as a decrease in the 6-minute&#xD;
      walk distance of greater than or equal to10% from baseline or clinical worsening requiring an&#xD;
      escalation in therapy, hospitalization due to right heart failure, transplantation or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional plasma will be collected from PAH subjects and age/gender matched control&#xD;
      subjects. This material will be used to probe for new biomarkers and inflammatory factors&#xD;
      using discovery based approaches (i.e. Proteomics and pulmonary artery endothelial cell&#xD;
      bioassay).&#xD;
