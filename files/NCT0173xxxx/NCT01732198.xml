      Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single booster dose of NU300, co-administered with&#xD;
      Prevnar 13® over a 28 day period following the injection compared to a single booster of&#xD;
      ACTHIB co-administered with Prevnar 13® over a 28 day period following the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the immunogenicity, as determined by anti-PRP polysaccharide response, of a single&#xD;

             device)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever at the time of&#xD;
             vaccination (fever is defined as a temperature of ≥ 38.0C [100.4F]).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Known history of thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
