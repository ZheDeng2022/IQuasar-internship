      RATIONALE: Placing a gene that has been created in the laboratory into white blood cells may&#xD;
      make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is resistant or refractory to&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced&#xD;
      with the anti-CD20 vector (referred to as CART-20 cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-20 cells. RT-PCR analysis of whole blood&#xD;
      will be used to detect and quantify survival of CART-20 TCR zeta:4-1BB over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-20 cell&#xD;
      infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-20 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells (such as patients with active CLL,&#xD;
      ALL, etc) determine tumor cell killing by CART-20 cells in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD20, and&#xD;
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-20 (loss of engraftment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the relative subsets of CART-20 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned groups according to order of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anti-CD20-CAR lentivirus vector-transduced autologous T cells with&#xD;
      41BB-gamma vector for 3-5 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.&#xD;
