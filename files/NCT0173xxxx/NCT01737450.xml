    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the activity, to assess the safety and tolerance of&#xD;
      BKM120 in adult patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer progressive under&#xD;
      platin and cetuximab-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor. The PI3K/Protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway deregulation&#xD;
      is frequently observed in Head and neck cancer. In addition to its role in tumor genesis, the&#xD;
      PI3K/AKT pathway seems to be involved in resistance to cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the study proposal is to evaluate the clinical interest of a monotherapy&#xD;
      with a PI3K inhibitor (BKM120, Novartis) in patients with metastatic head and neck cancers&#xD;
      refractory or relapsing under platin and cetuximab based- chemotherapy. Since resistance to&#xD;
      cetuximab can result from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit&#xD;
      alpha (PIK3CA) mutation, PIK3CA amplification or mutation upstream in the PI3K pathway,&#xD;
      BKM120 activity will be evaluated in two parallel independent cohorts of patients: patients&#xD;
      presenting a PI3KCA mutation and patients without a PI3KCA mutation.&#xD;
