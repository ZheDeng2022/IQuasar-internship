      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a functional imaging technique that can be uses light&#xD;
      to study brain function while allowing for movement. To look at blood flow in the brain, NIRS&#xD;
      uses a low-power light source with detectors that see how the light changes as it passes&#xD;
      through brain tissue. Brain blood flow can indicate which parts of the brain are active&#xD;
      during different tasks. Researchers want to study children with attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and will use NIRS to&#xD;
      compare the blood flow in the brain of children with ADHD and ASD with that of typically&#xD;
      developing children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see how well NIRS can detect changes in brain blood flow during tests of thinking and&#xD;
           memory in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare blood flow in the brains of typically developing children and those with ADHD&#xD;
           or ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children between 4 and 8 years of age with ASD, ADHD, or children with no psychiatric&#xD;
      diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened for eligibility. Those who are taking stimulant medication&#xD;
           for ADHD or ASD will need to stop taking it for 3 days before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After participating in a screening assessment, all participants will have one study&#xD;
           visit. At this visit, they will have be asked to complete two tasks during a NIRS scan.&#xD;
           For both tasks, they will react to images on a computer screen. This visit will last&#xD;
           about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a testing study only. No blood or other samples will be needed for this study.&#xD;

      Objective: to test whether Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to monitor&#xD;
      cognitive brain function and detect markers for differentiation of Autism Spectrum Disorders&#xD;
      (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Children with ASD, ADHD, and typically developing children, all between 4&#xD;
      and 8 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study will investigate NIRS signal changes while children with ASD, ADHD, and&#xD;
      typically developing children perform well-known functional tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Graded changes in blood flow and oxygen, measured with NIRS, in response to&#xD;
      different functional tasks.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will be between 4 to 8 years of age (4 years, 0 months to 8 years, 11 months).&#xD;
        English speakers only will be recruited for the study, because the language measures/tests&#xD;
        and stimuli being used are in English and were developed and standardized on English-only&#xD;
        samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Typically Developing Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Development in nonverbal and verbal areas within age expectations (per scores onthe&#xD;
        Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of&#xD;
        Intelligence Fourth Edition , no more than 1.5 standard deviation below the mean)&#xD;
&#xD;
        ASD Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Diagnosis of Autistic Disorder, Asperger s disorder, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder -&#xD;
        Not Otherwise Specified (PDD NOS), based on diagnostic evaluation conducted through a&#xD;
        separate screening protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADHD Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
