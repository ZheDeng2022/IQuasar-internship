      The purpose of PREPARE trial is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of TRI versus&#xD;
      TFI for PCI in patients with left main (LM) and/or three-vessel coronary artery disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transradial intervention (TRI) has been widely practiced in China, accounting for approximate&#xD;
      80 to 90% of procedures. A recent meta-analysis indicated that TRI has advantages in reducing&#xD;
      major bleeding and ischemic events compared to transfemoral intervention (TFI) after the&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, no clinical trial has yet shown&#xD;
      statistical equivalence in terms of long-term efficacy of TRI compared with TFI for the&#xD;
      treatment of complex coronary lesions, which is simply due to limited numbers of subjects&#xD;
      enrolled. The purpose of PREPARE trial is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      TRI versus TFI for PCI in patients with left main (LM) and/or three-vessel coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

             appropriate IEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina,&#xD;
