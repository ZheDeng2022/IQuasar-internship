      The UKGPCS was set up to find genetic alterations which occur in patients who have prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A man's risk of developing prostate cancer increases if he has a first-degree relative&#xD;
      (father or brother) who was diagnosed with prostate cancer at a young age. This is why we are&#xD;
      looking for men who are affected at a young age or who have a family history of prostate&#xD;
      cancer, since it is more probable that these prostate cancers are due to an inherited genetic&#xD;
      cause rather than an environmental cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also ask all men who come to the Royal Marsden Hospital to be treated for prostate cancer&#xD;
      if they would like to take part in the study so that we can also look to see if we find&#xD;
      genetic alterations in older men, and those who do not have a family history of prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      The study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Study at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London and Sutton:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be offered to every patient attending the prostate clinics at The Royal&#xD;
           Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London and Sutton. This is called 'The Systematic Study'.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients are approached in the clinic and are given an information sheet and the study&#xD;
           is also explained verbally. They are asked for 18ml of blood and asked to fill out a&#xD;
           family history and epidemiological questionnaire. Those who have not had any treatment&#xD;
           will also be asked for 18ml blood for serum and plasma marker studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Those patients with one relative affected with PrCa where one is ≤ 65 years at diagnosis&#xD;
           or a total of 3 or more relatives with PrCa at any age, will be asked if their relatives&#xD;
           can be approached to be asked to give a blood sample for DNA analysis for PrCa&#xD;
           predisposition genes and tumour samples for molecular analyses for PrCa predisposition&#xD;
           and behaviour as outlined above. Where relatives with PrCa are deceased, pathology&#xD;
           records and tumour blocks will be requested after obtaining details of where they were&#xD;
           treated via the index case.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consent Consent will be sought prospectively from living individuals accrued into the&#xD;
           study from January 2006 to access medical records and tumour blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study has been active since 1992 and all blood samples have informed consent for&#xD;
           PrCa predisposition gene studies. Outside tumour blocks and pathological samples have&#xD;
           informed consent for molecular studies. Many of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust&#xD;
           PrCa tumour samples also have consent under a clause in the operation consent form in&#xD;
           use at that time that 'material removed may be used for research purposes'. Some tissue&#xD;
           was collected from local hospitals under the auspices of the previous protocol and the&#xD;
           consent form did not explicitly state separate consent for the use of tissue at that&#xD;
           time, although it was part of the approved protocol. Many patients are now deceased. It&#xD;
           is therefore proposed that tissue and medical record data collected retrospectively will&#xD;
           be analysed anonymously with no results fed back to patients as this would not impact&#xD;
           upon their care. An exception is results from the studies on blood where findings in&#xD;
           PrCa predisposition genes could have implications for relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Those patients who are still living who have previously taken part in the study from&#xD;
           1992 until the present and who have not taken part in the environmental questionnaire&#xD;
           part of the study will be invited to take part in this part of the study. New consent&#xD;
           will be obtained for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Study at Collaborative Centres throughout the UK. Many of these are via the NCRN&#xD;
           network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is conducted as for the Study at The Royal Marsden except the study is explained&#xD;
      verbally and then if the patient is interested, their details are given to the study office&#xD;
      by confidential fax and the study office sends the patient an information sheet and consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the only groups of patients eligible for this part of the study are (a) men with&#xD;
      PrCa presenting at a young age (≤ 60 years) or (b) PrCa in first-degree related pairs where&#xD;
      one is ≤ 65 years at diagnosis or (c) a total of 3 or more relatives with PrCa at any age&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two parts (1) and (2) are now called the UKGPCS (UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently over 300 collaborators UK-wide participating under the auspices of the&#xD;
      previous protocol (previously, The Cancer Research UK/British Prostate Group//British&#xD;
      Association of Urological Surgeons Section of Oncology and NCRN Familial Prostate Cancer&#xD;
      Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed analyses on the samples The samples will be used to find PrCa predisposition genes&#xD;
      using linkage and other analyses. These investigations are solely for research to find a&#xD;
      prostate cancer-predisposing gene and no results would be conveyed to the patients until such&#xD;
      a gene(s) had been found. If such a gene(s) is found, then no patient will have genetic&#xD;
      testing for abnormalities in such a gene without prior genetic counselling and this would be&#xD;
      on a newly taken blood sample. Only those patients who wish (as stated on their consent form)&#xD;
      to be informed of research findings will be contacted. If this occurs more than 6 months&#xD;
      after the last contact with the patient, this would be via the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be correlated with medical records and treatment outcome to find genetic&#xD;
      alterations that are associated with prostate cancer development and/or prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour material will be collected and stored at -70oC in freezer space currently available at&#xD;
      The Institute of Cancer Research. Tumour will also be stored in RNA later and paraffin&#xD;
      embedded tumour will be made into tissue microarrays and sections cut. This will be used for&#xD;
      molecular biology analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases and their relatives may be flagged by the cancer registry to confirm a diagnosis of&#xD;
      prostate cancer, a date of death and cause of death. This will be done via the Medical&#xD;
      Research Information Service (MRIS), using records maintained by The NHS Information Centre&#xD;
      and the NHS Central Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical details are collected routinely as part of the medical care and clinical follow up&#xD;
      record on patients with prostate cancer and these include disease parameters (e.g. stage,&#xD;
      grade) and treatment outcome (e.g. survival data, side effects of treatment). We will also&#xD;
      request follow-up data, approximately 2 years after the patient has consented, to record any&#xD;
      relapse, treatment and survival data that has occurred since diagnosis. We will link the&#xD;
      genetic findings with these clinical data to try to identify genetic markers of disease&#xD;
      parameters (e.g. those which predict for poorer prognosis or worse late toxicity from&#xD;
      treatments such as radiotherapy). These data would be analysed anonymously after linking the&#xD;
      clinical and genetic datasets. No results would be feedback to participants. We will supply&#xD;
      anonymised data from this to an EU dataset (Genepi study). This would only be to a central&#xD;
      database managed under the auspices of GCP and would only be anonymised data. No individual&#xD;
      would be identifiable to the holders of the Genepi database.&#xD;
