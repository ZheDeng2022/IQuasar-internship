  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two hospitals of the same geographic area. It will be included&#xD;
      children &lt;3-years-old with recurrent wheezing attacks, confirmed by the review of the medical&#xD;
      records, in the previous 12 months or a shorter time for those younger than one year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will included 120&#xD;
      children &lt;3 years old with ≥3 episodes of wheezing during the previous year. They will&#xD;
      receive active treatment or placebo for six months. The main outcome will be the number of&#xD;
      wheezing attacks during one year. Other outcomes were duration and severity of wheezing&#xD;
      attacks , symptom and medication scores, and use of health resources.&#xD;

    <measure>Symptom Score During Wheezing Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total of Symptom score during wheezing attacks. The patients were reviewed at our clinics every three months. These scores were recorded daily in a diary card by the parents, who were duly instructed.&#xD;
Scale use to evaluate symptom during wheezing attacks is called the Symptom scores (SS) scale. Minimum value is 0 (meant improvement) and maximum value (meant not improvement) is 3.&#xD;
The rating was: 0=absent (no sign/symptom evident); 1=mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but easily tolerated); 2=moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable) and 3=severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily life and/or sleeping). Fever was scored as number of days with temperature over 37ºC.&#xD;
The total symptom score was calculated as the sum of all individual scores during the wheezing attacks.</description>

    <description>Review of medication consumption during wheezing attacks. The patients were reviewed at our clinics every three months. Medication scores were recorded daily in a diary card by the parents, who were duly instructed.&#xD;
Medication was rated from 0 (minimum value) and the maximum value correspond to the maximum medication consumed per 24h. Rating was according to Dreborg et al. with slight modifications: two points were given for one tablet of 4 mg of Montelukast, for one puff of 50 μg budesonide-equivalent or for one dose of oral prednisolone, and 3 for the inhalation of one puff of 200 μg budesonide-equivalent. In the case of antibiotics and antipyretic/-anti-inflammatory drugs, the number of daily doses of these drugs was recorded.&#xD;

    <measure>Use of Health and Social Resources During the Whole Period of the Study.</measure>

    <description>The use of health and social resources during the study was also recorded: days of hospitalization in ward and/or intensive care unit, visits to the emergency units, unscheduled visits to the pediatrician and/or to the specialist, telephone calls to the pediatrician, complementary tests (chest radiogram, blood analysis, others), days of school absenteeism and caregiver-days when the children needed them. The data were obtained from the diary cards and confirmed through the review of medical records.&#xD;
Maximum value corresponds to the maximum days spent in health resources (specified above) and the minimum value corresponds to the minimum of days spent in health resources (specified above)</description>

Scale use to evaluate symptom during wheezing attacks is called the Symptom scores (SS) scale. Minimum value is 0 (meant improvement) and maximum value (meant not improvement) is 3.&#xD;
The rating was: 0=absent (no sign/symptom evident); 1=mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but easily tolerated); 2=moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable) and 3=severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily life and/or sleeping). Fever was scored as number of days with temperature over 37ºC.&#xD;

        <description>Review of medication consumption during wheezing attacks. The patients were reviewed at our clinics every three months. Medication scores were recorded daily in a diary card by the parents, who were duly instructed.&#xD;
Medication was rated from 0 (minimum value) and the maximum value correspond to the maximum medication consumed per 24h. Rating was according to Dreborg et al. with slight modifications: two points were given for one tablet of 4 mg of Montelukast, for one puff of 50 μg budesonide-equivalent or for one dose of oral prednisolone, and 3 for the inhalation of one puff of 200 μg budesonide-equivalent. In the case of antibiotics and antipyretic/-anti-inflammatory drugs, the number of daily doses of these drugs was recorded.&#xD;
The total symptom score was calculated as the sum of all individual scores during the wheezing attacks.</description>

          <title>Medication Score During WA</title>
          <description>Review of medication consumption during wheezing attacks. The patients were reviewed at our clinics every three months. Medication scores were recorded daily in a diary card by the parents, who were duly instructed.&#xD;
Medication was rated from 0 (minimum value) and the maximum value correspond to the maximum medication consumed per 24h. Rating was according to Dreborg et al. with slight modifications: two points were given for one tablet of 4 mg of Montelukast, for one puff of 50 μg budesonide-equivalent or for one dose of oral prednisolone, and 3 for the inhalation of one puff of 200 μg budesonide-equivalent. In the case of antibiotics and antipyretic/-anti-inflammatory drugs, the number of daily doses of these drugs was recorded.&#xD;
The total symptom score was calculated as the sum of all individual scores during the wheezing attacks.</description>

        <description>Review of symptoms during the whole study. The patients were reviewed at our clinics every three months. These scores were recorded daily in a diary card by the parents, who were duly instructed.&#xD;
Scale use to evaluate symptom during wheezing attacks is called the Symptom scores (SS) scale. Minimum value is 0 (meant improvement) and maximum value (meant not improvement) is 3.&#xD;
The rating was: 0=absent (no sign/symptom evident); 1=mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but easily tolerated); 2=moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable) and 3=severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily life and/or sleeping). Fever was scored as number of days with temperature over 37ºC.&#xD;
