      In 2012, infants having surgery for congenital heart disease have a high survival. The&#xD;
      investigators are now focused on improving how sick these infants become after surgery (short&#xD;
      term outcomes) and their later neurodevelopment (long term outcomes). During heart surgery,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB; the heart-lung machine) takes over heart function while the&#xD;
      surgeon repairs the heart disease. During this surgery there are periods of time when the&#xD;
      amount of blood going to the heart and brain is lower than usual, called &quot;ischemia&quot;. Once the&#xD;
      surgery is finished the blood going to the heart and brain is increased to normal again,&#xD;
      called &quot;reperfusion&quot;. This ischemia-reperfusion can cause injury to the heart, brain, and&#xD;
      other organs, affecting the short and long term outcomes in these infants. Adult studies have&#xD;
      shown that a short time of ischemia to the legs for 5-10 minutes [the legs are not damaged by&#xD;
      a short time of ischemia, unlike the heart or brain], before severe ischemia to another&#xD;
      distant vulnerable vital organ [like the heart or brain], can protect this other vital organ&#xD;
      from ischemia-reperfusion injury. This is called &quot;remote ischemic preconditioning&quot; (RIPC).&#xD;
      Our objective is to test whether RIPC before heart surgery can improve the recovery of the&#xD;
      heart and brain after heart surgery in newborn babies with congenital heart disease. The&#xD;
      investigators will test whether RIPC will result in lower peak lactate and troponin levels on&#xD;
      the day after heart surgery. Lactate levels are a marker for how much the different tissues&#xD;
      of the body suffer from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Troponin is released from damaged heart&#xD;
      during ischemia-reperfusion. In our trial infants will be randomized to RIPC or control. This&#xD;
      means each baby has an equal chance of being in one group or the other. The intervention&#xD;
      group will have RIPC before surgery; the &quot;control group&quot; will not. The investigators hope&#xD;
      this trial will lead to a larger study to test if RIPC results in fewer days on a breathing&#xD;
      machine after surgery, lower mortality, and higher scores on neurodevelopmental tests at 2&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ischemic Preconditioning (IPC) refers to the phenomenon where a brief ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      event to a tissue/organ can result in subsequent protection from a more severe&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion event to that tissue/organ. There are many descriptions of IPC in animal&#xD;
      models. Protection occurs in two phases: early after the IPC (&lt;4hr), and later after the IPC&#xD;
      (24-72hr). The protection is marked, with reduction in infarction sizes in brain and heart on&#xD;
      the order of 50% or more. The later phase provides protection against infarction (lethal&#xD;
      reperfusion injury) and stunning (post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction), while the early&#xD;
      phase provides protection against infarction only. The mechanisms of IPC have been divided&#xD;
      into 4 phases: preconditioning insult, stress sensors, signal transduction, and effectors of&#xD;
      protection. Remote Ischemic PreConditioning (RIPC) refers to the finding that a brief&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion event to a tissue/organ results in subsequent protection from a more&#xD;
      severe ischemia-reperfusion event to a different tissue/organ. This is advantageous because&#xD;
      the tissue subjected to the preconditioning stimulus can be more accessible and less&#xD;
      vulnerable than the target organ to be protected, such as the brain or heart. Animal studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated the efficacy of RIPC. The mechanisms and timing (early and late phases)&#xD;
      appear to be the same as for IPC. There are several adult human studies of IPC. Studies of&#xD;
      IPC in adults having coronary bypass surgery have found improvements in acute markers of&#xD;
      myocardial injury and hemodynamic function. A meta-analysis of 22 trials of IPC during&#xD;
      cardiac surgery in adults found a significant improvement in postoperative arrhythmias,&#xD;
      inotrope requirements, and intensive care unit stay in the IPC group. There are adult studies&#xD;
      showing that RIPC prevents ischemia-reperfusion injury. Currently, 3 large adult randomized&#xD;
      control trial (RCT) are underway investigating the effects of RIPC after cardiac surgery and&#xD;
      stroke. There are six studies of RIPC in children . In one study 37 children having cardiac&#xD;
      surgery were randomized to RIPC induced by lower limb ischemia with a blood pressure cuff.&#xD;
      The levels of troponin I and inotrope requirements were significantly greater in the control&#xD;
      group vs. the RIPC group. In another study infants having repair of ventricular septal defect&#xD;
      were randomized to receive RIPC 24 hr and 1 hr before CPB. The postoperative release of&#xD;
      cytokines and heart enzymes were attenuated, there was better lung and heart function, and no&#xD;
      adverse effects. A study in children with ventricular septal defect found that early RIPC and&#xD;
      post-conditioning were associated with lower levels of troponin I, creatinine kinase and&#xD;
      inotrope score post-operative. A recent RCT of children undergoing cardiac surgery found that&#xD;
      late RIPC was associated with lower N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide but no&#xD;
      difference in inflammatory markers or cardiac dysfunction. Similarly, a more recent small RCT&#xD;
      of RIPC did not find any difference in troponin I levels or other short term outcomes. The&#xD;
      largest RIPC pediatric RCT performed to date involved 113patients with the expectation that&#xD;
      RIPC would reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury. This study found only a trend towards&#xD;
      lower incidence of acute kidney injury in the RIPC group. The interpretation of most of these&#xD;
      studies is difficult due to the small samples, and multiple analyses and without prestated&#xD;
      primary or secondary outcomes. Recent reviews suggest studies be done with a larger sample&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Concerns in Children: In immature rodents, preconditioning with lipopolysaccharide,&#xD;
      or oxygen-glucose deprivation, results in worse brain injury on ischemia-reperfusion. This&#xD;
      raises the possibility of harm from IPC in neonates. This is very unlikely for the following&#xD;
      reasons. First, this data applies to neonates at &lt;32 weeks post-conception age. Second,&#xD;
      lipopolysaccharide protected the brain when given 4 hr and 24hr before the ischemic event.&#xD;
      Third, hypoxic preconditioning is protective to the immature brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety concerns: Based on the above discussion of potential concerns, and the studies&#xD;
      reviewed, we anticipate no adverse effects from RIPC. Discomfort during RIPC is mild and will&#xD;
      be treated with sedation if necessary. The dose of midazolam given for this purpose has been&#xD;
      shown to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Interference with Preconditioning: Animal studies have found that beta-blockers,&#xD;
      sulfonylurea, caffeine, aminophylline, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and naloxone&#xD;
      interfere with IPC. Patients on any of these drugs will be excluded. There are studies&#xD;
      showing that inhalational anesthetics are pharmacologic preconditioning agents. The mechanism&#xD;
      of action involves some of the same pathways as IPC. However, the response to IPC and&#xD;
      anesthetic preconditioning involve a substantial subset of genes unique to each&#xD;
      preconditioning stimulus. Studies of anesthetic preconditioning have found conflicting&#xD;
      results suggesting that anesthetic preconditioning, if it occurs, is likely to be enhanced by&#xD;
      IPC. Furthermore, in clinical studies with promising results discussed above, anesthetics&#xD;
      were used during the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: a) To demonstrate the feasibility of patient recruitment to a RIPC RCT at our&#xD;
      center; and b) determine the effect of RIPC on the early postoperative course of infants&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery. We aim to recruit 4 patients/month for a total of 50 patients in 1&#xD;
      year; this recruitment rate would make a larger trial feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a) the target patient recruitment will be feasible, and b)&#xD;
      RIPC will result in a 50% reduction in the peak lactate level on day 1 postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: We propose a pilot double blind randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by a computer based program to ensure allocation concealment. A&#xD;
      total of 50 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an RIPC stimulus or&#xD;
      control (sham-RIPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medications/interventions: The cardioplegia solution used, and the dose of&#xD;
      steroids given in the operating room will be standardized in order to minimize the&#xD;
      possibility of confounders. We will use Sevoflurane as an inhalation agent, and will record&#xD;
      the dose and duration in both study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables: To be sure the groups are comparable and that known risk factors are&#xD;
      equally distributed among both groups, we will record the following: demographic variables&#xD;
      (sex, gestational age, birth weight, weight at surgery, age at surgery, mother's years of&#xD;
      schooling, father's socioeconomic status); preoperative variables (cardiac diagnosis,&#xD;
      cyanosis preoperatively (oxygen saturation &lt;85%), single/biventricular heart physiology, days&#xD;
      on mechanical ventilation, inotrope score, lowest Pa02, highest lactate, and highest base&#xD;
      deficit); and intraoperative variables (lactate level and troponin I level before CPB,&#xD;
      duration of inhalational anesthetic, CPB time, aortic cross clamp time, DHCA use, DHCA&#xD;
      duration, and re-CPB in the operating room).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: When the patient is admitted at the Stollery Children's Hospital and the&#xD;
      necessity of heart surgery with CPB is established, patients will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility. Written informed consent will be asked. After consent, patient demographics and&#xD;
      baseline variables will be recorded. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to the intervention group or the control group. Randomization will be done by a&#xD;
      computer based program at the Epidemiology Coordinating and Research Centre (EPICORE) to&#xD;
      facilitate the procedure and to ensure allocation concealment. As a patient qualifies for the&#xD;
      trial, a study number and a randomization number will be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visit: A follow up visit will be scheduled at age 2 years. During the follow-up&#xD;
      visit a certified pediatric psychologist and, who will be unaware if the patients was&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention or the control group, will assess the neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcome of the subject at the tertiary site of origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking: This is a double blind study. The research nurse will cover the lower body of the&#xD;
      subject with a drape, so that whether the cuff is being inflated around or underneath the leg&#xD;
      is not known by others. The only people that will know the patient allocation will be at&#xD;
      EPICOR and the research nurse performing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Withdrawal: A patient may be withdrawn from the study if an intolerable adverse event&#xD;
      thought to be related to the RIPC occurs, if the patient's parent(s) wish their child to be&#xD;
      withdrawn, or if the clinicians caring for the patient or the site investigator believe it is&#xD;
      in the best interests of the patient to withdraw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification: The primary outcome used to determine sample size for a future&#xD;
      larger RCT is the Bayley III cognitive composite score 2 years post-operatively. The minimal&#xD;
      clinically important difference for the Bayley III cognitive score is half a SD. This is a&#xD;
      medium effect size usually considered to indicate different classes of patient outcome. The&#xD;
      Boston Circulatory Arrest trial was designed to detect a difference of half a standard&#xD;
      deviation in intelligence quotient, and considered the detected 6.5 point deficit in&#xD;
      Psychomotor Development Index of the Bayley (43% of a SD) clinically significant. Our data&#xD;
      from the CPTP shows a mean Bayley III cognitive score of 91 with SD 16. To detect an 8 (half&#xD;
      a SD) point increase in the mean cognitive score at 2 years with an alpha of 0.05 and a power&#xD;
      of 0.8, we need 63 patients per group. In the CPTP cohort studies, loss to follow up has been&#xD;
      &lt;2% at 2 years, and exclusion criteria were met by about 5% of eligible neonates in 2009.&#xD;
      Loss to follow up is unlikely in these patients because they need frequent follow up visits&#xD;
      with the pediatric cardiologist and pediatricians. To account for loss to follow up and early&#xD;
      withdrawal from the study we plan to enroll a total of 140 patients (70 patients in each&#xD;
      group) in the future study. The Stollery Children's Hospital is the referral center for&#xD;
      pediatric cardiac surgery in Western Canada, all the neonates having heart surgery are&#xD;
      transferred to the Stollery preoperatively. The enrollment of 50 patients in 1 year in the&#xD;
      pilot study would determine that recruitment of 140 patients in 3 years is feasible.&#xD;
      Furthermore, based on data from our center (mean peak lactate level 4.6, SD 2.4) a sample&#xD;
      size of 50 patients will allow us to detect a 50% reduction in peak lactate level on day 1&#xD;
      post-operative with an alpha (two sided) of 0.05 and 0.9 power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Demographic and baseline characteristics will be analyzed by&#xD;
      descriptive methods. We will analyze all outcome variables on intention to treat basis. The&#xD;
      primary efficacy analysis will compare the mean peak lactate level at day 1 post-operatively&#xD;
      between the RIPC group and the control group using student-t test. The purpose of the pilot&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety and feasibility of conducting the study and as such the data&#xD;
      (except the peak lactate level at day 1) will be analyzed with descriptive methods and not&#xD;
      used for statistical inferential purposes. Analysis will be done only for the purposes of&#xD;
      sample size calculation for the future larger RCT and to establish trends. All statistical&#xD;
      tests will be two-sided with 0.05 level of significance. Data will be analyzed with Stata&#xD;
      (version 10.0, Statacorp, Texas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: All variables will be recorded on paper case report forms by the research&#xD;
      nurse. Upon completion, the data will be transferred to an anonymized computer database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary: we plan to study a promising, easy, low cost and simple method (RIPC) with great&#xD;
      therapeutic potential to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury in infants with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
