  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, diabetic nephropathy, which may lead to dialysis treatment, is the most&#xD;
      prevalent underlying disease of people in developed countries. A wide range of studies have&#xD;
      been carried out, from various points of view, to understand the progress of renal&#xD;
      dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is a primary regulator of renal phosphate excretion.&#xD;
      FGF23 is inversely associated with the GFR, a relationship underlying a fundamental mechanism&#xD;
      for maintaining serum phosphate constancy during CKD progression. Such an adaptation may have&#xD;
      deleterious trade-offs because, independently of serum phosphate, high FGF23 signals a high&#xD;
      risk of death in ESRD patients. Some studies showed that there is relationship between FGF-23&#xD;
      levels and proteinuria in CKD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data about the effects of calcium channel blocker on FGF23 levels in diabetic&#xD;
      patients with proteinuria. The aim of this study was to find out whether the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of calcium channel blocker in diabetic proteinuria has any relation with the&#xD;
      alteration of FGF-23 levels. The investigators searched for the effects of calcium channel&#xD;
      blocker amlodipine on the clinical and laboratory parameters of diabetic patients with&#xD;
      proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators registered the study 'The effect of renin angiotensin system Blockage&#xD;
      (RAS), calcium channel blocker and combined drugs on TWEAK, PTX3 and FMD levels in Diabetic&#xD;
      Proteinuric Patients with Hypertension' (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT00921570). The&#xD;
      investigators will use the samples of the some patients for this study. The investigators&#xD;
      also registered the study 'FGF-23 and Endothelial Dysfunction in Diabetic Proteinuric&#xD;
      Patients' (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01703234). The investigators will combine these&#xD;
      two registered studies (NCT00921570 and NCT01703234) in one study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who were non-obese (BMI&lt;30kg/m2), non dyslipidemic (total cholesterol &lt;200mg/dl,&#xD;
      Triglyceride&lt;150mg/dl), and free of cardiovascular events (negative medical history, negative&#xD;
      ECG findings) were investigated for enrollment. CKD stage 1 patients older than 18 years of&#xD;
      age and willing to participate to the study were screened. From the 231 patients with&#xD;
      established type 2 diabetes mellitus, 126 had proteinuria and/or hypertension (24 h protein&#xD;
      excretion 1-2 g/day, systolic blood pressures ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressures ≥ 90&#xD;
      mmHg, respectively). All cases were first referrals and at the time of the study all were off&#xD;
      treatment. Patients with history of coronary artery disease, smokers and those taking statins&#xD;
      or renin-angiotensin blockers were excluded because of the effect of these factors on&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. Of 61 screened patients 32 met the study criteria and were included&#xD;
      in this study. The duration of proteinuria and diabetic nephropathy after initial diagnosis&#xD;
      was not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were as follows: A)Nephrotic syndrome, B)coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (patients with ischemic ST-T alterations and voltage criteria for LVH on electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      and with history of revascularization or myocardial infarction), C) elevated liver enzymes&#xD;
      (AST or ALT levels ≥ 40U/L) and D) renal failure (serum creatinine levels &gt; 1.3 mg/dl). In&#xD;
      order to evaluate the effect of calcium channel blocker on serum FGF-23 concentrations,&#xD;
      patients with proteinuria were given an calcium channel blocker (Amlodipine 10 mg/day) for 12&#xD;
      weeks. The effect of calcium channel blocker on insulin sensitivity and proteinuria was also&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention period, blood samples were obtained for assay of plasma PTX3&#xD;
      concentrations, HbA1c , and insulin resistance scores (HOMA-IR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples were also collected over a 24-hour period to determine the degree of&#xD;
      proteinuria.&#xD;
