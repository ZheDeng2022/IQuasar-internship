      The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of an autologous DC&#xD;
      immunotherapy in patients with AML of non-favorable risk profile.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients ≥ 18 years of either gender with AML of non-favorable risk profile in CR or CRi not&#xD;
      being eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation will receive as intradermal&#xD;
      injections at two different sites up to ten immunotherapies with autologous DCs presenting&#xD;
      two leukemia-associated antigens and one CMV antigen conserved in cryomedium over a time span&#xD;
      of 26 weeks. Phase I will test the safety and toxicity in a small group of patients (n=6).&#xD;
      After at least four vaccinations of three patients, the safety and toxicity data will be&#xD;
      presented to the Data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Only after the DSMB has no objectives&#xD;
      against the continuation of the trial, further patients will be included into the trial.&#xD;
      Again, after three more patients, receiving a minimum of four vaccines, clinical data will be&#xD;
      presented to the DSMB, and phase I will be terminated. The decision for continuation of the&#xD;
      trial will be done by the DSMB. If there are no objectives by the DSMB, the trial will&#xD;
      continue and evaluation will be started in a larger group of patients (n=14). During the&#xD;
      phase II trial, safety and toxicity will be evaluated in a larger co-hort of patients).&#xD;
      Besides, preliminary assessment of efficacy will be performed including induction of&#xD;
      immunological responses to leukemia associated antigens as well as to a viral antigen (CMV),&#xD;
      MRD control, time to progression of disease and ECOG performance status.&#xD;
