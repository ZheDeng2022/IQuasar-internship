      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myositis is a rare disease in which the body s immune cells attack the muscle tissue. It&#xD;
           can cause muscle weakness, swelling, and pain. It can develop in people with no history&#xD;
           of muscle problems. Environmental exposures may determine who develops myositis. Genes&#xD;
           may also affect development of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some people who serve in the military develop myositis. However, other military&#xD;
           personnel do not. Researchers want to compare military personnel with and without&#xD;
           myositis. They will look for common factors that might have led to the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study environmental risk factors for myositis in military personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Military personnel who developed myositis during their period of service.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy military personnel who do not have myositis or another autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill out forms about environmental exposures, particularly while in&#xD;
           the military. The questions will ask about past infections, vaccines and medications,&#xD;
           and personal habits. They will also ask about participants occupations during military&#xD;
           service and their deployments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also provide blood samples for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Myositis, an autoimmune muscle disease, likely develops as a result of environmental&#xD;
      exposures in genetically susceptible persons. Preliminary data suggest a trend for an&#xD;
      increasing incidence in myositis in military personnel over the last decade for unknown&#xD;
      reasons. Although a few environmental exposures have been preliminarily associated with&#xD;
      myositis in the civilian population, these have not been confirmed. In addition, no study has&#xD;
      assessed exposures that might result in the development of myositis in military personnel.&#xD;
      Military personnel experience a number of intense, unique exposures, often over a relatively&#xD;
      short interval, which include different stresses, novel vaccines, distinct occupational&#xD;
      exposures, battlefield injuries and unique chemicals during field deployment, that differ&#xD;
      from those exposures in non-military populations. Therefore, we propose a protocol that&#xD;
      consists of three complementary approaches to attempt to determine the environmental factors&#xD;
      associated with the development of myositis in active duty military personnel and an initial&#xD;
      understanding of the possible mechanisms involved. In the first approach, we will assess risk&#xD;
      factors in a case-control study of 300 patients who developed myositis while on active duty&#xD;
      by comparing them to 1500 active duty military personnel (randomly selected, but matched 5:1&#xD;
      by gender, race, and age and military service within 10 years) who have not been diagnosed&#xD;
      with an autoimmune disease or chronic muscle disease. For this first approach, we will&#xD;
      analyze existing military databases for information on medications, vaccines, infections,&#xD;
      co-existing medical conditions, military occupations, deployments, and worldwide active duty&#xD;
      locations. In the second case-control approach, we will attempt to define environmental&#xD;
      factors associated with the development of myositis that developed in military personnel&#xD;
      (n=150) by comparing them to 150 similarly matched military personnel who have not been&#xD;
      diagnosed with an autoimmune disease or chronic muscle disease. This second approach will&#xD;
      differ from the first approach, in that subjects will be prospectively enrolled and assessed&#xD;
      during a single clinic visit to confirm diagnoses and examine patient questionnaires on&#xD;
      focused environmental exposures, including those not captured in the military databases. A&#xD;
      third laboratory approach will identify, in an exploratory study, the global DNA methylation&#xD;
      epigenetic changes, microRNA and mRNA profiles in peripheral blood and muscle tissues from 18&#xD;
      subjects (six PM and six DM compared to six non-myositis controls enrolled in the second&#xD;
      approach) and assess the effects of selected environmental exposures on these parameters.&#xD;
      These complementary approaches should enhance the understanding of environmental factors and&#xD;
      possible mechanisms associated with the development of myositis in the military, and provide&#xD;
      insights into environmental risk factors that may also be relevant to the development of&#xD;
      myositis in non-military populations.&#xD;

&#xD;
        For Aim 1 of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for myositis subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Diagnosis of PM, DM or IBM during military service. Subjects may be active duty or no&#xD;
        longer active duty personnel. A matrix diagnosis of myositis will be based on ICD-9 and&#xD;
        ICD-10 codes, laboratory tests and medical records in an attempt to match criteria for&#xD;
        probable or definite PM, DM or IBM&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for matched control subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -The same gender, race, age within 10 years, and service in the military within 10 years as&#xD;
        the myositis subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The exclusion criteria for control subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -A matrix diagnosis of autoimmune or chronic muscle disease based on ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes&#xD;
        and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Aims 2 and 3 of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for enrollment of myositis subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;

             civilian working for the military, based on criteria for probable or definite PM or&#xD;
             DM, or clinically or pathologically defined or possible IBM. Subjects may be active&#xD;
             duty or no longer active duty personnel. Military contractors or civilians working for&#xD;
             the military include those with at least 1 year of collective service on a military&#xD;
             base or who actively deployed with military units after October 1998 and developed&#xD;
             myositis will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to give informed consent, to complete the questionnaires and to&#xD;
             donate blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for matched controls are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with military experience or having served as a military contractor or civilian&#xD;
             working for the military attending the same clinic or hospital as the myositis subject&#xD;
             to which they are matched, or if not available, volunteers from the general community&#xD;
             (such as other participating military or VA hospitals, private HCPs, or the NIH&#xD;
             Healthy volunteer program), gender- race- and age- (within 10 years) and military&#xD;
             service period (within 10 years) matched to the myositis subject. Military contractors&#xD;
             include those with at least 1 year of collective service on a military base or who&#xD;
             actively deployed with military units after October 1998.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Controls should be without a recognized autoimmune or chronic muscle disease, able and&#xD;
             willing to give informed consent, to complete the questionnaires and to donate blood&#xD;
             samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The exclusion criteria for all protocol subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical illness that in the judgment of the investigators does not allow safe blood&#xD;
             draws or other clinical evaluations needed for study participation.&#xD;

&#xD;
        There are no gender or ethnic restrictions to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV is not an exclusion for this study for the two following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It has no impact on study procedures or tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV may be one of the viral risk factors we are investigating.&#xD;
