  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, bioavailability, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      an organic yeast-selenium compound in reducing brain oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in&#xD;
      the brain has been linked to a variety oif disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Selenium&#xD;
      is a very powerful antioxidant that could prove useful in reducing the harmful effects of&#xD;
      oxidative stress in the brain and may help prevent diseases such as Alzheimer's. Our recent&#xD;
      work has demonstrated that the specific type of selenium compound greatly influences it's&#xD;
      ability to enhance brain health and prevent Alzheimer changes in mouse models of this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 24 participants and will allow us to test the hypotheses that&#xD;
      yeast-selenium supplementation is safe in the elderly, and that our specific formulation&#xD;
      reduces brain oxidative stress.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Placebo-controlled, single-center, multiple ascending dose study. Approximately 8 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be enrolled into 3 sequential cohorts, for a total of 24 enrolled subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be treated with study drug or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects will be seen&#xD;
      in the clinic for the following visits: Screening, Baseline (Day 1), Day 2, Day 4, Day 7&#xD;
      (Week 1), Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8,and Week 12 while on study drug. An additional&#xD;
      safety visit at Week 14 (two weeks after study drug discontinuation) will be required of&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo blood draws, urine collection, assessment of vital signs, and review of&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) as well as changes in concomitant&#xD;
      medical conditions and medications at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine medical examinations will be performed at study screening and enrollment, Week 1,&#xD;
      Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 14 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be performed on all subjects at Screening to ensure safety of lumbar puncture.&#xD;
      Research procedures will also include lumbar puncture at the Screening and Week 12 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A designated Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate safety in the subjects who&#xD;
      have been enrolled and completed a cohort before escalating to the next cohort. The DSMB will&#xD;
      review safety data (i.e. any AE or SAE) through Week 14. The committee may also request to&#xD;
      review additional data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DSMB will also be convened in the event of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) to determine&#xD;
      whether stopping rules for accrual have been met.&#xD;
