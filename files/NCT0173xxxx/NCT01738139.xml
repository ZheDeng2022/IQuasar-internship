  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab and imatinib mesylate&#xD;
      in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body or cannot&#xD;
      be removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving ipilimumab and imatinib mesylate may work better&#xD;
      in treating patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of intravenous ipilimumab (Yervoy)&#xD;
      administered in combination with oral imatinib mesylate (GLEEVEC) for patients with advanced&#xD;
      malignancies that are refractory to standard therapy, relapsed after standard therapy, or&#xD;
      have no available standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum toxic dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of&#xD;
      ipilimumab and imatinib mesylate combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine antitumor activity of ipilimumab and imatinib mesylate combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine antitumor activity of ipilimumab and imatinib mesylate combination therapy&#xD;
      in KIT confirmed solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the potential predictive role of tumor-associated immune biomarkers for&#xD;
      therapy effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the potential predictive role of therapy associated toxicities with antitumor&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 and imatinib&#xD;
      mesylated orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

             includes an exception of patients with metastatic GIST tumors who are taking&#xD;
             maintenance imatinib mesylate therapy. These patients are allowed to remain on&#xD;

          -  Patients MUST have recovered from all treatment related toxicities to grade 1 National&#xD;
             Center Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version&#xD;
             [v] 4.0) in severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to review, understand, and provide written consent&#xD;
             before starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma, gliosarcoma or&#xD;
             anaplastic astrocytoma will be eligible. Patients must have shown unequivocal&#xD;
             radiographic evidence for tumor progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.&#xD;
             A scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dose&#xD;
             that has been stable for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the&#xD;
             date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in the expansion cohort must also agree to participate in the biomarker&#xD;
             study. However, patients in the melanoma KIT positive mutant subgroup, patients must&#xD;
             agree to participate in the biomarker study and biopsies.&#xD;

          -  Patients must be willing to stay within 2 hours drive of MD Anderson Cancer Center&#xD;
             whilst receiving Ipilimumab therapy. Patient must also agree to present to MD Anderson&#xD;

             the management of cancers other than intracranial glioblastoma, gliosarcoma or&#xD;
             anaplastic astrocytoma, or when used to treat non-cancer-related illnesses).&#xD;
&#xD;

             therapy.&#xD;
