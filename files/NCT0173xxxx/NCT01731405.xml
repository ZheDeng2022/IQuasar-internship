      The purpose of this study is to determine the potential efficacy of three revised Medication&#xD;
      Guide layouts to increase consumers' comprehension&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      'Medication Guides' (Med Guides) are industry-developed documents that have been required by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be issued to consumers for prescription medications&#xD;
      that have been viewed to possess &quot;serious and significant public health concerns&quot; since&#xD;
      1998.1,2 These materials for consumers are intended to 1) provide specific dosing&#xD;
      administration instructions that could prevent serious adverse effects associated with taking&#xD;
      the medication, 2) warn individuals about significant health risks that could affect one's&#xD;
      decision to take the medication, or 3) underscore the importance of taking the prescribed&#xD;
      medication to the patient's health, and the need for proper adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite their potential value in communicating safe and appropriate medication use, problems&#xD;
      are clearly evident with the current template for Med Guides. Research conducted by this team&#xD;
      in 2006 showed that the majority, if not all Med Guides dispensed with prescribed medicines&#xD;
      are too complex and written at a reading grade level not suitable for the majority of&#xD;
      patients to comprehend. As a result, these materials are usually ignored by consumers.3&#xD;
      Further research by this team investigating consumers' ability to process and correctly&#xD;
      understand content contained in existing Med Guides found that, across all literacy levels,&#xD;
      current Med Guides are poorly understood and ineffective in conveying safety information.&#xD;
      Patients with low literacy comprehended significantly less, proving yet again that industry&#xD;
      standards must be applied to improve these documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear that the current guidance for Medication Guide development is insufficient, and&#xD;
      the FDA is working to change that. Both the FDA and this research team have proposed multiple&#xD;
      new Medication Guide formats, most of which are one-page cover sheets that highlight the most&#xD;
      important information of the medication. To examine these new prototypes, this research team&#xD;
      conducted six focus groups to obtain consumer-based feedback, and then evaluated three of the&#xD;
      prototypes in an eye tracking study. Using the collective data from these two consumer-based&#xD;
      studies, the investigators have further developed patient-centered and evidence-based Med&#xD;
      Guide prototypes that will be more user-friendly, clear, usable, and low literacy&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cross-sectional, controlled trial, the investigators will investigate consumers' ability&#xD;
      to process and correctly understand content contained in each of these top three new,&#xD;
      redesigned prototypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to better understand how well people with varying levels of&#xD;
      literacy understand information contained in three newly designed Med Guides. Through an&#xD;
      in-person interview, the investigators aim to test consumers' ability to comprehend&#xD;
      information contained in the guides by asking them retrieval and inference questions over the&#xD;
      guides' content. This will allow us to compare the three formats against each other to see&#xD;
      which prototype is most efficient in conveying the important information it is intended to&#xD;
      convey. The investigators will recruit a total of 600 participants from general internal&#xD;
      medicine clinics here in Chicago (Northwestern clinic = 300 participants and University of&#xD;
      Illinois Chicago = 300 participants. A UIC RA will be responsible for this recruitment and&#xD;
      will submit their own IRB for review).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will field test our enhanced prototypes and allow us to compare them to each&#xD;
      other, showing which format is best understood, especially in participants with low literacy.&#xD;

  <arm_group>

    <description>All patients will see all 3 different formats of the Medication Guide prototypes. They will also see information for the same drugs, in the same order - Ritalin, Morphine Sulfate, and Aranesp. All participants see all the formats, the only thing that changes by participant is which format is in each medication. There will be 6 different randomized orders - A,B,C; A,C,B; B,C,A; B,A,C; C,A,B; C,B,A. So for example, A,B,C participants would see Ritalin in format A, Morphine Sulfate in format B, and Aranesp in format C.</description>
