      Pulse oximetry is a standard non-invasive method of measuring blood oxygen saturation (SpO2).&#xD;
      In developing countries, pulse oximeters are rare because of expense and electricity&#xD;
      requirements. Our ECEM group has developed the Phone Oximeter, which uses a cell phone&#xD;
      (widely available in developing countries) to compute and analyze information from a pulse&#xD;
      oximeter sensor. To further reduce costs, we use the integrated flashlight of a cell phone's&#xD;
      camera to extract SpO2 (Camera Oximeter), eliminating the need for external hardware. This&#xD;
      study aims to calibrate the Camera Oximeter by exposing 30 healthy adult volunteers to&#xD;
      various altitudes in UBC's hypoxia chamber.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We at the Electrical and Computer Engineering in Medicine Group (ECEM) at the University of&#xD;
      British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, plan to make pulse oximetry available to resource poor&#xD;
      countries by designing a low-cost, battery-powered pulse oximeter device. We have developed&#xD;
      the Phone Oximeter, which uses a mobile phone to compute and analyze the information received&#xD;
      from a pulse oximeter sensor. The use of mobile phones as patient monitors is appealing as&#xD;
      they are widely available in many developing countries. Utilizing battery power, mobile&#xD;
      phones do not rely on a continuous source of electricity. This is essential, as most&#xD;
      low-resource settings lack adequate infrastructure and thus cannot provide the uninterrupted&#xD;
      power supply required for conventional patient monitoring. Furthermore, a mobile phone has&#xD;
      the efficiency, integrated display, and processing power required to analyze and store the&#xD;
      data derived from the pulse oximeter sensors. Data from the pulse oximeter can be transmitted&#xD;
      to referral centers for diagnostic and advisory purposes where cellular and networking&#xD;
      services permit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the ECEM Phone Oximeter software runs on smartphones and receives input from an&#xD;
      external proprietary oximeter sensor which is relatively expensive ($300 US). To further&#xD;
      reduce cost and increase ubiquity of oximeters, we are developing two novel pulse oximeter&#xD;
      systems for mobile phones that will be more integrated: the Audio Oximeter (AudioOx) and the&#xD;
      Camera Oximeter. This study aims at calibrating the Camera Oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Camera Oximeter uses the camera of a mobile phone as a photo detector. Illumination of&#xD;
      the finger is provided through the integrated flash light. This allows completely eliminating&#xD;
      external hardware, which allows the camera phone to become a standalone vital sign recording&#xD;
      device at minimal cost (no additional cost other than the phone and the software). This&#xD;
      principle has been applied in many mobile phone software applications available in various&#xD;
      software repositories to measure the HR of the user. Preliminary research has shown that the&#xD;
      extraction of SpO2 from a video recorded with a mobile phone is also possible. We have&#xD;
      further extended this approach and want to calibrate and validate a software implementation&#xD;
      of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that this study will allow us to successfully calibrate the Camera Oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the safety of the patient, the development of any new pulse oximeter equipment requires&#xD;
      calibration and evaluation for accuracy. This is required to ensure that the pulse oximeter&#xD;
      device is functional. Results of accuracy evaluations have to be reported so the clinician is&#xD;
      informed and he/she can understand the limits of the device that he/she is using. The&#xD;
      International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and a technical committee have created&#xD;
      standards that regulate the calibration and accuracy evaluation procedures of pulse&#xD;
      oximeters. These standards are enforced by regulatory bodies, such as the federal drug&#xD;
      administration (FDA), to approve the medical device for its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse Oximeter Theory and Calibration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying principle of pulse oximeters is the Beer-Lambert law which stipulates that&#xD;
      light intensity diminishes exponentially when traveling in an absorbing medium. Oxygenated&#xD;
      (O2Hb) and de-oxygenated (Hb) hemoglobin have different extinction coefficients for different&#xD;
      wavelengths and are the most important light absorbers in blood. In some wavelength ranges,&#xD;
      Hb is more absorbent than O2Hb, and in others the absorption property is inverted. These&#xD;
      regions are separated by isosbestic points. With each pulse, the volume of blood in the&#xD;
      vessels and the optical path length increase, and therefore, the total absorbance also&#xD;
      increases. As a result, the variation of volume can be registered as a variation of&#xD;
      transmitted light intensity and recorded with a photodetector. This produces the PPG&#xD;
      waveform. The difference in total absorbance at two distinct wavelengths allows the&#xD;
      calculation of a modulation ratio R. The theoretical relationship between R and SaO2 can be&#xD;
      described as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SaO2 = (εHb(λ1) - εHb(λ2) x R) / (εHb(λ1) - εO2Hb(λ1) + (εO2Hb(λ2) - εHb(λ2)) x R)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Beer-Lambert law ignores scattering of light. Various other design aspects of individual&#xD;
      oximeters (e.g. photodetector quantum efficiency, probe type) are not taken into account in&#xD;
      the theoretical equation. To account for these effects, the relationship between R and SaO2&#xD;
      has to be determined empirically using calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calibration of pulse oximeters for use on human subjects is regulated by ISO 80601-2-61.&#xD;
      This standards document defines minimal requirements for devices, provides classification&#xD;
      methods for systems, instructions how to measure accuracy of SpO2 and HR, and lists possible&#xD;
      fault conditions. The standards document also provides informative recommendations on how to&#xD;
      measure accuracy (Annex CC), standards for calibration (Annex DD), and guidelines for&#xD;
      evaluating and documenting SpO2 accuracy in human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard tool for calibrating pulse oximeters. According to the ISO pulse&#xD;
      oximetry standard document, &quot;there is today no accepted method of verifying the correct&#xD;
      calibration of a pulse oximeter probe/pulse oximeter monitor combination other than testing&#xD;
      on human beings. This is due to the complexity of the optical intricacies of the interaction&#xD;
      of light and human tissue upon which pulse oximetry depends&quot;. In-vitro calibration device&#xD;
      prototypes using whole blood have been suggested in various research projects, but these&#xD;
      systems are, to-date, not commercially available and very expensive to build and operate.&#xD;
      They have not been accepted as standard tools for calibration because of their lack of&#xD;
      simulating tissue interaction with pulse oximeter light. It is therefore necessary to&#xD;
      calibrate pulse oximeters on human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For calibration and accuracy evaluation of SpO2 measurements, the ISO accepts two methods of&#xD;
      testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive testing: The SpO2 readings of the test pulse oximeter are compared to values of&#xD;
      arterial blood oxygen saturations (SaO2) measured with a &quot;gold standard&quot; blood gas analysis&#xD;
      using a CO-oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive testing: The SpO2 readings of the test pulse oximeter are compared to values&#xD;
      from a secondary standard pulse oximeter, which can be used as a transfer standard because&#xD;
      its calibration is directly traceable to a blood gas analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests can be conducted on healthy volunteers who consent to induced hypoxemia or&#xD;
      patients from whom arterial blood samples/reference pulse oximeter readings are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to calibrate the Camera Oximeter. We will also evaluate the accuracy&#xD;
      and reliability of the calibration to measure SpO2, respiratory rate, and heart rate&#xD;
      measurements. Measurements produced by two secondary standard pulse oximeters and a&#xD;
      capnometer (CO2 breath analyzer) will be used as reference monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a non-invasive testing on healthy subjects using two secondary standard,&#xD;
      clinically approved pulse oximeters. The approved oximeters will provide the reference&#xD;
      measurements for both SpO2 and HR. This is the least invasive approach that is recommended by&#xD;
      the ISO standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be put into a hypoxic state by exposing them to normobaric (sea-level&#xD;
      atmospheric pressure) hypoxia (low oxygen) by administrating an air mix containing a reduced&#xD;
      O2 concentration. This is achieved in a hypoxia chamber where O2 concentration is gradually&#xD;
      reduced to simulate high altitude (around 4500 m).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the current study are very similar to another study conducted in the hypoxia&#xD;
      chamber (REB ID#H12-02365, Calibration and evaluation of an Audio Pulse Oximeter Sensor&#xD;
      (AudioOx) at ascent and descent from simulated altitude), the same methodology is applied.&#xD;
      This will allow recruiting subjects for both studies and will reduce the total number of&#xD;
      subjects necessary for achieving our goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibration of SpO2 Data from the initial set of subjects (at least 10) in the study will be&#xD;
      used to calibrate the Camera Oximeter oximetry data. Firstly, the red and infra-red (IR)&#xD;
      light signals from oximeter sensors are used to calculate ratio R, where&#xD;
&#xD;
      R = ( ACRED / DCRED ) / ( ACIR / DCIR )&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACRED and ACIR are pulsatile components of the red and infra-red light detected by the&#xD;
      oximeter photo detector. DCRED and DCIR are constant components of the red and infra-red&#xD;
      light detected by the oximeter photo detector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      R values are paired to SpO2 readings from the reference oximeter taken at the same time.&#xD;
      Linear regression on a second order polynomial equation is then used to estimate the&#xD;
      calibration parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of SpO2 Readings from later subjects (at least 10) will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      accuracy and validity of the SpO2 measurements from both novel oximeters. Paired readings&#xD;
      from the test oximeters and the reference oximeter are grouped into six ranges (70-75%,&#xD;
      76-80%, 81-85%, 86-90%, 91-95% and 96-100%). Mean bias, precision and accuracy will be&#xD;
      calculated as per ISO definitions for each group of SpO2 ranges and the overall range&#xD;
      (70-100%) [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local bias, b, is the difference between the expectation of the test results (SpO2) and an&#xD;
      accepted reference value (SR). For pulse oximetry, this is, at a given value of the reference&#xD;
      SpO2, the difference between the y-value of the regression line at that coordinate and the&#xD;
      y-value of the line of identity, in a plot of SpO2 versus SR, or given by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local bias, bi = SpO2 fit,i - SRi&#xD;
&#xD;
      where SpO2 fit,i is the value of the curve fitted to the test data at the ith reference SpO2&#xD;
      value, SRi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean bias, B, is mean difference between the test and reference values, preserving sign&#xD;
      (average of all local bias values):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean bias, B = (∑i=1 to n (bi))/n&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precision is the closeness of agreement between independent test results obtained under&#xD;
      stipulated conditions, defined as the standard deviation of the residuals (Sres), given by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precision, Sres = √(∑i=1 to n (SpO2i - SpO2fit,i)^2 )/(n-2))&#xD;
&#xD;
      where n is the number of data pairs in the sample within the range of interest; (SpO2,i -&#xD;
      SpO2 fit,i) is the difference between the ith SpO2 datum and the value of the fitted curve&#xD;
      corresponding to the ith reference SpO2 value, SRi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy of the pulse oximeter shall be stated in terms of the root-mean-square (rms)&#xD;
      difference between measured values (SpO2,i) and reference values (SRi), as given by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy = √((∑i=1 to n(SpO2i- SRi)^2 )/n)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To express ACCURACY relative to the &quot;gold-standard&quot; blood gas analysis, the error of the&#xD;
      secondary standard pulse oximeter (errorref) has to be included, thereby:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracycorrected = √Arms^2 + error(ref)^2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of HR Readings from later subjects (at least 10) will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      accuracy and validity of HR measurements from the novel oximeter. Paired HR readings from the&#xD;
      test oximeter and the reference oximeters are grouped into four ranges (40-65, 66-90, 91-115,&#xD;
      and 116-140 beats per minute (bpm)). Mean bias, precision and accuracy are calculated as per&#xD;
      ISO definitions for each group of HR ranges and the overall range (40-140 bpm), as detailed&#xD;
      previously for SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Respiratory Rate Readings from later subjects (at least 10) will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the accuracy and validity of respiratory rate measurements extracted from the&#xD;
      plethysmogram that was recorded with the Camera Oximeter. Paired respiratory rate readings&#xD;
      from the test oximeter and the reference capnometry are grouped into three ranges (0-8, 9-16,&#xD;
      and &gt;17 breaths per minute). Mean bias, precision and accuracy are calculated for each group&#xD;
      of respiratory range and the overall range.&#xD;
