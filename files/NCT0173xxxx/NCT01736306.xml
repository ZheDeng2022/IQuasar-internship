      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - At present, women do not have very accurate tests to inform of them of their personal risk&#xD;
      of developing breast cancer. More information on the changes associated with both benign and&#xD;
      cancerous breast lesions will help develop better risk information. Researchers have been&#xD;
      looking at cells found in breast milk to study genetic changes related to breast cancer.&#xD;
      However, most of these cell samples have been collected from white women. A new study wants&#xD;
      to collect breast milk samples from African American women for further research. Comparing&#xD;
      the results of genetic tests will help improve understanding of breast cancer risk in all&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study genetic changes related to breast lesions, including breast cancer, in African&#xD;
      American women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - African American women at least 18 years of age who are nursing a baby and who either have&#xD;
      had or are being considered for a breast biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with personal health questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a box with sterile bottles for milk collection. They will&#xD;
           collect two breast milk samples, one from each breast. They will also fill out a&#xD;
           questionnaire about their medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The box with the samples and the questionnaire will be returned to the clinical center&#xD;
           for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the box is returned, participants will be asked to provide a copy of the biopsy&#xD;
           report for any breast biopsies they have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a followup phone call every year. Participants will provide health history&#xD;
           information. This information will include whether they have been diagnosed with breast&#xD;
           cancer in the previous year.&#xD;

      Increasing evidence supports the importance of the role of pregnancy, lactation and&#xD;
      post-weaning breast remodeling in the etiology of certain types of early onset aggressive&#xD;
      breast cancers, including basal breast cancers, which are difficult to detect and treat and&#xD;
      disproportionately affect African American women. Thus, improving methods for detecting or&#xD;
      preventing early onset tumors is important from a clinical, public health and racial&#xD;
      disparities perspective. Recent evidence indicates that analysis of breast milk during the&#xD;
      postpartum period may advance the discovery of mechanisms and biomarkers related to risk of&#xD;
      early onset, aggressive tumors. However, developing methods for collecting, processing and&#xD;
      testing milk for biomarkers poses challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research team co-led by Drs. Mark Sherman (NCI/DCEG/HREB) and Kathleen Arcaro (University&#xD;
      of Massachusetts) has received an NIH Bench-to-Bedside award for a project entitled,&#xD;
      Molecular Epidemiology of Postpartum Involution of the Breast: Development and Demonstration&#xD;
      of Tools for Understanding the Postpartum Period in Relation to Risk for Early Onset Breast&#xD;
      Cancer. The specific bench objectives of this project include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop improved methods for fractionating breast milk into epithelial cell rich and&#xD;
           liquid components&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To optimize assays for DNA methylation, proliferation, apoptosis, p16 expression and&#xD;
           telomere lengths using epithelial enriched breast milk fractions, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop assays for TGF-beta ligands, prolactin and sex -steroid hormone using liquid&#xD;
           milk fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these objectives, NCI will initially work with fresh specimens that are being&#xD;
      prospectively collected under the University of Massachusetts IRB-approved open protocol&#xD;
      entitled Epigenetics and Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women , funded by the Avon&#xD;
      Foundation for Women. Dr. Arcaro s lab is studying breast cancer risk and promoter&#xD;
      hypermethylation in breast cells obtained from the milk of nursing women. They have analyzed&#xD;
      breast cells from nearly 400 women and are continuing with long-term follow-up. However, the&#xD;
      majority of the data has been from White women. Since disease risk factors differ between&#xD;
      ethnic groups, it is important to test risk assessment methods on a wide population. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this specific UMass study is to extend their findings of breast cancer risk to&#xD;
      African American women. They plan to recruit 200 lactating African American women to&#xD;
      participate in the breast milk study. This involves collecting questionnaire data, completing&#xD;
      methylation analyses for eight genes, archiving milk and the remaining DNA for future&#xD;
      studies, and annual follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key aims that we seek to address through the current protocol are related to objective&#xD;
      (1) listed above: To develop improved methods for fractionating breast milk into epithelial&#xD;
      cell rich and liquid components. Given that Dr. Arcaro has an IRB approved open protocol to&#xD;
      collect fresh milk at University of Massachusetts, NCI can only pursue this collaborative aim&#xD;
      (effectively within the timeframe of the bench-to-bedside award) in the context of this&#xD;
      ongoing study. Specifically, the collaborative project that is the subject of this IRB&#xD;
      application will assess the following aims through in vitro manipulation of fresh liquid milk&#xD;
      collections: 1) the effects of modifying the initial rinse of epithelial pellets (rinse&#xD;
      solution: saline vs. media; centrifugation speeds, temperature); 2) yields of cells and&#xD;
      nucleic acids achievable via fractionation of milk using different types of immunomagnetic&#xD;
      beads (coated with antibodies to remove leukocytes ( negative selection ) vs. coated with&#xD;
      antibodies to remove epithelial cells ( positive selection ); 3) the relative preservation at&#xD;
      room temperature at 24, 48 and 72 hours of milk suspended in cellular fixatives (e.g.&#xD;
      formalin, Proclin) as compared to fresh milk without fixation; 4) the possibility that&#xD;
      strategies 1 and 2 be combined. This project brings together specific experience and&#xD;
      expertise at University of Massachusetts with regard to milk processing with technical&#xD;
      knowledge from NCI, provided by Drs. Kopp, Heckman, Yang and Sherman. In particular, NCI&#xD;
      Frederick and Dr. Heckman have successfully used immunomagnetic bead technology to purify&#xD;
      epithelial cells from blood products and lactating mouse glands by removing leukocytes.&#xD;
