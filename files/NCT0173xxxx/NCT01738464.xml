      This research study seeks to provide more insight as to how the microbiome affects or is&#xD;
      affected by conditions causing chronic pelvic pain such as Interstitial Cystitis (IC),&#xD;
      Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS), Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms&#xD;
      (LUTS), or Overactive bladder (OAB). Depression and many chronic pain disorders are often&#xD;
      related and are poorly understood, and treatment is often not helpful. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to explain pelvic pain characteristics and causes by studying microbiomes of healthy&#xD;
      people compared to people suffering from IC, CP/CPPS, LUTS, OAB, and Major depression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC) or Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic&#xD;
      Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) is characterized by chronic pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction. IC&#xD;
      or CP/CPPS remains an enigma within urology, with no known etiology or widely effective&#xD;
      therapies. However, some IC, CP/CPPS, and depressed patients suffer bowel co-morbidities, and&#xD;
      it is well established that the GI tract can influence bladder function, mood and sensation&#xD;
      via pelvic organ crosstalk. Like other body sites, the gut harbors a rich microflora. Studies&#xD;
      characterizing microbial diversity and relative abundance at a particular body site, the&#xD;
      &quot;microbiome,&quot; reveal that microbiomes play critical roles in normal cellular and organ&#xD;
      function, and thus this importance is emphasized with the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), an&#xD;
      NIH Common Fund initiative. CPPS patients suffer chronic pelvic pain and dramatically lower&#xD;
      quality of life, yet diagnostic markers and effective therapies remain elusive for these&#xD;
      costly syndromes. IC is a debilitating condition of pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction&#xD;
      afflicting up to 8 million U.S. women where depression is a common co-morbidity, distinct&#xD;
      from over-active bladder (OAB) patients lacking pain. IC etiology remains unknown, but&#xD;
      urothelial lesions and lamina propria mast cells are associated with patient symptoms.&#xD;
      Similarly, CP/CPPS afflicts 1 in 22 men in the U.S. with pain and voiding and sexual&#xD;
      symptoms, again distinct from patients having only irritative voiding from lower urinary&#xD;
      tract symptoms (LUTS). And although leukocytes are observed in prostatic fluid of some&#xD;
      patients, the etiology of CP/CPPS also remains unknown. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis&#xD;
      (HPA) dysfunction has been implicated in female and male patients and cats with feline IC,&#xD;
      and thus may be common among CPPS, but a mechanism that integrates pelvic pain, voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction, HPA activity, and depression is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiomes are also dynamic and subject to skewing, and these changes are increasingly&#xD;
      associated with diseases including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, obesity, and possibly&#xD;
      depression. Antibiotic therapies alter microbiomes, often causing temporary dysfunction and&#xD;
      sometimes resulting in diseases such as colitis. Since IC or CP/CPPS patients often have a&#xD;
      history of urinary tract infection (UTI), they typically receive multiple courses of&#xD;
      antibiotics. This therapeutic history of IC or CP/CPPS patients may have adverse consequences&#xD;
      for two reasons. First, potential skewing of the gut microbiome may alter normal sensory and&#xD;
      functional homeostatic mechanisms, contributing to pain and voiding dysfunction. Second, an&#xD;
      altered gut microbiome may foster uropathogen reservoir expansion, and our preliminary data&#xD;
      demonstrate urinary E. coli isolates can induce chronic pelvic pain persisting long after&#xD;
      microbial clearance. Together these lines of reasoning raise the provocative possibility that&#xD;
      microbiomes contribute to IC, CP/CPPS, and depression directly by supplying uropathogens or&#xD;
      indirectly through organ crosstalk dysfunction. Therefore, is an altered gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract microbiome associated with IC, CP/CPPS, and/or depression? Our team marries core NIH&#xD;
      and NIDDK missions, digestive diseases and kidney/urologic, to address this novel question&#xD;
      with synergistic expertise in clinical diagnosis of IC, CP/CPPS, and depression, quantifying&#xD;
      GI tract microbiomes, and neural mechanisms of microbe-induced pelvic pain. Stool samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed by 16S rDNA sequence and in silico metagenome analyses to identify taxa,&#xD;
      abundance, and function. Computational tools will be used to identify taxa amenable to rapid&#xD;
      evaluation of stool. Stool, serum, and urine will be evaluated for small molecules specific&#xD;
      to CPPS, and these putative mediators will be tested in mice for effects on pelvic pain and&#xD;
      urinary function.&#xD;
