  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different surgical procedures for the treatment&#xD;
      of Rectal Cancer: Laparoscopic Surgery and Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery. The ROLARR&#xD;
      study is for participants with cancer of the rectum for whom a laparoscopic operation&#xD;
      (sometimes called &quot;keyhole surgery&quot;) has been recommended by their surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past most rectal cancers were removed using &quot;open&quot; surgery. Open surgery involves a&#xD;
      large cut down the middle of the patient's abdomen to allow the surgeon to see and take out&#xD;
      the cancer. On a previous study showed that using laparoscopic surgery to remove colorectal&#xD;
      cancers was as good as open surgery for curing cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is now another option to remove rectal cancers, which involves using a robotic system&#xD;
      with laparoscopic surgery. This type of surgery is called &quot;robotic-assisted&quot; laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery and is now becoming widely used by surgeons to remove cancers including the rectum,&#xD;
      as well as for other non-cancer operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to perform robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon sits at a robotic&#xD;
      control unit a few feet away from the patient. Using the robotic control unit, the surgeon&#xD;
      can see a clear video image of the patient's abdomen and the operation site. The surgeon can&#xD;
      perform the operation from the robotic control unit by controlling the movement of a set of&#xD;
      robotic surgical instruments, guided by the video camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like standard laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon is able to carry out the entire operation&#xD;
      through a few small cuts in the abdomen. The camera of the robotic system provides a 3D&#xD;
      high-definition magnified view of the operation site and the robotic system is also able to&#xD;
      translate the movements of the surgeon's hands into small precise movements inside the&#xD;
      patient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to test whether robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery is as good, or even better, at&#xD;
      removing rectal cancers as standard laparoscopic surgery (actually Robotic-assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery is used as standard of care in rectal cancer patients at University of&#xD;
      California, Irvine Medical Center). We also want to investigate whether using&#xD;
      robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery reduces the number of times a laparoscopic operation&#xD;
      needs to be converted to an open operation, and see whether using a robotic system can also&#xD;
      shorten the length of time patients need to stay in hospital and if it reduces the number of&#xD;
      complications patients may have during and after their operation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The feasibility and safety of laparoscopic surgery has been established for colon cancer. The&#xD;
      case for rectal cancer is less clear, and of the reported multicentre trials only the Medical&#xD;
      Research Council (MRC) CLASICC trial included an evaluation of laparoscopic compared to open&#xD;
      rectal cancer surgery. Although both laparoscopic and open rectal cancer resection were&#xD;
      associated with similar lymph node yields, concern was expressed at the higher rate of&#xD;
      circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement in the laparoscopic arm (12.4%) as&#xD;
      compared to the open arm (6.3%) for patients undergoing anterior resection. This however did&#xD;
      not translate into a difference in local recurrence at either 3-year or 5-year follow-up. The&#xD;
      difference in CRM involvement was felt to reflect the increased technical difficulties&#xD;
      associated with the laparoscopic technique in the rectal cancer subgroup. This was supported&#xD;
      by the higher conversion rate in the laparoscopic rectal subgroup (34%) as compared to the&#xD;
      laparoscopic colon subgroup (25%). Analysis of CLASICC data revealed higher morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality rates associated with laparoscopic cases converted to open operation (30-day&#xD;
      morbidity: laparoscopic 29%, converted 45%; in-hospital mortality: laparoscopic 1%, converted&#xD;
      9%). Some of this increased morbidity may be related to more advanced cancers requiring&#xD;
      conversion, but a proportion will inevitably have resulted from the increased operative time,&#xD;
      increased technical difficulty, and the need for a laparotomy wound in converted cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery using the da Vinciâ„¢ system&#xD;
      (Intuitive Surgical, California, USA) promises to eliminate many of the technical&#xD;
      difficulties inherent in laparoscopic surgery. It offers the advantages of intuitive&#xD;
      manipulation of laparoscopic instruments with 7-degrees of freedom of movement, a&#xD;
      3-dimensional field of view, a stable camera platform with zoom magnification, dexterity&#xD;
      enhancement, and an ergonomic operating environment. Experience has shown that the benefits&#xD;
      of the robot are most appreciated when surgical accuracy is required within a confined space,&#xD;
      such as the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery is technically demanding requiring accurate pelvic&#xD;
      dissection according to total mesorectal excision (TME) principles with autonomic nerve&#xD;
      preservation. Inadvertent injury to the nerves has been attributed to the higher rate of male&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction following laparoscopic surgery. The practicalities of robotic-assisted&#xD;
      colorectal cancer surgery have been reported in small series but only two studies have&#xD;
      concentrated on rectal cancer, and only one of these performed a randomised comparison in a&#xD;
      small number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature on robotic-assisted colon surgery is limited to 17 small case series. Most of&#xD;
      these comprise mixed benign and malignant disease. The largest by D'Annibale et al reported&#xD;
      53 robotic-assisted colectomies and compared outcomes with 53 laparoscopic resections. It&#xD;
      concluded that robotic-assisted surgery was as safe and effective as laparoscopic, was&#xD;
      particularly useful in pelvic dissection, but that cost-effectiveness needed further&#xD;
      evaluation. Other reports concur that robotic-assisted colorectal surgery is feasible and&#xD;
      safe, with low rates of conversion, morbidity and mortality, but with increased operative&#xD;
      times. There is only one study which has addressed the issue of hospital costs. This compared&#xD;
      30 robotic-assisted with 27 standard laparoscopic cases and concluded that the total hospital&#xD;
      cost was higher for robotic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of robotics for TME rectal cancer resection was established by Pigazzi et al&#xD;
      in a series of 6 low rectal cancers. A subsequent follow-up study of 39 rectal cancers&#xD;
      treated prospectively by robotic-assisted resection reported a zero rate of conversion with a&#xD;
      mortality of 0% and morbidity of 12.8%. The only randomised trial compared 18 patients&#xD;
      assigned to robotic-assisted resection with 18 patients assigned to standard laparoscopic&#xD;
      resection. No difference was observed in the operative times, the conversion rates (2&#xD;
      laparoscopic, 0 robotic), or the quality of mesorectal resection. The only difference was the&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, which was significantly shorter following robotic-assisted&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery (robotic-assisted: 6.9 +/-1.3 days; standard laparoscopic: 8.7 +/-1.3&#xD;
      days, p&lt;0.001) and attributed to a reduction in surgical trauma by the authors. In addition&#xD;
      to original reports, there has been one systematic review of robotic-assisted colorectal&#xD;
      surgery, which concluded that &quot;robotic colorectal surgery is a promising field and may&#xD;
      provide a powerful additional tool for optimal management of more challenging pathology,&#xD;
      including rectal cancer&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal aims to test the hypothesis that robotic-assistance facilitates&#xD;
      laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. On short-term follow-up this should result in a reduction&#xD;
      in the conversion rate and no worsening of the CRM positivity rate. On longer-term follow-up,&#xD;
      the increased accuracy should improve post-operative bladder and sexual function, enhance&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL), and ensure there is no increase in local disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing enthusiasm for robotics in many surgical specialities. This enthusiasm is&#xD;
      often not supported by data on clinical or cost-effectiveness derived from rigorous&#xD;
      evaluation by randomised controlled trials. This is the case for robotic-assisted rectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery. Given the expense associated with the robotic systems and the limited&#xD;
      evidence to support clinical and economic benefits, it is essential that a proper assessment&#xD;
      of this new technology is performed in timely manner before its widespread recommendation or&#xD;
      implementation. A randomized trial of robotic-assisted versus standard laparoscopic rectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery is now urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for current study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery have been established for&#xD;
      certain operations, most notably radical prostatectomy. Pelvic surgery, including rectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery, lends itself to robotic-assistance. However, the experience with robotic-&#xD;
      assisted rectal cancer surgery is limited to a few small personal series and one randomised&#xD;
      clinical trial. Although this data suggests it is feasible, it has not established a benefit&#xD;
      over standard laparoscopic surgery in terms of technical, functional or oncological outcomes.&#xD;
      The primary aim of any curative cancer surgery is complete oncological resection of the tumor&#xD;
      with minimal morbidity. It is therefore of utmost importance that prior to the widespread use&#xD;
      of robotics in rectal cancer surgery, it is subjected to rigorous evaluation. The use of this&#xD;
      new technology incurs additional financial burdens on already overstretched health care&#xD;
      resources and it is therefore essential to assess the health economics and cost-&#xD;
      effectiveness in comparison to alternative treatments. As this trial is unlikely to be&#xD;
      repeated, 3-year outcomes and cost effectiveness will be included within this trial.&#xD;
      Specifically, it is aimed to provide information on the ability of the robotic system to&#xD;
      facilitate laparoscopic rectal cancer resection, its impact on oncological outcomes&#xD;
      (short-term and long-term), its effect on functional outcomes and QoL, and its&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in terms of future healthcare decision-making. Currently, and for the&#xD;
      foreseeable future, there is only one surgical robotic system, the da Vinciâ„¢ robot. To avoid&#xD;
      any criticism of commercial bias, it is imperative that an evaluation of this robotic&#xD;
      technology is performed independently of the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a new technology, it is essential that a proper evaluation is performed and&#xD;
      disseminated prior to its widespread implementation. A timely assessment is imperative and&#xD;
      for this reason there is no plan to perform a prior pilot study, which would inevitably delay&#xD;
      evaluation by proper scientific methods. The feasibility of robotic-assisted rectal cancer&#xD;
      surgery has already been established and preliminary data upon which to base sample size&#xD;
      calculations are available. The time is right for a formal randomised controlled trial to&#xD;
      provide a definitive answer to the proposed research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the trial is to perform a rigorous evaluation of robotic-assisted rectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery by means of a randomised, controlled trial. The chosen comparator is standard&#xD;
      laparoscopic rectal cancer resection, which is essentially the same procedure but without the&#xD;
      use of the robotic device. The two operative interventions will be evaluated for short- and&#xD;
      longer-term outcomes. The key short-term outcomes will include assessment of technical ease&#xD;
      of the operation, as determined by the clinical indicator of low conversion rate to open&#xD;
      operation, and clear pathological resection margins as an indicator of surgical accuracy and&#xD;
      improved oncological outcome. In addition, QoL assessment and analysis of cost- effectiveness&#xD;
      will be performed to aid evidence-based knowledge to inform National Health Service (NHS) and&#xD;
      other service providers and decision-makers. These short-term outcomes will be analyzed after&#xD;
      the last randomised patient has had 6 months of follow-up to provide a timely assessment of&#xD;
      the new technology, and made available to the public, clinicians and healthcare providers to&#xD;
      inform health-care decision making. Longer-term outcomes will concentrate on oncological&#xD;
      aspects of the disease and its surgical treatment with analysis of disease-free and overall&#xD;
      survival and local recurrence rates at 3-year follow-up.&#xD;
