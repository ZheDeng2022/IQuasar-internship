             clinically relevant sensitization to pollens (grasses AND P. judaica or O. europaea).&#xD;
             Asthmatic patients can be included in the trial only if seasonal asthma is controlled&#xD;

             or minor or equal to 400 μg/day of budesonide or an equivalent plus a long-acting- β2&#xD;
             agonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthmatic patients must be stable within 3 months prior to Visit 1 and on an stable&#xD;
             inhaled steroid dose within 6 weeks prior to visit 1 and throughout the study. FEV1&#xD;
             must be ≥ 80% of predicted value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The IgE-mediated sensitization must be demonstrated by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        medical history AND IgE specific CAP RAST ≥ 2 to the suspected relevant pollens (grass&#xD;
        pollen AND Olea and/or Parietaria) AND a positive skin prick test to grass and Olea and/or&#xD;
        Parietaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindication for treatment with allergen specific immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) value &lt;80% of the&#xD;
             predicted normal value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant allergy symptoms due to sensitization to perennial allergens&#xD;
             (mites, molds, epithelia) or other seasonal pollen which might interfere with the&#xD;
             safety of the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asthma requiring a dose &gt; 800 μg/day of Budesonide or an equivalent, without&#xD;
             long-lasting beta-2 agonists or requiring a dose &gt; of 400 μg/day of Budesonide or an&#xD;
             equivalent plus a long-acting-β2 agonist to reach asthma control, according to the&#xD;
             Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with non controlled bronchial asthma within 3 months prior to Visit 1.&#xD;

             V1.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of tricyclic, tetracyclic and IMAO antidepressants. It will not be allowed to wash&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids 3 months before visit 1.&#xD;

             IMP administration is administered at least 14 days later).&#xD;

          -  Participation of the subject in another clinical trial 30 days before visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are going to donate stem cells, blood, organs or bone marrow in the&#xD;
