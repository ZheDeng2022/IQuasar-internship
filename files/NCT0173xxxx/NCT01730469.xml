  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) study of a single&#xD;
      dose of 150 mg AT1001 (migalastat HCl, GR181413A) administered orally to healthy subjects&#xD;
      with normal renal function and to subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multiple-center, sequential group, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK study of a single dose of AT1001 (migalastat HCl, GR181413A)&#xD;
      administered orally as a 150 mg dose in fasted healthy control male and female subjects with&#xD;
      normal renal function compared to mild, moderate, and severe renally-impaired subjects&#xD;
      (classified by level of creatinine clearance [CLcr] as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
      formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will occur from Day -28 to Day -2. Subjects will check-in to the clinic on Day -1&#xD;
      and receive a single oral dose of 150 mg AT1001 on Day 1. Subjects will be discharged from&#xD;
      the clinic on Day 2 (if stable as determined by the Investigator) and return for daily visits&#xD;
      on Day 3 through Day 6 for a safety assessment and PK sampling. Subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      follow-up visit on Day 7 (+1) and an end of study visit on Day 10 (+1).&#xD;
