      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The ABCA4 gene contains a blueprint for the ABCA4 protein. When this protein is absent or&#xD;
      faulty (such as in Stargardt s disease), waste material from dead cells collects in the eye.&#xD;
      The waste material may cause other cells in the eye to die. This can lead to the loss of&#xD;
      vision. Researchers want to look at blood and skin samples from people with ABCA4 gene&#xD;
      mutations to study related eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study eye diseases that are related to mutations in the ABCA4 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 12 years of age who have ABCA4 gene mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study requires 12 visits to the National Eye Institute clinic over 10 years. In the&#xD;
           first year, there will be three visits. After the first year, participants will have one&#xD;
           visit a year for 9 more years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, full eye exam, and medical history.&#xD;
           The eye exam will check eye pressure, light and color sensitivity, and retina function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample and a skin tissue sample for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to 1) establish a cohort of participants with&#xD;
      ABCA4-related retinopathies in anticipation of future clinical trials, 2) create a repository&#xD;
      of plasma, DNA, and skin fibroblast samples from the accrued cohort of ABCA4-related&#xD;
      retinopathy participants, 3) formulate clinical outcome measures for future studies, and 4)&#xD;
      acquire and perform preliminary analyses of data that may advance our understanding of&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlations in ABCA4-related retinopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the skin fibroblast samples collected from participants may be used to generate&#xD;
      iPS cells, which may be differentiated into RPE and/or neural retinal cells. These cells, if&#xD;
      produced, will be used to analyze molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and&#xD;
      to perform high throughput (HTP) drug screens to identify novel potential therapeutic&#xD;
      compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Sixty-five (65) participants, age 12 or above, with ABCA4-related&#xD;
      retinopathies, will be initially accrued for this study. However, up to an additional five&#xD;
      participants may be enrolled to replace participants who may withdraw from the study prior to&#xD;
      reaching the Month 12 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In this natural history study, participants will be followed for 10 years. Because&#xD;
      three years may be required to enroll 65 participants, this study will last up to 13 years.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through other pre-existing NIH protocols, such as the Ocular&#xD;
      Natural History Protocol (16-EI-0134), The Genetics of Inherited Eye Disease Protocol&#xD;
      (15-EI-0128), the NEI Screening Protocol (08-EI-0102), and the National Ophthalmic Disease&#xD;
      Genotyping and Phenotyping Network, Phase II protocol (eyeGENE II, 10-EI-N164), or through&#xD;
      referral from an outside clinician after a review of pertinent medical records and genetic&#xD;
      testing. All participants will undergo a standardized medical/ophthalmic history and a&#xD;
      complete baseline eye examination, that may include non-invasive electrophysiology (e.g.,&#xD;
      electroretinography), psychophysiology (e.g., microperimetry, static perimetry), and&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging examinations (e.g., optical coherence tomography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be examined three times over the course of the first year (i.e.,&#xD;
      baseline examination, Month 6, and Month 12). After the first year, they will return to the&#xD;
      NEI clinic on an annual basis for the next nine years. This study will require a minimum of&#xD;
      12 study visits. Participants may be seen at more frequent intervals at the investigators&#xD;
      discretion, depending on the clinical and research situation. Participants will be required&#xD;
      to submit a blood sample as part of the study for DNA and serum banking, and they will have&#xD;
      the option to provide a 3-mm punch skin biopsy to facilitate research at a cellular level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome for this study is the establishment of a cohort of&#xD;
      participants with ABCA4-related retinopathies, and the secondary outcome is the creation of a&#xD;
      repository of plasma, DNA, and skin fibroblast samples from the accrued cohort of&#xD;
      ABCA4-related retinopathy participants. Exploratory outcomes for this study include: 1) the&#xD;
      formulation of clinical outcome measures for future studies and 2) the acquisition and&#xD;
      preliminary analysis of data that may advance our understanding of genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      correlations in ABCA4-related retinopathies. Potential exploratory outcomes include: 1) the&#xD;
      generation of iPS cells from the skin fibroblast samples, 2) the differentiation of the&#xD;
      generated iPS cells into RPE and/or neural retinal cells, and 3) the use of the&#xD;
      participant-specific RPE and/or neural retinal cells to perform HTP drug screens to identify&#xD;
      novel potential therapeutic compounds. The cells obtained in this protocol may be genetically&#xD;
      modified and may be used for in vivo research.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Participant (or legal guardian) must understand and sign the protocol s informed&#xD;
                  consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Participant must be able to cooperate with detailed psychophysics and&#xD;
                  electrophysiology testing.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Participant has:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A maculopathy or retinal degeneration plus two (or more) clear mutations in the ABCA4&#xD;
             gene (ascertained with CLIA-certified testing) that are known to be associated with&#xD;
             retinal disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -One clear mutation in ABCA4 associated with a classic presentation of fundus&#xD;
        flavimaculatus/Stargardt macular dystrophy (e.g., flecks, macular atrophy) and no&#xD;
        pathogenic mutation(s) in other genes known to cause macular dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -One clear mutation in ABCA4, a cone-rod degeneration and no clearly pathogenic mutation(s)&#xD;
        in other genes known to cause cone-rod degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has evidence of a systemic condition or ocular disease not related to ABCA4&#xD;
        mutations that would complicate the analysis of psychophysical, electrophysiological, or&#xD;
        imaging data. For example, a participant with advanced diabetes mellitus and significant&#xD;
        diabetic retinopathy may display changes in retinal function that could be related to&#xD;
        either his/her diabetic retinopathy or ABCA4 mutations.&#xD;
