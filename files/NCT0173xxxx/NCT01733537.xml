      The purpose of this study is to determine whether providing motorcycle taxi drivers with a&#xD;
      free reflective fluorescent vest will result in increased use of reflective or fluorescent&#xD;
      clothing compared to education about wearing reflective or fluorescent clothing alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Road traffic injuries are the 4th leading cause of death among individuals in the&#xD;
      economically productive age group (age 15 to 59) in low and middle income countries. The&#xD;
      Africa region currently has some of the world's highest traffic injury rates, with vulnerable&#xD;
      road users, including motorcycle riders, bearing a disproportionate share of the injury&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motorcycles are a rapidly growing form of transport in Africa, both for personal and&#xD;
      commercial transportation. Conspicuity measures-factors that increase a motorcycle rider's&#xD;
      visibility-for the prevention of motorcycle crash have been previously studied and found to&#xD;
      be associated with a decreased risk of crash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motorcycle taxi drivers are a particularly high risk population for motorcycle crash as they&#xD;
      operate a motorcycle for several hours a day. Reflective, fluorescent safety vests are a&#xD;
      common article worn by motorcycle drivers in some locations; however, penetration of such&#xD;
      clothing in Moshi is currently low. This study aims to increase use of reflective vests among&#xD;
      commercial motorcycle drivers. We will test whether provision of a free reflective,&#xD;
      fluorescent vest increases use of reflective, fluorescent clothing compared to education&#xD;
      about wearing reflective, fluorescent clothing alone.&#xD;
