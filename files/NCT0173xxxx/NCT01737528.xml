      The TVT Registryâ„¢ is a benchmarking tool developed to track patient safety and real-world&#xD;
      outcomes related to the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure. Created by&#xD;
      The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the TVT&#xD;
      Registry is designed to monitor the safety and efficacy of this new procedure for the&#xD;
      treatment of aortic stenosis.&#xD;

      Purpose of the Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TVT Registry was designed to support a national surveillance system to assess the&#xD;
      characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients receiving transcutaneous valve&#xD;
      therapies. Patient-level data are submitted by participating hospitals to The Society of&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and American College of Cardiology Foundation's (ACCF) joint TVT&#xD;
      Registry. The purposes of the TVT Registry include: (i) collecting pertinent and standardized&#xD;
      data elements from participating hospitals, health care providers and others that measure and&#xD;
      assess the quality of care for patients receiving TVT; (ii) providing confidential periodic&#xD;
      reports to participating hospitals, health care providers and others, to evaluate and improve&#xD;
      the quality of care in these areas; and (iii) permitting and fostering appropriate research&#xD;
      based upon the data collected by means of the TVT Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of the TVT Registry is to serve as a scalable data infrastructure for post&#xD;
      market studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter valve therapies are now emerging into clinical practice from the research phase&#xD;
      in the United States. The first of several approaches to replacing the aortic valve without&#xD;
      open-chest surgery has now become a reality. Other valve and delivery systems are expected to&#xD;
      be approved in the upcoming years. An Expert Consensus Document on Transcatheter Valve&#xD;
      Therapy has outlined the initial technology, targeted patient population, and the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary heart team and specialized facilities needed. The document also proposes&#xD;
      the establishment of a national registry of patients with valvular heart disease that can&#xD;
      collect and analyze data as these new valve treatment options become available. Surveillance&#xD;
      of device performance, monitoring of long-term outcomes, and performance of comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness research are some of the proposed uses of the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter valve therapies have emerged because of unmet patient needs. Furthermore, TVT&#xD;
      has developed at a time when degenerative heart valve diseases of both the mitral and aortic&#xD;
      valves are increasing in frequency as the population ages. With the introduction of the first&#xD;
      TAVR commercial product, the targeted patient group is the &quot;inoperable&quot; patient who cannot&#xD;
      receive the traditional therapy of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). It is expected&#xD;
      that TAVR will subsequently be extended to patients who have high risk with SAVR. The marked&#xD;
      reduction of mortality by TAVR in the inoperable patients and the similar mortality of TAVR&#xD;
      versus SAVR in the high risk patients provide patients with a new therapy with benefits but&#xD;
      also with a different risk profile. Patients and their families will need to make informed&#xD;
      decisions regarding the likelihood of having a mortality benefit, of improving their&#xD;
      functional class and quality of life, of suffering a complication, and of choosing between&#xD;
      different care options and therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these patients there are unique issues such as the prioritization of the health related&#xD;
      quality of life versus the quantity of life, the desire to preserve independence and avoid&#xD;
      becoming a burden to families, and the need to clearly understand what about their current&#xD;
      condition is reversible versus irreversible and linked to other conditions and aging. These&#xD;
      issues become further highlighted when considering the considerable costs and other treatment&#xD;
      burdens of the TVT technologies versus the disabling symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations&#xD;
      caused by untreated severe valvular heart disease.&#xD;
