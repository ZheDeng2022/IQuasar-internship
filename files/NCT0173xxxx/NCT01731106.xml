      Brief Summary Cerebral Autoregulation is a well known physiological response to blood&#xD;
      pressure changes to maintain the cerebral perfusion. The critically ill patients are&#xD;
      submitted to different situations that can impair the cerebral autoregulation as sepsis,&#xD;
      sedation drugs and mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delirium on ICU has been described as a bad prognosis factor, increasing the mortality&#xD;
      and length of stay. The physiopathology of delirium has been related to cerebral perfusion.&#xD;
      The delirium has been related to long term cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a physiological prospective study that will be done in a 14 bed medical-surgical ICU.&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 100 ventilated patients, septic and non-septic. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure cerebral autoregulation every 48-72 hours from admission on ICU.&#xD;
      Neurological biomarkers (Neurological Specific Enolase, S100 beta and Vascular Endothelial&#xD;
      Growing Factor) will be done at inclusion, 72 hours and 7 days. Clinical data, delirium&#xD;
      presence, analytic data and ventilatory parameters will be registered every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At hospital discharge, a psychologist will do a cognitive evaluation using specific tests.&#xD;
      The cognitive evaluation will be repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipate results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some items like mechanical ventilation, sepsis and sedation can impair cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation. The impairment of cerebral autoregulation is related to delirium in ICU and&#xD;
      long cognitive impairment.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral Autoregulation (CA) is the physiological strategy used for the brain to maintain the&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow constant during blood pressure (BP) changes. The evaluation of CA dynamic&#xD;
      and static models has been described in the literature. The coefficient Sx and the Mx are one&#xD;
      of the validated dynamic methods. These coefficients are obtained from the correlation&#xD;
      between BP and Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) velocity measured using Transcranial Doppler&#xD;
      (TCD). Correlation values higher than 0.3 reflect an impairment of CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of CA impairment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is not well described.&#xD;
      Neither, risk factors or clinical situations that precipitate CA impairment have been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical Ventilation (MV) is a common treatment in the ICU. The main difference is the&#xD;
      positive pressure administrated to the lungs instead of the negative pressure in spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing. The positive pressure applied in the alveoli causes a local and systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response. Lung injuries are well described due to MV. Some studies relate&#xD;
      changes in the Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) with the&#xD;
      Positive End- Expiratory Pressure in neurological patients. Also changes in the MCA velocity&#xD;
      have been described with MV. The studies speculate that the changes are related to the&#xD;
      intrathoracic positive pressure. However, all studies are in patients with acute neurological&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ICU sedation drugs are often used to guarantee patient comfort in the MV. The BIS ®&#xD;
      device is used for monitoring sedation level based on the electroencephalogram drawing.&#xD;
      Recent studies analyse the influence of this drugs on CA in healthy volunteers. However, no&#xD;
      studies have described the effects of long sedations like usually occurs in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of delirium in the ICU has been described as 50%. In mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients the incidence increases to 80%. Delirium is considered an independent factor of bad&#xD;
      prognosis. It increases the days under mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, the&#xD;
      dependence at discharge and the risk of death. Because of that, it has a high impact in&#xD;
      health and in economic cost. However it is an underdiagnosed illness due to the absence of&#xD;
      ICU protocols for the correct diagnosis. The scale Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM -&#xD;
      ICU) is the validated tool for the screening and it is used by the nurses and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term cognitive impairment is well described in patients admitted in the ICU. A&#xD;
      recent study followed-up the patients subjected to mechanical ventilator who had developed&#xD;
      delirium. They use the Mini-mental State Examination Score and they found that at 3 month&#xD;
      following-up 61% patients had severe cognitive impairment and 17% a moderate impairment. At&#xD;
      12 months the 36% of patients still had a severe impairment and the 35% a moderate&#xD;
      impairment. The developing of delirium during the ICU admission is considered a risk factor&#xD;
      for long term cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis has been also related with cognitive impairment. Iwashyna et al, published that&#xD;
      patients with basal moderate cognitive impairment who survived a severe infection, had higher&#xD;
      probability of getting worse compared to patients who were admitted for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some biomarkers for neurological damage are well known. The S100B protein, present in the&#xD;
      calcium canal of glial cells, and the Neurological Specific Enolase (NSE), an enzyme that&#xD;
      participates in neurological glucolysis are increased in patients with Brain Trauma, cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia or bleeding. In older patients with delirium the levels of S100B are also increased,&#xD;
      but not the NSE levels. In critical patients the S100B and NSE have been used for delirium&#xD;
      and cognitive impairment markers. However, the publications have been contradictories. Most&#xD;
      of them find high levels of S100Bin septic and postoperative patients who developed delirium,&#xD;
      but in some studies no significant differences have been seen. NSE has not relation with&#xD;
      delirium in septic patients, however, after cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation&#xD;
      both markers, S100B and NSE, are good predictors of delirium and cognitive impairment at 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Endothelial Growing Factor (VEGF) takes part in the vascular and cerebral&#xD;
      regeneration in the neurological system. It is considered a neuronal protector. Cerebral&#xD;
      hypoxia stimulates the expression of VEGF for starting the vascular neogenesis. No studies&#xD;
      related VEGF with delirium in the critical patient. Assuming that hypoxia and ischemia can&#xD;
      develop delirium in the ICU, the VEGF levels may be augmented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The critical patient under mechanical ventilation can have impaired CA due to situation as&#xD;
      sepsis and multiorgan failure. The CA impairment can be related to sedation, pressors or some&#xD;
      co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determinate the CA impairment in critically ill patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe evolving patterns of CA in the critically ill patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the influence of MV, sedation and sepsis on CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the relation between CA impairment and delirium in the ICU and long term&#xD;
           cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determinate the long term cognitive status of patients who had CA impairment during&#xD;
           the ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determinate the levels and kinetic evolution, and prognosis power of the biomarkers&#xD;
           S100B, NSE and VEGF in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To describe the influence of CA impairment on mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Field This is a physiological observational prospective study done in a University&#xD;
      Hospital of 400 beds approximately. The study will take place in a medical-surgical ICU of 14&#xD;
      beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive enrolment of patients admitted on Fundació Althaia ICU of Manresa, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral autoregulation analysis The investigators will use TCD to determinate CA situation.&#xD;
      A continuous monitoring of MCA velocity and simultaneous invasive arterial pressure will be&#xD;
      done every 48-72 hours during admission and when the patient is under MV. The investigators&#xD;
      will calculate the Mx and Sx coefficients, defined as Pearson correlation between the average&#xD;
      of mean (Mx) and systolic (Sx) MCA velocity and average of the values of arterial pressure&#xD;
      waveform every 3 minutes. The software used is DWL Compumedics Monitoring ® to measure MCA&#xD;
      velocity and arterial pressure waveform every 1 millisecond. The monitoring test will take&#xD;
      between 20 minutes and 1 hour time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sedation depth will be continuous monitored using Bispectral Index System (BIS) of&#xD;
      Covidien ®. Ramsay scale will be registered every 6 hours by nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive evaluation After the discharge from the hospital the cognitive situation will be&#xD;
      evaluated using neuropsychological tests. A medical psychologist of Fundació Althaia&#xD;
      Psychiatry Service will do the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test grouping has been designed following the recommendation for medical population. Two&#xD;
      or more of these tests under 1.5 SD general population standards will be considered as&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. The test used includes psychometric tools for neuropsychological&#xD;
      evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attention and velocity of processing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selective attention: Trail Making Test Part A; direct numbers (WMS-III).&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  Verbal nomination for visual confrontation (Boston nomination test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verbal comprehension (Token test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual-space and visual-construction function (WAIS - III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Executive function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concept formation and cognitive flexibility (WSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Memory of work: inverse numbers (WMS - III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verbal fluency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous performance estimation: vocabulary (WAIS - III). Depressive and psychotic&#xD;
           evaluation While the long term cognitive impairment evaluation, Depressive&#xD;
           symptomatology will also be evaluated using the Beck Inventory. The psychotic evaluation&#xD;
           will be carried out using the Brief Psychiatric Evaluation Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100B, NSE and VEGF levels At inclusion time the levels of biomarkers S100B, NSE and VEGF&#xD;
      will be determined. The investigators will repeat the samples at 72 hours and 7 days.&#xD;
