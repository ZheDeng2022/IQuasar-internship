      To examine the benefits of using a video-game, Dance, Dance, Revolution, as an exercise&#xD;
      modality to improve gait and balance in individuals with Huntington's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a therapist-guided&#xD;
      Video-game Biofeedback Modulated Exercise (ViBE) program administered via Dance Dance&#xD;
      Revolution to improve dynamic balance, gait and mobility in individuals with Huntington's&#xD;
      Disease. Secondary aims were to explore whether the ViBE intervention would improve quality&#xD;
      of life, fall risk, and neuropsychological functions. The investigators hypothesized that the&#xD;
      video-game program would lead to greater improvements in walking, dynamic balance, quality of&#xD;
      life, fall risk, and neuropsychological function than a control handheld video game program.&#xD;
      Since motivation is essential to the long-term maintenance of an exercise program the&#xD;
      investigators were also interested in finding out how successful people with Huntington's&#xD;
      Disease were at playing Dance Dance Revolution, what their perceptions were of playing the&#xD;
      game, and whether they thought that it was beneficial&#xD;

    <description>Observation of gait and balance with quantifiable 16-item assessment with an ordinal scale of 0-2 for up to a total score of 32, with higher scores indicating better performance.

    <measure>Four Square Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Examines ability to step over an object in multiple directions and is timed. Participants are instructed to step over a cane into each square in a specific order. Faster times indicate better balance. It has been shown to predict falls in the elderly.</description>

    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals rate their balance confidence from 1-100 on 16 tasks and total score is the mean; higher scores indicate greater confidence and lower fall risk. The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale is reliable and valid in elderly and neurological populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention and post hand-held game, each lasts 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a measure of quality of life addressing 4 domains including physical, psychological, social, and environment health. Responses on 26 items are on a five-point scale (from 1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied) and each item is added to achieve a total score for each domain. The mean score for each domain is calculated then multiplied by 4 to get the domain score which are then transformed to a scaled score of 0-100 comparable to the original WHOQOL-100 therefore a total score between 0-400 with high scores indicating better quality of life. The WHOQOLBref has good reliability and validity.</description>

        <description>This questionnaire is a measure of quality of life addressing 4 domains including physical, psychological, social, and environment health. Responses on 26 items are on a five-point scale (from 1 = very dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied) and each item is added to achieve a total score for each domain. The mean score for each domain is calculated then multiplied by 4 to get the domain score which are then transformed to a scaled score of 0-100 comparable to the original WHOQOL-100 therefore a total score between 0-400 with high scores indicating better quality of life. The WHOQOLBref has good reliability and validity.</description>
