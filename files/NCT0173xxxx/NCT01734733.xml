      To assess the safety of xenotransplantation of NTCELL [immunoprotected&#xD;
      (alginate-encapsulated) choroid plexus cells] in patients with Parkinson's disease, assessed&#xD;
      over the duration of the study, by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events and serious&#xD;
      adverse events, including clinical and laboratory evidence of xenogeneic infection in&#xD;
      transplant recipients and their partners/close contacts. Subsequent safety follow-up will&#xD;
      include lifelong monitoring for clinical and laboratory evidence of xenogeneic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the clinical effects of NTCELL [immunoprotected (alginate-encapsulated) choroid&#xD;
      plexus cells] in patients with Parkinson's disease. This will be quantified by testing the&#xD;
      secondary endpoints of the trial as described below (see Endpoints/Outcome Measures).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is characterized by widespread neural degeneration, particularly in the&#xD;
      substantia nigra and its projections to the basal ganglia. Current therapy for Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease is purely symptomatic. There is a pressing need for a treatment that reverses or&#xD;
      slows the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous transplant-based therapies have attempted to support, repair or replace the&#xD;
      degenerating nigrostriatal neurons. These have included the transplantation of foetal and&#xD;
      other neuronal stem cells, gene transfers, and the implantation of devices releasing neural&#xD;
      growth factors. All these have been shown to have some effectiveness in animal models, but&#xD;
      have been generally disappointing in human studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracranial choroid plexus cell transplantation has the potential to deliver biological&#xD;
      neural agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease which cannot be achieved by&#xD;
      conventional treatment. The overall aim of delivering neural proteins and compounds over many&#xD;
      months to the basal ganglia of the brain is to enhance neural repair currently not possible&#xD;
      with antiparkinsonian medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As animal-derived tissues have to be protected from immune rejection when transplanted into&#xD;
      humans, transplants are usually accompanied by immunosuppressive therapy. However, porcine&#xD;
      choroid plexus cells are preferably implanted without the use of immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
      which cause significant morbidity. To protect them from immune rejection, the cells can be&#xD;
      encapsulated in alginate microcapsules which permit the inward passage of nutrients and the&#xD;
      outward passage of biologic neural proteins and compounds normally secreted by choroid plexus&#xD;
      cells. Alginate-encapsulated porcine choroid plexus cells implanted into the brain without&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs have survived rejection for many months in animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NTCELL comprises neonatal porcine choroid plexus cells encapsulated in alginate&#xD;
      microcapsules. NTCELL has been safely implanted in rats, and non-human primates. Following&#xD;
      NTCELL implants, animals with chemically-induced Parkinson's-like lesions showed improvement&#xD;
      of functional neurological motor abnormalities that was associated with histologic changes&#xD;
      consistent with amelioration of the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose for intracranial implantation of the current NTCELL preparation for the&#xD;
      treatment of Parkinson's disease in humans is based on the effective dose in a non-human&#xD;
      primate (rhesus monkey) model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease patients will be followed up for 26 weeks after receiving an implantation&#xD;
      of NTCELL administered into the putamen of the corpus striatum on the side contralateral to&#xD;
      the greatest clinical deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the data obtained during the 26-week follow-up period a decision will be made as&#xD;
      to whether the patient will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an implantation of a second dose of NTCELL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unilateral DBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bilateral DBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no further intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be reviewed by the investigators and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB),&#xD;
      the data will consist of clinical outcomes and clinimetric data, an MRI scan, PET scanning,&#xD;
      and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for a further 48 weeks if there is no further intervention,&#xD;
      however if it is decided that either DBS or implantation of a second dose of NTCELL occurs&#xD;
      then the frequency of follow-up will be the subject of a protocol amendment.&#xD;
