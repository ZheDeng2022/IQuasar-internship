  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate platelet inhibition with dual antiplatelet therapy is a key therapeutic goal after&#xD;
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), aimed at protecting against stent&#xD;
      thrombosis and increased mortality. Recent aggregometric assays have shown that up to one&#xD;
      third of acute coronary syndrome patients treated with clopidogrel have incomplete inhibition&#xD;
      of adenosine diphosphate(ADP)-induced platelet aggregation while the number of patients&#xD;
      treated with aspirin who have incomplete inhibition of thromboxane A2-induced platelet&#xD;
      aggregation (ASPI)is much lower. High on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) has been&#xD;
      associated with an increased rate of ischemic events after PCI. However, recent large trials&#xD;
      did not show a clinical benefit of TPR-guided therapy modification in acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      patients treated by PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-treatment PLAtelet reactivity-guided Therapy modification FOR ST-segment elevation&#xD;
      Myocardial infarction (PLATFORM) is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      parallel-group, controlled clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy modification is superior to standard antiplatelet regimen among intermediate to&#xD;
      high-risk STEMI patients undergoing PPCI. The safety hypothesis is that compared with control&#xD;
      arm, interventional study arm will have similar rates of non-coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery-related bleeding. Approximately 632 ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)&#xD;
      patients with intermediate to high-risk (RISK-PCI score &gt;3) clinical features undergoing PPCI&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to treatment modification or standard treatment. Low responders to&#xD;
      aspirin will receive 200 mg aspirin for 30 days. Low responders to clopidogrel will receive&#xD;
      180 mg ticagrelor for 1 year. Patients will be followed up to 1 year after PPCI.&#xD;

      On-treatment PLAtelet reactivity-guided Therapy modification FOR ST-segment elevation&#xD;
      Myocardial infarction (PLATFORM) is an investigator-initiated, prospective, open-label,&#xD;
      randomized, parallel-group, actively controlled single-centre clinical trial. The research&#xD;
      protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Centre of Serbia. All&#xD;
      participants will have to provide their informed consent in writing. The trial design will&#xD;
      ensure that all participants abide by good clinical practice and the ethical principles of&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki II. Patients will be randomly allocated to antiplatelet regimen&#xD;
      modification (ARM, interventional arm) or standard treatment (control arm) using a&#xD;
      computer-generated 1:1 simple randomization scheme. TPR will be assessed in patients enrolled&#xD;
      in the intervention arm of the trial. Low responders to aspirin will receive 200 mg aspirin&#xD;
      for 30 days. Low responders to clopidogrel will receive 180 mg ticagrelor for 1 year.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the control arm will receive standard antiplatelet regimen including 100&#xD;
      mg aspirin and 75 mg clopidogrel without assessment of TPR. The treating physicians will not&#xD;
      be blinded to the intervention since an open design will make it possible for investigators&#xD;
      to perform necessary adjustments of the antiplatelet regimen in accordance with TPR status.&#xD;
      To minimize any possible bias inherent in the open design, endpoints will be evaluated by a&#xD;
      blinded endpoint committee. Enrollment will start in June 2013. Recruitment will continue&#xD;
      until 632 patients have been randomized. The end of the recruitment period is planned for&#xD;
      June 2015. The trial will continue until all available survivors have been followed for at&#xD;
      least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin 300 mg and clopidogrel 600 mg loading doses will be administered as early as possible&#xD;
      before PPCI. Primary PCI will be performed via femoral or radial approach, using standard 6&#xD;
      French-7 French guiding catheters. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) blood&#xD;
      flow will be measured by two experienced observers blinded to identity and the order of&#xD;
      angiograms. Any disagreement will be resolved by a third observer. Unfractionated heparin&#xD;
      will be started as 100 IU/kg bolus (60 IU/kg if glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor&#xD;
      was used); the 12 IU/kg/h infusion will follow if clinically indicated. Proton-pump inhibitor&#xD;
      pantoprazole or H2-blocker ranitidine will be given to selected patients at risk for&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage. GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor tirofiban will be administered&#xD;
      during the procedure in patients with evidence of high intracoronary thrombus burden&#xD;
      according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple electrode aggregometry will be performed using the impedance aggregometer and under&#xD;
      the monitoring of an official representative of the manufacturer (Multiplate analyzer,&#xD;
      Verum-Diagnostics, Munich, Germany). TPR results will be evaluated by 2 investigators who&#xD;
      will be blinded to patient's identity and treatment. Whole blood will be sampled 24 hours&#xD;
      after the loading dose. In patients who received IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban blood samples&#xD;
      will be obtained at least 24 hours after the completion of tirofiban infusion. On-treatment&#xD;
      platelet reactivity (TPA) above 50%, compared to the basal value estimated by TRAP test, will&#xD;
      be linked with low responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up after discharge from hospital for net adverse events up to 1&#xD;
      year after enrolment by scheduled telephone interviews and outpatient visits. Interviewers&#xD;
      will be blinded to the randomization scheme and to the results of platelet aggregation. An&#xD;
      independent Clinical Event Committee, composed of 3 cardiologists and 1 neurologist and&#xD;
      blinded with respect to randomization allocation will review and adjudicate the occurrence of&#xD;
      each suspected clinical end point. Interim analyses of efficacy and futility, using&#xD;
      O'Brian-Fleming guidelines for group sequential design, are planned when one fourth, one half&#xD;
      and three fourths of the maximum number of the 632 patients had been followed-up for 30 days.&#xD;
      Interim analyses and all safety data will be reviewed by an independent Data Safety and&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee, composed of a chairman, a statistician, and 2 physician members.&#xD;
