  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with COPD, negatively influencing their quality of&#xD;
      life, treatment response and survival. Loss of muscle protein is generally a central&#xD;
      component of this weight loss and independently increases mortality. This study will provide&#xD;
      relevant clinical information in regards to the anabolic properties of specific dietary&#xD;
      substrates and their co-active anabolic effects. Hypotheses: 1) That supplementation of a&#xD;
      hydrolyzed casein-based protein meal with the addition of carbohydrates is more anabolic than&#xD;
      a hydrolyzed casein-based protein meal without carbohydrates in COPD patients and healthy&#xD;
      older adults; 2) That leucine addition to a hydrolyzed casein-based protein meal only&#xD;
      enhances the protein anabolic response in COPD patients and healthy older adults when&#xD;
      carbohydrates are not added to the protein meal; 3) That COPD patients have a more efficient&#xD;
      protein anabolic response to a hydrolyzed casein-based protein meal than healthy older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fifth study day was added to measure protein requirements of included individuals to be&#xD;
      able to interpret their response to the other interventions on the other study days, and to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that subjects with lower protein requirements respond less to&#xD;
      intervention with leucine and/or carbohydrates. For the 5th additional test day we will first&#xD;
      approach the 10 COPD and 10 healthy subjects who already completed the first 4 study days&#xD;
      (and signed the re-contact form) to come back for this extra test day. We will (pre-)screen&#xD;
      these subjects by phone for eligibility and check for changes in their recent medical history&#xD;
      (with help of the (pre-)screening questionnaires in CRF). If all inclusion criteria are still&#xD;
      met, these subjects will be asked to provide a written re-consent. If necessary, we will&#xD;
      recruit new subjects who will complete only one of the four test days (i.e. the test day on&#xD;
      which the hydrolyzed casein-based protein meal with carbohydrates is provided) and the&#xD;
      additional 5th study day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves 5 study days. The duration of the first 4 study days is approximately 6.5&#xD;
      hours per day and the duration of the 5th study day is approximately 8 hours. On each of the&#xD;
      first 4 study days the effect a casein protein meal with or without leucine and carbohydrates&#xD;
      will be examined. On the fifth study day the effect of 4 different levels of casein protein&#xD;
      and carbohydrate intake by sip feeding (every 20 minutes) is examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, subjects will receive a mixture of amino acids (little parts of protein) which are a&#xD;
      little bit heavier than normal, called stable isotopes. This is the so-called stable isotope&#xD;
      method to investigate protein behavior in the body (protein kinetics). Altogether about 75 ml&#xD;
      of blood will be drawn per study day to assess outcome measures.&#xD;
