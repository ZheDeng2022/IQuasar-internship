      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are studying how metabolism and hormone levels change in response to mild&#xD;
      changes in environmental temperature. Changes in metabolism may lessen with time because of&#xD;
      hormonal adaptations. If this increase in metabolism continues for a longer period, mild cold&#xD;
      exposure may cause weight loss. It is unclear whether exposure to a warmer temperature may&#xD;
      cause opposite changes in metabolism. Researchers want to see if longer exposure (1 month) to&#xD;
      different temperatures can affect how the body uses energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test changes in energy metabolism in response to different room temperatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy men between 18 and 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The entire study will last for 4 months. It will involve a screening visit and a 4-month&#xD;
           inpatient stay at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. The inpatient stay&#xD;
           will be in a private room at the Metabolic Clinical Research unit. Study participants&#xD;
           will be required to stay in the Metabolic Clinical Research unit during the night, but&#xD;
           are free to leave during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the screening visit, participants will have a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
           Blood samples will be collected. A heart function test and diet questionnaire will also&#xD;
           be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first month, the temperature of the private room will be set at to 75.2&#xD;
           degrees F. This will allow the body to become used to the testing environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the second month, the temperature will be set to either a cool (66.2 degrees F)&#xD;
           or a warm (80.6 degrees F) temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the third month, the temperature will return to 75.2 degrees F.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the fourth month, the temperature will be altered to the opposite temperature to&#xD;
           the one set in the second month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throughout stay, participants will have daily temperature monitoring and will keep a&#xD;
           food diary. Once a week, they will collect all of their urine for 24 hours. Once a&#xD;
           month, they will spend 24 hours in a metabolic suite to study their metabolism rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throughout stay, the food will be provided as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first and third month (75.2 degrees F) the participants will be allowed to&#xD;
           leave the Metabolic Clinical Research unit during the weekends, while during the second&#xD;
           and forth month (66.2 or 80.6 degrees F), the participants will be allowed to spend one&#xD;
           weekend out of the Metabolic Clinical Research unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other tests, such as body scans, fat tissue samples, and imaging studies, will be&#xD;
           performed as needed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major health issue worldwide. Despite global research efforts, effective&#xD;
      treatments for obesity are limited. There are two kinds of fat in the body: white fat and&#xD;
      brown fat. White fat functions mainly as an energy-storing organ and in excess results in&#xD;
      obesity and complications such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Brown fat on the other&#xD;
      hand releases the energy stored in fat as heat. It protects small animals and newborn human&#xD;
      infants from cold temperatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in imaging techniques have revealed brown fat to be present in significant&#xD;
      amount in adult humans. Using PET scanning, brown fat is shown to be more abundant in lean&#xD;
      and younger individuals, suggesting that brown fat may regulate energy balance and&#xD;
      metabolism. In a previous study we showed that following exposure to mild cold (19degree&#xD;
      C/66degree F), the activity of brown fat was increased by nearly 10% and the energy&#xD;
      expenditure by over 6%. Over time, these changes might result in substantial weight loss.&#xD;
      However this has not been investigated and it is uncertain whether long-term cold exposure&#xD;
      can sustain the increased activity of brown fat. In order to determine the therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of brown fat activation, we designed a study investigating the effects of cold&#xD;
      exposure over a long period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that adult humans can be cold-acclimatized through mild cold exposure over a&#xD;
      month. Brown fat activity can be increased and sustained by cold stimulation, which could&#xD;
      result in beneficial metabolic changes in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the current project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determine whether brown fat can be stimulated by exposure to mild cold&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. investigate the metabolic consequences of long-term cold exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomly assigned to sleep overnight in the Metabolic Clinical Research&#xD;
      Unit at NIH, set at either mild cold (19degree C/66degree F) or mild warm (27degree&#xD;
      C/81degree F), with a lead-in period and a wash-out period before crossing over, during which&#xD;
      the temperature will be ambient (24degree C/75 degree F). Volunteers can conduct their&#xD;
      regular activities during the day. Each period will be 1 month in duration. At the end of&#xD;
      each month, volunteers will be evaluated for their metabolic response to a mild cold&#xD;
      challenge for 24 hours (19degree C/66degree F) to determine whether brown fat function and&#xD;
      activity have been altered by temperature acclimatization in the previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Based on its role in energy homeostasis and protection against obesity in&#xD;
      animals, brown fat is likely to have a similar role in adult humans. Determining the&#xD;
      contribution of brown fat-mediated cold acclimatization to long term energy balance may lead&#xD;
      to novel treatment strategies of obesity.&#xD;
