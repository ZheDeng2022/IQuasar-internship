  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients who are starting to take antiretroviral medication (to treat HIV) for the first&#xD;
      time, there are now a variety of different medicines which may be taken together as a&#xD;
      combination in order to form an effective treatment which suppresses the virus for prolonged&#xD;
      periods of time. Currently, national guidelines recommend the use of two different drugs of&#xD;
      one type (the nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NRTI often known as&#xD;
      &quot;nukes&quot;) with a third drug from one of two other types (either a nonnucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor, known as an NNRTI or &quot;nonnuke&quot;, or a protease inhibitor, known as a&#xD;
      PI) to form a treatment regime of three active drugs. In the UK and Europe, all PIs are given&#xD;
      in combination with a small dose of a second PI, ritonavir, which has the effect of boosting&#xD;
      the levels of the active PI in the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know from both research studies and patient experience in clinic that a&#xD;
      combination of a ritonavirboosted PI with an NNRTI achieves similar results in suppressing&#xD;
      the HIV virus, compared to the use of either a PI or NNRTI with 2 NRTI as described above. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will observe the combination of two licensed antiretroviral&#xD;
      medications, ritonavirboosted darunavir(DRV/r) and rilpivirine (RPV), in suppressing virus&#xD;
      when given to patients who are commencing treatment for HIV infection for the first time.&#xD;
      Both of these drugs are licensed for treatment of patients with HIV in the UK and Europe, and&#xD;
      are currently in standard clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will monitor this treatment over the first 48 weeks. The investigators will also&#xD;
      examine the levels of both drugs in the bloodstream during the first 4 weeks of starting this&#xD;
      regimen, to confirm that they remain at levels which the investigators know to be effective&#xD;
      against the virus.&#xD;
