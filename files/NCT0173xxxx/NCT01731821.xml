      Pancreaticojejunostomy is the key procedure of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The aim of our study&#xD;
      is to investigate a new pancreaticojejunal (PJ) anastomosis procedure named &quot;nonstented&#xD;
      stump-closed pancreaticojejunostomy&quot; in pancreatoduodenectomy, which could provide a feasible&#xD;
      option to pancreatic surgeons for patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a standard surgical approach for resectable pancreatic tumors and&#xD;
      periampullary tumors. It is considered a safe procedure resulting from the continuous&#xD;
      improvement in surgical techniques over the years. Although postoperative mortality has&#xD;
      obviously decreased, pancreatic fistula is still a major challenge in pancreatic surgery and&#xD;
      remains the major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality after&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy(PD), ranging from 5% to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many risks factors have been shown to cause pancreatic fistula(PF) after the operation,&#xD;
      including advanced age, prolonged operation time, intraoperative hemorrhage, BMI, soft&#xD;
      pancreas, size of the main pancreatic duct and texture of the remnant pancreas. Among them,&#xD;
      soft pancreatic texture without a dilated main pancreatic duct is regarded as the most&#xD;
      important risk factor in predicting pancreatic fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serious consequences of pancreatic fistula result from the pancreatic juice becoming&#xD;
      activated by the bile and intestinal fluid, which will eventually corrupt the PJ anastomosis&#xD;
      and the surrounding normal tissues. The corrosion of the vasculature will lead to lethal&#xD;
      hemorrhage, which is the main cause of mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Furthermore,&#xD;
      pancreatin, together with the bacteria in the alimentary tract, will lead to intra-abdominal&#xD;
      infection and abscess. To reduce the pancreatic fistula rate, several techniques have been&#xD;
      described as alternatives to the conventional PJ anastomosis. Duct-to-mucosa sutures, binding&#xD;
      pancreaticojejunostomy and end-to-side invaginated fashion are widely used in the current&#xD;
      clinical setting. Some non-randomized studies showed that the duct-to-mucosa method was a&#xD;
      relatively safe approach. However, the prospective clinical study found that in comparison&#xD;
      with the conventional end-to-side anastomosis, duct-to-mucosa did not obviously decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of pancreatic fistula as well as other operative complications. The Peng's binding&#xD;
      anastomosis technique might be relatively simple to operate and have shorter operative time,&#xD;
      but as the raw pancreatic surface is exposed to the jejunal lumen directly after the&#xD;
      reconstruction, the activated pancreatic juice might lead to hemorrhage through vascular&#xD;
      corrosion. Moreover, a wide or large pancreatic stump will not fit the size of the jejunal&#xD;
      lumen, which could lead to anastomosis ischemia and leakage. The duct-to-mucosa method is not&#xD;
      affected by the size of pancreatic remnant and the jejunal lumen. The seromuscular layer of&#xD;
      the jejunum covers the pancreatic stump completely and will lower the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative hemorrhage. It was proved to be superior to invagination anastomosis in terms&#xD;
      of anastomotic patency and function. Unfortunately, in the cases of small main pancreatic&#xD;
      duct or normal soft pancreas, the duct-to-mucosa approach is difficult to operate and takes&#xD;
      more surgery time, while simultaneously increasing the incidence of postoperative pancreatic&#xD;
      fistula(POPF). Therefore, it is difficult to find a single superior strategy that applies to&#xD;
      every case. Selecting an optimal pancreaticojejunal anastomotic method should be based on the&#xD;
      different textures of pancreas and the various sizes of the main pancreatic duct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), which determines postoperative mortality, length&#xD;
      of hospital stayï¼Œ is dependent of its definition, and is reported in up to 16% of patients.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new anastomosis called &quot;nonstented&#xD;
      stump-closed&quot; pancreaticojejunostomy can reduce the POPF rate and downgrade compared with the&#xD;
      common accepted duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy. This&#xD;
      single-centre, open, randomized controlled trail is conducted following International Study&#xD;
      Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) criteria for pancreatic fistula (PF). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the POPF rate, and others include overall postoperative complication rate and&#xD;
      their severity reoperation rate and hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the comparison with classic pancreatic duct-to-mucosa anastomosis, to evaluate&#xD;
      whether &quot;nonstented stump closed&quot; pancreaticojejunal anastomosis can reduce the pancreatic&#xD;
      fistula and other complications incidence; to evaluated the safety and maneuverability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods :all patients diagnosed with periampullar occupations which should be&#xD;
      resected through pancreaticoduodenectomy will be evaluated before surgery, including&#xD;
      CT,Magnetic Resonance(MR), Ultrasound B ,blood biochemical checks and cardiac and thoracical&#xD;
      evaluations. Before the surgery, the patients are divided into two groups by randomization.&#xD;
      After the pancreaticoduodenectomy, the randomization number decided the procedure of the&#xD;
      pancreaticojejunostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staging investigations will be standard and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      pancreatic enhanced CT; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography(MRCP); PET-CT if&#xD;
      necessary;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block randomization will be done using a computer generated sheet. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed 1 day before the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries will be performed under general anesthesia with epidural analgesia. The surgery&#xD;
      will be either performed by or under the direct supervision of pancreatic surgeons with&#xD;
      experience in pancreaticojejunostomy surgery. Operative time, blood loss, blood product&#xD;
      replacement and all intraoperative details will be recorded in the proforma. Patients will be&#xD;
      shifted postoperatively to the anesthesia care unit (PCU) for observation and subsequently to&#xD;
      the recovery or high dependency ward once stabilized. Postoperative details including period&#xD;
      of postoperative pancreatic fistula,biliary leakage,postoperative haemorrhage,postoperative&#xD;
      pancreatitis , hospital stay and other complications will be recorded. Postoperative&#xD;
      mortality will be defined as 30-day mortality plus death before discharge after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: All collected data will be entered into a statistical software package for&#xD;
      subsequent analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main research variables:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the postoperative pancreatic fistula(POPF) rate.&#xD;

Close the pancreatic stump with interrupted inverting sutures around the &quot;papillary-like&quot; pancreatic duct.&#xD;
A small full-thickness enterotomy was penetrated on the jejunal wall for connecting to the &quot;papillary-like&quot; pancreatic duct by placing 4-6 sutures from the &quot;periductal&quot; parenchyma to the whole-layer jejunum hole. After that, interrupted sutures between the front wall of pancreatic stump and the seromuscular jejunum were performed by 4-0 absorbable sutures to complete the anastomosis.&#xD;
Duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy:Two layer anatomosis with &quot;Duct-to-Mucosa&quot; pancreaticojejunostomy is performed by suturing the pancreatic parenchyma to the jejunal seromuscular layer and no stenting tube was used.</description>
