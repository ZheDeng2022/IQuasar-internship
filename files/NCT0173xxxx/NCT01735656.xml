      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of coronary bifurcation lesion&#xD;
      (BL) remains a challenging task. The DK-crush have been established as a safe and efficacious&#xD;
      dual-stenting technique, which can effectively improve the success rate of final kissing&#xD;
      balloon inflation (FKBI) and reduce long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE). However,&#xD;
      in the clinical real world, especially when the bifurcation angle was relatively small, the&#xD;
      DK-crush still has several limitations, such as kissing unsatisfied (KUS), relatively complex&#xD;
      wiring or rewiring technique, incomplete stent coverage in the distal side of the side-branch&#xD;
      ostium and near the carina, severe stent deformation or evenly acute stent destruction. Our&#xD;
      observational study showed that the DK-culotte was also a safe and feasible dual-stenting&#xD;
      technique and was equal to DK-crush in terms of improving FKBI and MACE. Nonetheless, there&#xD;
      remain no studies for head-to-head comparison of clinical outcomes between the two&#xD;
      approaches. We, thereby, carry out a multicentre, non-inferior, randomized and controlled&#xD;
      trial to compare DK-culotte stenting versus DK-crush stenting in the treatment of true BL.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      How to properly treat coronary bifurcation lesion (BL) is still controversial in the field of&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The current guidelines recommended simpler&#xD;
      strategies, single crossover stenting or provisional stenting, as the preferred treatment.&#xD;
      However, the acute occlusion or loss of important branches, which affects immediate as well&#xD;
      as long-term outcomes, may result from such simpler strategies as treating severe true&#xD;
      bifurcation lesion (TBL). Therefore, for the procedural safety, double stenting is clinically&#xD;
      necessary particularly in treatment of major vessel bifurcation lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to date, a great number of double-stenting techniques have been introduced clinically:&#xD;
      crush stenting (classic crush, mini-crush, step-crush, DK-crush), culotte stenting (classic&#xD;
      or modified culotte stenting), T-stenting (classic or modified T), and V-stenting (step&#xD;
      V-stenting, simultaneous kissing stenting). Of which, crush-based and culotte-based stenting&#xD;
      have been the most popular techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DK-crush has been demonstrated as a safe and efficient procedure, which can effectively&#xD;
      elevate the success rate of final kissing balloon inflation (FKBI) and reduce long-term major&#xD;
      adverse cardiac events (MACE). However, in the clinical real world, especially when the&#xD;
      bifurcation angle was relative small or parallel, the DK-crush still has several limitations:&#xD;
      (1) although initial kissing balloon inflation (IKBI) can push away the struts covering the&#xD;
      side-branch ostium and remold the geometric shape of orifice, redundant struts will be&#xD;
      crushed aside onto parent-vessel wall and the side-branch ostium, thereby inducing turbulent&#xD;
      flow due to local unsmooth vessel lumen; (2) once the main-vessel stent was released, the&#xD;
      side-branch orifice will be squeezed crushed again, thus resulting in stent deformation,&#xD;
      malapposition or incomplete coverage near the bifurcation arena and carina; (3) because of&#xD;
      deformation or crush of the side-branch stent at its ostium, rewiring the side-branch may be&#xD;
      extremely hard with subsequent balloon passing difficulty, leading to low quality or failure&#xD;
      of FKBI, or sometimes stent destruction as the wire runs out of the stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culotte-based stenting has been demonstrated superior to crush-based stenting in reduction of&#xD;
      the side-branch restenosis though overall MACE is similar in Nordic studies [PMID: 20031690].&#xD;
      However, it is an essential requirement of similar size of the two branches when using the&#xD;
      conventional culotte stenting. As firstly described by us, the modified culotte stenting&#xD;
      [PMID: 22088451], to start with stenting the side-branch (smaller branch) and by&#xD;
      pre-imbedding a balloon in the main-branch for prevention of acute branch loss, has no strict&#xD;
      requirement of similar size of the two branches and has been proven to be a safe and&#xD;
      efficient procedure for treatment of TBL. However, if the diameter difference between two&#xD;
      branches is too much (&gt;0.75 mm), a circular under-expansion band (CUEB) of main-branch stent&#xD;
      in the parent vessel near the bifurcation arena will frequently occurred since the&#xD;
      side-branch stent implanted earlier will limit the expansion of the main-branch stent&#xD;
      implanted subsequently by its side-hole and the portion protruding into the parent vessel,&#xD;
      leading to local stent malapposition and the risk of in-stent thrombosis. For overcome CUEB,&#xD;
      we further improved culotte-based stenting to order to develop a novel culotte stenting, the&#xD;
      DK-mini-culotte stenting, by the following modifications: (1) pre-imbedding a balloon in the&#xD;
      main-branch for prevention of acute vessel loss, (2) firstly stenting the smaller side-branch&#xD;
      with shorter protrusion (mini-protrusion) of the stent into the parent vessel, (3) performing&#xD;
      IKBI prior to the main-branch stenting for fully expanding the side-hole and protruded&#xD;
      portion of the side-branch stent, (4) finally stenting main-branch after IKBI, followed by&#xD;
      FKBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our series studies, including mimic stenting in artificial vessel in vitro, hemodynamics and&#xD;
      flow-field investigations in vitro or in vivo, and pilot clinical observation, have&#xD;
      demonstrated that the DK-mini-culotte stenting is necessary for the achievement of&#xD;
      high-quality hemodynamic and morphological results, and is superior to the crush-based&#xD;
      techniques for treating TBL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly, our initial clinical experience has shown the DK-mini-culotte stenting has&#xD;
      several advantages: (1) efficiently eliminating CUEB and preventing stent malapposition by&#xD;
      IKBI;(2) technically easier to be performed, particularly for wiring/rewiring and for balloon&#xD;
      passing during IKBI and FKBI; (3) technically safer to complete the procedure, especially for&#xD;
      preventing the acute vessel occlusion or loss; (4) effectively preventing the deformation and&#xD;
      collapse that occasionally happened when using the crush-based stenting; (5) mostly close to&#xD;
      the general technique for treating BL regardless of size difference of branches and&#xD;
      bifurcation angle; (6) potentially long-term benefits because of complete and even stent&#xD;
      coverage in the treated segments particularly in the bifurcation arena and carina. However,&#xD;
      there remains no strictly compared study to validate whether the above-mentioned technical&#xD;
      superiorities can be translated into clinical benefits as using the DK-mini-culotte stenting&#xD;
      for treatment of BL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, we hypothesized that the DK-mini-culotte stenting is not only feasible technically but&#xD;
      also may be superior to or at least not inferior to the DK-crush stenting in terms of&#xD;
      reducing in-stent restenosis and MACE. Hereby, we now carry out a head-to-head, prospective,&#xD;
      multicentre, non-inferior, randomized and controlled study to compare DK-culotte stenting&#xD;
      versus DK-crush stenting in the treatment of TBL.&#xD;
