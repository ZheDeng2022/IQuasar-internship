      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - HER2/neu (HER2) is a tumor protein that appears in almost a third of breast cancers and in&#xD;
      several other types of cancers such as colon, prostate and non-small cell lung. Tumors that&#xD;
      overexpress HER2 can be associated with a more aggressive cancer, higher recurrence rates,&#xD;
      and reduced survival rates. Researchers are testing a therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system to recognize HER2. The vaccine, called AdHER2/neu dendritic cell&#xD;
      vaccine, is custom-made using an individual's own immune cells. These cells will be collected&#xD;
      and used to produce the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of AdHER2 vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have HER2-expressing tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an apheresis procedure to collect immune cells to create the&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive five doses of the vaccine at study Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored with physical exams, frequent blood tests and imaging&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as c-erbB2 or neu) is a&#xD;
           proto-oncogene that encodes a 185-kd transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that&#xD;
           participates in receptor-receptor interactions that regulate cell growth,&#xD;
           differentiation and proliferation. Its over-expression contributes to neoplastic&#xD;
           transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HER2 is over-expressed in up to 25-30% of node-positive or node-negative primary breast&#xD;
           cancers and is associated with clinically aggressive breast cancer, a high recurrence&#xD;
           rate and reduced survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab (Herceptin (Registered trademark)) is a recombinant humanized mouse&#xD;
           monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to the extracellular (EC) domain of the HER2&#xD;
           receptor. Its clinical efficacy is limited to patients with 3+ HER2 tumor expression&#xD;
           documented by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a Vysis fluorescent in situ hybridization&#xD;
           (FISH) ratio of greater than 2.2. IHC is a subjective measurement of HER2/neu protein&#xD;
           while FISH is an objective measurement of amplification of the HER2 oncogene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although the use of trastuzumab has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, a&#xD;
           significant number of patients are unresponsive to therapy and most eventually&#xD;
           experience clinical progression. At present no vaccine is available that induces&#xD;
           patients to make their own anti-HER2 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose to investigate the use of an adenoviral vector (Ad5f35) expressing human&#xD;
           HER2ECTM (Ad5f35HER2ECTM- AdHER2) to transduce autologous dendritic cells for&#xD;
           therapeutic vaccination in patients with HER2 expressing solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the safety and toxicity of autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, to determine if the fraction of patients with cancer therapeutics-related&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD), defined as a decrease in LVEF &gt;=10 percentage points, to a value&#xD;
      LVEF to less than or equal to 53% (normal reference value for two-dimensional (2-D)&#xD;
      echocardiography), is sufficiently low to warrant further development in subsequent trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the immunogenicity of autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination as measured&#xD;
      by a 3-fold increase in anti-HER2/neu antibody concentration or a 4-fold increase in antibody&#xD;
      dilution titers over baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label, non-randomized, two-part, phase I study of 48 weeks duration for evaluation of&#xD;
      primary endpoints with extended follow-up out to 30 months to monitor LVEF cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I involves vaccine dose escalation in a population with no prior exposure to trastuzumab&#xD;
      or other HER2-targeted therapies to determine if there is a significant, adverse safety&#xD;
      signal regarding cardiac toxicity, in addition to preliminary assessment of the vaccine s&#xD;
      immunogenicity and clinical activity. Five doses of 5, 10, 20 or 40 x 10(6) viable&#xD;
      cells/AdHER2 DC vaccine will be given intradermally at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic solid tumors or high risk bladder cancer in the adjuvant setting Response&#xD;
      will be evaluated by a Modified Immune- Related Response Criteria (irRC) based on Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1) (modified irRC) at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 with confirmatory scans obtained&#xD;
      not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. Adjuvant bladder&#xD;
      cancer patients will undergo re-staging at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 with confirmatory scans&#xD;
      obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II is identical to part I, in the schedule of treatment and response evaluation,but is&#xD;
      conducted in a population with prior exposure to trastuzumab and other HER2-targeted&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
