  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer that has returned after local treatment usually responds to hormone blocking&#xD;
      treatment, but most patients eventually experience disease progression. Further chemotherapy&#xD;
      does not normally lead to a cure or dramatic improvement in the disease and there is a need&#xD;
      to identify new drugs that are beneficial for these patients without unacceptable side&#xD;
      effects. Prodrug chemotherapy is an approach in which an inactive non-toxic agent is&#xD;
      administered to the patient and gets activated within the body at specific locations,&#xD;
      resulting in a higher concentration of the cytotoxic form at a tumour location whilst&#xD;
      avoiding general side effects. G-202 is an example of prodrug chemotherapy. It does not have&#xD;
      many general side effects because it is converted to a cell toxin only at the tumour or other&#xD;
      specific locations in the body. G-202 is activated by Prostate Specific Memory Antigen&#xD;
      (PSMA), a substance expressed by prostate cancer cells and in the blood vessels of most solid&#xD;
      tumours, but not by normal cells or blood vessels in normal tissue. It is believed that&#xD;
      activation of the prodrug G-202 will allow the drug to kill cancer cells, particularly&#xD;
      prostate cancer cells. This study will evaluate the activity and safety of G-202 in men with&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which means the cancer has progressed after&#xD;
      hormone blocking treatment, but who have not yet received chemotherapy and who have no or&#xD;
      only a few symptoms from their CRPC. The study will evaluate clinical activity and safety of&#xD;
      G-202 administered on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle.&#xD;

      Patients will undergo a screening period of up to 4 weeks. Patients who are deemed eligible&#xD;
      will be entered into the study and undergo treatment with G-202. G-202 will be administered&#xD;
      by intravenous infusion over one hour on Days 1, 2 and 3 of a 28-day treatment cycle. The&#xD;
      G-202 dose will be 40 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 66.8 mg/m2 on Days 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the percentage of patients with&#xD;
      chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who do not have disease&#xD;
      progression (radiographic or clinical) after 24 weeks of treatment with G-202.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage study design will be used to evaluate the percentage of patients who do not have&#xD;
      disease progression after 24 weeks of treatment with G-202. If the percent of patients who&#xD;
      are progression-free at 24 weeks is at most 15%, then the clinical efficacy of G-202 in this&#xD;
      patient population will be considered unacceptably low. If, on the other hand, the percent of&#xD;
      patients who are progression-free at 24 weeks is at least 35%, this will be considered&#xD;
      sufficient evidence to consider further clinical investigation. The null hypothesis that the&#xD;
      percent of patients who are progression-free at 24 weeks is at most 15% will be tested&#xD;
      against the alternative hypothesis that the percent is greater than 15% at the one-sided 10%&#xD;
      significance level. In order to avoid a suspension in accrual awaiting interim analysis, a&#xD;
      two-stage study design for evaluating survival probabilities with continual accrual will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis for futility will be conducted after 24 evaluable patients have been&#xD;
      accrued assuming that the time between accrual of the first patient and accrual of the 24th&#xD;
      patient is at least 8 months. If 24 patients are accrued in less than 8 months, accrual will&#xD;
      continue until the time period between the date of accrual of the first patient and the date&#xD;
      of accrual of the last patient is at least 8 months. If the trial is not terminated for&#xD;
      futility after the interim analysis, an additional 10 patients will be accrued for a total of&#xD;
      34 patients. The two-stage design minimizes the expected duration of accrual under the null&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the interim analysis, any patient who discontinues participation for reasons other than&#xD;
      safety or disease progression before completing three full cycles and undergoing the 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up assessment will be replaced. Any replaced patient will be included in all study&#xD;
      analyses of the intent-to-treat and safety populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by the reporting of adverse events, vital signs and assessment of&#xD;
      findings on physical exam and routine laboratory determinations. The severity of adverse&#xD;
      events and laboratory findings will be assessed according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Effects (CTCAE) V4.&#xD;
