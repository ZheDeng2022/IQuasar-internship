  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll Veterans with chronic pain who have been receiving opioid medications&#xD;
      (like methadone, percocet, oxycontin) on a regular basis for at least 3 months to treat their&#xD;
      pain. The purpose of this study is to understand if two automated interventions that are&#xD;
      delivered by phone can improve the safe and effective use of opioid medications and the&#xD;
      physical functioning of Veterans with chronic pain who take opioid medications. One&#xD;
      intervention, opioid monitoring, will include monthly automated calls to the enrolled Veteran&#xD;
      to ask questions about their use of the opioid medications, pain relief, side effects, effect&#xD;
      of pain on physical activity and mood and satisfaction with pain care. The other&#xD;
      intervention, skills training, includes learning pain management skills using automated calls&#xD;
      and a self-help book with weekly feedback calls from a nurse. Veterans who are enrolled in&#xD;
      this study will be randomly assigned (by chance, like a flip of a coin) to receive either&#xD;
      opioid monitoring only, self-management only, self-management plus opioid monitoring or a&#xD;
      weekly automated phone call with wellness tips. Everyone enrolled in the study will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires about their pain and other pain-related information at the beginning of the&#xD;
      trial, after the interventions are completed 12 weeks later, and 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      treatment ends.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to: 1) test the effectiveness of an automated intervention&#xD;
      system called COMPACT for improving pain-relevant outcomes including physical functioning and&#xD;
      pain intensity; 2) determine whether opioid monitoring promotes guideline concordant care;&#xD;
      and 3) examine key components of the intervention process to inform future implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, controlled, multi-site, factorial design trial of a technology&#xD;
      supported treatment program called COMPACT relative to enhanced usual care (EUC) in the PACT&#xD;
      setting. Participants will include 380 Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT) and&#xD;
      reporting chronic musculoskeletal pain of at least moderate severity. Outcomes of interest&#xD;
      include pain-related physical functioning, pain intensity, presence of guideline concordant&#xD;
      care practices, and provider satisfaction. Enrolled participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive COMPACT treatment or EUC. At baseline, 12 weeks (post-treatment), 24 weeks&#xD;
      (follow-up) and 36 weeks (follow-up) all participants will undergo an opioid risk evaluation&#xD;
      and assessment of all outcome variables. Participants randomized to COMPACT treatment will&#xD;
      received interactive voice response (IVR)-based pain self management training and monthly&#xD;
      opioid risk monitoring. Throughout treatment COMPACT participants will undergo automated&#xD;
      monthly opioid risk monitoring and collection of patient reported opioid use, pain intensity,&#xD;
      physical functioning, emotional functioning and quality of life data. Monthly opioid risk&#xD;
      monitoring information will be made available to PACT clinicians via automatic entry into&#xD;
      CPRS prior to a scheduled opioid renewal appointment. Participants in the EUC condition will&#xD;
      undergo assessment of outcome variables and opioid risk assessment at 12-, 24- and 36-weeks&#xD;
      post baseline only; they will not receive treatment or opioid monitoring.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of the effect of the OM intervention on providers' concordance with VA/DoD chronic opioid treatment practice guidelines will be a quality score (scale 0 - 8) that represents the number of practices out of eight key practices to which providers adhered at the 12 weeks follow up. The eight key practices considered are: use of UDS, contra-indicated co-prescription, non-medication treatments, no psychiatric at risk/SUD, acetaminophen over-prescription, risky sedative co-prescription, bowel regimen and serious adverse effects</description>
