  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well imetelstat sodium works in treating participants&#xD;
      with primary or secondary myelofibrosis and other myeloid malignancies. Imetelstat sodium may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of imetelstat (imetelstat sodium) in myelofibrosis&#xD;
      (MF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of imetelstat in the reduction of spleen size, as measured by&#xD;
      physical examination (palpable distance from the left costal margin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the efficacy of imetelstat in improving anemia or inducing red blood cell&#xD;
      transfusion-independence in previously transfusion-dependent participants (per International&#xD;
      Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment [IWG-MRT] criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate onset and durability of response as defined in primary and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of imetelstat on bone marrow histology, karyotype and JAK2V617F&#xD;
      allele burden II. To evaluate the effect of imetelstat on leukocytosis, circulating blast&#xD;
      count, circulating immature myeloid cell count and thrombocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants receive imetelstat sodium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1.&#xD;
      Participants may continue to receive imetelstat study treatment for as long as they derive&#xD;
      clinical benefit or until study end. The study end when all participants discontinued study&#xD;
      drug, the last participant enrolled has been treated for approximately 5.7 years, or&#xD;
      imetelstat is commercially available in the United States, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum duration of study was approximately 5.7 years. Arm C was never initiated, and&#xD;
      participants allocated to Arm C (Imetelstat 9.4 mg/kg [with MF]) were reassigned to Arms A&#xD;
      and B.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at 1 site in the United States from 29 October 2012 to 22 January 2014 (end of recruitment). Data analyses includes data through 24 May 2018. Study has 4 phases: Screening Phase, Core Phase:up to nine 21-day (Arms A,B) or 28-day (Arms D,E,F,G) cycle, Extension Phase: after Cycle 9 to continue treatment with imetelstat; Event Monitoring Phase:Follow-up for those who discontinued treatment to collect survival status, disease status, and subsequent treatment information.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 80 participants with Intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis (PMF)/post-polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (post-PV/ET) MF (Arms A, B, C, E and F) or blast-phase MF (Arm D only) or spliceosome-mutated (or with ring sideroblasts) myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS]/ myeloproliferative neoplasm [MPN] (Arm G only) were enrolled to receive imetelstat. Arm C (Imetelstat 9.4 mg/kg [with MF]) was never initiated, participants allocated to Arm C were reassigned to Arm A or B.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants could receive imetelstat beyond Cycle 9 in the Extension Phase if they did not meet any of the withdrawal criteria, did not have disease progression and were receiving clinical benefit from treatment as determined by the investigator. Following treatment discontinuation, participants entered the Event Monitoring Phase for collection of survival status, disease status, and subsequent treatment information (Up to approximately 5.7 years).</description>
