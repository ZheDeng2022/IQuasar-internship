    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the United States with over 60,000 new&#xD;
      cases each year. It can usually be treated initially by insertion of an endoscope into the&#xD;
      bladder and surgically removing the tumor, a procedure known as cystoscopy and trans-urethral&#xD;
      resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). For most patients this procedure will successfully remove&#xD;
      all of the detectable tumor. Unfortunately over 40% of all patients will develop a cancer&#xD;
      recurrence in less than two years and all patients remain at increased risk of recurrence for&#xD;
      the remainder of their lives. This risk requires life long monitoring and this is best&#xD;
      accomplished with regular cystoscopic examinations. The goal of this study is to test whether&#xD;
      the drug valproic acid can cause changes in bladder tumors that might inhibit their growth.&#xD;
      Patients with suspected bladder cancer will be invited to participate in the study, if a&#xD;
      tumor is observed during cystoscopy it will be sampled for research purposes and then&#xD;
      according to standards of care, the patient scheduled for TURBT under general anesthesia. In&#xD;
      the interval between discovery of a bladder tumor and resection, usually two to four weeks,&#xD;
      the patient will be given valproic acid to take orally. In addition, tumors from patients&#xD;
      with known or suspected bladder cancer referred for TURBT or cystectomy will be sampled. The&#xD;
      tumor pieces obtained before and after taking valproic acid and from the referral patients&#xD;
      not treated with valproic acid will be analyzed to see if the drug has changed what genes are&#xD;
      active. We have found that valproic acid causes bladder cancer cells to make more of the&#xD;
      protein, thrombospondin-1. This protein inhibits the growth of new blood vessels and so&#xD;
      increased thrombospondin-1 in bladder tumors should inhibit their growth by decreasing the&#xD;
      blood supply. Valproic acid may change thrombospondin-1 levels through inhibition of histone&#xD;
      deacetylases. We will also assay HDAC activity in the tumor specimens. If valproic acid&#xD;
      alters thrombospondin-1 levels and HDAC activity in bladder cancer patients further study to&#xD;
      see if it can reduce growth will be justified. Valproic acid is a drug approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of seizure disorders that is generally well tolerated with few side effects. It may&#xD;
      prove useful in reducing bladder cancer recurrence and progression.&#xD;
