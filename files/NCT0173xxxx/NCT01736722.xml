    <textblock>
      The Methodist Hospital Neurological Institute is conducting a clinical trial for patients&#xD;
      suffering from Metastatic brain tumors. The objective for this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of a MRI-guided laser thermal therapy during a real-time MRI guidance&#xD;
      for the treatment of brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will undergo laser therapy using the MRI scan to plan the treatment and ensure proper&#xD;
      placement of the laser within the tumor. The tumor will then be heated by the laser and&#xD;
      monitored by study physicians through the real-time MRI to see and control temperatures in&#xD;
      the tissue. One in place, the thermal laser will then surgically remove the lesions. After&#xD;
      the procedure, post treatment MR images will thenbe acquired for the determination of the&#xD;
      effective treatment region.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for evaluating the feasibility and safety of MR-guided laser thermal ablation&#xD;
      of treatment-resistant brain tumors using the Visualase® Thermal Therapy System (Manufactured&#xD;
      by BioTex, Inc., Houston, TX). The Visualase system is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation&#xD;
      in a number of surgical specialties including Neurosurgery (see appendix for documentation).&#xD;
      Patients with intracranial brain tumors measuring 3 cm or smaller in largest diameter that&#xD;
      have failed any conventional therapy (surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target tissue containing the tumor will undergo MRI-guided laser induced thermal therapy.&#xD;
      MR imaging is used to define the treatment volume as well as plan and verify placement of the&#xD;
      applicator. The extent of ablation is quantitatively monitored and displayed during delivery&#xD;
      using real-time, MR temperature imaging. MR temperature imaging will also be used to monitor&#xD;
      and control the temperature of adjacent tissues. Treatment will be automatically stopped if&#xD;
      the MR temperature feedback system reports the temperature in the adjacent tissue has risen&#xD;
      above a preset threshold. Treatment can be manually stopped by the neurosurgeon monitoring&#xD;
      the treatment in real-time at any point during the procedure by simply turning off the power&#xD;
      to the laser from the Visualase® system console. After laser delivery, MR images can be used&#xD;
      to verify the extent of treatment and plan a therapy delivery if necessary.&#xD;
