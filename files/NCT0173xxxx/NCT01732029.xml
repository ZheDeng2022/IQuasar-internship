  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulse oximetry is a standard non-invasive method of measuring blood oxygen saturation (SpO2).&#xD;
      In developing countries, pulse oximeters are rare because of expense and electricity&#xD;
      requirements. Our ECEM group has developed the Phone Oximeter, which uses a cell phone (which&#xD;
      are widely available in developing countries) to compute and analyze information from a pulse&#xD;
      oximeter sensor. To further reduce costs, we have developed an oximeter sensor (AudioOx) that&#xD;
      plugs into the audio jack of a standard cell phone. This study aims to calibrate the AudioOx&#xD;
      by exposing 30 healthy adult volunteers to various altitudes in UBC's hypoxia chamber.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We at the Electrical and Computer Engineering in Medicine Group (ECEM) at the University of&#xD;
      British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, plan to make pulse oximetry available to resource poor&#xD;
      countries by designing a low-cost, battery-powered pulse oximeter device consisting of a&#xD;
      low-cost pulse oximeter sensor connected to a cell phone. The use of cell phones as patient&#xD;
      monitors is appealing as they are widely available in many developing countries. Utilizing&#xD;
      battery power, cell phones do not rely on a continuous source of electricity. This is&#xD;
      essential, as most low-resource settings lack adequate infrastructure and thus cannot provide&#xD;
      the uninterrupted power supply required for conventional patient monitoring. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      cell phone has the efficiency, integrated display, and processing power required to analyze&#xD;
      and store the raw data derived from the pulse oximeter sensors. Data from the pulse oximeter&#xD;
      can be transmitted to referral centers for diagnostic and advisory purposes where cellular&#xD;
      and networking services permit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proprietary oximeter sensors and modules are expensive. To reduce cost, we are proposing to&#xD;
      develop a simple audio pulse oximeter sensor (AudioOx) that that does not require a sensor&#xD;
      module and interfaces via the audio jack of any standard cell phone. By utilizing the audio&#xD;
      jack for transmission of data from the sensor to phone, we can ensure that cell phone types&#xD;
      most common in various areas of the world are universally supported. Preliminary laboratory&#xD;
      tests showed that oximetry data from the AudioOx has sufficient signal strength and&#xD;
      resolution for extraction of heart rate and SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that this study will allow us to successfully calibrate the AudioOx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of pulse oximeters requires calibration and evaluation for accuracy. There is no&#xD;
      acceptable surrogate calibration tool for pulse oximeters. To quote the current International&#xD;
      Organization for Standardization (ISO) Pulse Oximetry standard document: &quot;There is today no&#xD;
      accepted method of verifying the correct calibration of a pulse oximeter probe/pulse oximeter&#xD;
      monitor combination other than testing on human beings. This is due to the complexity of the&#xD;
      optical intricacies of the interaction of light and human tissue upon which pulse oximetry&#xD;
      depends&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous calibration study was performed on volunteers during a concurrent study in the UBC&#xD;
      hypoxia chamber. The results demonstrated that the AudioOx can be calibrated to within the 4%&#xD;
      accuracy required by ISO. The study setup, however, was suboptimal as the measured SpO2 data&#xD;
      was predominantly hypoxic. Motion artifacts were also abundant, as the subjects had&#xD;
      unrestricted movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to improve the calibration of the AudioOx by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asking subjects to remain relatively immobile during data measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposing subjects to a very gradual change in oxygen concentration so that measurements&#xD;
           are distributed over the entire clinical range of SpO2 (70% to 100%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using two (instead of one) clinically-approved pulse oximeters from different&#xD;
           manufacturers as secondary reference standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objective is to evaluate and compare the performance of the AudioOx during&#xD;
      motion, low perfusion, and rapidly changing SpO2 by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asking the subjects to perform standardized hand and finger motions during data&#xD;
           measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simulating low perfusion via two methods: by partially occluding the brachial artery&#xD;
           using a blood pressure cuff and by having the patient raise their arm for two minutes&#xD;
           and using light filters to reduce the red and infra-red signals detected by the pulse&#xD;
           oximeter sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measuring SpO2 as the subject enters and exits the hypoxia chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a non-invasive concurrent observational study of healthy voluntary adult&#xD;
      subjects in a normobaric (sea-level atmospheric pressure) hypoxia (low oxygen) chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be put into a hypoxic state by exposing them to normobaric hypoxia by&#xD;
      administrating an air mix containing a reduced O2 concentration. This is achieved in a&#xD;
      hypoxia chamber where O2 concentration is gradually reduced to simulate high altitude (about&#xD;
      4500 m).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the current study are very similar to another study conducted in the hypoxia&#xD;
      chamber (REB ID#H12-02362, The Camera Oximeter), the same methodology is applied. This will&#xD;
      allow recruiting subjects for both studies and will reduce the total number of subjects&#xD;
      necessary for achieving our goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibration of SpO2 Data from the initial set of subjects (at least 10) in the study will be&#xD;
      used to calibrate the AudioOx oximetry data. Firstly, ratio R is calculated from the red and&#xD;
      infra-red (IR) photo-absorbance signals, where&#xD;
&#xD;
      R = ( ACRED / DCRED ) / ( ACIR / DCIR )&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACRED and ACIR are pulsatile components of the red and infra-red light detected by the&#xD;
      oximeter photosensor. DCRED and DCIR are constant components of the red and infra-red light&#xD;
      detected by the oximeter photosensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      R values are paired to the reference SpO2 values (average of the two readings from the two&#xD;
      reference pulse oximeters) and plotted on a scatter plot. Depending on the shape of the plot,&#xD;
      the R values are translated to SpO2 values using a linear equation, multiple linear&#xD;
      equations, or polynomial equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readings from the oximeter sensors are grouped into six ranges (70-75%, 76-80%, 81-85%,&#xD;
      86-90%, 91-95% and 96-100%). For each range of SpO2 and the overall range (70-100%) accuracy&#xD;
      will be calculated as per ISO definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy of the pulse oximeter shall be stated in terms of the root-mean-square (rms)&#xD;
      difference between AudioOx values (SpO2i) and reference values (SRi), as given by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms = √((∑i=1 to n(SpO2i- SRi)^2 )/n)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To express Accuracy relative to the &quot;gold-standard&quot; blood gas analysis, the error of the&#xD;
      secondary standard pulse oximeter (errorref) will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy = √(Arms^2 + error(ref)^2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion &amp; low perfusion will be quantified by the proportion of time that the test&#xD;
      measurements either gave no readings or were more than 4% different from the corresponding&#xD;
      control measurements.&#xD;
