      The objective of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABT-199&#xD;
      (venetoclax) in patients with advanced Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). A secondary&#xD;
      objective is to explore clinical response to ABT-199 (venetoclax) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      CTCL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized study with venetoclax (ABT-199) in CTCL&#xD;
      patients (subtypes mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome only, and excluding transformed&#xD;
      mycosis fungoides). This study is planned to be conducted in 18 patients, 18 years or older&#xD;
      in age, undergoing a 5-week dose escalation protocol (per the US FDA package insert&#xD;
      guidelines of venetoclax for CLL). Safety monitoring will continue throughout the whole&#xD;
      period of drug administration and the treatment will be discontinued if intolerable toxicity&#xD;
      (defined in Stopping Rules) or disease progression occurs during this period.&#xD;

    <description>Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and receive venetoclax daily per the US FDA package insert guidelines of venetoclax, with dose escalation up to 400 mg. To minimize the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), and following the package insert directions for dose escalation over 5 weeks, the initial dose is 20 mg daily, and may be progressively increased as tolerated to 400 mg by week 5.</description>
