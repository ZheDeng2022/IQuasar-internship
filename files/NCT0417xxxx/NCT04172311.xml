      In this study, the efficacy of add-on modified Atkins diet will be compared with add-on&#xD;
      Levetiracetam in children with refractory epilepsy in a randomized open label trial. The&#xD;
      results will aid clinicians in deciding the treatment options when a child has been diagnosed&#xD;
      to have refractory epilepsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate&#xD;
      seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological and social consequences of this&#xD;
      condition. Epilepsy is a disabling and common neurological condition which rank 4th in the&#xD;
      world's neurological disorder burden, which can be controlled successfully in most of the&#xD;
      patients with one or more antiepileptic drugs. But approximately 30% of patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy have refractory epilepsy, which is, a failure to respond to adequate trials of two&#xD;
      tolerated, appropriately chosen and used antiepileptic drug schedules to achieve sustained&#xD;
      relief of seizures.Many severe and catastrophic epilepsies present in children such as West&#xD;
      syndrome, Lennox Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome. Uncontrolled epilepsy carries significant&#xD;
      risks for the affected child, such as injuries, cognitive and behavioural problems. Epilepsy&#xD;
      surgery is a good option but it is expensive and not easily available. Also, many children&#xD;
      with refractory epilepsy are not good surgical candidates. Hence there is a need to consider&#xD;
      alternative treatments in these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ketogenic diet is an individually calculated and rigidly controlled high-fat, low&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet used for the treatment of difficult to control seizures. The ketogenic diet&#xD;
      is an effective treatment option for refractory childhood epilepsy however it is very&#xD;
      restrictive and difficult to implement in low resource settings. The modified Atkins diet is&#xD;
      a less restrictive alternative to the traditional ketogenic diet. This diet is started on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis without a fast, and allows unlimited protein and fat. This diet has been&#xD;
      shown to be equally effective as the ketogenic diet and a useful option in&#xD;
      resource-constraint settings. The modified Atkins diet has been demonstrated to be effective&#xD;
      in refractory childhood epilepsy in two randomized controlled trials from India. However, in&#xD;
      both these trials the control groups continued their ongoing antiepileptic medication without&#xD;
      any new treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levetiracetam is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs available for treating drug resistant&#xD;
      epilepsy. It is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug effective in most seizure types. It also&#xD;
      has an excellent pharmacokinetics and tolerability profile with no known pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interactions. Use of levetiracetam as an add on drug in refractory childhood epilepsy&#xD;
      recently in some published studies has shown good efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the efficacy of add-on modified Atkins diet will be compared with add-on&#xD;
      Levetiracetam in children with refractory epilepsy in a randomized open label trial. The&#xD;
      results will aid clinicians in deciding the treatment options when a child has been diagnosed&#xD;
      to have refractory epilepsy.&#xD;
