  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the effect that CFI-400945 and durvalumab have on&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFI-400945 is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests show that it works by&#xD;
      blocking a specific protein called Polo-like Kinase 4 (PLK4) that is involved in cancer cell&#xD;
      growth. CFI-400945 may slow down the growth of cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
      This drug has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 60&#xD;
      patients. It appears to be well tolerated with few side effects. CFI-400945 seems promising&#xD;
      but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Durvalumab is an immunotherapy&#xD;
      drug and not a chemotherapy drug. Laboratory tests show that it works by allowing the immune&#xD;
      system (PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction) to detect your cancer and reactivating the immune&#xD;
      response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
      Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 6000&#xD;
      people. In laboratory studies, when used together with CFI-400945, results seem promising but&#xD;
      it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone. This is the&#xD;
      first time that the combination of CFI-400945 and durvalumab has been tested in patients.&#xD;
