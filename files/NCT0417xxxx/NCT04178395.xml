      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can change the excitability of the central&#xD;
      nervous system and contribute to motor recovery of stroke patients. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the benefit of tDCS may increase with interventions facilitating motor&#xD;
      responses, such as repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation (rPNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study was to examine the short and long-term effects of real vs sham&#xD;
      bihemispheric tDCS on scales of motor function and neurophysiological tests in patients with&#xD;
      acute stroke and a moderate/severe motor impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was prospective, randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled. Twenty acute&#xD;
      stroke patients (ischemic and haemorrhagic) with Upper limb Fugl-Meyer (ULFM) score&lt;19 were&#xD;
      randomized in two parallel groups: one group received 5 consecutive daily sessions of anodal&#xD;
      tDCS over the affected hemisphere (AH) and cathodal over unaffected hemisphere combined with&#xD;
      rPNS and the other received sham tDCS associated to rPNS. Pacients were examined before tDCS,&#xD;
      5 days and 3, 6 and 12 months after tDCS. The investigators evaluated ULFM and modified&#xD;
      Ashworth scales (MAS), resting motor threshold, motor and somatosensory evoked potentials&#xD;
      (MEPs and SEPs), silent periods and Hmax/Mmax ratio.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      used to induce excitability changes in central nervous system circuits. The basis of tDCS&#xD;
      application in stroke patients follows the model of interhemispheric imbalance between the&#xD;
      damaged and intact hemispheres: anodal tDCS over affected hemisphere to induce long-lasting&#xD;
      increase in cortical excitability, cathodal tDCS over unaffected hemisphere to induce&#xD;
      long-lasting decrease in cortical excitability. Simultaneous effects on both hemispheres can&#xD;
      be obtained with bi-hemispheric tDCS. Minimum intensity and duration of tDCS is necessary to&#xD;
      induce long-lasting effects, which are referred as long-term potentiation and long-term&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most interventional tDCS studies have focused on chronic stroke patients, at a time in which&#xD;
      patients are supposed to have reached a plateau in their spontaneous recovery after the&#xD;
      lesion. Less research has evaluated the effects of an early tDCS intervention. tDCS protocols&#xD;
      differ in location of electrodes, session frequency and duration, dosage of electrical&#xD;
      charge, temporal window of tDCS delivery and other variables. The functional benefit of tDCS&#xD;
      may increase with the concomitant application of adjuvant therapeutic strategies such as&#xD;
      constraint-induced therapy, electrical stimulation or robot-mediated therapy. Sattler et al.&#xD;
      used radial nerve stimulation, together with tDCS, to facilitate motor output. It is possible&#xD;
      that repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation (rPNS) modulates corticospinal output at&#xD;
      somatotopically specific supraspinal sites through GABAergic interneurons. The patients that&#xD;
      improved in Sattler et al.'s study, as in other tDCS studies, had an initial mild to moderate&#xD;
      impairment of motor function. Improvement is more dubious in patients presenting with severe&#xD;
      motor deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim in this study was to examine the effectiveness of bihemispheric tDCS combined with&#xD;
      rPNS in acute stroke patients with pronounced motor impairment, the group of patients with&#xD;
      fewer options in therapeutic programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit of applying tDCS early after stroke is still unclear. However, based on animal&#xD;
      models, the first month after stroke seems to be the optimal period to induce morphological&#xD;
      changes associated with increased plasticity, hence the therapeutic window was chosen between&#xD;
      5 and 20 days after the stroke event. The investigators reasoned that, if plastic changes&#xD;
      have been induced by tDCS, the clinical and neurophysiological benefit may manifest not just&#xD;
      immediately after treatment, but further ahead in the patient's natural evolution after the&#xD;
      stroke. For this reason, the investigators considered relevant to determine if the results of&#xD;
      tDCS treatment persisted in time and had a long-term effect, therefore extended our clinical&#xD;
      and neurophysiological follow-up to 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients with a history of first acute stroke (ischemic and haemorrhagic) were&#xD;
      included, from April through December 2011, in a prospective, double-blind, randomized study.&#xD;
      Eleven patients were affected by an ischemic stroke: cortical and/or subcortical and 9 were&#xD;
      affected by a haemorrhagic stroke. Inclusion criteria were: first time single and unilateral&#xD;
      supratentorial stroke confirmed by CT or MRI, stroke interval between 5 and 20 days of study&#xD;
      onset, age 18 to 79 years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≥6 and ≤21.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were preceding epileptic seizures, metallic implants within the brain or&#xD;
      pacemaker implants and coexistence of other neurological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were included in the study when they were medically stable, between 5 and 17 days&#xD;
      after the stroke event. The study was conducted in according to the World Medical Association&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (PR160/11).&#xD;
      Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants or their relatives before their&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized in two parallel groups: one group (11 patients) received 5&#xD;
      consecutive daily sessions of anodal tDCS over the affected hemisphere and cathodal over&#xD;
      unaffected hemisphere combined with repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation and the other (9&#xD;
      patients) received sham tDCS associated to repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were examined before tDCS, 5 days and 3, 6 and 12 months after tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments Patients' condition was characterized using standardized clinical and&#xD;
      neurophysiological assessment tools on the day before onset of interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment Neurological functioning was assessed using the NIHSS. Motor assessment&#xD;
      of the paretic upper limb and spasticity were evaluated using the upper limb Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      (ULFM) and Modified Ashworth scales (MAS). MAS scale measures were taken for shoulder&#xD;
      abduction, elbow extension and wrist extension, which were used to calculate the mean value&#xD;
      of resistance during passive stretching, with higher scores reflecting greater resistance&#xD;
      (maximum 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded using a biphasic magnetic stimulator (Magstim&#xD;
      200; The Magstim Co. Ltd., UK) connected to a figure-of-eight magnetic stimulating coil&#xD;
      (70-mm outer diameter; The Magstim Co. Ltd., UK) placed over the cortical abductor digiti&#xD;
      minimi hotspot. A tight-fitting cloth cap marked with a 1cmx1cm grid was used for the mapping&#xD;
      of the target muscle cortical representation. The coil was positioned tangentially to the&#xD;
      scalp, with the handle pointing backwards at an angle of 45 degrees to midline and was moved&#xD;
      in 1-cm steps to localize the optimal scalp location in each hemisphere, from which the&#xD;
      largest MEPs in the abductor digiti minimi could be evoked. A Synergy electromyograph (Oxford&#xD;
      Instruments, Surrey, UK) was used to record MEPs from the abductor digiti minimi. Whenever&#xD;
      MEPs were not elicited in the affected upper limb at rest using maximal stimulator output,&#xD;
      patients were instructed to make an attempt to voluntarily activate the muscle. If no MEP&#xD;
      could be elicited using maximal stimulator output, MEPs amplitude was described as 0 mV.&#xD;

      stimulation: report of an IFCN committee. Clin Neurophysiol 2012;123:858-882.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting motor threshold:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting motor threshold (rMT) was defined as the lowest stimulator output at the optimal&#xD;
      scalp site required to elicit a MEP of at least 50 μV in the relaxed abductor digiti minimi&#xD;
      in at least 5 of 10 trials.21 If no MEP could be elicited using maximal stimulator output,&#xD;
      then rMT was described as 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contralateral and ipsilateral silent period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To elicit the silent period, transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the M1 area&#xD;
      of each hemisphere while patients sustained a steady maximum tonic contraction of the&#xD;
      abductor digiti minimi and a 500ms poststimulus period was analysed. Stimulation intensity&#xD;
      was 120% rMT. We essentially recorded simultaneously contralateral (cSP) and ipsilateral&#xD;
      silent period (iSP) to a unilateral stimulus. If patients were unable to maintain a stable&#xD;
      contraction with the paretic hand, the SP was considered unmeasurable. cSP duration was&#xD;
      measured from the onset of the MEP to the point of EMG resumption after a period of EMG&#xD;
      suppression and the mean of 10 trials was used to estimate the silent period duration. iSP&#xD;
      was quantified considering a period of relative suppression of EMG activity below the&#xD;
      background EMG activity.&#xD;

&#xD;
      SEPs recording:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were elicited using electrical stimulation with the&#xD;
      same procedure described in detail in previous studies. Signals were recorded using Synergy&#xD;
      electromyograph (Oxford Instruments, Surrey, UK). SEPs data were compared between affected&#xD;
      and unaffected upper limbs.&#xD;

      H-reflex H-reflex responses were recorded from a 45-degree angle supinated arm and a slightly&#xD;
      contracted flexor carpi radialis muscle. When the flexor carpi radialis muscle couldn't be&#xD;
      contracted the paretic upper limb was positioned with the wrist in slight flexion. Recording&#xD;
      electrode was placed over the belly of the flexor carpi radialis and referred to an electrode&#xD;
      3 cm distal. Electrical stimuli delivered a square-wave pulse of 0.5 ms in duration and were&#xD;
      applied over the median nerve at the bicipital groove; above the cubital crease. Hmax/Mmax&#xD;
      responses were compared between the paretic and non-paretic sides.&#xD;

    <description>tDCS was applied with the anode placed over the M1 hand area of the ipsilesional motor cortex and the cathode over the same area of the contralesional motor cortex (C3/C4). For the active condition, patients received 5 consecutive daily sessions of 2 mA anodal tDCS over the AH and cathodal tDCS over the UH of 20 minutes each, with fade-in and fade-out periods of 1s. For the sham condition, the stimulation applied in the same sites and with the same parameters, was turned off after a fade-in period, 30 seconds of direct current stimulation and a fade-out period.&#xD;
Repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation was performed by a peripheral nerve stimulator to the radial nerve and applied at the same time as tDCS. Radial nerve was chosen to improve wrist extension. Trains of 40 stimuli (ISI: 10 ms, duration: 1ms) were delivered every 6 seconds to the radial nerve through bipolar electrodes (5 cm diameter) at an intensity that could elicit a visible wrist extension (20-30 mA).</description>
