  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the challenges in pediatric anesthesiology is to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      pressure to prevent cerebral ischemia or hyperemia from pressure-passive perfusion. However,&#xD;
      there is no optimal tool for longitudinally monitoring cerebral perfusion under general&#xD;
      anesthesia (GA). In addition, the safe limits of blood pressure that maintains adequate&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion in infants and children are not clear. Furthermore, patients with&#xD;
      neurological impairments may have impaired cerebral auto-regulation (CA) function which may&#xD;
      associated with functional outcomes. To address the critical public health issues associated&#xD;
      with the safe use of general anesthesia in during neurosurgery, monitoring cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      and oxygenation continuously during the peri-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have pioneered a novel technology, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS),&#xD;
      to optically measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) non-invasively and demonstrated that it is&#xD;
      safe and practical as a bedside CBF monitor in the NICU. Blood flow is distinct from blood&#xD;
      oxygenation, but both are important for brain health. Clinical near infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      (NIRS) devices are available to monitor oxygenation by light absorption, but CBF must be&#xD;
      monitored by light scattering, which is only available with research DCS devices. While the&#xD;
      physical principles of the methods are different, the sensors for both techniques are very&#xD;
      similar. The investigators have therefore combined DCS with advanced frequency-domain NIRS&#xD;
      (FDNIRS) in a single device to simultaneously monitor cerebral tissue oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (cStO2), blood volume (CBV), CBF and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2), which cannot be monitored&#xD;
      with existing clinical devices. The investigators have previously shown that these measures&#xD;
      are far more sensitive than cStO2 alone in several infant brain pathologies. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators aim to test the feasibility of integrating the FDNIRS-DCS technology into&#xD;
      perioperative monitoring to study cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism continuously in&#xD;
      children during general anesthesia and surgery. Additionally, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine how anesthesia-related events affect cerebral hemodynamic instability and how&#xD;
      anesthetic level correlates with CA functions in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a mechanism that maintains cerebral flood flow (CBF) despite&#xD;
      the fluctuations in the arterial blood pressure. This process protects the brain from&#xD;
      ischemic or hemorrhagic insults during events of hypo- or hyperperfusion, respectively.&#xD;
      Children under general anesthesia (GA) are particularly vulnerable to these events because&#xD;
      anesthetic agents profoundly impact cerebral metabolic supply and demand. At the same time,&#xD;
      to varying degrees, anesthetic agents can compromise respiration, produce hypotension, and&#xD;
      even inhibit cerebral autoregulation function. General anesthesia-induced cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion can occur during routine GA and is associated with deleterious neurological&#xD;
      outcomes in children. Thus, primary goals in managing GA are therefore to maintain adequate&#xD;
      hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion under intact CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent large retrospective study demonstrated that blood pressure ranges in anesthetized&#xD;
      children are significantly lower than in awake, healthy children. However, the safe limits of&#xD;
      blood pressure that maintains adequate cerebral perfusion in infants and children are not&#xD;
      clear and my vary depending on the age and disease severity. Currently, bedside CBF&#xD;
      monitoring had been impractical. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is the only clinically&#xD;
      available tool to measure cerebral blood flow velocity in larger arteries. Although TCD has&#xD;
      been used for obtaining cerebral hemodynamics including autoregulation for clinical use, it&#xD;
      is not practical for long-term monitoring due to the difficulty to secure the probe on the&#xD;
      patient's head. Furthermore, the accuracy of the TCD measurement is highly operator-dependent&#xD;
      which impedes its general use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral oximeters, based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have become popular means of&#xD;
      assessing cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation (cStO2) during GA, but its use has not become&#xD;
      routine. Clinically relevant desaturation (generally below 50-60 percent) implies a mismatch&#xD;
      between brain oxygen supply and demand. When presenting persistently, they can serve as an&#xD;
      intraoperative warning sign of hemodynamic and metabolic comprise. A recent study with 453&#xD;
      healthy infants undergoing general anesthesia for non-cardiac surgery found the episodes of&#xD;
      desaturation is rare (2%) despite that critically low blood pressure (MAP &lt;35 mmHg) was&#xD;
      observed in almost 40% of subjects. Because desaturation events are relatively rare, they are&#xD;
      unlikely to be responsible for adverse outcomes in non-cardiac surgery. However, the&#xD;
      magnitude of the change in cStO2 from the awake to anesthetized state was associated with the&#xD;
      range of MAP experienced during GA, suggesting systematic changes in cerebral perfusion may&#xD;
      be more important than desaturation events for assessing hemodynamic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the critical public health issues associated with the safe use of anesthesia in&#xD;
      children, the investigators propose to develop new beside tools to monitor cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamics and perfusion continuously during anesthesia. The investigators aim to quantify&#xD;
      cStO2, CBF, CMRO2, and its coupling relationship in children with and without neurologic&#xD;
      impairments while awake and during different phases of GA (aim1). With continuous measures of&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure, the investigators will further determine CA functions by studying&#xD;
      the relationship between CBF and ABP simultaneously with anesthesia-related physiological&#xD;
      events, including hypercapnia (aim2). Ultimately, the investigators aim to integrate our&#xD;
      technology into perioperative monitoring to enable age-appropriate, goal-directed cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamic management to spare infant brains from the potentially deleterious effects of&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
