  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of talabostat and pembrolizumab and to see how&#xD;
      well they work for the treatment of solid cancers that have spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body (advanced). Talabostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving talabostat and pembrolizumab may help&#xD;
      control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and&#xD;
      immune (i)RECIST in patients treated in cohort A and in patients treated in cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in the first 6 patients enrolled to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). II. To evaluate duration of response (DOR).&#xD;
      III. To evaluate overall survival (OS). IV. To evaluate overall safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the quantitative and qualitative effects of talabostat (BXCL701) in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab on relevant immune effector cytokines in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the quantitative and qualitative effects of BXCL701 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab on various immunological effector cells, including neutrophils, myeloid derived&#xD;
      suppressor cells (MDSCs), dendritic cells, cancer associated fibroblast (CAF), T-cells and&#xD;
      macrophage density in pre-dose tumor biopsies and when feasible in post-dose tumor tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the predictive value of baseline programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor&#xD;
      expression and tumor mutation burden (TMB) with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate changes in serially collected blood circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (DNA) (ctDNA) to assess for tumor response and clonal evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate pre- and post-treatment PD-L1 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) as a predictive tool for therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talabostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

                  with PD1/PDL1 antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Efficacy stage cohort B: patients with advanced cancers which have relapsed or&#xD;
                  progressed with PD1/PDL1 antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a life expectancy of more than 3 months, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &lt; 18 years of age have to weigh &gt; 40 kgs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST. Disease amenable to a&#xD;
             biopsy is not mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's acute toxic effects of previous anticancer therapy have resolved to =&lt; grade&#xD;
             1 except for grade 2 peripheral neuropathy or any grade of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum albumin &gt;= 2.5 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN (for patients with known Gilbert syndrome &lt; 3 x ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 3 x&#xD;
             institutional ULN (patients with hepatic metastases must have AST/ALT =&lt; 5 x ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dL and no red blood cell transfusions during the prior 7 days&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             [HCG]) within 14 days prior to the initiation of treatment and/or postmenopausal women&#xD;
             must be amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential. Women of childbearing potential must agree and commit to the use of 2&#xD;
             highly effective methods of birth control throughout the duration of the study until&#xD;
             at least 4 months following the last dose of study drug. Acceptable methods are&#xD;
             defined as those that result, alone or in combination, in a low failure rate (ie, less&#xD;
             than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as surgical&#xD;
             sterilization, an intrauterine device, or hormonal contraception in combination with a&#xD;
             barrier method. It is currently unknown whether BXCL701 or pembrolizumab may reduce&#xD;
             the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives; therefore, women&#xD;
             using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method. In&#xD;
             certain countries (if permitted by law), WOCBP may agree to abide by heterosexual&#xD;
             sexual abstinence during the time of participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients and their female partners of childbearing potential must agree and&#xD;
             commit to use a barrier contraception (eg, condom with spermicidal&#xD;
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) throughout the duration of the study until at least&#xD;
             60 days following the last dose of study drug, in addition to their female partners&#xD;
             using either an intrauterine device or hormonal contraception and continuing until at&#xD;
             least 4 months days following the last dose of study drug. This criterion may be&#xD;
             waived for male patients who have had a vasectomy &gt; 6 months before signing the&#xD;
             informed consent form (ICF)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific&#xD;
             procedures or treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient cannot swallow oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is on gliptins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has active central nervous system (CNS) metastases not controlled by prior&#xD;
             surgery or radiotherapy (patient must be off steroids). Patients with signs or&#xD;
             symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis are not eligible unless brain metastases are&#xD;
             ruled out by brain magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received external-beam radiation or another systemic anticancer therapy&#xD;
             within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of the&#xD;
             study endpoints. Patients with the following concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are&#xD;
             eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ (including transitional cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, anal carcinoma, and melanoma in situ). Patients with simultaneous cancers,&#xD;
             which are not active and do not require treatment may be eligible contingent on&#xD;
             discussion with the principle investigator (PI) and supporter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or any&#xD;
             New York Heart Association class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus active or chronic&#xD;
             hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Patients with history of hepatitis B or C and undetectable&#xD;
             viral load are eligible. Screening is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a clinically significant upper gastrointestinal obstruction, abnormal&#xD;
             physiological function or malabsorption syndrome that may affect the absorption of the&#xD;
             study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places&#xD;
             the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
