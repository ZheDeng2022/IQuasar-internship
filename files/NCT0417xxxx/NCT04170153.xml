      This is an open-label, Phase I, first-in-human (FIH) multicenter, clinical study conducted in&#xD;
      multiple parts to establish the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      (PK/PD) profile (with and without food) and early signs of efficacy of M1774 as monotherapy&#xD;
      and in combination with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor niraparib.&#xD;
