  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Permissive hypercapnia increased the survival rate in patients with acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS) who required mechanical ventilation in critical care medicine. This&#xD;
      has been explained by its association with ventilator induced lung injury. Since then, a&#xD;
      protective lung ventilation strategy has been very important, with a low tidal volume of 4-6&#xD;
      ml/kg. Patients undergoing surgery will inevitably require mechanical ventilation. In&#xD;
      particular, patients undergoing one lung ventilation for thoracic surgery may have increased&#xD;
      airway pressure and a greater chance of ventilator induced lung injury. Recently, protective&#xD;
      lung ventilation has been applied to patients undergoing one ung ventilation during thoracic&#xD;
      surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference in the degree of pulmonary&#xD;
      oxygenation and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in hypercapnia induced&#xD;
      by controlling the respiratory rate with a constant tidal volume.&#xD;
