      The study schedule will consist of a standard therapy data collection phase followed by a&#xD;
      hybrid closed-loop phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a 14-day outpatient, standard therapy phase during which sensor and&#xD;
      insulin data will be collected. Subjects, or their caregivers, will manage their diabetes at&#xD;
      home per their usual routine using the study continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) and&#xD;
      remain on current multiple daily injections (MDI) or pump therapy. This will be followed by a&#xD;
      14-day hybrid closed-loop phase conducted in both a hotel/rental house setting and an&#xD;
      outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hybrid closed-loop phase will begin on Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hybrid closed-loop phase, subjects will be divided into two groups. The first&#xD;
      group of subjects will commence the hybrid closed-loop phase in the hotel/rental house&#xD;
      setting. On Study Day 3, subjects will transition to an outpatient setting for the remaining&#xD;
      12 days. After all subjects from the first group have completed the 2-day hotel/rental house&#xD;
      phase, the second group of subjects may commence the hybrid closed-loop phase in an&#xD;
      outpatient setting for 14-days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hybrid closed-loop phase, all subjects will participate in specific target blood&#xD;
      glucose (BG) challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each subject in the prepivotal study has successfully completed 14-days of&#xD;
      hybrid-closed-loop, they may immediately transition to and enroll in the pivotal study.&#xD;
