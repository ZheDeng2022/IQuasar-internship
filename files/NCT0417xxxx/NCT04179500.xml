  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pretomanid is being used in an antimicrobial combination regimen(s) to treat patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary tuberculosis. The primary purpose of the Male Reproductive Safety - &quot;BPaMZ/SEM&quot;-&#xD;
      clinical study is to evaluate the potential effect of pretomanid on human testicular function&#xD;
      whilst being used in a 26 weeks antimicrobial combination regimen consisting of bedaquiline&#xD;
      (B) plus pretomanid (Pa) plus moxifloxacin (M) and pyrazinamide (Z) (BPaMZ).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the male reproductive safety of pretomanid&#xD;
      in the regimen (BPaMZ) of bedaquiline 200mg (200mg daily for 8 weeks then 100 mg daily for 18&#xD;
      weeks), together with pretomanid 200 mg (1x daily) + moxifloxacin 400 mg (1x daily) +&#xD;
      pyrazinamide 1500 mg (1 x daily) for 26 weeks in participants with Drug-resistant (DR)&#xD;
      pulmonary TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the TB treatment efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability after 26 weeks of active treatment for TB and follow up until 45 weeks after&#xD;
      start of the above described treatment regimen in participants with Drug-resistant (DR)&#xD;
      pulmonary TB.&#xD;
