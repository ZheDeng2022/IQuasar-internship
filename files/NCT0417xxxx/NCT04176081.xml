  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and second leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer-related death. Men with PCa have a wide range of possible outcomes if the cancer&#xD;
      has not spread and is classified as Intermediate-Risk PCa (IR-PCa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for IR-PCa is radiation therapy (RT) with or without hormone therapy&#xD;
      which can result in cure in some men. In other men, the cancer can come back or spread to&#xD;
      other areas of the body. Treatment response in men with IR-PCa is highly variable. This&#xD;
      uncertainty has led to significant under- and over-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to find out if the addition of intensive treatment (hormonal therapy:&#xD;
      darolutamide + degarelix) to standard treatment for PCa will work better than standard&#xD;
      treatment alone. To do this, some participants will receive hormone therapy and others will&#xD;
      not. All participants will receive RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is difficult to identify men who may require more intensive therapy. Current&#xD;
      methods, such as using prostate specific antigen (PSA) alone, may not give the doctor enough&#xD;
      information about who requires more intensive treatment. The researchers conducting this&#xD;
      study believe that a particular arrangement of cancer cells [called intraductal carcinoma&#xD;
      (IDC)] and the presence of a genetic marker called SChLAP1 can be used to identify people who&#xD;
      would benefit from more intensive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal therapy such as with drugs called darolutamide (new drug for PCa) and Degarelix,&#xD;
      reduce androgens (male hormones, such as testosterone) or block their effect on the cells.&#xD;
      PCa cells require androgens to grow and divide, so removal of androgens may be effective in&#xD;
      preventing the return of cancer following radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although darolutamide has been studied in about 1000 men with PCa and seems promising and&#xD;
      well tolerated it is considered an experimental drug, therefore it can only be used in a&#xD;
      research study such as this one. Degarelix has been approved by Health Canada to treat PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 2, open label, randomized, controlled study and will be conducted across&#xD;
      sites in Canada. To qualify, men must have IR-PCa and have both SChLAP1 and IDC present or&#xD;
      both absent. Participants will be randomized to receive RT with hormone therapy or RT only.&#xD;
      The study treatment period is 6 months for the RT + hormone therapy group. RT will take about&#xD;
      1-2 weeks. All participants will be followed for 5 years with multiple visits to assess&#xD;
      safety and treatment effects.&#xD;
