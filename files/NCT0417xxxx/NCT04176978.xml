  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction (MI). Using coronary computer tomography angiogram (CCTA), it is&#xD;
      found that a significantly higher prevalence of high-risk coronary plaque (non-calcified&#xD;
      plaque [NCP]), supporting the notion that more aggressive cardiovascular (CV) evaluation&#xD;
      strategy should be considered in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid ultrasound screening in this population may be a better alternative than traditional&#xD;
      risk score to identify patients at high CV risk as the latter underestimated CV risk.&#xD;
      Previous study from our group have demonstrated that achieving treatment target (minimal&#xD;
      disease activity [MDA]) can prevent progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, 38%&#xD;
      of this Treat to Target (T2T) cohort still had carotid plaque progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that combination of a T2T stratgy together with high-intensity&#xD;
      rosuvastatin treatment (Group 1: T2T-statin group) is more effective in preventing&#xD;
      progression of coronary and carotid atherosclerosis than T2T stratgy alone (Group 2: T2T-only&#xD;
      group) in high-risk PsA patients with carotid plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to ascertain the effect of T2T strategy with high-intensity&#xD;
      rosuvastain (Group 1: T2T-statin group) on the change in CIMT over a period of 12 months&#xD;
      compared with T2T strategy alone (Group 2: T2T-only group)&#xD;

      Treatment protocol This is a 1-year prospective, hospital-based, open-label, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial. The trial comprised two arms. Group 1 will receive T2T strategy together&#xD;
      with rosuvastain 20mg daily (T2T-statin group). Group 2 will receive T2T strategy only&#xD;
      (T2T-only group). The method of concealed random allocation will be used. Simple&#xD;
      randomization will be conducted by a computer-generated random list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of statins The patients will be given the necessary number of rosuvastatin tablets at&#xD;
      each visit. At the following visits, surplus medication will be returned to the investigator.&#xD;
      Compliance is calculated as a percentage, based on the number of tablets returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No trials to date that have evaluated effects on CVD events have tested any medication in&#xD;
      combination with statins or treatment to specific LDL-C goals, therefore we do not intensify&#xD;
      the regimen for any particular level of LDL-C response. Measuring LDL-C response after&#xD;
      initiating therapy in this study is mainly to assess adherence. In this primary prevention&#xD;
      trial, in patients who do not tolerate statins, no lipid-lowering therapy will be&#xD;
      administered. Potential interventions include lifestyle modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of DMARDs All participants will receive a 1-year protocolized treatment with the aim to&#xD;
      achieve MDA. A predefined treatment protocol is developed based on the EULAR recommendations&#xD;
      and the Hong Kong guideline for the use of bDMARDs. Patients fulfilling the criteria for&#xD;
      bDMARDs can either pay out of pocket or can apply for the Samaritan Fund for financial&#xD;
      assistance, provided they must pass a household-based financial assessment&#xD;
      (http://www.ha.org.hk/visitor/ha_visitor_index.asp?content_id=212020). When patient cannot&#xD;
      achieve treatment goal within 3-6 months of therapy, the treatment therapy will be escalated&#xD;
      to the next step according to the protocol, unless the patient declined or toxic effects&#xD;
      preclude this approach. For the introduction of DMARD only joint involvement is taken into&#xD;
      account. The participants with active disease who failed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug&#xD;
      (NSAID) or those with poor prognostic factor will start with methotrexate monotherapy, which&#xD;
      is increased to 20mg/week or maximum tolerated dose. Subsequent steps for patients who fail&#xD;
      to achieve treatment goal include switching to other conventional synthetic DMARDs&#xD;
      (csDMARDs), combination csDMARD therapy or TNFi, ustekinumab, secukinumab or tofacitinib.&#xD;
      Intra-articular steroid or local steroid injection to enthesitis and dactylitis are allowed&#xD;
      during the study but will be forbidden in the 4 weeks before assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessment Assessment performed at each visit include pain, physicians' and&#xD;
      patients' global assessments, number of tender joints count (TJC) and swollen joints count&#xD;
      (SJC) (using the 68 tender/66 SJC), Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score&#xD;
      (MASES), number of digits with dactylitis; ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score&#xD;
      (ASDAS), modified health assessment questionnaire (M-HAQ); Disease Activity index for&#xD;
      Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA), Psoriasis Area (BSA), Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index&#xD;
      (PASI) were used to measure joint and skin disease activity.(31) MDA was used for assessment&#xD;
      of treatment efficacy endpoint. The MDA criteria assess 7 domains [TJC ≤ 1, SJC ≤ 1,&#xD;
      enthesitis count ≤ 1, skin (≤ 1 or BSA ≤ 3%), function (measured by the Health Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire), ≤ 0.5, patient's global VAS on a 100-mm scale ≤ 20, and patient pain VAS on a&#xD;
      100 mm scale ≤ 15]. If 5 of 7 of the cutoffs for these domains are met, then the patient is&#xD;
      deemed to be in MDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular assessments The following anthropomorphic assessment will be performed at each&#xD;
      visit. Anthropomorphic measurements include body heights, body weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumferences, two consecutive blood pressure readings in sitting position and heart rate.&#xD;
      Hypertension status is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140mmHg or diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (DBP) ≥90mmHg or the use of antihypertensive agents. Other data include menopausal&#xD;
      status, smoking and drinking habits, history of DM, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, overt&#xD;
      CVD, and family history of CVD, DM in first-degree male relatives &lt;55 years of age or&#xD;
      first-degree female relatives &lt;65 years of age. Drug history is retrieved from case notes or&#xD;
      elicited during the clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory assessments and inflammatory markers Laboratory assessments at each visit include&#xD;
      complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, creatine kinase (CK), ESR and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting blood glucose, lipid profile (total cholesterol [TC],&#xD;
      LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL-C], triglycerides), fibrinogen and uric&#xD;
      acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and plaque CIMT and plaque will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      and 12 months.CIMT will be measured using a high-resolution B-mode ultrasound machine&#xD;
      (Philips EPIQ7) by an experienced sonographer blinded to all clinical information using a&#xD;
      30-MHz linear vascular probe (Philips L12-3 broadband linear array transducer). The CIMT will&#xD;
      be measured offline in the distal common carotid artery, bulb, and proximal internal carotid&#xD;
      artery using dedicated software (Philips Xcelera Cardiology Enterprise Viewer Client 4). The&#xD;
      mean and maximal IMT values of 6 arterial segments will be calculated for further analysis.&#xD;
      Plaque is defined as a localized thickening &gt;1.2 mm that do not uniformly involve the whole&#xD;
      artery. Progression of plaque is defined as an increase in region harboring plaque or number&#xD;
      of plaque. Reproducibility of IMT was 0.97. Total plaque area (TPA) will be measured as&#xD;
      described before. The plane for measurement of each plaque will be chosen by reviewing the&#xD;
      video of the scan to find the largest extent of plaque as seen on the longitudinal view. TPA&#xD;
      will be recorded as the sum of the areas of all plaques in the right and left carotid&#xD;
      arteries. Reading of the ultrasound scans obtained at baseline and follow-up will be&#xD;
      performed concurrently by a single reader (ITC) who is aware of the temporal order of the&#xD;
      images but is blinded to all clinical data. The change in TPA will be calculated by&#xD;
      subtracting the baseline TPA from the follow-up TPA. The intraobserver intraclass correlation&#xD;
      coefficient for TPA was 0.94.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary atherosclerosis assessment CCTA scans will be performed at baseline and 12 months&#xD;
      256-rows multidetector CT (General Electric (GE) Revolution CT) in accordance with the&#xD;
      protocol employed in the ACCURACY trial, and will be analysed by an experienced radiologist&#xD;
      blinded to clinical data (PT). Coronary artery calcium score (CAC) will be quantified by the&#xD;
      Agatston method. The presence, site, stenosis level of plaques will be recorded. Coronary&#xD;
      arteries will be standardised to American Heart Association 15-segment model. Segment&#xD;
      involvement score (SIS) represented the total number of segments harbouring plaque. Lesions&#xD;
      rendering over 50% stenosis of the lumen will be considered as obstructive. For multiple&#xD;
      plaques, the most stenotic one will be recorded. Voxels with attenuation less than 130 HU&#xD;
      will be assigned to the non-calcified volume of the plaque. For each segment, the presence or&#xD;
      absence of 4 coronary artery high risk plaque features will be assessed: positive remodeling,&#xD;
      low attenuation plaque, spotty calcification, and the &quot;napkin ring&quot; sign. Positive remodeling&#xD;
      is defined as an outer vessel diameter that is 10% greater than the mean of the diameter of&#xD;
      the segments immediately proximal and distal to the plaque. Low-attenuation plaque is defined&#xD;
      as a focal central area of plaque with an attenuation density of &lt;30 HU. Spotty calcification&#xD;
      is defined as focal calcification within the coronary artery wall &lt;3 mm in maximum diameter.&#xD;
      The &quot;napkin ring&quot; sign is defined as a central area of low attenuation plaque that had a&#xD;
      peripheral rim of high attenuation. Observer agreement for the assessment of coronary artery&#xD;
      plaque characteristics has overall been shown to be fair. Plaque volume will be measured&#xD;
      automatically based on attenuation (CardIQ Xpress 2.0 Reveal, General Electic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity monitoring To monitor the possible side effect of the statin and DMARDs, complete&#xD;
      blood count, CK, liver and renal function tests will be performed every visit. Chest X-rays&#xD;
      will be obtained at baseline and at the end of the study. The treating physician record all&#xD;
      adverse events and serious adverse events and, if necessary, make treatment adjustments in&#xD;
      accordance with the protocol. Serious adverse events are defined as any adverse reaction&#xD;
      resulting in any of the following outcomes: a life-threatening condition or death, a&#xD;
      significant or permanent disability, a malignancy, hospitalization or prolongation of&#xD;
      hospitalization, a congenital abnormality, or a birth defect.&#xD;
