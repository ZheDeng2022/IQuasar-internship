      A Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of four dose&#xD;
      cohorts of 10 subjects (A: 10mg, B: 25mg, C: 50mg, D: 100mg). Dose escalation will not occur&#xD;
      until safety data through Day 8 is reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). The study&#xD;
      will consist of a twenty-eight day screening period, 12-hour clinic stay, and 120-day&#xD;
      (Cohorts A-C) or 180-day (Cohort D) outpatient follow-up. The primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of G03-52-01 administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of escalating IM doses of G03-52-01.&#xD;
