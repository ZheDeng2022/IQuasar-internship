  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate whether younger subjects report pain with&#xD;
      pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution) more often and/or at higher levels (greater&#xD;
      intensity) than older subjects.This study will be carried out throughout the course of your&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment, which will be prescribed by your study doctor. Participation in this&#xD;
      study will not affect your cancer treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure pain using ESAS self-reported pain scores over the course of one week&#xD;
      following each dose of pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution). At the end of that week,&#xD;
      blood will be drawn from each subject to directly measure the WBC/ANC, which can then be&#xD;
      compared to self-reported pain and evaluated for any correlation. Finally, subjects will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups by age: 45 years or younger, and over 45 to look for any differences&#xD;
      in pain or WBC/ANC measurements based on age.&#xD;

    <description>It works by increasing neutrophil migration to counteract cytotoxicity. It is commonly administered to patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment.
