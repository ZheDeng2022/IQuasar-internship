  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Aliviado Dementia Care Program (formerly known as the Dementia Symptom Management at Home&#xD;
      Program, or DSM-H) was developed to implement dementia friendly care for persons with&#xD;
      Dementia and their caregivers living in the community. Aliviado Dementia Care-Hospice Edition&#xD;
      is a systems level quality assurance performance improvement program that includes&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team training, validated assessment instruments, patient-centered care&#xD;
      plans, treatment algorithms for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and&#xD;
      terminal delirium, and caregiver education pamphlets. Utilizing the R61/R33 mechanism, the&#xD;
      Aliviado Dementia Care-Hospice Edition was successfully implemented in 2 sequential pilot&#xD;
      trials in the hospice setting in 2019 (R61 phase). Following the successful pilot trials and&#xD;
      the attainment of the R61 milestones, we now seek to test the effectiveness of Aliviado&#xD;
      Dementia Care-Hospice Edition in a pragmatic RCT in 25 hospice agencies across the nation&#xD;
      (R33 phase) on its ability to reduce antipsychotic use (primary outcome) and effect quality&#xD;
      (secondary and exploratory outcomes).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the population ages, the incidence rate of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders&#xD;
      (dementia) is expected to triple. The National Alzheimer's Plan recognizes that while the&#xD;
      number of persons with dementia (PWD) is increasing substantially, the healthcare and long&#xD;
      term care systems are unprepared to provide high quality, effective and efficient care to the&#xD;
      PWD and their caregivers. PWD often have many behavioral and psychological symptoms of&#xD;
      dementia (BPSD) including agitation, depression and sleep disturbances that affect both the&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) of the PWD and the caregiver. Unfortunately, due to a lack of programs&#xD;
      to insert evidence-based care into the community, and hospice system specifically, PWD&#xD;
      receive inappropriate and even harmful care. We have developed the Aliviado Dementia Care&#xD;
      Program (formerly known as the Dementia Symptom Management at Home Program, or DSM-H) to&#xD;
      implement dementia friendly care for PWD and their caregivers in the community. Initially&#xD;
      developed for use in home healthcare (HHC), we have modified the program for use in hospice.&#xD;
      The Aliviado Dementia Care-Hospice Edition is a systems level quality assurance performance&#xD;
      improvement (QAPI) program that includes workforce training, and agency level workflow&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;

    <description>A multi-modal QAPI program for improving the quality of care provided to PWD and support to their informal caregivers through hospice. It has been culturally tailored for use in diverse settings and tested with multiple minority communities in New York, including multiple Hispanic groups and African-Americans and Caribbean blacks. The intervention includes mentorship, training, a toolkit, and mobile app to assist clinicians in providing evidence-based symptom management to persons with dementia.</description>
