  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of mechanical ventilation (MV) to replace spontaneous breathing has been associated&#xD;
      with respiratory muscle dysfunction and lung injury from positive pressure. While using MV in&#xD;
      an intensive care unit setting, the diaphragm is unloaded, potentially resulting in early&#xD;
      development of diaphragmatic atrophy in as early as 18 hours of complete diaphragm&#xD;
      inactivity. These changes in muscle properties result in a decrease in the force generating&#xD;
      capability of the muscle, ultimately resulting in difficulty to restore spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      and a subsequent prolonged weaning process or failure. A prolonged weaning period is&#xD;
      associated with longer duration of MV, which may result in a cascade of further diaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction, weakness, and injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation of the phrenic nerves to produce diaphragm contraction and activity is a possible&#xD;
      mechanism to reduce MV related diaphragm dysfunction. Two promising studies have shown the&#xD;
      potential of repetitive phrenic nerve stimulation on inducing diaphragm activity in human&#xD;
      subjects with trains of pulses via both cervical and bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation.&#xD;
      However, neither study provided optimal stimulation settings. As such, the primary purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the optimal settings for noninvasive phrenic nerve stimulation&#xD;
      to induce diaphragm contraction.&#xD;
