      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 percent of couples are infertile. In up to half of these couples, male infertility&#xD;
      plays a role. Male infertility is due to low sperm production, abnormal sperm function or&#xD;
      blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems,&#xD;
      lifestyle choices and other factors can play a role in causing male infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an interventional trial that involved 45 participants with infertility (Oligospermia,&#xD;
      Hypospermia, Asthenozoospermia and Necrozoospermia). All the participants underwent a semen&#xD;
      analysis for his semen count, volume and motility for a sample taken by masturbation. Then I&#xD;
      gave each one of the participants a small device. This device gives an electrical shock up to&#xD;
      5 milliamps. I told each one independently to use this device properly on his testis every&#xD;
      day and come for follow up checking every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the fourth months, I made the final checkup for everyone and records my data and make a&#xD;
      comparison between (before and after) semen analysis.&#xD;

      Introduction :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 percent of couples are infertile. (1) This means they aren't able to conceive a&#xD;
      child even though they've had frequent, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year or longer.&#xD;
      In up to half of these couples, male infertility plays a role. Male infertility is due to low&#xD;
      sperm production, abnormal sperm function or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm.&#xD;
      Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices and other factors can play a&#xD;
      role in causing male infertility. (2,3) Not being able to conceive a child can be stressful&#xD;
      and frustrating, but a number of male infertility treatments are available. The consequences&#xD;
      of infertility are manifold and can include societal repercussions and personal suffering.&#xD;
      Advances in assisted reproductive technologies, such as IVF, can offer hope to many couples&#xD;
      where treatment is available, although barriers exist in terms of medical coverage and&#xD;
      affordability. (4) Electrical shocks are applied in many fields to treat many diseases&#xD;
      especially in psychiatry and mental disorders. Despite its hazards but it can be useful&#xD;
      within range of current (Up to 5 milliamps). In 1 milliamp can cause just a faint tingle,&#xD;
      this tingle increases as the amount of current increasing until it causes a little pain with&#xD;
      5 milliamps. (5,6,7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an interventional trial that involved 45 participants with infertility (Oligospermia,&#xD;
      Hypospermia, Asthenozoospermia and Necrozoospermia) aged (25 - 45 years) and all of them were&#xD;
      married. 5 participants were excluded because they have Aspermia or Azoospermia. After&#xD;
      clarifying the purpose and the mechanism of the study to the participants, all of them signed&#xD;
      a written consent for each one to confirm his agreement to participate in addition to the&#xD;
      little risks that can be brought as result of the trial if there is. The investigator applied&#xD;
      a semen analysis at a licensed laboratory in Dhi Qar, Nassiryah city in the north of Iraq by&#xD;
      many Laboratory assistances under the supervision of an infertility specialist. All the&#xD;
      participants underwent a semen analysis for his semen count, volume and motility for a sample&#xD;
      taken by masturbation. After choosing my participants and selecting their conditions. Then&#xD;
      The investigator gave each one of the participants a small device (Created by an electrical&#xD;
      engineer from Dhi Qar Engineering College). This device gives an electrical shock up to 5&#xD;
      milliamps. The investigator told each one independently to use this device properly on his&#xD;
      testis every day and come for follow up checking every month as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first month: 1 milliamp for the first 15 days and 2 milliamps for the second 15&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second month: 3 milliamps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third month: 4 milliamps. This process continued for four months (1st June - 25th&#xD;
           September, 2019) with regular follow up by semen analysis. After the fourth months, The&#xD;
           investigator made the final checkup for everyone and records my data and make a&#xD;
           comparison between (before and after) semen analysis and the follow up semen analysis&#xD;
           using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When The investigator compared between the fourth semen analysis results, The investigator&#xD;
      found a clear change and improvement in seminal motility, volume and count. This can be used&#xD;
      in treating patients with infertility by applying a small amount of current on the testis&#xD;
      from outside (taking in consideration the skin and tissues) which can improve the movement&#xD;
      and power of the sperms gradually and it is also painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also can be used before intercourse time for those who are very hurry to fertilize an&#xD;
      ovum so their chance of getting an embryo will increase. This device can be produced so any&#xD;
      person with infertility (Oligospermia, Hypospermia, Asthenozoospermia and Necrozoospermia)&#xD;
      can get one and use it with instructions to make his sperms more powerful to fertilize an&#xD;
      ovum.&#xD;
