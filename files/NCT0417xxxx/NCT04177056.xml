  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy has been shown to be very effective at relieving pain caused by bone&#xD;
      metastases. However, certain types of cancers such as prostate, breast, kidney, and melanoma&#xD;
      can have resistance to radiation, making treatment less successful. Stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SBRT) is a newer form of focused treatment that gives higher doses of radiation&#xD;
      without damage to surrounding organs. It often is used to help control and cure disease, but&#xD;
      less commonly as a way to palliate and treat symptoms. This study is looking at using SBRT&#xD;
      for the purposes of improving pain caused by bone metastases in prostate cancer, breast&#xD;
      cancer, kidney cancer, and melanoma patients. It is theorized that the higher levels of&#xD;
      radiation may be able to combat the resistance some tumour cells have to radiotherapy and&#xD;
      provide improved pain response to treatment. The investigators are looking to show that SBRT&#xD;
      has a role in helping this group of patients deal with painful bone lesions from their cancer&#xD;
      without increasing side effects and toxicity from the radiation treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has shown promising early results in the management of&#xD;
      bone metastases. However, there is a paucity of prospective data studying the use of SBRT for&#xD;
      bone metastases originating from low alpha-beta tumors, with systematic reporting of changes&#xD;
      in pain scores and analgesia use over time. The vast majority data looking at SBRT in bone&#xD;
      lesions focuses on local control and survival, rather than more tangible outcomes in a&#xD;
      palliative population including symptomatic control, durability of response, and patient&#xD;
      reported quality of life; a component that is understudied in this group despite its&#xD;
      tremendous value. Furthermore, SBRT for bone metastases has yet to become common practice&#xD;
      given the limited evidence for its efficacy and uncertainty in regards to toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study proposes an investigation of the potential benefits of SBRT for symptomatic&#xD;
      bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      melanoma, and sarcoma. The investigators look to conduct a prospective cohort study that is&#xD;
      adequately powered to analyse efficacy in alleviating pain from bone lesions and compare this&#xD;
      to well-established rates in literature for conventionally fractionated palliative RT.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study will assess the tolerability of this modality, toxicity rates, and&#xD;
      effect on quality of life. If the results show that SBRT has a significant benefit on this&#xD;
      population, the goal would be to pursue a larger randomized trial to confirm the findings.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will received a single fraction of 15-20 Gy to bone metastases causing pain. Planning and delivery will be conducted using a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) approach on the Varian TrueBeam platform. Patients will be CT simulated, with vac-lock immobilization. Use of 4-dimensional CT will be dependent on the area being treated. Daily image guidance will be performed using cone beam CT aligning to relevant bony anatomy.</description>
