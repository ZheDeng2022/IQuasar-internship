      Measuring precision radiation delivery through cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and&#xD;

      : Brain metastases are reported to occur in 20% to 40% of all patients with cancer. Treatment&#xD;
      options for brain metastases include surgical resection, particularly in lesions causing&#xD;
      significant mass effect, whole brain radiation (WBRT) and radiosurgery (SRS). Due to concerns&#xD;
      of neurocognitive toxicity following WBRT, there is growing use of SRS, particularly in&#xD;
      patients with limited brain metastases and controlled extracranial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiosurgery delivers a high dose of radiation to a defined intracranial target through&#xD;
      precise targeting with a sharp dose fall off at the target boundaries and minimal damage to&#xD;
      surrounding tissue. To date, precision radiation delivery has been facilitated through the&#xD;
      Leksell Coordinate Frame (LCF), fixated to the patient's skull through 4 pins. A relocatable&#xD;
      mask system (RMS), consisting of a patient specific head rest and mask was developed to&#xD;
      enable minimally-invasive fractioned radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) image guidance and intra-fraction motion management&#xD;
      (IFMM) system was previously developed in-house in order to measure and address setup&#xD;
      uncertainties on Gamma Knife. The in-house prototype has been integrated into a commercially&#xD;
      available GammaKnife device with CBCT guidance. The installation of this device will enable&#xD;
      volumetric guidance for all patients treated in either a single or multiple session on&#xD;
      GammaKnife Perfexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to have 2 arms, A and B. Both Arm A (using the Leksell Coordinate&#xD;
      Frame) and Arm B (using the relocatable mask) are undergoing standard of care treatment on&#xD;
      GammaKnife Perfexion for SRS. CBCT is part of standard of care for Arm B. However, CBCT&#xD;
      imaging is considered as part of study treatment for Arm A. Pre and post treatment images&#xD;
      will be acquired of the patient treated on Perfexion Gamma Knife using the Leksell Coordinate&#xD;
      Frame in order to aid in analyzing the imaging metrics of the Image Guided Perfexion unit.&#xD;
