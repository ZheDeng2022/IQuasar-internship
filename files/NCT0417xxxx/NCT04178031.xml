      Only clinicians with proven proficiency in IUD insertion will be allowed to perform&#xD;
      insertions . The steps of the IUD insertion procedure will be explained to the woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perform a bimanual examination to determine the size, shape, and position of the uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insert a warm, moistened speculum. Cleanse the cervix with an antiseptic solution using 3&#xD;
      scoppettes or more (one for each sweep of the cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open the sterile insertion instruments without touching the inside of the packet and place&#xD;
      within easy reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remove the tenaculum by its handle and grasp the anterior or posterior lip of the cervix.&#xD;
      Close gently to the first notch. Having the woman to cough while the tenaculum is being&#xD;
      attached can ease the pinch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apply gentle traction with the tenaculum to straighten the canal. Remove the sound by its&#xD;
      handle and gently insert to measure the depth of the uterus. Do not apply great force if&#xD;
      there is resistance. Apply further traction to the tenaculum and attempt to re-insert the&#xD;
      sound at a different angle. Once the sound is inserted and removed, note the depth of the&#xD;
      uterine cavity. The woman can expect to feel cramping as the sound is inserted and withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open the IUD pack without touching its contents. Put on sterile gloves. Load the IUD and&#xD;
      insert it into the uterine cavity according to the manufacturer instructions. As the IUD is&#xD;
      inserted through the cervix into the uterus, the patient may have pain and cramping similar&#xD;
      to strong menstrual cramps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gently remove the tenaculum. Tamponade any bleeding from the tenaculum site until it is&#xD;
      resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trim the strings of the IUD to 3-4 cm in length and note the string length. Avoid cutting the&#xD;
      strings too short. If the client or her partner becomes aware of the threads, they may be cut&#xD;
      shorter in length at the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remove the speculum and assess the woman.&#xD;
