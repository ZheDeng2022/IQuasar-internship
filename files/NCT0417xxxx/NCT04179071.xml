  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, randomised, 2 part (Part A and Part B), 2 treatment (savolitinib&#xD;
      alone or in combination with famotidine), crossover study in healthy, non Japanese, male&#xD;
      subjects, performed at a single study centre.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parts A and B will each have 2 Periods (Period 1 and Period 2) with a crossover design. Part&#xD;
      B will be conducted only if results of Part A suggest a clinically meaningful effect of&#xD;
      famotidine on savolitinib pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters. In both parts subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned 1:1 to receive one of the 2 treatment sequences: savolitinib alone first&#xD;
      followed by crossover to the combination treatment of savolitinib+famotidine, or the reverse&#xD;
      sequence. Subjects will be admitted for 4 days from one day before the first dose of the&#xD;
      study drug and discharged 2 days after. There will be a washout period (no study treatment)&#xD;
      of 14 days between the 2 Periods. The essential difference between the 2 parts is that in the&#xD;
      combination treatment, famotidine will be administered 2 hours before savolitinib in Part A&#xD;
      and 6 hours before savolitinib in Part B. A given subject will receive a total of 1 dose of&#xD;
      famotidine and 2 doses of savolitinib during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 2 part study, 16 subjects will be randomised in each part to ensure at least 14&#xD;
      evaluable subjects at the end of the last study period. If Part B is conducted, a total of 32&#xD;
      subjects overall are planned to be enrolled in the study. Additional subjects may be enrolled&#xD;
      to ensure 14 evaluable subjects in each part if more than 2 subjects are deemed non&#xD;
      evaluable.&#xD;
