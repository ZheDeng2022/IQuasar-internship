  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth are disproportionately affected by the current opioid crisis with catastrophic&#xD;
      consequences, and young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) often struggle with adherence&#xD;
      to relapse prevention medications. The Youth Opioid Recovery Support (YORS) model is a&#xD;
      promising, innovative, wrap-around approach that addresses barriers to medication adherence&#xD;
      and treatment engagement in an effort to improve public health outcomes in this vulnerable&#xD;
      young adult population. This study seeks to refine the YORS intervention through stakeholder&#xD;
      input and pilot iterative testing followed by an efficacy randomized controlled trial. This&#xD;
      project will significantly contribute to our knowledge base of practical strategies to&#xD;
      address the opioid crisis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young people are disproportionately affected by the current opioid crisis including worse&#xD;
      retention and outcomes compared to older adults. Further, young adults typically do not have&#xD;
      access to medications for opioid use disorder (OUD), and for those that do, struggles with&#xD;
      adherence are a major barrier. Standard approaches to treatment typically do not incorporate&#xD;
      developmentally informed strategies for engagement, retention, and medication adherence for&#xD;
      this special population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Youth Opioid Recovery Support (YORS) model is an innovative wrap-around approach that&#xD;
      attempts to address barriers to treatment engagement in this vulnerable young adult&#xD;
      population, especially difficulties with medication adherence. Its components include: (1)&#xD;
      Home delivery of extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for OUD; (2) Engagement of families in&#xD;
      collaborative treatment planning and monitoring focusing on medication adherence; (3)&#xD;
      Assertive outreach from the treatment team including actively tracking and communicating with&#xD;
      youth and families by text messaging and social media to promote engagement and adherence;&#xD;
      and (4) Contingency management to provide incentives for medication adherence. YORS is&#xD;
      currently showing very promising results in a small pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) by&#xD;
      the investigative team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to refine and then conduct a more definitive test of the YORS&#xD;
      intervention for youth with OUD. In the first phase the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      stakeholder focus groups to get input and feedback on potential refinements, while also&#xD;
      conducting 3 cycles of pilot testing of these potential refinements. Based on the preparation&#xD;
      and final synthesis of the intervention refinements, in the second phase the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct an RCT to test the efficacy of YORS, by randomizing N=120 young adults ages&#xD;
      18-26 seeking treatment for OUD with XR-NTX at Mountain Manor Treatment Center (MMTC), to&#xD;
      either the refined YORS intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) for a 6-month course of&#xD;
      treatment with XR-NTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be number of XR-NTX doses received. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      opioid relapse, days of opioid use, time to first opioid relapse, HIV risk behaviors,&#xD;
      criminal behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, and family member distress and self-efficacy. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that participants in the YORS condition will receive significantly more XR-NTX&#xD;
      doses and will demonstrate less severe opioid use and associated behaviors compared to those&#xD;
      in the TAU group. The assertive YORS intervention has the potential to improve the real-world&#xD;
      effectiveness and public health impact of medication for OUD in this very high-risk,&#xD;
      vulnerable population. If the refined YORS intervention is found to be efficacious, it would&#xD;
      set the stage for future work including: an economic analysis, a larger multi-site study,&#xD;
      longer intervention duration, study of extended release buprenorphine, and study of step-down&#xD;
      to less intensive interventions.&#xD;
