      RAPA-201-RRMM is an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized multicenter Phase II study of&#xD;
      RAPA-201 autologous T cells in adults with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma who have&#xD;
      received at least three (3) prior lines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized multicenter Phase 2 study evaluating&#xD;
      RAPA-201 cells in subjects with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a subject consents to the study, an apheresis procedure will be performed to collect&#xD;
      cells to manufacture the investigational product, RAPA-201 cells. During Cycle 1, subjects&#xD;
      will receive pentostatin and low-dose, dose-adjusted Cyclophosphamide (PC regimen), but will&#xD;
      not receive RAPA-201 cells. During Cycles 2 and beyond, Subjects will receive a conditioning&#xD;
      regimen consisting of the PC regimen followed by the RAPA-201 cell infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive up to five cycles of treatment. If a subject has stable disease at the&#xD;
      end of cycle 4, they will receive an additional four cycles of PC regimen+RAPA-201 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who complete the active treatment portion of the study, prematurely terminate&#xD;
      the study, or subjects who discontinue active treatment due to a toxicity attributable or&#xD;
      related to the study drug will complete the follow-up portion of the study (approximately one&#xD;
      year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience progressive disease will be taken off study.&#xD;
