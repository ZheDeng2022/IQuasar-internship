  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute phase of stroke is characterized by an enhancement of neural plasticity which&#xD;
      supports rapid motor recovery. It is unclear whether acute stroke patients can acquire new&#xD;
      motor skills with their affected upper limb. The aims of this research program are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the capacity of acute stroke patients (&lt; 21 days) to learn and retain a complex&#xD;
           unimanual motor skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether acute stroke to different brain regions (quantified with brain MRI)&#xD;
           induces specific deficits in motor skill learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare acute stroke patients with healthy individuals and with chronic stroke&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 3 consecutive days, the subjects will be evaluated and will train on the rehabilitation&#xD;
      robot REAplan® (http://www.axinesis.com/). They will practice 2 serious games on the robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to differentiate the effect of motor control recovery from that of MskL, the acute&#xD;
      stroke patients will be randomised 4/1 to &quot;MskL&quot; (n=120) ,to &quot;motor control recovery&quot; (n=30)&#xD;
      or to &quot;conventional&quot; group (n=15) with a minimisation software. The experimental design will&#xD;
      be similar except that the &quot;motor control recovery&quot; group will practice the serious game EASY&#xD;
      instead of CIRCUIT (see below) and the &quot;conventional&quot; group will practice conventional&#xD;
      therapy instead of CIRCUIT. The performances on both EASY &amp; CIRCUIT will be compared between&#xD;
      groups (subjects in both groups will perform the EASY &amp; CIRCUIT tasks).The total time of&#xD;
      rehabilitation will be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motor skill learning setup (CIRCUIT + EASY) that we developed and successfully used in&#xD;
      healthy individuals and stroke patients has already been implemented in the REAplan&#xD;
      environment and will be used as innovative serious games based on a speed/accuracy trade-off&#xD;
      (SAT), allowing a detailed analysis of motor skill learning components (speed, accuracy, SAT,&#xD;
      movement smoothness, dynamics...). For the serious game CIRCUIT, who based on motor skill&#xD;
      learning, the subjects will have to practice a complex circuit and move as a cursor quickly&#xD;
      and accurately as possible by controlling the handle of the robot with their affected&#xD;
      hand/arm. For the other task EASY (a brick busters serious game), the aim will be to go back&#xD;
      and forth between walls presented in different locations. The CONVENTIONAL therapy will&#xD;
      consist in classical exercices focused in the upper limb administered by occupational&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subacute stroke phase is a unique opportunity to investigate the role of brain structures&#xD;
      in motor learning/control. Compared to chronic impairments (&gt; 6 months post-stroke), the&#xD;
      subacute phase provides a window into how a lesion perturbs sensorimotor functions prior to&#xD;
      reorganisation driven by plasticity and neurorehabilitation. To clarify the role of different&#xD;
      brain structures in MskL, Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) based on high-resolution&#xD;
      brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, will be used to analyse the relationship&#xD;
      between tissue damage and MskL scores on a voxel-by-voxel basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, several &quot;classical&quot; clinical scales and tests will be used to evaluate overall&#xD;
      motor-sensory-cognitive functions. The subjects will practice serious games on the robot&#xD;
      REAplan (R), requiring movements with the affected arm (unimanual tasks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      And, we used a Dextrain® tool which allows quantification of key components of manual&#xD;
      dexterity : forces, selectivity (independance of fingers movement) and coactivation of the&#xD;
      fingers.Moreover, we added a Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as a tool for&#xD;
      predicting recovery of motor function after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the (sub)acute stroke patients, 4 others groups will be recruited for this&#xD;
      study : a group of acute stroke patients who will receive &quot;conventional rehabilitation&quot; and&#xD;
      be shortly tested on the robot (N=15), a group of chronic stroke patients (stroke &gt; 6 months)&#xD;
      who will not be hospitalized and will not undergo MRI (N=30), a group of healthy individuals&#xD;
      who will not undergo MRI (N=50) and a group of patients with a transient global amnesia which&#xD;
      is a sudden, temporary episode (&lt;24hours) of memory loss (N=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in these 4 groups will be randomized 1/1 in the two arms (&quot;MSkL&quot; versus &quot;motor&#xD;
      control recovery&quot; arms), except the patients with a TGA who will be included in the &quot;MSkL&quot;&#xD;
      arm only.&#xD;
