  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the effect of a single IV dose of ketamine (0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg) on laboratory-induced stress in healthy participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress exposure is one of the greatest risk factors for psychiatric illnesses like major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress resilience is the&#xD;
      ability to experience stress without developing psychopathology. Enhancing stress resilience&#xD;
      in at-risk populations could potentially protect against the development of stress-induced&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. Despite this, no resilience-enhancing pharmaceuticals have been&#xD;
      identified yet. Pre-clinical studies showed that the administration of the glutamate&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine one week before an acute stress&#xD;
      prevents the developing of depressive-like behavior in animals. In this project the study&#xD;
      team proposes a pilot study to test if this stress prophylactic effect of ketamine applies&#xD;
      also to humans. Ketamine will be compared to an active placebo control condition, the&#xD;
      anesthetic midazolam, in a sample of healthy volunteers. The specific aims of this project&#xD;
      are to test the effect of ketamine administered 1-week prior a laboratory-induced stress (1)&#xD;
      on the positive and negative affect as measured with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) -&#xD;
      Bipolar and (2) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis),&#xD;
      adrenaline-noradrenaline axis (ANS axis), and self-reports of anxiety. The study team expects&#xD;
      that subjects treated with ketamine, compared to midazolam, will experience reduced symptoms&#xD;
      of negative affect and anxiety and a blunted hormonal response to an acute stress.&#xD;

    <measure>The Profile of Mood States - Bipolar Version (POMS - Bi)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The Profile of Mood States - Bipolar Version (POMS - Bi) scale measures moods and feelings primarily in clinical rather than nonclinical settings. The POMS-Bi consists of 72 adjectives that form six bipolar sub-scale scores (Composed - Anxious, Clear - Confused, Confident - Unsure, Agreeable - Hostile, Energetic - Tired, Elated - Depressed). Each of the 12 adjectives within each subscale is rated on a 4-point Likert scale with anchors of 0 = &quot;much unlike this,&quot; 1 = &quot;slightly unlike this,&quot; 2 = &quot;slightly like this,&quot; and 3 = &quot;much like this.&quot; The subscale score is the sum of positive minus the sum of negative responses plus a constant of 18. The subscale score range is from 0 to 36. Higher score indicates higher functioning. Each subscale is separate and there is no overall score.</description>

    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) measures both positive and negative affect and is utilized within clinical and non-clinical populations. The PANAS is a 20-item instrument, each item is scored on a 5-likert scale from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). Positive Affect Score - total score from 10-50, with higher score indicating higher levels of positive affect. Negative Affect Score - total score from 10-50, with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>

    <description>The Visual Analog Scales are scored in millimeters from the left-hand side of a 100-mm line to a perpendicular mark made by the patient at a point corresponding to the apparent magnitude of the feeling state. Range: 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 100 (&quot;most ever&quot;). The VAS-Stressed prompts participants to rate their level of stress in that exact moment on the visual analog scale.</description>

    <description>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). This is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety in adults. The questions used in this measure ask about common symptoms of anxiety (such as numbness and tingling, sweating not due to heat, and fear of the worst happening). It is designed for individuals who are of 17 years of age or older and takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Total score range of 0-63, with higher score indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
