  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with sensory impairment (SPD) are often unable to sit still and focus their&#xD;
      attention. This can affect the children by limiting their opportunities for participation in&#xD;
      school activities. Previous studies indicate a link between childhood SPD, childhood anxiety,&#xD;
      and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in adulthood. Research and clinical experience&#xD;
      suggest that systematic use of proprioceptive-tactile stimulant aids may have a positive&#xD;
      effect for children with SPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to investigate and describe the effects of a systematic use of&#xD;
      proprioceptive-tactile stimulating vest, MyFit®, for children 6-12 years with SPD in the form&#xD;
      of sensory-seeking behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can systematic use of MyFit® for children with sensory seeking behaviour increase their&#xD;
           participation in school activities?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can systematic use of MyFit® support children with sensory seeking behaviour to increase&#xD;
           their awareness, concentration and focus on tasks?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can systematic use of MyFit® affect children's feelings of confidence and self-efficacy?&#xD;
           The project seeks to answer these questions to contribute to knowledge on how children&#xD;
           with sensory seeking behaviours can be supported for better participation in school&#xD;
           activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized controlled trial of 240 children with SPD and sensory seeking&#xD;
      behaviour.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of systematic proprioceptive-tactile&#xD;
      stimulation through use of the Protac MyFit® to children, age 6-12 years with SPD and sensory&#xD;
      seeking behavior. The primary objective is to determine the effect of the vest on the&#xD;
      children´s abilities for attention and participation in school activities, and secondary&#xD;
      their abilities for on-task behavior and feelings of self-esteem and self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method &amp; design The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT), were primary school&#xD;
      children with SPD and sensory seeking behavior receives an intervention with systematic&#xD;
      proprioceptive-tactile stimulation through use of the Protac MyFit®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting and participants The study will be conducted in public primary schools across&#xD;
      Denmark. Participants will be 240 children with SPD and sensory seeking behaviour age 6-12&#xD;
      years attending public primary school. Sample size has been calculated based on results from&#xD;
      the feasibility study and the primary outcome of sustained attention measured with the Test&#xD;
      of Every Day Attention-Children. The sample size is calculated with Ancova analysis and made&#xD;
      with an anticipated difference on 1.5 with a correlation of .07 and a standard deviation at&#xD;
      5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and randomization Recruitment will be conducted in collaboration with gatekeepers&#xD;
      from municipal Pedagogical Psychological Counselling (PPR) departments and public-school&#xD;
      managements across Denmark, that will assist in identifying possible study participants.&#xD;
      Parents to possible participants will be introduced to the study by the gatekeepers and&#xD;
      handed out written information about the study together with a baseline questionnaire, the&#xD;
      Short Sensory Profile questionnaire (SSP), a consent form for participation and a franked&#xD;
      reply envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included children will be randomized into two groups; an intervention group (A) and a&#xD;
      control group (B). The randomization will be computer generated 1:1. Additionally, 20 of the&#xD;
      included children will be strategically selected (as per age, gender, group) to represent the&#xD;
      main population and complete a qualitative research interview regarding their experiences of&#xD;
      using the MyFit®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention consisted of systematic proprioceptive-tactile stimulation by&#xD;
      the MyFit®, were the children are asked to wear the vest from the beginning of every school&#xD;
      day within the study period. Additionally, the participants are invited to use the vest as&#xD;
      they please at home and doing leisure activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline participants try out and chose whether they wish to use a vest with balls 25mm or&#xD;
      38mm in diameter. Doing the test period participants in both group A and B will receive the&#xD;
      usual treatment as provided by the PPR departments, the school and/or the family doctor.&#xD;
      Usual treatment offered by PPR and schools can vary between municipalities, it can be in form&#xD;
      of physical therapy, occupational therapy, increased support doing school activities etc.&#xD;
      This will be registered and described throughout the study. Parents of participant are asked&#xD;
      to document if the child receive any other treatment medical or otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will be voluntary and the families will be informed that they at&#xD;
      any time can withdraw from the study and that the child should never be forced to use the&#xD;
      vest.&#xD;
