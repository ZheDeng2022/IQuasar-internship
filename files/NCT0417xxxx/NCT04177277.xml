  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a survey of dialysis patients and staff to determine both the readiness of ESRD&#xD;
      patients to use mHealth as well as the Readiness of the dialysis center staff (healthcare&#xD;
      technicians, nurses and administrative staff) to utilize mHealth in order to assist patients&#xD;
      who may have barriers to do so for themselves.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional observational study. Approximately 700 ESRD patients currently on&#xD;
      dialysis will be recruited from Satellite In-Center (Hemodialysis) and WellBound (Home&#xD;
      Dialysis) Centers in the US. These will include centers in Texas, Tennessee, and California.&#xD;
      In addition, about 100 dialysis staff will be recruited to complete a staff mHealth&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and staff will be asked questions that conform to Khatun's conceptual model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technological readiness:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Availability of the devices and internet&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ability to use the devices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human resource readiness:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Socio-demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Awareness of mHealth services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motivational readiness&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concerns (cost/privacy/ other)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Attitudes/intentions: Current use or potential for use.&#xD;
