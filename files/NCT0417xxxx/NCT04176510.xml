  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial (cRCT) aims to evaluate the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness (CER) of two approaches to preventing destabilization (&quot;tipping points&quot;) that&#xD;
      lead to unplanned hospitalization and increased disability. The cRCT compares the outcomes of&#xD;
      patients randomized in clusters by site within four Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)&#xD;
      networks in New York City (NYC) and Chicago to either: 1) the Patient Centered Medical Home&#xD;
      (PCMH); or 2) the Patient Centered Home plus a health coaching intervention that employs a&#xD;
      positive affect/self-affirmation intervention to help motivate patients to succeed at&#xD;
      implementing self-management by setting life goals (experimental).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT embeds novel effective interventions within large FQHC networks, namely, Community&#xD;
      Healthcare Network and the Family Health Centers of New York University (NYU) Langone in NYC&#xD;
      and Erie Family Health Centers and Friend Family Health Center in Chicago, serving patients&#xD;
      with multiple chronic diseases or high comorbidity. This CER study compares two PCMH-based&#xD;
      strategies and will provide a manualized training system that can be disseminated and&#xD;
      implemented across the national FQHC networks, with over 9,000 delivery sites that serve&#xD;
      nearly 25 million low-income and minority patients, and can be implemented in a wider range&#xD;
      of practice settings, organization types and population characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among 1920 adult patients with a Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥4 who are established primary&#xD;
      care patients of 16 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in NYC (8 FQHCs) and Chicago&#xD;
      (8 FQHCs) this pragmatic cRCT aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two approaches to&#xD;
      preventing destabilization that leads to unplanned hospitalization and increased disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) study builds on the National&#xD;
      Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRNs)&#xD;
      in NYC and Chicago. Patients will be identified via electronic health records (EHRs) and&#xD;
      their outcomes assessed through comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health records that&#xD;
      are aggregated by these PCORnet CDRNs.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Unplanned Hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Unplanned hospitalizations are hospitalizations for any reason other than elective procedures. This specifically excludes admissions for a planned procedure (i.e. elective surgery, chemotherapy, childbirth, etc.). Admissions not accompanied by an acute diagnosis are not counted. Circumstances surrounding hospitalization will be recorded through a vignette, classified by two independent blinded reviewers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WHODAS 2.0 (36 items) assesses individual level of function in six major life domains: cognition (understanding and communication) mobility (move and get around), self-care (attend to personal hygiene, dress, eat and live alone), getting along (interact with other people); life activities (carry out responsibility of home, work, school), and participation in society (engage in community, civil and recreational activities).Chronbach's α was &gt;0.79 for each of the domains. The test-retest reliability ranged from 0.93 to 0.96 at the domain level. WHODAS 2.0 generates one global score and six domain-specific scores, validated against the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey and other scales and is responsive to change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Education Impact Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Education Impact Questionnaire evaluates eight domains: positive and active engagement in life, health directed behavior, skill and technique acquisition, constructive attitudes and approaches, self-monitoring and insight, health services navigation, social integration and support, and emotional wellbeing. Each domain is scored separately and domain scores range between 1 and 4. For the domain of emotional wellbeing, lower score represents better outcome. For all other domains, higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Activation Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13) assesses skill and confidence for self-management of chronic conditions. It is a 13 item scale with a 5-point Likert response scale (disagree strongly, disagree, agree, agree strongly, or N/A). Raw scores are transformed to a scale of 0-100 with 100 being the highest activation and 0 the lowest activation in self-management.</description>
