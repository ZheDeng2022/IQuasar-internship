  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether a quantitative detection specfic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol improves&#xD;
      prostate cancer (PCa) detection in biopsy naïve men is not adequately studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 2 arm prospective clinical trial. Men with clinical suspicion for PCa but no&#xD;
      prior prostate biopsy will be enrolled from the University of Illinois (UI) Health Urology&#xD;
      clinics. All eligible men will be screened and enrolled by the clinical research coordinator.&#xD;
      Enrolled men will undergo detection protocol MRI at the UIC Advanced Imaging Center (AIC)&#xD;
      prior to diagnostic biopsy. The MRI will be processed by the study team and evaluated for&#xD;
      areas suspicious for high grade PCa by a board certified clinical radiologist. Subjects with&#xD;
      MRI with no suspicious areas for high grade PCa will undergo standard of care (SOC) core&#xD;
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy. Subject with MRI suspicious for high grade PCa will&#xD;
      have 2-4 biopsies guided toward each suspicious lesion using MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies&#xD;
      (maximum of 12 cores). All biopsies will undergo SOC histologic processing and interpretation&#xD;
      in pathology. Biopsy results will be communicated to the patients by the Urologist performing&#xD;
      the biopsy and all additional management will be SOC. This visit will signify the end of the&#xD;
      study&#xD;
