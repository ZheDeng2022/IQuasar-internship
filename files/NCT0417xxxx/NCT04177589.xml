&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Disturbance or other cognitive disorders at the time of assessment at&#xD;
      admission, hospital stay not exceeding 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct interview with the patient. Minimum time 10-15 minutes for each interview (excluding&#xD;
      time to explain purpose, method of conducting research, time for collecting information on&#xD;
      demographic characteristics and medical conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Person doing interview: geriatric resident doctors including Dinh Pham Thi Thuy Van, Huynh&#xD;
      Khoi Nguyen, Tran Tan Dat The interviewers will explain the research objectives and only&#xD;
      started conducting the interview when the patient or his relative (authorized) agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Evaluation at the time of admission (within the first 24 hours of admission): Patients&#xD;
      entering the geriatric ward who agree to participate in the study will be assessed by the&#xD;
      doctor for cognitive status, clinical characteristics and a diagnostic flow chart for&#xD;
      Delirium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record details about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic characteristics: gender, age, address, occupation, family status and marital&#xD;
           status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis at the time of admission, co-morbidities (pulmonary disease, hypertension,&#xD;
           type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, constipation,&#xD;
           liver and gastrointestinal diseases, cardiovascular disease, arrhythmia, endocrine and&#xD;
           metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, urological diseases, hematological&#xD;
           pathologies and other diseases). Amount and type of medication being taken at home up to&#xD;
           the time of admission. Routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frailty status, functional activities according to ADLs and IADLs scale, initial&#xD;
           cognitive status according to MMSE, vision and hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation during the hospital stay:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient is suspected of delirium, we evaluate it using the CAM tool to identify. After&#xD;
      that, the patient was recorded the following characteristics: the time of onset, the clinical&#xD;
      form (increased activity, decreased activity or mixed), current medical conditions and&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record falls, transfer to other wards (if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Evaluation at the time of discharge: At the time of discharge, we will record the time of&#xD;
      hospitalization, the reason for discharge (improved condition or relative request due to&#xD;
      serious illness) or the place of hospital transfer or in-hospital death (if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record diagnosis on discharge and drugs used during inpatient treatment at the department&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools: A sheet of prepared data and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias control:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information discrepancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clearly define the subjects of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Choose a sample according to admission and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selection errors&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The person doing the interview is the person who wrote the data collection sheet,&#xD;
                so it will limit the errors in the interview process.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The variables are clearly defined and measurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect information in a unified form.&#xD;
