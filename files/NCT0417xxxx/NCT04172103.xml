  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate the association between the duration and stage of acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI) and the development of chronic kidney disease during postoperative three&#xD;
      years in patients undergoing cardiac or thoracic aortic surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) has been investigated as an important contributor to&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality after cardiovascular surgery. Also, temporary worsening&#xD;
      of renal function after aortic surgery is associated with higher long-term mortality.&#xD;
      Although the associations between AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in medical or other&#xD;
      surgical settings were reported, only a few studies evaluated this relationship in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery. More specifically, the association of the severity or duration of&#xD;
      AKI with the risk of the development of new-onset CKD after cardiac surgery has not been&#xD;
      clearly elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be important to find predictors of the long-term renal function or risk factors for&#xD;
      the development of CKD after cardiac surgery because postoperative management of high-risk&#xD;
      patients to develop long-term renal dysfunction may prevent further deterioration in renal&#xD;
      function and improve patient prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to evaluate (1) the long-term renal function after cardiac surgery&#xD;
      and (2) the association between the duration and stage of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the&#xD;
      development of chronic kidney disease during postoperative three years in patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac or thoracic aortic surgery.&#xD;
