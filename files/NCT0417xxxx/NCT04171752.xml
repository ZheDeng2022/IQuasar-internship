  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly, pharmacokinetics is altered. Gastric juice pH is elevated which influences&#xD;
      drug solubility and absorption. Drug distribution is decreased in the elderly because of&#xD;
      decreased cardiac output, increased peripheral vascular resistance, diminished blood flow in&#xD;
      the liver and the kidneys, reduced total amount of water in the body. Drug metabolism and&#xD;
      biotransformation mainly take place in the liver and is often reduced. Drug elimination is&#xD;
      altered very often because of reduced excretory (renal and hepatic) function. All these&#xD;
      changes may lead to significant pharmacokinetic changes in geriatric population. A formal&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic clinical study is being conducted in order to assess the need of dose&#xD;
      adjustment in the elderly population.&#xD;
