    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-approval study is to confirm that the clinical performance of the&#xD;
      Orsiro stent in a real-world setting is similar to the clinical performance observed for&#xD;
      Orsiro in the BIOFLOW-V Investigational Device Exemption pivotal trial, as a condition of the&#xD;
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (P170030).&#xD;

      BIOFLOW-VII is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study. Subjects with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD) who undergo an on-label percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a placed&#xD;
      Orsiro stent within the prior 24 hours will be screened post-index procedure per the protocol&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the index procedure and study enrollment, subjects will be followed for 5 years.&#xD;
      The follow-up schedule will include an intermediate study visit at 1 month, a primary&#xD;
      endpoint study visit at 12 months, and long-term study visits at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.&#xD;

             study. Subjects may be concurrently enrolled in a post-market study, as long as the&#xD;
             post-market study device, drug or protocol does not interfere with the follow-up&#xD;
             requirements of this study or does not involve a drug that may confound the&#xD;
             interpretation of any relevant clinical events of interest (e.g. investigational DAPT&#xD;
             therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. In the investigator's opinion, subject will not be able to comply with the follow-up&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;

        Subjects will be excluded from the trial if any of the target lesions/vessels met any of&#xD;
        the following angiographic criteria during the index procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Target lesion was located within or treated through a saphenous vein graft or arterial&#xD;
             graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Target lesion was a restenotic lesion that was previously treated with a bare metal or&#xD;
             drug-eluting stent (in-stent restenosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Target lesion had any of the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Lesion location is within the left main coronary artery, or within 3 mm of the&#xD;
                  origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) or left circumflex (LCX).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Involves a side branch of &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Target vessel/lesion was excessively tortuous/angulated or is severely calcified, that&#xD;
             would prevent complete inflation of an angioplasty balloon. This assessment should be&#xD;
             based on visual estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Target vessel had angiographic evidence of thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Target lesion was totally occluded (100% stenosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Target vessel was treated with brachytherapy any time prior to the index procedure.&#xD;
