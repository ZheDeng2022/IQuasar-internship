  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and the&#xD;
      safety/tolerability of poziotinib in five patient cohorts for up to 150 previously treated&#xD;
      patients with any systemic therapy (Cohort 1: 30 Patients that have HER2-positive or&#xD;
      HER2-negative breast cancer with HER2 activating mutations, Cohort 2: 30 Patients that have&#xD;
      colorectal cancer with HER2 activating mutations, Cohort 3: Patients that have solid tumors&#xD;
      (except NSCLC, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer) with HER2 activating mutations, Cohort 4:&#xD;
      30 Patients that have high-grade glioma with EGFR activating mutations, and Cohort 5: 30&#xD;
      Patients that have solid tumors (except NSCLC or high-grade glioma) with EGFR activating&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;

      The Screening period (Day -30 to Day 1) lasts up to approximately 30 days prior to Cycle 1,&#xD;
      Day 1. Patients must meet all Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will provide written Informed Consent prior to undergoing any study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle is 28 calendar days in duration. There will be five patient cohorts and&#xD;
      eligible patients will be enrolled into each cohort in parallel based on EGFR or HER2 exon 20&#xD;
      mutation status and prior treatment status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Patients that have HER2-positive or HER2-negative breast cancer with HER2&#xD;
           activating mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Patients that have colorectal cancer with HER2 activating mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Patients that have solid tumors (except NSCLC, breast cancer, or colorectal&#xD;
           cancer) with HER2 activating mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: Patients that have high-grade glioma with EGFR activating mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: Patients that have solid tumors (except NSCLC or high-grade glioma) with EGFR&#xD;
           activating mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated 28 days per cycle until 24 months of treatment, disease&#xD;
      progression, death, intolerable adverse events (AEs), or other protocol-specified reasons for&#xD;
      patient withdrawal&#xD;
