    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label study of AUSTEDO in study subjects with dystonia. The&#xD;
      study will provide preliminary experience of the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity&#xD;
      of AUSTEDO in study subjects with dystonia. Study duration will be up to 13 weeks from&#xD;
      screening (Visit 1) to the post treatment evaluation (Visit 5). Treatment period from drug&#xD;
      initiation to final on-treatment Visit will be 12 weeks, or less, as follows: during the&#xD;
      ramp-up period, study drug will start at 12 mg/day (6 mg twice daily) and will be titrated&#xD;
      weekly by 6 mg/day increments until either 1) the maximal allowable dose (48 mg/day) is&#xD;
      reached, or 2) dose-limiting side-effects occur. In study subjects receiving a strong CYP2D6&#xD;
      inhibitor, the maximum allowed dose of AUSTEDO will be 36 mg/day, reducing study duration&#xD;
      (due to a reduction in the ramp-up period) to 11 weeks. Study subjects who experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting side effects will be maintained on their maximum tolerated dose. Once the&#xD;
      maximal dose is established for each participant, they will complete 6 continuous weeks on&#xD;
      this dose (maintenance period), followed by a 1-week washout. For study subjects unable to&#xD;
      titrate up to 48 mg/day due to side effects, the 6 weeks of maintenance will start once they&#xD;
      reduce the study drug back to the maximum well-tolerated dose. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study and will be reported after drug initiation. Dose reductions,&#xD;
      suspensions, and withdrawals due to adverse events will be recorded. ECG readings will be&#xD;
      measured at screening, during week 2, during the first week of the maintenance period&#xD;
      (whenever this is established to be, typically week 7 for subjects able to titrate up to 48&#xD;
      mg/day), immediately before washout (week 12 for those study subjects who are able to titrate&#xD;
      up to 48 mg/day) and during week 13. Assessment of Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and&#xD;
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores will occur at screening and all clinic Visits. The Mini&#xD;
      Mental (MMSE) Scale will be performed at screening and at the final on-treatment Visit (week&#xD;
      12). A video examination of the study subjects will be made at screening (right before&#xD;
      initiation of the study drug), and after 6 weeks on AUSTEDO at a steady dose (right before&#xD;
      drug cessation). Part III of the MDS-UPDRS will be performed at both of these Visits as well&#xD;
      to screen for the appearance of drug-induced parkinsonism. Videos will be sent to raters&#xD;
      blinded to treatment, Visit number and recording date.&#xD;
