    <textblock>
      One of the most important obstacles to improving end-of-life care is the inability of&#xD;
      clinicians to reliably identify those who are approaching the end-of-life. Every aspect of a&#xD;
      palliative approach to care - screening for unmet needs, treating symptoms, discussing goals&#xD;
      of care, and developing a palliative management plan - depends on the reliable and accurate&#xD;
      identification of patients with palliative needs. The investigators developed an accurate and&#xD;
      reliable mortality prediction tool that automatically identifies patients in hospital at&#xD;
      elevated risk of death in the coming year. In previous studies it has been shown that these&#xD;
      patients also frequently have unmet palliative care needs at the time they are identified by&#xD;
      the tool. This tool has been demonstrated feasible, acceptable to patients and providers, and&#xD;
      effective for changing physician behaviour in an inpatient clinical context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, this tool is implemented as part of an integrated knowledge translation&#xD;
      project to facilitate reliable and timely identification of unmet palliative needs across&#xD;
      multiple hospitals with different clinical settings and contexts. The investigators have&#xD;
      partnered with 12 hospitals to improve the quality of palliative and end-of-life care&#xD;
      provided to patients and families. With each partner site the investigators will develop a&#xD;
      comprehensive implementation plan, including stakeholder engagement, education, and feedback.&#xD;
      Process measures will be collected at each site to determine whether the tool was effective&#xD;
      for promoting the identification and documentation of unmet palliative needs. Patients who&#xD;
      were identified by the tool will also be followed over time to collect outcome and impact&#xD;
      measures to see if their end-of-life care was affected by the intervention compared to&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, van Walraven et al described the Hospital One-year Mortality Risk (HOMR) score for&#xD;
      predicting 1-year mortality for patients admitted to hospital. HOMR is based on 12&#xD;
      administrative data points routinely coded by hospitals at the time of discharge and&#xD;
      available in the CIHI Discharge Abstract Database. The model has been externally validated&#xD;
      with excellent discrimination and calibration. Among HOMR's 12 data fields, nine are&#xD;
      routinely available in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) at the time of admission in&#xD;
      Ontario. Using a method similar to that used to derive HOMR, the investigators developed a&#xD;
      &quot;modified&quot; HOMR (mHOMR) model based on the nine data fields available at the time of&#xD;
      admission. mHOMR had comparable accuracy to HOMR (C-statistic .89 vs .92, respectively).&#xD;
      Additionally, an updated version of mHOMR has recently been developed and validated, called&#xD;
      HOMR Now!, which has the same c-statistic as the original HOMR (.92) but is calculated using&#xD;
      ten data fields and an interaction available in many hospital admissions data, similar to&#xD;
      mHOMR. Using either mHOMR or HOMR Now!, hospitals are able to retrieve admissions data from&#xD;
      the EMR and calculate each patient's mortality risk on admission. If any patient's mortality&#xD;
      risk exceeds a predefined threshold, the application would send a message to their clinical&#xD;
      team prompting them to assess and address unmet palliative needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mHOMR has been implemented in four hospitals in Ontario to date and has been adapted to work&#xD;
      with different EHRs. The mHOMR application identified a gender-balanced cohort of generally&#xD;
      elderly patients (mean age of 83 years) who were admitted for several days (median length of&#xD;
      stay of 5 days) and discharged alive (89%), meaning they were not in their final days of life&#xD;
      and there would be an opportunity to screen for unmet needs and participate in care planning.&#xD;
      A second pilot study found &gt;90% of patients identified by the application had an unmet&#xD;
      palliative need- either a severe symptom or a desire to discuss ACP with a physician or&#xD;
      both-and that patients with higher mHOMR scores had more severe symptoms. The application&#xD;
      preferentially identified patients with non-cancer illnesses-most were admitted with a&#xD;
      frailty-related condition (56.8%), followed by end-stage organ failure (23.5%), and cancer&#xD;
      (20%)-meaning that the tool did not show a bias towards cancer but instead identified&#xD;
      patients who reflected the actual population of dying Canadians. These results are similar to&#xD;
      findings from HOMR Now! validation work. Furthermore, investigators found &lt;50% of those&#xD;
      identified by mHOMR had a documented palliative care consultation or Goals of Care&#xD;
      discussion, but after the integration of mHOMR notifications into existing workflow, the&#xD;
      incidence of early Goals of Care discussions and palliative care consultation increased&#xD;
      significantly. Additionally, qualitative results show the application is acceptable to&#xD;
      patients and clinicians alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the mHOMR and HOMR Now! applications are intended to be a reliable and accurate&#xD;
      &quot;trigger&quot; to improve the effectiveness of any palliative intervention by focusing attention&#xD;
      on a small group of patients with a high risk of death and unmet palliative needs. Both&#xD;
      applications can also be versatile depending on the situation-it produces a numerical risk&#xD;
      output rather than a binary yes/no like the Surprise Question, Gold Standards Framework or&#xD;
      NECPAL tools, so the user can decide what threshold to use for identifying &quot;high risk&quot;&#xD;
      patients. Thus, organizations concerned with the efficient use of limited resources could set&#xD;
      a higher mortality threshold, while organizations using more scalable interventions could&#xD;
      lower the mortality threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the initial success of the mHOMR and HOMR Now! applications in identifying unmet&#xD;
      palliative care needs in an acceptable way among patients nearing the end-of-life, the next&#xD;
      step is to implement and rigorously evaluate the immediate long-term effects of this highly&#xD;
      scalable intervention in a large population to determine whether it improves screening and&#xD;
      documentation processes and ultimately leads to better outcomes for patients, family members,&#xD;
      and the healthcare system as a whole. To achieve this aim, investigators have partnered with&#xD;
      twelve acute care hospitals from across Ontario to implement the mHOMR/HOMR-Now!&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether implementation of an mHOMR or HOMR Now! application to identify patients&#xD;
      at increased risk of death and trigger screening for unmet palliative needs improves (1)&#xD;
      identification and documentation of those needs and (2) the end-of-life care provided to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention-Implementation Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every inpatient at each site will automatically be given the intervention (an mHOMR or HOMR&#xD;
      Now! Score, depending on which application can be most easily integrated into each site's&#xD;
      existing EMR system) upon admission to an implementing unit at a participating hospital and&#xD;
      considered for secondary interventions (i.e. palliative care) based on their score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a minimum, each individual identified by the chosen HOMR tool should receive two&#xD;
      additional assessments to screen for severe symptoms and the patient's desire to engage in&#xD;
      advanced care planning (ACP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised (ESAS-R): scores of &gt;6 will be flagged as&#xD;
           'severe'. Individual clinical teams can then choose to address the symptoms as&#xD;
           appropriate for the patient, or consult a PC team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 4-item Advanced Care Planning Engagement Survey: Scores of 3-4 indicate a patient is&#xD;
           ready to discuss ACP with a member of the clinical team. Clinical teams may choose to&#xD;
           discuss ACP and goals of care (GoC) themselves, activate a local ACP/GoC intervention,&#xD;
           or distribute ACP documentation (e.g. SpeakUp resources), as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of the mHOMR/HOMR-Now! intervention in each site will follow 4 phases informed&#xD;
      by the Quality Implementation Framework:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Site-Specific Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
           To facilitate successful implementation of the mHOMR/HOMR-Now! application, three&#xD;
           strategies will be used to tailor implementation to the site-specific context, including&#xD;
           needs, resources, fit, capacity, and readiness. Firstly, members of the coordinating and&#xD;
           implementation research team will virtually conduct a detailed readiness assessment to&#xD;
           determine the best way to implement the application given the local context of each&#xD;
           site. Secondly, semi-structured focus group interviews will be held virtually at each&#xD;
           site with the Implementation team (i.e. an executive champion, implementation lead,&#xD;
           clinical lead, and information technology lead), as well as staff who will interact with&#xD;
           the HOMR application output (i.e. either recipient of or actors on the notification).&#xD;
           Lastly, select members of the implementation team will be virtually interviewed&#xD;
           individually to determine site-specific implementation barriers and facilitators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Considering the unique site context, investigators will then work with stakeholders to&#xD;
           determine the additional interventions that each site will implement once a patient has&#xD;
           been identified as being at elevated risk for mortality and unmet palliative needs by&#xD;
           the application. Notably, determination of secondary interventions will consider the&#xD;
           normal workflow and resources available at each site. Details of these interventions&#xD;
           will be provided in each site's individual protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establishment of Information Technology Infrastructure for Implementation at each Site&#xD;
&#xD;
           Logistics of the mHOMR or HOMR-Now! application will be discussed with the IT lead at&#xD;
           each site to determine the technical approach for implementation in the electronic&#xD;
           health record (EHR), including which application would be most appropriate to implement&#xD;
           given each site's existing EHR. Some EHR platforms are used by more than one site; thus,&#xD;
           solutions derived for one EHR will be shared among other partners as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once the specific technical implementation process has been defined for each site,&#xD;
           electronic and print educational material will be developed to teach staff at each site&#xD;
           about mHOMR/HOMR-Now!, how the application works, and steps to take when they receive a&#xD;
           notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Development, Deployment, and Ongoing Support for mHOMR/HOMR-Now! Implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Integration of the application into each site's EHR will be managed by the site IT lead&#xD;
           and tested to ensure the application is correctly calculating the mortality risk scores&#xD;
           and notifying the appropriate members of the care team. Once this is complete, each site&#xD;
           will host a &quot;go-live&quot; kick-off event to help generate awareness, enthusiasm, and uptake&#xD;
           of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the following six to nine months (depending on the site's funding source), the&#xD;
           application will be 'live' at each site, actively identifying newly admitted patients&#xD;
           and notifying care teams to conduct the ESAS-R and 4-item ACP Engagement Survey as&#xD;
           appropriate. Any additional site-specific interventions will also be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Process and outcomes evaluations will also occur during phase 3. In addition to phase 1&#xD;
           interviews and focus groups, these evaluations will involve: (1) a second set of&#xD;
           semi-structured interviews with members of the implementation team at each site to&#xD;
           examine determinant factors associated with successful implementation of the mHOMR&#xD;
           application; (2) a chart review to examine clinical and implementation outcomes, and;&#xD;
           (3) analysis of linked health administrative data held at ICES to evaluate long-term&#xD;
           clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Continuous Improvement of mHOMR/HOMR-Now! Implementation (Concurrent with Phases 1-3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will be regularly updated of study progress through teleconferences and&#xD;
      newsletters. These communications will also share learnings across sites to improve&#xD;
      implementation through establishment of best practices and identification of strategies to&#xD;
      overcome implementation barriers. Additionally, this process will inform implementation of&#xD;
      the application in other hospitals in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical secondary outcomes will be measured for HOMR positive patients for six to nine&#xD;
      months pre and post implementation, and followed until end of study follow-up (up to one year&#xD;
      after hospital discharge) or death. While each of these outcomes will be measured,&#xD;
      aggregated, and linked to databases held at ICES, results from individual site data will be&#xD;
      used to improve patient care by driving existing clinical best practices for palliative care,&#xD;
      symptom management, and advanced care planning. In this sense, the clinical secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will also serve as indicators for continuous quality improvement at each hospital.&#xD;

    <description>Every inpatient will automatically be given the intervention (an mHOMR/HOMR Now! score) upon admission to hospital and considered for secondary interventions based on their score. Baseline threshold will be set as &gt;0.21 (59% sensitivity and 90% specificity for 12-month mortality with mHOMR).&#xD;
At minimum each individual identified by the tool will receive two assessments to screen for severe symptoms and desire to engage in advance care planning (ACP):&#xD;
Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised: scores &gt;6 will be flagged as severe. Clinical teams will address the symptoms as appropriate for the patient.&#xD;
4-item Advanced Care Planning Engagement Survey: Scores of 3-4 indicate readiness to discuss ACP. Clinical teams may choose to discuss ACP and goals of care themselves, activate a local ACP intervention, or distribute ACP documentation.&#xD;
Both of these assessments will be done by a member of the treating team within 72 hours of the patient's hospital admission.</description>
