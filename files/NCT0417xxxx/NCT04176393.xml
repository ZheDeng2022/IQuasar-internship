    <description>subjects will receive a single dose of ivosidenib 500 mg on Day -3 (i.e., 3 days prior to the start of daily dosing) and undergo PK/PD assessments over 72 hours to evaluate drug concentrations and 2-HG levels. Following that, subjects will be treated with ivosidenib 500 mg once a day (QD) PO continuously (28-day cycles, there are no inter-cycle rest periods).</description>

&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have R/R AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have documented IDH1 R132 gene-mutated based on the central evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have ECOG PS of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must be amenable to serial bone marrow sampling and peripheral blood&#xD;
             samplings during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by Serum total bilirubin ≤&#xD;
             1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to Gilbert's disease or&#xD;
             leukemic involvement and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 3.0 × ULN, unless considered due to leukemic&#xD;
             involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must have an adequate renal function as evidenced by Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 ×&#xD;
             ULN or Creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min based on the Cockcroft-Gault glomerular&#xD;
             filtration rate (GFR) estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must be recovered from any clinically relevant toxic effects of any prior&#xD;
             surgery, radiotherapy, or other therapy intended for the treatment of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who previously received prior treatment with a mutant-specific IDH1 inhibitor&#xD;
             and progressed on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who have undergone HSCT within 60 days of the first dose of ivosidenib, or&#xD;

             allowed prior to enrollment and after the start of ivosidenib for the control of&#xD;
             leukocytosis to reduce peripheral leukemic blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who received an investigational agent &lt; 14 days prior to their first day of&#xD;
             study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who received traditional Chinese medicine with known anti-cancer indication &lt;&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subjects for whom potentially curative anticancer therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with an active severe infection that required anti-infective therapy or with&#xD;
             an unexplained fever &gt; 38.5°C during screening visits or on their first day of study&#xD;
             drug administration (at the discretion of the Investigator, subjects with tumor fever&#xD;
             may be enrolled).7. Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart&#xD;
             failure or LVEF &lt; 40% by an echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA)&#xD;
             scan obtained within approximately 28 days of C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction within the last 6 months of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with known unstable or uncontrolled angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with a known history of severe and/or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with known dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other conditions&#xD;
             that limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs administered orally.&#xD;

             there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with immediately life-threatening, severe complications of leukemia such as&#xD;
             uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated&#xD;
             intravascular coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects with a known medical history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.&#xD;
