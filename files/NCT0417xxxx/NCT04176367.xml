  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a bioequivalence study to support a generic consistency evaluation program,&#xD;
      initiated by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2015, for the evaluation of&#xD;
      quality and efficacy of the products manufactured in China. Related guidance was issued by&#xD;
      Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) on 27 Nov 2015 named &quot;Use pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter as&#xD;
      endpoint for chemical generics bioequivalence (BE) study&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicergoline localized product is manufactured at Pfizer Dalian China, while the reference&#xD;
      product is manufactured at Pfizer Italia S.r.l., Italy. The selected strength of 10 mg tablet&#xD;
      is the marketed strength in China, and the selected dose of 30 mg (3 x 10 mg tablet) is one&#xD;
      of the commonly used clinically approved daily doses with good tolerability profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, participants will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment sequences according&#xD;
      to a computer generated randomization schedule. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2&#xD;
      periods, separated by a washout period of at least 7 days between the first day of each&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior/Concomitant Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;

             7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             investigational product. (Refer to Section 6.5 for additional details).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Taking any medicinal product that changes the activity of hepatic enzymes within 28&#xD;
             days prior to Screening, such as inducer of CYP2D6.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined&#xD;

&#xD;
             Diagnostic Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A positive urine drug screen.&#xD;

             (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is &gt;= 140 mm Hg&#xD;
             (systolic) or &gt;= 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the&#xD;
             average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Baseline 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results&#xD;
             (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 millisecond [msec], complete left&#xD;
             bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third&#xD;
             degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias).&#xD;
             If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate&#xD;
             corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting corrected QT (QTcF) should be&#xD;
             used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120&#xD;
             msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS&#xD;
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted&#xD;
             ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding&#xD;
             participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Other Exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5&#xD;

             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1&#xD;
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5&#xD;
             cigarettes per day within 3 months of Screening; a positive urine nicotine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 400 mL or more within 60&#xD;
             days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to ergot alkaloids, or to any&#xD;
             of the excepients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations&#xD;
             section of this protocol.&#xD;
