  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of major non-communicable diseases such as&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes (7%), cardiovascular disease (6%), musculoskeletal disorders and some&#xD;
      cancers, and has been proposed to be the 4th leading cause of death worldwide. Reduced&#xD;
      physical activity leads to an impaired function of the hormone insulin and increased&#xD;
      adiposity. Thus, the elimination of physical inactivity would remove between 6% and 10% of&#xD;
      the major non-communicable diseases and increase life expectancy. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of a short-term (2-day) period of reduced physical activity, with and&#xD;
      without a proportional decrease in energy intake, on the action of insulin to regulate blood&#xD;
      sugar fluctuations, appetite, and cardiovascular parameters (heart rate, cardiac output,&#xD;
      stroke volume, blood flow, arterial blood pressure, peripheral vascular resistance) in&#xD;
      response to food ingestion.&#xD;
