  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is highly prevalent in children and adolescents, up to one in four children will&#xD;
      develop pain that persists or recurs for three or more months. Chronic pain is not only&#xD;
      linked to significant psychological, physical, and social concerns for affected children and&#xD;
      their families, but also places an enormous burden on healthcare systems - in the United&#xD;
      States, chronic pain costs around $19.5 billion dollars each year and ranks among the most&#xD;
      expensive pediatric health problems. Chronic pain significantly decreases quality of life and&#xD;
      is associated with numerous missing days at school or at work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several interventions exist, however, for some, the risk-benefit profile is not favorable, or&#xD;
      the effect sizes are small and the clinical effect can be questioned. In general, a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach that includes medical, psychological, and physiological aspects&#xD;
      has been shown to be most promising in the treatment of chronic pain in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical impressions suggest that an Animal-assisted Therapy (AAT) intervention could be&#xD;
      promising, but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an AAT intervention for children and adolescents with chronic pain. With&#xD;
      this pragmatic trials investigators aim to investigate the pre- and post-intervention&#xD;
      differences in pain levels, levels of emotional distress, and quality of life within&#xD;
      participants with chronic pain.&#xD;
