  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Pakistan, around 15% of children under five are wasted, which is almost twice that of the&#xD;
      global prevalence 7.5%. There is a demand for a reliable and consistent locally available&#xD;
      severe acute malnutrition (SAM) treatment option since currently the only option is to use an&#xD;
      imported ready-to-use-therapeutic food (RUTF). While imported RUTF is successful for&#xD;
      treatment of children with SAM, Pakistan is often faced with supply chain issues and&#xD;
      consequentially management of SAM with RUTF is unreliable. The World Food Programme (WFP)'s&#xD;
      work in Pakistan supports government-led efforts to improve food and nutrition security,&#xD;
      including the development of Acha Mum, a chickpea containing lipid-based ready-to-use-food.&#xD;
      Acha Mum replaces the peanut in standard RUTF formulation with chickpea, a locally available&#xD;
      legume. Acha Mum is well accepted by children in Pakistan and is currently being used as a&#xD;
      treatment for children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in targeted supplementary&#xD;
      feeding programs (TSFP) throughout the country. The broad objective of this clinical trial is&#xD;
      to test the effectiveness of a chickpea-based specialized nutritious food Acha Mum, compared&#xD;
      to a standard RUTF for the treatment of SAM. The study will be conducted in 10 basic health&#xD;
      units (BHUs) operating by PPHI in Umerkot district of Sindh, Pakistan. This will be an&#xD;
      individual randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical non-inferiority trial assessing&#xD;
      the treatment of SAM with one of two therapeutic foods. A total of 1700 children will be part&#xD;
      of the study (850 children in RUTF and 850 children in Acha Mum group). Children aged 6-59&#xD;
      months with SAM, i.e. MUAC &lt;11.5 cm and/or with bilateral pitting oedema (+, ++), with&#xD;
      appetite and without medical complications presenting at selected rural therapeutic feeding&#xD;
      clinics. The primary outcome is recovery from SAM, deﬁned as: MUAC ≥ 11.5cm (for two&#xD;
      consecutive weekly visits), clinically well, no bilateral pitting oedema (for two consecutive&#xD;
      weekly visits). The secondary outcomes include neurocognitive performance after first 4 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment as assessed by eye tracking and infant problem solving; changes in MUAC, weight,&#xD;
      and length; time to recovery from SAM; time to recovery from MAM defined as achieved a MUAC&#xD;
      ≥12.5 cm; relapse into MAM; relapse into SAM and any adverse events.&#xD;

      Rationale: In Pakistan, around 15% of children under five are wasted, which is almost twice&#xD;
      that of the global prevalence 7.5%. There is a demand for a reliable and consistent locally&#xD;
      available severe acute malnutrition (SAM) treatment option since currently the only option is&#xD;

      Objectives: The broad objective of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      chickpea-based specialized nutritious food Acha Mum, compared to a standard RUTF for the&#xD;
      treatment of SAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area: The study will be conducted in 10 basic health units (BHUs) operating by PPHI in&#xD;
      Umerkot district of Sindh, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be an individual randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial assessing the treatment of SAM with one of two therapeutic foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: A total of 1700 children will be part of the study (850 children in RUTF and 850&#xD;
      children in Acha Mum group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Children aged 6-59 months with SAM, i.e. MUAC &lt;11.5 cm and/or with&#xD;
      bilateral pitting oedema (+, ++), with appetite and without medical complications presenting&#xD;
      at selected rural therapeutic feeding clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: The duration of study will be 24 months (3 months for protocol and tool&#xD;
      development, 18 months for enrollment and follow-ups and 3 months for data cleaning, analysis&#xD;
      and report writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: The primary outcome is recovery from SAM, deﬁned as: MUAC ≥ 11.5cm (for&#xD;
      two consecutive weekly visits), clinically well, no bilateral pitting oedema (for two&#xD;
      consecutive weekly visits). The secondary outcomes include neurocognitive performance after&#xD;
      first 4 weeks of treatment as assessed by eye tracking and infant problem solving; changes in&#xD;
      MUAC, weight, and length; time to recovery from SAM; time to recovery from MAM defined as&#xD;
      achieved a MUAC ≥12.5 cm; relapse into MAM; relapse into SAM and any adverse events.&#xD;
