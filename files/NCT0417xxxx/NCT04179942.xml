  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was associated with upper and lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      inflammation, Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) proposed as a marker of airway&#xD;
      inflammation, few studies were done on the impact of continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) on FeNO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work: to study the impact of continued positive airway pressure therapy on exhaled&#xD;
      NO and using Hs-CRP as a marker of inflammation in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and Methods: This study is a case-control study including participants were newly&#xD;
      diagnosed as OSAS and control recruited from sleep outpatient clinic, full night PSG was&#xD;
      done, fractional exhaled nitric oxide and Hs-CRP were measured next morning of PSG, CPAP for&#xD;
      moderate to severe OSA patient was advised with measurement of FeNO and Hs-CRP after 3months&#xD;
      of CPAP Keywords: FeNO; Hs-CRP; CPAP; OSA. This research did not receive any specific grant&#xD;
      from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective 3 months follow up study including only (27) participants as a&#xD;
      convenient sample for the cost limitations newly diagnosed as OSA and (10) healthy control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      inclusion characters All participants enrolled in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. were ≥ 18 years old,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. non-smokers and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. excluded from any inflammatory disorders (allergy, bronchial asthma, gastro-esophageal&#xD;
           reflux disease, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases) or use of any&#xD;
           regular medication including (nasal/inhaled/oral corticosteroids, antihistaminic,&#xD;
           cysteinyl leukotriene receptor inhibitors), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. had an upper or lower respiratory tract infection 2 weeks prior to sampling. Control&#xD;
           healthy subjects were also free from any sleep disorders symptoms. Cases were recruited&#xD;
           from Sleep-disordered breathing unit out Patient Clinic in pulmonary medicine department&#xD;
           - Mansoura University - Egypt. All participants in this study were evaluated by history&#xD;
           taking with stress on OSAS questionnaires, anthropometric parameters measurement and&#xD;
           spirometric pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC ) all patients were subjected to&#xD;
           laboratory, attended, full-night polysomnography using (SONMOscreenTMplus, SOMNOmedics,&#xD;
           (Germany) with AASM standard montage, This included a standardized montage: two-channel&#xD;
           electroencephalograms (EEG; C4/A1, C3/A2), bilateral electrooculogram (EOG), submental&#xD;
           electromyogram (EMG), bilateral leg EMGs, and electrocardiography (ECG). Airflow was&#xD;
           measured using a thermistor (Healthdyne Technologies), the respiratory effort was&#xD;
           assessed by inductance plethysmography and oxygen saturation was recorded using a finger&#xD;
           probe. The oxygen saturation signal was digitally sampled at 1 Hz and stored both on the&#xD;
           PSG record and in a separate monitor for offline analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      studies were interpreted according to the last manual scoring criteria. The cases were&#xD;
      diagnosed as severe OSA according to the third international classification of sleep&#xD;
      disorders. Then they were classified according to apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) into two main&#xD;
      groups: cases (AHI ≥5) (n=) and control (AHI˂5) (n=10). Cases were classified into two&#xD;
      subgroups into severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30) (n=34) and moderate OSA (AHI (15-30) mild (n=10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the next morning of the study 30 min after PSG, the blood sample was collected for&#xD;
      measuring of high sensitivity C- reactive protein (HS-CRP) by (The Immunospec Hs-CRP) ELISA,&#xD;
      based on the principle of a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [15]. The assay&#xD;
      system utilizes a unique monoclonal antibody directed against a distinct antigenic&#xD;
      determinant on the CRP molecule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement: was measured by (NO breath®FeNO&#xD;
           monitor-Bedfont scientific Ltd) according to international recommendations [16], with a&#xD;
           single breath online method at constant flow of 50 mL/s or 12 seconds of exhalation of&#xD;
           adults with a sensitivity of one part per billion (ppb) Calibration of the analyzer was&#xD;
           automatically performed by the software. Briefly, after inhaling to total lung capacity,&#xD;
           the subjects exhaled through a mouthpiece into an exhalation circuit. All subjects were&#xD;
           asked to stop eating, drinking, and strenuous exercise for two hours prior to FeNO&#xD;
           measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CPAP therapy and follow up: 22 of 27 patients with moderate and severe OSA were advised&#xD;
           to use CPAP therapy after full-night CPAP titration study in accordance with AASM&#xD;
           recommendations [17]Preliminary education and adaptation for CPAP was performed 1hour&#xD;
           prior to the beginning of CPAP titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An optimal titration study was defined as one in which an optimal CPAP pressure was&#xD;
           reached that normalizes the AHI and eliminates snoring, desaturation, and arousals, and&#xD;
           restores a normal flow contour [17] adjusted prescribed CPAP pressure after titration&#xD;
           was administered during sleep for at least five hours per night, for at least five days&#xD;
           per week for three consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. follow up sessions after CPAP therapy: were adjusted 1,2 and 3 months after starting&#xD;
           CPAP therapy for evaluation of patients response and compliance to CPAP, Adherence to&#xD;
           the CPAP therapy was evaluated after revision of the download information from the CPAP&#xD;
           device.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adherence was defined as CPAP use for an average of 4 h on&#xD;
&#xD;
           ≥ 70% of the nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. (FeNO) was also measured in the three follow up visit with CPAP follow up, however, BMI,&#xD;
           spirometric pulmonary function(FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ) and high sensitivity C-&#xD;
           reactive protein (HS-CRP) were measured after 3 months in last follow up visit of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five patients from 27 were lost in follow up sessions because they did not use CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 for Windows® (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
      Qualitative variables were presented as numbers and percentages. Chi-square test or Fisher&#xD;
      exact test of significance was for comparison between groups, as appropriate. Quantitative&#xD;
      variables were presented as mean ±SD. They were tested for normality distribution by the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In normally distributed variables unpaired t-test (t) was used. In&#xD;
      abnormally distributed variables independent Mann-Whitney test (Z) was used. P-value ≤0.05&#xD;
      was considered statistically significant. For the detection of cut off points, we use the&#xD;
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Sensitivity, Specificity values were used for&#xD;
      studying the selected cut off point for validation as a screening tool.&#xD;
