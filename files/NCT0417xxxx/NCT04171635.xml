  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to help develop a new magnetic resonance (MR) method,&#xD;
      Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), to improve the measurement of liver iron&#xD;
      concentrations without the need for a liver biopsy. Measurement of liver iron is important to&#xD;
      diagnose and treat patients who have too much iron in their bodies (iron overload). Liver&#xD;
      iron measurements by current MRI methods (R2 and R2*) can be inaccurate because of the&#xD;
      effects of fat, fibrosis and other abnormalities. QSM should not be affected by these factors&#xD;
      and should be free of these errors. In this study, MRI measurements (QSM, R2 and R2*) of iron&#xD;
      in patients before liver transplant will be compared with chemical analysis of iron in liver&#xD;
      explants (livers removed from patients undergoing liver transplant). The liver explants would&#xD;
      otherwise be discarded. Investigators expect that this study will show that the new MRI&#xD;
      method, QSM, is superior to the current MRI methods, R2 and R2*.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research is to improve the safety of iron-chelating therapy&#xD;
      (ICT) in patients with transfusional iron overload by developing an accurate non-invasive&#xD;
      measurement of the liver iron concentration (LIC), the best measure of the body iron burden&#xD;
      in all forms of systemic iron overload. The scientific premise is that quantitative&#xD;
      susceptibility mapping (QSM) provides a quantitative biophysical connection to LIC. Safe ICT&#xD;
      requires careful adjustment of the iron chelator dose to the body iron burden to optimize&#xD;
      iron excretion while avoiding chelator toxicity, including gastrointestinal disorders,&#xD;
      audiovisual impairment, neutropenia, arthropathy, growth retardation, and hepatic and renal&#xD;
      failure. QSM enables accurate measurement of LIC by overcoming the inherent cellular&#xD;
      interference in current R2 (=1/T2) and R2* (=R2+R2') estimates that lack a well-defined&#xD;
      biophysical connection to the LIC. A fundamental biophysical limitation of the R2 and R2*&#xD;
      approaches is that intravoxel contents other than iron, including fibrosis, steatosis and&#xD;
      necroinflammation, also alter relaxation. In the liver, paramagnetic iron stored in ferritin&#xD;
      and hemosiderin is the dominant susceptibility source for QSM. Consequently, magnetic&#xD;
      susceptibility measured by QSM has a simple linear relationship with the concentration of&#xD;
      iron in the liver and is little affected by fibrosis, steatosis and necroinflammation. The&#xD;
      investigator's research plan has 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Develop hQSM for accurate measurement of LIC without interfering errors. Investigators&#xD;
      will optimize data acquisition and processing for free-breathing navigator acquisition with&#xD;
      robust fat-water separation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Validate hQSM using histology and chemical measurement of LIC in liver explants.&#xD;
      Investigators will assess the accuracies of LICs measured by hQSM and R2* in patients before&#xD;
      liver transplant with histologic examination using the reference standard of chemical&#xD;
      measurement of LIC in liver explants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Evaluate hQSM in patients with transfusional iron overload under ICT. In patients&#xD;
      regularly transfused for thalassemia major, investigators will conduct a double-blind&#xD;
      clinical study comparing the accuracy of hQSM and R2* in measuring annual changes in LIC,&#xD;
      using regression against the year-long amount of iron administered in red blood cell&#xD;
      transfusions and the year-long cumulative dose of iron chelator.&#xD;

    <description>R2* is an imaging method used in MRI. R2* = (1/T2*) where R2* is a relaxation rate measured in units of Hz ([1/sec]).
