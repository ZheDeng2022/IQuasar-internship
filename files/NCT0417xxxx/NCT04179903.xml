      The study will be single blinded since professionals who will evaluate patients will not know&#xD;
      to which exercise group patients have been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that effectiveness and safety of the exercise program are equal&#xD;
      when administered as gym trainer or individual home trainer. However, the investigators&#xD;
      expect differences in adherence among the two groups which may cause different impact on the&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the large amount of evidence on the efficacy of Physical Activity in women with&#xD;
      Osteoporosis, the investigators considered it ethically unacceptable to advise a control&#xD;
      group inactivity. On the other hand, it seemed particularly relevant for the purpose of&#xD;
      addressing the advice to the improvement of the active lifestyle, to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      the ACTLIFE exercise program when administered as gym trainer or individual home trainer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is carried out within the project &quot;Physical ACTivity: the tool to improve&#xD;
      the quality of LIFE in osteoporosis people&quot; (ACTLIFE) and is funded within the Erasmus Plus&#xD;
      Sport program (Grant Agreement N2017-2128/001-001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is aimed at evaluating differences in efficacy and safety of a PA program specifically&#xD;
      designed for improving physical function and, here in after, QoL in post menopausal women&#xD;
      with Osteoporosis (T-score &lt;-2,5) under usual pharmacological treatment, when administered as&#xD;
      gyms as group training (GGT) or Individual Home Training IHT. During the study patients will&#xD;
      be recommended to maintain their usual pharmacological treatment for OP, as prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to compare modifications of QoL measured with the Short&#xD;
      Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ECOS-16) induced by the ACTLIFE exercise&#xD;
      programme when administered as IHT or GGT. ECOS-16 is a specific-disease instrument with the&#xD;
      purpose to measure the health related QoL (HRQoL) in post menopausal women with OP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to investigate differences between IHT and GGT on&#xD;
      domains which are considered to be determinants of QoL:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) which evaluates the six activity and&#xD;
           participation domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and&#xD;
           Health (ICF): cognition, mobility, self-care, interacting with other people, life&#xD;
           activities, participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fear of falls evaluated by the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walking (6-Minute Walk Test), standing balance (stability Index), muscle force (hand&#xD;
           grip), postural alignment (occiput-wall distance) and joint mobility will be also&#xD;
           evaluated as fundamental prerequisites of motor behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass index and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adherence of each patient to the exercise program will be monitored. The adherence will&#xD;
      be measured as percent of exercise sessions actually performed /total number of scheduled&#xD;
      exercise sessions. The investigators hypothesize that effectiveness and safety of the&#xD;
      exercise program are equal when administered as GGT or IHT. However, the investigators expect&#xD;
      differences in adherence among the two groups which may cause different impact on the outcome&#xD;
      measures. In the context of the evaluation of adherence to the program, the satisfaction of&#xD;
      the participants for the ACTLIFE program administered as GGT or IHT at the end of the 12&#xD;
      months of exercise will be evaluated with a specific questionnaire based on 7-point Likert&#xD;
      scale and the reasons of abandoning the exercise program (question with structured answers).&#xD;
      Education attainment, work activity, marital status and home-gym distance will be also&#xD;
      recorded since recognized to influence the adherence in an exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of the ACTLIFE exercise program is to increase physical activity in a&#xD;
      sedentary population. The exercise program, through its beneficial effects on health, is&#xD;
      expected to generate a virtuous circle of greater activity and participation. In this&#xD;
      context, to evaluate differences between GGT or IHT, the investigators introduced in the&#xD;
      study protocol the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). PASE is an easily scored&#xD;
      survey designed specifically to measure the weekly physical activity in adult and aged&#xD;
      population. Its score combines information on leisure, household and occupational activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT with two parallel groups: in the first group the 12-month ACTLIFE program is performed as&#xD;
      IHT, while in the second as GGT. The study will be single blinded since professionals who&#xD;
      will evaluate patients will not know to which exercise group they have been assigned.&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
