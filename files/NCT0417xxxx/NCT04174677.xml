    <textblock>
      Viela Bio is conducting an open-label, randomized study of inebilizumab, VIB4920, or the&#xD;
      combination as part of a multi-center study in highly sensitized patients on the deceased&#xD;
      donor waiting list for kidney transplantation. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      three treatment arms, administered the investigational products as an intervention and&#xD;
      subsequently followed for safety.&#xD;
