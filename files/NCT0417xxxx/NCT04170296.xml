  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, multiple dose, 2 cohort, Phase 3b study to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of CCH in adult women with mild or moderate edematous fibrosclerotic&#xD;
      panniculopathy (EFP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will include approximately 80 subjects with mild or moderate EFP in the&#xD;
      posterolateral thighs and Cohort 2 will include approximately 70 subjects with mild or&#xD;
      moderate EFP in the buttocks.&#xD;
