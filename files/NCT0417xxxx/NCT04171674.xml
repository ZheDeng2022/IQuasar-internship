    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to describe plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and pulmonary diffusion&#xD;
      of high-dose ceftobiprole (500 mg loading dose followed by 2.5 g under continuous infusion&#xD;
      for 24h) for mechanically-ventilated adult patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia,&#xD;
      using population PK modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- To determine whether the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets can be achieved&#xD;
      in the plasma and epithelial lining fluid with the recommended doses of ceftobiprole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B- To define the optimal dose regimen for ceftobiprole in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C- To evaluate clinical recovery (at Day 3 and Day 8) and microbiological recovery (at Day&#xD;
      3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D- To evaluate the clinical evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E- To evaluate the clinical and biological tolerance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is still associated with high morbi-mortality, and rapid treatment with suitable&#xD;
      antibiotics is required, i.e. with a broad enough spectrum to cover the activity of all the&#xD;
      potentially-incriminated pathogens. These antibiotics must be administered at efficient doses&#xD;
      and diffused in sufficient quantity at the infection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike other beta-lactams, ceftobiprole is a new-generation broad-spectrum cephalosporin&#xD;
      which is active on the majority of pathogens encountered in acute, community-acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia (CAP) and also on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and&#xD;
      non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) like pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is indicated for&#xD;
      the treatment of CAP and also healthcare-associated pneumonia, other than that acquired under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any antibiotic administered to critically ill patients it is necessary to ensure that the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets correlated with clinical efficacy can be&#xD;
      reached with the recommended doses. The DALI study published in 2014 was the first study to&#xD;
      alert on the risk of plasma under-dosing when the standard doses of beta lactams were&#xD;
      administered in severely ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, several PK studies performed in the intensive care unit have confirmed the&#xD;
      significant risk of non-optimal doses in this population, linked to physiopathological&#xD;
      alterations caused by sepsis. So far there have been no studies specifically aimed at the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ceftobiprole in those patients with CAP requiring mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, although there is increasing use in the pharmaceutical industry and in the&#xD;
      post-developmental phases of medicines, a population PK analysis to help describe the factors&#xD;
      influencing the PK of a molecule and establish new dose regimens optimised for a given&#xD;
      population (in this case an ICU population) using Monte Carlo simulations, has never been&#xD;
      developed for ceftobiprole given by continuous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate aim of so-called adequate antibiotic therapy is to obtain the right therapeutic&#xD;
      concentrations at the infection site. During a pulmonary infection, the targeted&#xD;
      concentrations of antibiotics in the alveolar liquid must be above the minimal inhibitory&#xD;
      concentration value at the end of the dose interval for so-called &quot; time-dependent &quot;&#xD;
      antibiotics like cephalosporins. Obtaining these efficient concentrations is often made&#xD;
      difficult by the beta-lactams' mediocre pulmonary diffusion and can require an increase in&#xD;
      doses in order to reach the PK/PD target at the infection site and/or the use of continuous&#xD;
      administration of beta-lactamines. Indeed, this way of administrating is being privileged&#xD;
      more and more in order to optimise the time spent above the minimal inhibitory concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pharmacokinetic study is the first to be carried out among a population of ICU patients&#xD;
      and one that focuses on pulmonary diffusion of ceftobiprole for the treatment of severe CAP.&#xD;
      The main benefits expected are to determine the most suitable doses of ceftobiprole when this&#xD;
      molecule is used to treat ICU patients suffering from CAP. With the help of this population&#xD;
      analysis, the main aim of the study is therefore to describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the&#xD;
      plasma and pulmonary diffusion of ceftobiprole administered at high-dosage (500 mg loading&#xD;
      dose followed by 2.5 g under continuous infusion for 24h) for severe community-acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia under mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- Determine whether the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets can be achieved in&#xD;
      the plasma and epithelial lining fluid with the recommended doses of ceftobiprole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B- Define the optimal dose regimen for ceftobiprole in this population. C- Evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical recovery (at Day 3 and Day 8) and microbiological recovery (at Day 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D- Evaluate the clinical evolution. E- Evaluate the clinical and biological tolerance.&#xD;
