  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LIBERATE intervention is a multi-component self-management, symptom monitoring and&#xD;
      signposting website tailored to the supportive needs of women living with secondary breast&#xD;
      cancer. Overall, this intervention aims to improve quality of life among this growing group&#xD;
      of patients through targeted, tailored and accessible information and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised waiting list control trial aims to evaluate the feasibility of the clinically&#xD;
      integrated LIBERATE intervention. Results of participants' online symptom monitoring&#xD;
      questionnaires are integrated with their electronic patient record, enabling clinician review&#xD;
      and follow up alongside participants' own self-management activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite ongoing treatment advances for women living with secondary (metastatic, stage IV,&#xD;
      advanced) breast cancer, quality of life (QoL) remains a crucial concern. Patients' diverse&#xD;
      psycho-social and supportive needs are widely reported to be poorly understood and&#xD;
      inadequately addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LIBERATE intervention is a multi-component self-management, symptom monitoring and&#xD;
      signposting website tailored to the supportive needs of women living with secondary breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I of the LIBERATE project informed intervention development though several strands:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Semi-structured interviews with patients and health &amp; charity professionals explored the&#xD;
           supportive needs and factors affecting the quality of life of women living with&#xD;
           secondary breast cancer. This guided the components and content of the online&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A systematic review of online interventions in the context of advanced cancer was also&#xD;
           conducted. This guided the design and delivery of the online intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final intervention comprises five components delivered via an interactive website;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A wide range of holistic health information specific to secondary breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online symptom monitoring questionnaire generating tailored self-management advice with&#xD;
           results available for clinician review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case studies of a diverse range of women living with secondary breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signposting to services and resources specific to secondary breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support for others affected by a diagnosis of secondary breast cancer. The overall aims&#xD;
           of the LIBERATE intervention are to better address the supportive needs and to improve&#xD;
           the quality of life of women living with secondary breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives: In this feasibility randomised controlled trial, the investigators plan&#xD;
      to test the complete LIBERATE intervention, including the clinical integration of users'&#xD;
      symptom monitoring questionnaire results with their electronic medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to examine the feasibility, acceptability and adherence to the online&#xD;
      intervention from the perspective of women living with secondary breast cancer and to explore&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention on their quality of life and self-efficacy in managing their&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators aim to determine effect sizes to inform a potential future larger&#xD;
      scale randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility and study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult females with a diagnosis of secondary breast cancer and access to the internet who are&#xD;
      receiving their care at St James' University Hospital, Leeds, will be eligible to take part&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective randomised controlled feasibility trial using a waiting list&#xD;
      control design, repeated measures and mixed methods. Participants will be randomised&#xD;
      (following a 1:1 randomisation strategy) to either receive the intervention or to be assigned&#xD;
      to a waiting list to receive access to the intervention following study completion. Those on&#xD;
      the waiting list will receive care and support as usual during the study period. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to recruit a maximum of 30 patients to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention arm will receive training to navigate the LIBERATE website&#xD;
      and complete the online symptom monitoring questionnaires from home. They will be free to use&#xD;
      the website as much or as little as they choose over the 12 week study period. They will be&#xD;
      reminded to complete a symptom monitoring questionnaire at least once per week. Their health&#xD;
      professionals will be able to view the results of their symptom monitoring questionnaires and&#xD;
      act on the information accordingly. Alerts will also be sent out to the relevant clinician&#xD;
      when patients report any severe symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (within both the intervention and the waiting list control arm) will&#xD;
      complete paper-based self-report questionnaires measuring quality of life and self-efficacy&#xD;
      at baseline and at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate single-arm sub study will also recruit approximately 15 women with secondary&#xD;
      breast cancer (bringing the overall recruitment target to 45) who are being cared for outside&#xD;
      of the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. The aim of this study is to explore whether&#xD;
      participants outside of Leeds find symptom monitoring and the overall website useful without&#xD;
      the function for linking to their medical records. Participants will fill in questionnaires&#xD;
      asking about their QoL and confidence in self-managing their cancer before and after the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a range outcome measures to compare the LIBERATE intervention with care&#xD;
      as usual (waiting list control):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcome measures: Validated questionnaires will be used to measure quality&#xD;
      of life (EQ-5D-5L and FACT-B) and self-efficacy (CBI-B and SEMCD-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical process measures: including number of clinician alerts generated, number of Clinical&#xD;
      Nurse Specialist contacts in intervention period, calls to hospital and number of visits to&#xD;
      hospital during intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study interviews: semi-structured interviews with participants and health&#xD;
      professionals will explore acceptance and experiences of using the LIBERATE intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall findings will determine the feasibility and value of a self-management,&#xD;
      symptom-monitoring and signposting website as a supportive intervention for women living with&#xD;
      and being treated for secondary breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Descriptive statistics of returned EQ-5D-5L questionnaires.&#xD;
The standardised EQ-5D-5L measures health outcomes through a descriptive profile and a visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive profile encompasses 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). For each dimension, participants choose one of 5 levels that best describes their health on that day (from 'no problem'= 1 to 'unable/extreme'= 5). The numbers chosen for the five dimensions are combined to give a 5 digit score (minimum score = 11111 maximum score = 55555). The VAS provides participant's rating of their health on a scale from 0 ('the worst health you can imagine') to 100 ('the best health you can imagine').</description>

The 12-item questionnaire Cancer Behaviour Inventory - brief version measures patients' self-efficacy for coping with cancer by asking them to rate their confidence to perform certain behaviours on a scale of 1 (not at all confident) to 9 (totally confident). CBI-B is a single score measure (minimum score = 12, maximum score = 108) with higher scores indicative of greater self-efficacy.</description>

This 6-item SEMCD-6 measures self-efficacy to manage chronic disease, asking patients to rate their confidence in their abilities to perform a range of self-management tasks. Each of the 6 items are rated on a scale from 1 ('not at all confident') to 10 ('totally confident'). Scores for the scale are calculated as a mean of the 6 items (minimum score = 1, maximum score = 10), with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy.</description>
