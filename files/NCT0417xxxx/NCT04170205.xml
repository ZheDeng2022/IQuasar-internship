  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is an injury of cutaneous nerve fibers, mainly by a decrease in&#xD;
      their density within the cutaneous tissue. The symptomatology associated with this SFN is&#xD;
      broad with symptoms that are essentially sensory, but also autonomic. The etiologies of SFN&#xD;
      are numerous (diabetes, drug, infectious, immunological...) and clinically non-specific,&#xD;
      justifying a broad etiological assessment. The appearance of staged skin biopsies in the SFN&#xD;
      balance sheet has greatly helped to improve diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, a significant part of SFN remains without associated etiology and is considered&#xD;
      idiopathic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the distribution of the different causes of SFN remains a missing data to date, the&#xD;
      completion of this cohort study by one of the SFN reference centres should make it possible&#xD;
      to establish the prevalence of SFN causes over a large population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with clinical symptoms that may be related to SFN and who have been sampled for&#xD;
      SFN, positive or not, will be eligible for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of the anatomopathological sampling will allow patients to be separated into two&#xD;
      groups, with or without SFN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main judgement criteria will be the prevalence of etiologies associated with SFN:&#xD;
      diabetes, medication, systemic lupus erythematosus, Gougerot-Sj√∂gren syndrome, amylosis,&#xD;
      dysthyroidism, alcoholism, vitamin B12 deficiency, HIV infection, hepatitis C, paraneoplastic&#xD;
      syndrome, hereditary disease (Fabry disease, Friedreich ataxia,...), idiopathic, others.&#xD;

    <description>Source population will be patients with symptoms that may be related to SFN, who have performed a biopsy for SFN.&#xD;
Patient will be considered to have SFN if he or she has a decrease in intra-epidermal distal density at nerve endings below the 5th percentile and at least one clinical sign in favour of small fibre neuropathy.&#xD;
Clinical signs in favour of SFN are as follows :&#xD;
Sensitive symptoms: burns, stings, numbness, tingling, hot/cold sensations, electric shocks, hyperesthesia, allodynia, intolerance of bed sheets, pruritus, restless legs.&#xD;
Vegetative symptoms: erectile disorders, dry syndrome, sweating, hot flashes, vertigo/discomfort (orthostatic hypotension), digestive and/or urinary disorders, resting tachycardia, palpitations&#xD;
Vascular symptoms: erythromelalgia, acrosyndrome</description>
