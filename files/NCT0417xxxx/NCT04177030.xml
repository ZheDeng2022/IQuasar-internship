    <textblock>
      The CIRCA-CHEM study is a non-pharmacological, randomized cross-over health intervention&#xD;
      trial studying the effect of the time of day on the metabolism and concomitant toxicity of&#xD;
      exposures to pesticides found in a balanced fruits and vegetables diet, providing the same&#xD;
      weekly portions of fruit and vegetables (isopesticide dietary scheme) but consumed in two&#xD;
      different time windows (morning vs. night).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigator's study is a 2x2 randomized cross over trial. All participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of the two groups (morning vs night or night first and then&#xD;
      morning; Groups A and B, respectively) having to daily consume an isopesticide dietary&#xD;
      pattern (4:2 portions of fruits:vegetables) within a specific, time-restricted window for a&#xD;
      week and repeat the same procedure within a different time-restricted window for another week&#xD;
      after an in between wash-out period of one week. Morning time-restriction window is set to be&#xD;
      between 9am until 12pm and nighttime-restriction window is set between 7pm until 10pm,&#xD;
      respectively. Participants will be called to start time-restriction based on group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for all participants to enter the study at a baseline level of pesticide load they&#xD;
      will be asked to undergo a run-in day where no fruit and vegetable consumption is allowed&#xD;
      prior the onset of the study. Within the first week of the study, Group A (n=25) will consume&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables within time-restriction morning window (9am-12pm) and Group B (n=25)&#xD;
      will consume fruits and vegetables within time-restriction night window (7pm-10pm). After&#xD;
      washout week period where participants will be called to return to their usual dietary&#xD;
      habits, two groups will swap to the opposite time-restriction window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants should collect first morning urine samples on specific days during the first&#xD;
      week (1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th day) and during the third week (1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th day). Day&#xD;
      indicated as &quot;8th&quot;, represents the first day of the following week (first day of the wash-out&#xD;
      week and first day of the fourth week which is the last day of the study). The participants&#xD;
      are asked to consume 4 portions of fruit and 2 portions of vegetables per day during the two&#xD;
      trial periods. The fruits selected for the study that will take place during winter season of&#xD;
      2020 are: a pear (~180g), a red apple (~170g), a banana (~110g) and an orange (~400g). The&#xD;
      vegetables selected include a tomato (~200g), two cucumbers (~240g) and lettuce (1 cup,4&#xD;
      chopped). All fruits and vegetables will be freshly and seasonally produced in Cyprus.&#xD;
      Overall, dietary daily consumption of foods and fluids will be monitored with the use of a&#xD;
      dietary diary throughout the study. Participants will also be asked to take a photograph of&#xD;
      the ready to be consumed fruit and vegetable on actual time of consumption and share photos&#xD;
      with research team in order to verify at a minimum whether the pre-set time-restriction&#xD;
      criteria have been met.&#xD;
