  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo their vaginal reconstructive surgery in the usual manner, but will also&#xD;
      be randomly assigned on the day of surgery to either receive the extra injection of numbing&#xD;
      medication at the onset of surgery or not. The chances they will be assigned to the&#xD;
      additional injection is 50%. Their care in the hospital and after surgery will be the same.&#xD;
      They will participate in the study for a total of 6 weeks during which time they will be&#xD;
      asked to complete two phone surveys, during which a provider will check in on pain level and&#xD;
      pain medication use, and one office visit at 6 weeks. The office visit is part of their&#xD;
      routine care and would be a scheduled visit regardless if they participated in the study or&#xD;
      not. If they are unable to return to the office for a postoperative visit at 6 weeks, they&#xD;
      will be contact by phone instead to obtain information on satisfaction with postoperative&#xD;
      care, any complications after surgery, and overall how they are doing after surgery.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether administration of a PNB at time of vaginal reconstructive surgery can&#xD;
      reduce use of narcotics and reported pain scores in the immediate postoperative period within&#xD;
      the setting of multimodal postoperative pain control of ERAS. Women &gt;18yo undergoing vaginal&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery without a hysterectomy will be randomized to either standard of care&#xD;
      with typical use of local anesthetic during their surgery versus perioperative PNB in&#xD;
      addition to typical use of local anesthetic during their surgery. PNB will be performed with&#xD;
      0.5% bupivacaine and 10cc will be injected bilaterally. All patients will be on a standard&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative multimodal pain regimen. Patients will be followed until 6&#xD;
      weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective blinded randomized controlled trial. We will recruit women who are&#xD;
      undergoing vaginal prolapse repair surgery with a Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive&#xD;
      Surgery fellowship-trained provider within the UCLA Health System. Women will be recruited&#xD;
      prior to undergoing vaginal reconstructive surgery. They will then be randomized to control&#xD;
      group with standard of care with local anesthesia used during surgery (Group 1) or PNB in&#xD;
      addition to use of local anesthesia typically used during surgery (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pain medication will be standardized. Preoperative medications per our ERAS protocol will&#xD;
      include oral acetaminophen 1000mg, gabapentin 600mg, and celecoxib 400mg. During surgery the&#xD;
      patient will undergo their randomized intervention as either Group 1 or Group 2.&#xD;
      Postoperative medications per our ERAS protocol including scheduled acetaminophen 1,000mg PO&#xD;
      every 6 hours and ketorolac 30mg IV every 6 hours. For supplemental pain medication patients&#xD;
      will have the following available: tramadol 50mg PO every 6 hours as needed for moderate pain&#xD;
      (pain 4-6/10 on NRS scale), tramadol 100mg PO every 6 hours as needed for severe pain (pain&#xD;
      7-10/10 on NRS scale), and oxycodone 5mg PO every 4 hours as needed for breakthrough pain as&#xD;
      supplemental pain medication. If the above regimen does not allow for sufficient pain control&#xD;
      then additional hydromorphone IV 0.2mg or morphine IV 2mg can be ordered by the provider as&#xD;
      needed, but will not be standard in the postoperative order set. The providers will know what&#xD;
      intervention the patients underwent, but the patients and the care team obtaining pain scores&#xD;
      in the hospital will be blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' pain scores on the numeric rating scale (NRS) and supplemental opioid use&#xD;
      measured in morphine milligram equivalent (MME) will be tracked during their hospitalization,&#xD;
      which is typically a 23-hour observation. They will then be called at 48 hours for further&#xD;
      follow-up on pain score by NRS and asked how much opioid medication they have taken since&#xD;
      leaving the hospital and their overall satisfaction with their pain control. To help with the&#xD;
      determination of supplemental pain medication used and pain scores, the patients will be&#xD;
      provided a worksheet upon discharge that outlines their recommended medication routine,&#xD;
      allows them to record their supplemental opioid medication use with dose and time, and also&#xD;
      provides space for them to record their pain score at 48 hours post operatively. The patient&#xD;
      will then be contacted at 2 weeks after surgery to determine if they have returned to normal&#xD;
      activities (walking, sitting, and performing daily household tasks comfortably) and if so at&#xD;
      what point this occurred, as well as their overall satisfaction with their postoperative pain&#xD;
      control again. The two week contact will be either a phone call or clinic visit depending on&#xD;
      the provider's preference for patient follow-up. The last point of contact will be at 6 weeks&#xD;
      to determine time to return to normal activities, if they had not met this milestone at the&#xD;
      2-week contact, and again assess their overall satisfaction with their postoperative pain&#xD;
      control. If a patient is discharge same day instead of admitted for 23-hour observation they&#xD;
      will also receive a call at 24 hours postoperative to check on pain score and supplemental&#xD;
      pain medication used.&#xD;
