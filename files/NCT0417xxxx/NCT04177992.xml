  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most premature babies require oxygen therapy. There is uncertainty about what oxygen levels&#xD;
      are the best. The oxygen levels in the blood are measured using a monitor called a saturation&#xD;
      monitor and the oxygen the baby breathes is adjusted to keep the level in a target range.&#xD;
      Although there is evidence that lower oxygen levels maybe harmful, it is not known how high&#xD;
      they need to be for maximum benefit. Very high levels are also harmful. Saturation monitors&#xD;
      are not very good for checking for high oxygen levels. For this a different kind of monitor,&#xD;
      called a transcutaneous monitor, is better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping oxygen levels stable is usually done by nurses adjusting the oxygen levels by hand&#xD;
      (manual control). There is also equipment available that can do this automatically (servo&#xD;
      control). It is not known which is best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of automated control have shown that infants spend more time within their intended&#xD;
      target oxygen saturation range. These have not included measurements of transcutaneous&#xD;
      oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to show the transcutaneous oxygen levels as well as the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation levels when babies have their oxygen adjusted manually or automatically.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently oxygen is titrated against saturation (SpO2) by manual adjustment. Automated or&#xD;
      servo-control systems have been developed that result in tighter control of SpO2 and more&#xD;
      time spent in the intended target range. These systems are already in clinical use. Automated&#xD;
      systems produce quite large fluctuations in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in order to&#xD;
      keep SpO2 in range. It is possible that this could result in short periods of high or low&#xD;
      oxygen tension (PO2) that are undetectable using saturation monitoring. Studies to date have&#xD;
      examined the effects of manual and automated (servo) oxygen targeting on SpO2 but not on&#xD;
      transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to determine the achieved SpO2 and TcPO2 distributions associated with the&#xD;
      use of manual and automated control as a first step in planning trials comparing these&#xD;
      approaches over many weeks. When this is measured over a small number of hours it is not&#xD;
      anticipated that this would have an influence on clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, single centre, randomised crossover trial of automated (servo)&#xD;
      control versus manual oxygen titration. Each infant will act as their own control. Infants&#xD;
      born at less than 29 weeks gestation, greater than 48 hour of age and receiving supplementary&#xD;
      oxygen will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be undertaken in the Neonatal Unit at the Simpson Centre for Reproductive&#xD;
      Health at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study time is 12 hours for each infant. Infants will be randomised to commence on&#xD;
      either automated (servo) control or manual mode. SpO2 (range 90-95%) will be continuously&#xD;
      monitored as per normal standard of care. A second pulse oximetry probe will be place for&#xD;
      servo control input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional monitoring will be carried out as shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TcPO2 monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FiO2 monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Heart rate monitoring (used to validate SpO2 readings)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Arterial gas sampling (only if conducted by the direct care team as part of the routine&#xD;
           care of the infant; no extra blood samples will be taken as part of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In manual mode, all oxygen adjustments will be made by clinical/nursing staff. In automated&#xD;
      mode, oxygen will be adjusted by the respiratory support device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In automated mode (servo control), oxygen adjustments will be made by one of two devices&#xD;
      (depending on the clinical requirements of the baby) - the IntellO2 device (IntellO2,&#xD;
      Vapotherm) or Leoni plus CLAC (Closed-Loop Automated oxygen Control) ventilator (Leoni plus,&#xD;
      LÃ¶wenstein Medical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2 and TcPO2 readings will be downloaded directly from the multiparameter patient monitor.&#xD;
      SpO2 will be measured using a Phillips MX500 multiparameter monitor. TcPO2 will be measured&#xD;
      using a SenTec Digital Monitoring System with OxiVent sensor. TcPO2 is calculated by dynamic&#xD;
      fluorescence quenching which measures oxygen molecules present in the vicinity of a&#xD;
      fluorescent dye incorporated within the sensor surface. The sensor is operated at a constant&#xD;
      temperature of 43 degrees Celsius. Control of sensor temperature and application duration are&#xD;
      designed to meet all applicable standards and this monitoring device is used routinely in&#xD;
      many neonatal units.&#xD;
