  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is an oral tumour deactivation agent that potently blocks multiple protein&#xD;
      kinases, including kinases involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2),&#xD;
      oncogenesis (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E), metastasis (VEGFR3, PDGFR, FGFR) and tumour&#xD;
      immunity (CSF1R). In particular, regorafenib inhibits mutated KIT, a major oncogenic driver&#xD;
      in gastrointestinal stromal tumours, and thereby blocks tumour cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib has shown in clinical trials an acceptable benefit-risk across different tumor&#xD;
      types, including colorectal cancer (CRC), GastroIntestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) and HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (≥30%) in patients receiving regorafenib&#xD;
      are pain, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), asthenia/fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite and&#xD;
      food intake, hypertension, and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody to the programmed death&#xD;
      (PD)-1 receptor, blocking the interaction with PD-ligand (PD-L)1/PD-L213 and restoring&#xD;
      T-cell-mediated antitumor activity. Nivolumab was evaluated in second-line the CheckMate 040&#xD;
      Study (Escalation and Expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cohorts of the CheckMate 040 Study, the safety profile was acceptable and there were&#xD;
      no reported nivolumab-related deaths. In the dose-expansion cohorts from the Phase 1/2&#xD;
      CheckMate 040 Study, 65% of patients had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any&#xD;
      grade 18% with Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs with fatigue, pruritus, and rash being the most common.&#xD;
      Elevation of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were the most&#xD;
      frequent Grade 3-4 TRAEs. AST/ALT elevations, however, were generally asymptomatic and&#xD;
      readily managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the rationale of this Phase I/IIa trial is to optimize the action of&#xD;
      regorafenib and nivolumab but bearing in mind the potential impact of the drug-interaction&#xD;
      and enhancement of the severity and/or frequency of adverse events. Thus, regorafenib will be&#xD;
      administered as monotherapy during the first 2 cycles (each cycle is 3 weeks on plus 1 week&#xD;
      off) of treatment to enhance T cell trafficking and infiltration into the tumor bed to&#xD;
      increase the benefits of anti-PD-PD-L1, specific stimuli while emitting Damage-associated&#xD;
      molecular patterns (DAMPs), followed by regorafenib plus nivolumab to impact step 7 of the&#xD;
      cancer immunity cycle described by Chen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-PD-L1 effect under hypoxia was evaluated by Noman et al in a tumor model and they&#xD;
      postulated that the abrogated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)-mediated T cell&#xD;
      suppression is achieved in part by modulating the cytokine production (IL-6 and IL-10).&#xD;
      Specifically, hypoxia could promote immunosuppression by reducing the cytotoxic efficacy of&#xD;
      immune cells, by increasing the peri-tumoral immunosuppressive cell populations infiltration&#xD;
      of and priming the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current options for first line are sorafenib and atezolizumab-bevacizumab. Lenvatinib has&#xD;
      been shown to be non-inferior to sorafenib, but it is less frequently used and its toxicity&#xD;
      profile mandates a stringent selection of patients. Sorafenib shares some molecular targets&#xD;
      with regorafenib, but this has specific action against VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, Tie-2, PDGFR,&#xD;
      FGFR-1, c-Kit, RET and p38-alpha7. Both are antiangiogenic as bevacizumab, but while&#xD;
      bevacizumab is limited to the VEGF pathway, they act on several additional target involved in&#xD;
      cancer progression. Atezolizumab and nivolumab target the PD1 checkpoint but acting at&#xD;
      different levels: PD-1 receptor for Nivolumab and PD-L1 for Atezolizumab. This implies a&#xD;
      difference and if resistance to one of the antibodies emerges during treatment, the use of&#xD;
      the other one may overcome such key event leading to treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to do a sequential treatment combining regorafenib, second- line&#xD;
      treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with anti PD-1 to enhance the outcome of patients&#xD;
      based on the synergy between both drugs.&#xD;
