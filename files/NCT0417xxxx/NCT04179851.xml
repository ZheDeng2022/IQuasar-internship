  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the jugular venous pressure (JVP) is an important clinical sign and correlates&#xD;
      with right atrial (RA) pressure. A patient with heart failure (HF) typically has an elevated&#xD;
      JVP, but in cases of dehydration JVP may be low. Assessment of the JVP is key to the&#xD;
      management of patients with fluid overload or needing diuretics. Currently the assessment of&#xD;
      JVP is made by the physician by direct visualization of the neck veins. However this is&#xD;
      inaccurate, may vary between investigators and depends largely on the patient's habitus. The&#xD;
      JVP and RA pressures may also be directly measured by catheterization (a routine during right&#xD;
      heart catheterization), but this is an invasive procedure that is seldom performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thermal movie of the external jugular vein at a specific neck position may help to measure&#xD;
      the JVP. In this study different modalities of JVP assessment (clinical assessment, thermal&#xD;
      image and invasive measurement) are to be compared&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for right heart catheterization at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center for&#xD;
      non-study related medical indications will be approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive estimates of JVP will be performed independently prior to the right heart&#xD;
      catheterization, during the waiting period (within 2 hours) prior to catheterization. These&#xD;
      will include up to 2min of thermal camera recording (to be analysed offline) and a&#xD;
      physician's JVP evaluation. The angle of the patient's upper body will be 30-60Â°, the&#xD;
      rotation of the neck will be optimal for filming, and the neck area may be cooled to enhance&#xD;
      the images. Blinding to the results will be confirmed by performance with separate&#xD;
      investigators and separate data registration. Right heart catheterization will then be&#xD;
      performed and RA pressure will be recorded, as well as pulmonary and wedge pressures. JVP&#xD;
      measured by physician and thermal image will be matched with invasive catheterization (the&#xD;
      gold standard) using Bland Altman plots and Spearmann correlation and comparison between&#xD;
      methods will be performed.&#xD;
