  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the therapeutic adherence of the patient-family caregiver with non-communicable&#xD;
      chronic disease through the hospital transition-discharge plan program in a second level&#xD;
      institution in the metropolitan area of Bucaramanga. Methods: The study will be a randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial in 100 participants who meet the inclusion criteria, distributed in&#xD;
      a 1: 1 ratio for the intervention group and the control group, considering a confidence level&#xD;
      of 90%, power of 80% and a reduction of 30%. Expected results: demonstrate the relevance of&#xD;
      the program in the target population through the formation of information mechanisms between&#xD;
      the parties involved in direct care, the development of skills and safety at home; the timely&#xD;
      identification of the risks inherent to clinical conditions or possible complications&#xD;
      associated with care, which aim to reduce the burdens related to the health - disease&#xD;
      experience; also emphasize the continuity of the treatment established. On the other hand,&#xD;
      achieve a more informed professional performance, prepared, transparent, that responds to the&#xD;
      needs and expectations of the user in terms of monitoring and comprehensive therapeutic&#xD;
      management. Impact: It is expected that this research will be the basis for the&#xD;
      protocolization and implementation of the hospital discharge transition plan program in the&#xD;
      health institution and subsequently develop a prospective study on a larger scale, which will&#xD;
      allow evaluating its impact on the target population in order to reduce the complications,&#xD;
      re-admissions and costs derived from the care of chronic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Noncommunicable chronic diseases are pathologies that over time require skills in the patient&#xD;
      and family caregiver; to ensure safe and continuous care once they are discharged from health&#xD;
      institutions. The approach of them represents multiple challenges in need of greater&#xD;
      communication and education; for this, the importance of generating strategies through&#xD;
      different interventions must be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this order of ideas, the program Plan of discharge or discharge consists of a coordinated&#xD;
      intervention and executed by nursing staff that captures the patient dyad with chronic&#xD;
      illness-family caregiver from his admission, stay and hospital discharge. The previous&#xD;
      approach consists of a systematized guide that contemplates the following activities: 1)&#xD;
      assessment of the family caregiver patient dyad to define the competence for care in the home&#xD;
      (CARING), the level of risk and complexity of the care associated with the treatment in the&#xD;
      home, according to defined risk: polypharmacy, parenteral medications, control medications&#xD;
      and / or invasive devices; 2) education and instruction to the patient and the family&#xD;
      caregiver during the hospital stay, anticipating the care needs at the time of discharge,&#xD;
      with delivery of booklets, brochures and instructions, and 3) telephone follow-up for up to&#xD;
      one month, by means of a 2-call call. week. (Melo Melo, Vargas Hernández, Carrrillo, &amp;&#xD;
      Alarcón Trujillo, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study carried out by (Sanchez, Carrillo Gonzalez, &amp; Barrera, 2014) they refer that there&#xD;
      exists a great variety of literature on the plan of transition and hospital discharge, in&#xD;
      which it is possible to evidence a heterogeneous level opposite to concrete guidelines, to&#xD;
      advance these plans, although this management is recommended in benefit of the users since&#xD;
      the evidence on the effectiveness of the development of plans of care, as fundamental part of&#xD;
      the continuous, safe and integral care of the patients and their families is very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The support of professionals, institutions and the health system must respond to these&#xD;
      demands to ensure the right to quality care for the sick person and the support required by&#xD;
      his or her family caregiver, as well as other factors that influence access, security,&#xD;
      continuity, social support with the use of appropriate information and communication&#xD;
      technology and the strengthening of capacities for self-management and competence for care.&#xD;
      (Carrillo Gonzalez , Sanchez Herrera, Gomez, Carreño, &amp; Chaparro Diaz, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to highlight that in a study conducted by (Sara Gutiérrez 2014) its objective&#xD;
      was to identify the way of educating both the patient and the family at the time of&#xD;
      discharge, it was possible to identify that the nursing staff does not give education to&#xD;
      patients of the instructions issued by the medical staff; patients and their caregivers do&#xD;
      not understand the care received and therefore 86% do not comply with the latest indications&#xD;
      as well as 50% of re-entries is given for not having understood or had education in front of&#xD;
      the care and instructions given at the time of discharge of the patient. (Gutierrez Suarez &amp;&#xD;
      Freire, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding Effectiveness of the egress or transition plan for safe, comprehensive and&#xD;
      continuous care, a trend is shown that would allow recommending the hospital transition and&#xD;
      discharge plan, to support continuity, facilitate change, specify the guideline, avoid&#xD;
      complications and decrease avoidable cost in patients with chronic, non-communicable disease.&#xD;
      (Gutierrez Suarez &amp; Freire, 2014)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand (Ginarte Arias, 2001) comments that in the majority of cases the patient&#xD;
      and / or caregiver is blamed in the adherence; However, 'it is suggested that public policies&#xD;
      and the health system could be directly related to the cause of non-adherence to treatment.'&#xD;
      (Ginarte Arias, 2001) In addition, the weaknesses of the Health System contribute to the&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess adherence, different instruments have been designed, the most appropriate for this&#xD;
      study being the Therapeutic Adherence Scale: it contains three factors, each with seven items&#xD;
      distributed as follows: Control over the intake of medicines and foods, Medical follow-up&#xD;
      behavioral and self-efficacy. Adherence is measured as a percentage, with 100 patients&#xD;
      adhering. In this order of ideas, this instrument allows the evaluation of adherence in&#xD;
      chronic diseases, without being directed to a specific disease. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      authors have concluded that this scale identifies behavioral characteristics of patients,&#xD;
      which favor or not their adherence to treatment (Soria Trujano, Vega Valero, &amp; Navas Quiroz,&#xD;
      2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program of Transition - Discharge Hospital, is based on strategies that can reduce adherence&#xD;
      to treatment being predictive and key factors among which are: 'lack of knowledge of the&#xD;
      disease, the therapeutic regimen and the consequences of non-compliance by the patient; lack&#xD;
      of an adequate relationship between the patient and the doctor, complexity and long duration&#xD;
      of treatment, asymptomatic disease, inadequate follow-up or lack of an elaborate plan on the&#xD;
      abandonment of the medication; presence of adverse effects, cost of medication and / or&#xD;
      copayment, failure to attend medical appointments, presence of psychological problems such as&#xD;
      depression or anxiety, beliefs and perceptions of the patient. The transition and hospital&#xD;
      discharge program starts from the patient's admission to hospital. the institution and the&#xD;
      medication and presence of cognitive difficulties '. (Dilla, Valladares, Lizán, &amp; Sacristán,&#xD;
      2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research proposal is in the context and is articulated with the Comprehensive Health&#xD;
      Care Policy (PAIS), where it addresses the different actors of the Health System to intervene&#xD;
      in the social determinants that promote the health of people with chronic diseases. . It also&#xD;
      shows the importance of intervening in public health with programs that in a short period&#xD;
      contribute in a concrete way to the operative component in the Model of Integral Health Care&#xD;
      (MIAS). (Ministry of Health and Social Protection, 2016)&#xD;
