      The main purpose of this study is to validate the ability of the Nelli system (video-based&#xD;
      epilepsy examination system) to detect epileptic motor seizure behaviors in patients at rest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proper seizure documentation is an important tool to evaluate treatment outcomes and risks&#xD;
      associated with epileptic seizures. Apart from a costly in-hospital video&#xD;
      electro-encephalogram (VEEG) monitoring, most patients with epilepsy log and track their&#xD;
      seizures with the help of the seizure diaries only. However, the reliability of the diaries&#xD;
      is heavily dependent on an accurate recognition and recording of the seizures. There is an&#xD;
      obvious need for a more objective and reliable seizure detection method. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a low-cost video-based examination system, designed to detect motor seizure behaviors&#xD;
      in patients at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to clinically validate the ability of the Nelli system&#xD;
      (video-based epilepsy examination system) to detect epileptic motor seizure behaviors in&#xD;
      patients at rest, using simultaneous VEEG as the ground truth with the reference to all motor&#xD;
      seizures and individual motor seizure types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design established as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study population is represented by 90 epilepsy patients with suspected history of motor&#xD;
           seizures undergoing a standard VEEG examination for clinical evaluation of epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Co-registration of standard VEEG with the Nelli video- and audio-based system is&#xD;
           performed, duration of the registration is 1-4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The inclusion criteria for seizures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Epileptic motor seizures appearing from rest while patients are in supine position&#xD;
                in their monitoring bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The seizures are determined to be epileptic based on electroclinical&#xD;
                characteristics by the responsible neurophysiologist / epileptologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The seizures can be classified into motor seizure types (both focal and&#xD;
                generalized) using the 2017 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) seizure&#xD;
                classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The registrations are analyzed by the Nelli system blinded to any clinical information.&#xD;
           Nelli system consists of two evaluation components:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Algorithmic component (pre-trained machine learning model based on video and audio&#xD;
                signals)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Supervisory component (performed by experienced VEEG technicians)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reports containing the seizure type classification (time-stamped) are provided by the&#xD;
           VEEG laboratory, the performance of the Nelli system is assessed using these reports as&#xD;
           the ground truth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Specificity and sensitivity of the Nelli system are evaluated with reference to both&#xD;
           all motor seizures and individual motor seizure types.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The secondary outcome measures are established as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To assess the latency from the onset of the seizure detection by the Nelli system&#xD;
                in comparison to VEEG registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To determine an inter-rater agreement for the supervisory component of the Nelli&#xD;
                system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To investigate the performance of the algorithmic component of the Nelli system&#xD;
                alone.&#xD;
