      Purpose: To test the effectiveness of an exercise intervention that combines group walking,&#xD;
      activity tracking, and heart rate monitoring (i.e. Physical Activity can Enhance Life,&#xD;
      PACE-Life) on the physical and mental health for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 56 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): During the baseline assessment, which can be completed virtually and&#xD;
      in-person (based on participant preference) all participants will be provided with a Fitbit&#xD;
      wristband and instructed how to use it. During the first group session, participants will be&#xD;
      taught how to use their heart rate (on the Fitbit) to determine how fast participants should&#xD;
      walk (to achieve the appropriate exercise dosage). Information on proper care, usage, and how&#xD;
      to determine the appropriate heart rate from the watch, to guide the intensity of the walk,&#xD;
      will be provided to participants and reviewed at each group session. Participants randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the PACE Life virtual walking group sessions will meet the other group members&#xD;
      and group leaders and be reminded of the heart rate (HR) that corresponds with the intensity&#xD;
      of that group session. Next, the group will exercise for 15 minutes in the first two weeks,&#xD;
      progressing to 30-minute walking sessions over the course of the intervention. At the&#xD;
      completion of the sessions, everyone will take a break for water and review the walk. After&#xD;
      the second group session of each week, participants will receive weekly progress reports of&#xD;
      their steps and minutes spent walking the prior week (obtained from Fitbit devices). During&#xD;
      this session, participants will also set individual goals for the upcoming week for both&#xD;
      their &quot;intensity walks&quot; and total steps per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomly assigned to Fitbit Alone will be given a Fitbit and shown how to use it&#xD;
      by study staff. Participants will also be given information on current recommended physical&#xD;
      activity guidelines (150 min/week of moderate intensity exercise) and will be told that study&#xD;
      staff may be contacting them on a weekly basis (or shorter, if necessary) if it looks like&#xD;
      participants are not wearing their Fitbit for a certain number of days (e.g. 3 consecutive&#xD;
      days) or to troubleshoot any issues. If necessary, participants might be invited to meet with&#xD;
      research staff to get assistance on any Fitibit or exercise-related issues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overview of Procedures: The PACE-Life Group will be integrated into the Schizophrenia&#xD;
      Treatment and Evaluation Program (STEP) outpatient clinics in Raleigh, NC and Carrboro, NC.&#xD;
      The group walks will occur on a secure online platform (Zoom). Goal-setting groups and all&#xD;
      assessments will also take place on a secure online platform (Zoom). Goal-setting will&#xD;
      include setting goals for the upcoming week in terms of number of steps as well as how many&#xD;
      intensity walks individuals plan to complete. Clinic-based group sessions will also include&#xD;
      if-then plans and problem solving any issues that interfere with home-based walks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fitbit Alone participants will be given a Fitbit and instructed on how to use them as&#xD;
      well as information on current recommended physical activity guidelines. Participants will be&#xD;
      told that study staff may be contacting them on a weekly basis (or shorter, if necessary) if&#xD;
      it looks like they are not wearing their Fitbit for a certain number of days or to&#xD;
      troubleshoot any issues. If necessary participants may be invited to meet with research staff&#xD;
      to receive assistance on any Fitbit or exercise-related issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments/Measures: The exercise intervention, PACE-Life, will last for 16 weeks and&#xD;
      includes both virtual group walks and independent walks. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete assessments (either virtually or in-person based on preference) at screening,&#xD;
      baseline, mid-point, post-test, and 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Screening the following measures will be examined: Demographics, the Wide Range&#xD;
      Achievement Test (WRAT), a licensed physician will complete a medical history and physical&#xD;
      exam to provide medical clearance for participants, Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PAR-Q) and the -the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be used to&#xD;
      verify that participants have a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis before they are enrolled in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Baseline, Mid-point, Post-test, and 1-Month Follow-up the following measures will be&#xD;
      examined: Demographics, Minutes Spent Walking, the Short Form International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPAQ), Steps/day, Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)- CRF will be measured using&#xD;
      the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), if in person, or compute CRF based on an equation by Jackson,&#xD;
      A.S., et al (1990) that includes recent weight and height, for the calculation of BMI,&#xD;
      gender, self-reported physical activity level, and age, Self-determination Basic Needs, the&#xD;
      Basic Psychological Need Scale-in General, the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale&#xD;
      (BPNES), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Resting Systolic/Diastolic Blood&#xD;
      Pressure and resting heart rate (RHR), autonomous motivation will be measured with the&#xD;
      Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2 (BREQ-2), enjoyment of walking will be&#xD;
      measured with the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), the UCLA Loneliness Scale,&#xD;
      Weight, BMI, and Waist/hip Circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the open trial, the investigators will administer a brief questionnaire&#xD;
      to the participants regarding satisfaction and acceptability that will include both Likert&#xD;
      ratings and open-ended questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention- PACE-Life Groups will occur twice per week for 15 minutes in the first two&#xD;
      weeks, progressing to 30-minute walking sessions over the course of the intervention without&#xD;
      changes in frequency. The intensity of virtual walks will increase throughout the&#xD;
      intervention in a stepwise fashion to create an exercise dose response to maximize impact on&#xD;
      CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitbits: All participants will be provided a Fitbit that is labeled with a participant&#xD;
      number. All Fitbits are paired to a Fitbit account. Data from Fitbit devices can be synced to&#xD;
      the corresponding account and accessed through Fitbit.com. Participants will be provided&#xD;
      information about their accounts should participants want to look at the data but will be&#xD;
      asked not to change any of the settings as the investigators will be using data for tracking&#xD;
      steps/day and minutes spent walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Changes due to COVID-19 Pandemic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been formalized and made permanent as&#xD;
      outlined above. Additionally, walking groups will take place virtually, on a secure online&#xD;
      platform (Zoom). The Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) will be used instead of the Wechsler&#xD;
      Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) to measure a minimum reading level (4th grade) to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
