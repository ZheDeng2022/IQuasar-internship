  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenvatinib and pembrolizumab work in treating patients&#xD;
      with anaplastic thyroid cancer that is stage IVB and has spread to nearby tissue or lymph&#xD;
      nodes (locally advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable), or stage IVC that&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Lenvatinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Given lenvatinib and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may work better than giving either one alone in treating stage IVB or C&#xD;
      anaplastic thyroid cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Demonstrate the efficacy (overall survival [OS]) of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      treatment naive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with&#xD;
      lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Establish safety for concurrent administration of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Translational endpoints: cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) changes and immune&#xD;
      biomarkers will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also receive lenvatinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;

          -  Subjects must be willing to undergo tumor biopsy prior to and after treatment with&#xD;
             lenvatinib/pembrolizumab, unless in the opinion of the treating physician, a biopsy is&#xD;
             not feasible or safe&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;

             contraceptive guidance during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt; 140 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;&#xD;
             90 mmHg) in spite of an optimized regimen of antihypertensive medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electrolyte abnormalities that have not been corrected, with the exception of calcium&#xD;
             if oral calcium and calcitriol are being titrated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiovascular impairment: history of congestive heart failure greater&#xD;
             than New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, unstable angina, myocardial&#xD;

             the principal investigator. The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood&#xD;
             vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of&#xD;
             severe hemorrhage and tracheoesophageal fistula associated with tumor&#xD;
             shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 1 week of course 1 day 1&#xD;
&#xD;

             hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy within &lt; 1 week prior to study day 1 or patients who have not&#xD;
             recovered (i.e., =&lt; grade 2) from adverse events due to a previously administered&#xD;
             agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous anti-angiogenic targeted therapy is excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis B (chronic or acute)&#xD;
             or hepatitis C infection. Patients with past or resolved hepatitis B infection&#xD;

             anti-HBc [antibody to hepatitis B core antigen] antibody test) are eligible. However,&#xD;
             patients with past or resolved HBV should be monitored for reactivation by a&#xD;
             specialist. Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only&#xD;
             if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;

             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has severe hypersensitivity (&gt;= grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a&#xD;
             positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG] (or human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             [hCG]) test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-hCG [or&#xD;
             hCG]). A women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who has a positive urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test within 72 hours prior to the first infusion will be excluded. If the urine test&#xD;
             is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required&#xD;
