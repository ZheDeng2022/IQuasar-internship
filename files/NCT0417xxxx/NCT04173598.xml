  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments are extremely common in schizophrenia and strongly predict deficit in&#xD;
      daily functioning, the poor managing medication and multiple hospitalizations. Cognitive&#xD;
      remediation is recognized to have an impact on cognitive impairments by engaging preserved&#xD;
      cognitive functions or by implementing environmental supports that sustain independent&#xD;
      living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pr. Velligan (University of San Antonio) developed and tested a manualized intervention,&#xD;
      called Cognitive Adaptation Training. In this program, trained mental health specialists&#xD;
      implement compensatory technique such as environmental supports in the individual's living&#xD;
      environment to live more independently and achieve greater self-sufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, implementing this program needs a lot of professionals and time to maintain CAT&#xD;
      effects. This type of intervention is not often done in community care and explains the large&#xD;
      number of patients who are dependent on family members for daily living activities. Training&#xD;
      family members in this form of intervention would be an appropriate way to resolve these&#xD;
      issues. Families expressed a real interest in these types of home-support strategies that CAT&#xD;
      offers. Recently, Pr. Kidd and Pr. Velligan developed a CAT version for families and created&#xD;
      a manual accessible to people without any knowledge of cognitive deficit. This manual helps&#xD;
      families to select specific cognitive-adaptative strategies with their relative to achieve&#xD;
      targeted goals. Thism ethod has been translated in French.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to examine whether Web-based family Cognitive Adaptation Training&#xD;
      can improve functioning, medication adherence and negative symptoms for individuals with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and reduce burden for family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 Dyads consisting of one caregiver and one supported individual with&#xD;
      schizophrenia will be randomized to either a Web-based family Cognitive Adaptation Training&#xD;
      or an Internet-based control condition. Primary outcome measured will be the score on the&#xD;
      life skills profile. Secondary outcomes will include the global score of the Zarit burden&#xD;
      Interview, PANSS negative score, and medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of intervention is expected to be developed in territorial area where professionals&#xD;
      are not trained to cognitive remediation and therefore substantially lowers the barrier to&#xD;
      the deployment of cognitive intervention with other psychosocial interventions for individual&#xD;
      with schizophrenia and their caregivers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Context and justification It has been shown that when patient's family commits to a&#xD;
      psycho-educational programme, the relapse rate of the patients themselves is halved to an&#xD;
      equivalent level to that of drug treatment. Cognitive disorders affect 80% of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and have deleterious consequences on their autonomy and daily functioning.&#xD;
      Cognitive remediation has now clearly demonstrated its effectiveness in the management of&#xD;
      these cognitive disorders, particularly with regard to compensatory approaches that aim&#xD;
      modifying the environment and providing external support. However, access to cognitive&#xD;
      remediation remains extremely limited. It is only available in a limited number of&#xD;
      specialized centres. In order to allow a better access to these cognitive remediation methods&#xD;
      and to maintain its effects over time, the objective of this research project is to develop a&#xD;
      web-based intervention, the Cognitive Adaptative Training for Caregivers (&quot;CAT famille&quot;),&#xD;
      aimed at accompanying and guiding family carers via an internet video chat with a&#xD;
      psychologist to implement cognitive remediation techniques of compensatory approach directly&#xD;
      into their sick relative living home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main and secondary objectives The main objective is to evaluate the impact of a web-based&#xD;
      intervention aimed at training a family caregiver in cognitive remediation techniques using a&#xD;
      compensatory approach on the daily life functioning of his/her family member suffering from&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Secondary objectives are to assess improvement in: 1) caregiver burden, 2)&#xD;
      caregiver and patient quality of life, 3) negative symptoms, and 4) patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This is a comparative, prospective, randomized study including two groups of&#xD;
      (patient/caregiver) dyads: 1) an intervention group consisting of a (patient + family carer)&#xD;
      dyad benefiting, in addition to the usual treatment, from the intervention for the family&#xD;
      carer, and 2) a group consisting of a (patient + caregiver) dyad with usual care (control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Psycho-education manual, with a weekly reading module and a 15-minute webcam&#xD;
      feedback by the psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: Family CAT manual, with a module each week to be read according to the&#xD;
      patient's objectives and a 15-minute webcam feedback by the psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before intervention: Neuropsychological assessment + home assessment of the environment and&#xD;
      the performance of daily living activities by psychologist A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intervention: Home assessment of the environment and the performance of daily living&#xD;
      activities by psychologist B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are: 1) for patients: patients with schizophrenia, aged 18 to 50, who&#xD;
      can read, understand and speak French, 2) for parents: understand, speak and read French. The&#xD;
      main outcome will be the assessment of the patient's daily life functioning as measured by&#xD;
      the Life Skills Profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of visits and follow-up: 3 visits during a prospective follow-up over 10 months&#xD;
      Duration of inclusions: 18 months and duration of statistical analysis/valuation: 3-6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University Service of Adult Psychiatry of the University Hospital of Montpellier is one&#xD;
      of the schizophrenia expert centres of the Fondamental network. SUPA has proven expertise in&#xD;
      the field of cognitive remediation (see PRME Grecco in progress). SUPA works in collaboration&#xD;
      with the family carers of people diagnosed with schizophrenia, in particular through the&#xD;
      Profamille program (psychoeducation for carers) and UNAFAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes / Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of cognitive disorders is essential in the care of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, in combination with other types of therapies. This research, aimed at training&#xD;
      family carers in the use of compensatory cognitive remediation techniques that require little&#xD;
      knowledge of neuropsychology, will be of direct benefit to patients. The expected results&#xD;
      will contribute to the optimization of management by demonstrating that intervention and&#xD;
      training of relatives in compensatory cognitive techniques will improve functional autonomy.&#xD;

    <description>The &quot;Life Scale Profile&quot; (LSP), validated in French by Mohr et al (2004), is a scale used to assess the subject's life skills profile, particularly for patients with schizophrenia. It is a hetero-questionnaire based on the patient's functioning during the last week (excluding the acute or relapse phase). The scale is composed of 20 items picked-up in an ensemble of 39 questions. The instruction is to rate each item on a scale from 1 to 4: &quot;always, usually, rarely and never&quot;. The lower the score, the more the patient has a deficit profile in terms of life. The maximum score is 80. The LSP scale assesses 5 subscores of life skills: sociability, self-management, treatment compliance, antisocial behaviours and strange behaviours. The total duration of the test is about 30 minutes.</description>
