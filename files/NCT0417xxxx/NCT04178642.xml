  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test whether the realization of 3 courses of intra-arterial&#xD;
      chemotherapy of idarubicin-lipiodol without embolization, administered non-selectively in the&#xD;
      hepatic artery, following the percutaneous tumour ablation of a hepatocellular carcinoma,&#xD;
      could constitute an effective adjuvant treatment to reduce the rates of local and&#xD;
      intrahepatic distant recurrence and thus improve the survival without hepatic progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this study percutaneous tumor destruction treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      (infusion of Idarubicin-Lipiodol intra-arterial hepatic) will be tested. The adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy is a minimally invasive technique. It consists of the administration of&#xD;
      Idarubicin (Zavedos®, Pfizer) mixed with Lipiodol (Lipiodol Ultra-Fluid®, Guerbet) in the&#xD;
      hepatic artery.The first course of treatment will be performed under general anesthesia at&#xD;
      the same time as the percutaneous tumour ablation. The second and third cures will be&#xD;
      performed under local anesthesia 3 and 6 weeks after percutaneous tumour ablation&#xD;
      respectively. In the case of incomplete treatment during the percutaneous tumour ablation,&#xD;
      the second intervention will be scheduled at the same time as the second intra-arterial&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment, under general anesthesia.&#xD;

    <description>Hepatic recurrence will be defined as the appearance on at least one hepatic MRI with gadolinium injection of a large diameter tumor site at least greater than 10 mm, and presenting characteristics of CHC (hyper vascularization at arterial time and washing at portal or late time), either at the edge of the percutaneous tumor destruction site (= local recurrence) or at a distance from the percutaneous tumor destruction site (= intrahepatic recurrence distant), or both, after at least one liver MRI scan with gadolinium injection showed the absence of tumor residues. Lesions of more than 10 mm that do not present with the typical CHC enhancement described above will be considered CHCs if they have a growth in size of at least 1 cm on successive controls.</description>
