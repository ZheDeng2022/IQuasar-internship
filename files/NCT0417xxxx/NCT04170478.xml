  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second cause of cancer-related deaths for men. The&#xD;
      standard surgical treatment for localised prostate cancer is radical prostatectomy. Possible&#xD;
      side effects of this treatment are incontinence and erectile dysfunction and this is related&#xD;
      to the whole-gland resection. A focal treatment with fewer side effects is desired for&#xD;
      patients with only a small focus of PCa. For this purpose, focal laser ablation is feasible.&#xD;
      Current focal laser ablation techniques use a single fibre setup with the need for fibre&#xD;
      replacement revisualisation of the tumour side accordingly. This leads to a long treatment&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Echolaser® system is a laser ablation system with four simultaneously operating laser&#xD;
      sources. This provides a potential larger treatment area, without the need for fibre&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This makes the system advantageous for focal laser ablation of prostate cancer, especially&#xD;
      since it can be applied under local anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study aims to evaluate histological ablative efficacy on radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      specimens following TPLA, feasibility and safety using a (multi)fibre setup in men with&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that TPLA will show adequate&#xD;
      histological ablative efficacy and will be feasible and safe.&#xD;

    <description>Safety is assessed by device and procedural adverse events using the CTCAE v5.0 until radical prostatectomy. TPLA is definitely safe when ≤10% of patients experience major adverse events, defined as grade 3 or higher. Technical feasibility is determined by procedural success of the TPLA treatment.&#xD;
TPLA is definitely feasible when ≥90% of procedures is performed successfully without any problems regarding needle placement, fibre introduction or device malfunctioning.</description>
