  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diuretic therapy is the cornerstone of the management of fluid overload in heart failure.&#xD;
      Resistance to diuretic therapy is the most common reason for treatment failure in patients&#xD;
      affected by the combination of heart failure and kidney disease. Currently, there is no way&#xD;
      of predicting whether heart failure patients will develop resistance to diuretic therapy and&#xD;
      what dose of diuretic is necessary to overcome diuretic resistance. Answering these questions&#xD;
      would allow doctors to be able to prescribe an accurate dose of diuretic therapy to prevent&#xD;
      diuretic resistance and potential side effects of an excessive diuretic dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to measure the kidney sodium (salt) content&#xD;
      and observe the diuretic response in patients with heart failure and kidney disease. The&#xD;
      investigators speculate that measuring kidney sodium content will allow to predict diuretic&#xD;
      response in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the kidney sodium content in patients with chronic&#xD;
      cardiorenal syndrome with and without diuretic resistance. Secondly, in a sample of patients&#xD;
      with diagnosed diuretic resistance,the aim will be to observe the changes in kidney sodium&#xD;
      content induced by an additional dose of diuretic therapy and to observe whether these&#xD;
      changes are associated with a response to diuretic therapy.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, interventional, pilot study involving patients recruited from the&#xD;
      Heart Failure outpatient clinic at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario. Depending on&#xD;
      scanner availability, the study visits may also take place at Robarts Research Institute,&#xD;
      University of Western Ontario. All eligible patients who consent to take part in the study&#xD;
      will undergo one study visit. During this visit, all study participants will undergo a&#xD;
      combined proton (1H) and 23Na MRI scan of their kidneys to measure kidney sodium content.&#xD;
      Prior to the scan, all participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire, will have&#xD;
      their fluid volume measured using bioimpedance spectroscopy, will have their heart failure&#xD;
      classified using the NYHA system, will have their weight taken using a clinical scale, and&#xD;
      will have their sitting blood pressure and heart rate measured three times consecutively&#xD;
      using a standard automatic blood pressure monitor. In addition to this, all participants will&#xD;
      undergo a research focused echocardiogram, provide a spot urine sample and have blood work&#xD;
      collected. All participants will be responsible to complete a 24-hour urine volume test the&#xD;
      day before the study visit and bring the special container to the team on the visit day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants who meet the criteria for diuretic resistance will undergo a second study&#xD;
      visit within one week of the first one. During this visit, participants will receive an&#xD;
      additional intravenous dose of diuretic (furosemide) and they will subsequently undergo a&#xD;
      second proton and 23Na MRI scan of their kidneys. Prior to the scan participants will undergo&#xD;
      the same study procedures as in visit one excluding the questionnaire. In addition to this,&#xD;
      participants will be responsible to record their weight at home the morning before the visit&#xD;
      and bring their weight to the study team. After the scan, all participants will have their&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart, rate, and weight measured again, and will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      24-hour urine collection. Furthermore, participants will be asked to take their weight using&#xD;
      a home scale the morning after the scan and a member of the research team will phone the&#xD;
      participants to collect this information.&#xD;
