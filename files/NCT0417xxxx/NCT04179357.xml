    <textblock>
      Hemostasis is the physiological process that stops bleeding at the site of an injury while&#xD;
      maintaining normal blood flow elsewhere in the circulation. Blood loss is stopped by&#xD;
      formation of a hemostatic plug. The endothelium in blood vessels maintains an anticoagulant&#xD;
      surface that serves to maintain blood in its fluid state, but if the blood vessel is damaged&#xD;
      components of the subendothelial matrix are exposed to the blood. Several of these components&#xD;
      activate the two main processes of hemostasis to initiate formation of a blood clot, composed&#xD;
      primarily of platelets and fibrin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many critically ill patients develop hemostatic abnormalities, ranging from isolated&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia to complex defects, such as DIC. Coagulation abnormalities are commonly&#xD;
      found in critically ill patients. Prompt and proper identification of the underlying cause of&#xD;
      these coagulation abnormalities is required, since each coagulation disorder necessitates&#xD;
      very different therapeutic management strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of coagulopathy The key basic management principle of all coagulopathies is that&#xD;
      the decision to transfuse blood products should not be based on the results of coagulation&#xD;
      tests alone, rather an individualized approach is warranted. It is imperative to synthesizes&#xD;
      all the available clinical data and treat the underlying cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, hemostatic disorders are very common in the critically ill. Blood product support&#xD;
      is frequently required, but there is only a very limited evidence-base to support its use. In&#xD;
      many cases, no specific product support is required and the key management step is the&#xD;
      treatment of the condition underlying the coagulopathy .&#xD;
