      This is a safety and infectivity study of experimental human Norovirus genogroup GII.4&#xD;
      administered to 48 healthy non-pregnant adults, 18-49 years of age, inclusive. Subjects will&#xD;
      be admitted to Cincinnati Center for Clinical Research (CCCR) inpatient facility and&#xD;
      challenged with a dose of human norovirus GII.4 challenge strain. The challenge study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 3 cohorts of approximately 16 subjects each, 15 subjects will have a functional&#xD;
      FUT-2 gene (secretor positive) and 1 subject will have a non-functional FUT-2 gene&#xD;
      (non-secretor). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 3.5x10^3 copies of norovirus, in Cohort 2&#xD;
      will receive 3.5x10^4 copies of norovirus and in Cohort 3 will receive 3.5x10^5 copies of&#xD;
      norovirus. Based on the illness rate of subjects meeting the primary outcome measure in&#xD;
      secretor - positive subjects of the initial cohort, the decision will be made with regards to&#xD;
      dosing of the second and the third cohorts. Study duration is approximately 12-18 months with&#xD;
      subject participation duration of 6-8 months. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the optimal challenge dose of Norovirus GII.4 CIN-3 Batch No.: 01-16C3 to achieve&#xD;
      illness in &gt; / = 50% of subjects (illness is defined as norovirus infection determined by&#xD;
      positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and either: a) &gt; / = 3 loose or liquid stools, in a&#xD;
      24-hour period, b) &gt; / = 300 gm of loose or liquid stool in a 24-hour period or c) and/or any&#xD;
      episode of vomiting), during the inpatient period.&#xD;

      This is a double-blind, safety and infectivity study of experimental human Norovirus&#xD;
      genogroup GII.4 administered to 48 healthy non-pregnant adults, 18-49 years of age,&#xD;
      inclusive. Subjects will be admitted to Cincinnati Center for Clinical Research (CCCR)&#xD;
      inpatient facility and challenged with a dose of human norovirus GII.4 challenge strain. The&#xD;
      challenge study will be conducted in 3 cohorts of approximately 16 subjects each, 15 subjects&#xD;
      will have a functional FUT-2 gene (secretor positive) and 1 subject will have a&#xD;
      non-functional FUT-2 gene (non-secretor). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 3.5x10^3 copies&#xD;
      of norovirus, in Cohort 2 will receive 3.5x10^4 copies of norovirus and in Cohort 3 will&#xD;
      receive 3.5x10^5 copies of norovirus. Based on the illness rate of subjects meeting the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure in secretor - positive subjects of the initial cohort, the decision&#xD;
      will be made with regards to dosing of the second and the third cohorts. Subjects will remain&#xD;
      in the inpatient facility for at least four days following the challenge and assessed daily&#xD;
      for clinical and virologic evidence of norovirus infection. After the discharge, subjects&#xD;
      will return to the site for evaluation on Days 6, 15, 30, 45, and 60 post challenge. A final&#xD;
      phone call will be performed at day 180 to obtain an interim medical history. Study duration&#xD;
      is approximately 12-18 months with subject participation duration of 6-8 months. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine the optimal challenge dose of Norovirus GII.4 CIN-3&#xD;
      Batch No.: 01-16C3 to achieve illness in &gt; / = 50% of subjects (illness is defined as&#xD;
      norovirus infection determined by positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and either: a) &gt; /&#xD;
      = 3 loose or liquid stools, in a 24-hour period, b) &gt; / = 300 gm of loose or liquid stool in&#xD;
      a 24-hour period or c) and/or any episode of vomiting), during the inpatient period. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety of the Norovirus GII.4 CIN-3 Batch No.:&#xD;
      01-16C3 challenge strain; 2) To determine the rate of infection at different challenge doses&#xD;
      by detection of norovirus GII.4 in the stool using specific qRT-PCR and Anti-norovirus GII.4&#xD;
      serum IgG by Enzyme-Linked Immunnosorbent Assay (ELISA) (&gt; / = 4-fold rise from baseline&#xD;
      through Day 30); 3) To measure the severity of acute gastroenteritis; 4) To determine the&#xD;
      quantity and duration of virus shedding in stool by qRT-PCR.&#xD;

             for at least 30 days prior to enrollment through day 45 after receipt of challenge&#xD;
             virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless post-menopausal (absence&#xD;
                  of menses for &gt; / = 1 year) or surgically sterilized (tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acceptable contraception methods for women include but are not limited to: sexual&#xD;
                  abstinence from intercourse with men, monogamous relationship with vasectomized&#xD;
                  partner who has been vasectomized for 6 months or more prior to the subject&#xD;
                  enrolling in the study, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with&#xD;
                  spermicide or foam, effective devices (intrauterine devices (IUD's), NuvaRing&#xD;
                  (R)) or licensed hormonal products such as implants, injectables or oral&#xD;
                  contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For women of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Are in good general health*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or&#xD;
             currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have&#xD;
             been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of the safety of&#xD;
             subjects. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60&#xD;
             days (no hospitalizations, Emergency Room (ER), or urgent care for condition and no&#xD;
             adverse symptoms that need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental&#xD;
             oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or&#xD;
             frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition&#xD;
             in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of&#xD;
             health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons,&#xD;
             as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this&#xD;
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a&#xD;
             disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional&#xD;
             risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not&#xD;
             indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes&#xD;
             subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no&#xD;
             deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a&#xD;
             medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with&#xD;
             the evaluation of responses to study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Demonstrate knowledge and comprehension of the study by scoring &gt; / = 70% on a quiz&#xD;
