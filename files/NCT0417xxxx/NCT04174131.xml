      This study is designed to assess and compare the efficacy of two hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers&#xD;
      on moderate, severe and extreme nasolabial folds (NLF).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most significant signs of aging is the appearance of deep lines that run from each&#xD;
      side of the nose to the corners of the mouth [i.e., nasolabial folds (NLFs)]. These folds are&#xD;
      defined by facial structures that support the buccal fat pad and separate the cheeks from the&#xD;
      upper lip. The NLFs form due to volume shifts in the face, caused by a combination of fat&#xD;
      descent and bone absorption, which results in sagging skin and hollowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue augmentation can effectively restore the youthful, harmonious contours of the&#xD;
      face. The most popular non-invasive treatment options for volume loss in the face include the&#xD;
      use of hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers. Injections of HA for skin rejuvenation are one of the&#xD;
      most common aesthetic treatments performed worldwide. Due to their effectiveness, safety, low&#xD;
      immunogenicity (HA is a normal component of human skin) and reversibility with hyaluronidase,&#xD;
      HA fillers are understandably a popular option for facial volume restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through recent advances in manufacturing technology, various types of HA fillers have been&#xD;
      approved for the correction of facial wrinkles and folds, such as NLFs. Two such fillers, i)&#xD;
      Restylane + Lidocaine and ii) Restylane Lyft, are well tolerated and provide significant&#xD;
      improvement in this indication. These products contain the same amount of HA (i.e., 20mg/mL)&#xD;
      and are manufactured using the same technology [i.e., non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      (NASHATM)], but differ primarily in their particle size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small particle size HA (Restylane + Lidocaine): was the first non-animal stabilized&#xD;
      HA-containing filler approved for use in the United States. Because of its particle size&#xD;
      (i.e., 330-430 μM), Restylane + Lidocaine is referred to as small gel-particle HA (SGP-HA).&#xD;
      NASHA small gel contains approximately 100,000 gel particles per mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large particle size HA (Restylane Lyft): was approved in the United States in 2010 and is&#xD;
      considered a large gel particle hyaluronic acid (LGP-HA). Restylane Lyft also contains the&#xD;
      anesthetic lidocaine. NASHA large gel contains approximately 10,000 gel particles per mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in gel size between the two products results in different viscosity and&#xD;
      lifting capabilities, which is anticipated to affect treatment outcomes. While the&#xD;
      comparative research is limited, a small number of clinical trials have compared the two&#xD;
      products. For example, two randomized studies performed using US populations have shown&#xD;
      equivalent safety and similar efficacy of Restylane + Lidocaine and Restylane Lyft, in&#xD;
      subjects of all Fitzpatrick skin types; and one recent study found that both products exhibit&#xD;
      similar safety and efficacy in a Chinese population. These three comparative studies found no&#xD;
      significant differences in safety of LGP- and SGP-HA however, efficacy changes can occur due&#xD;
      to the injection techniques and depth of injection used by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to assess and compare the efficacy of these two HA fillers on&#xD;
      moderate, severe and extreme NLF, when using a modified technique. This modified technique&#xD;
      will use a single puncture technique in each NLF, in comparison to others who have used a&#xD;
      multi puncture, fanning or linear threading injection technique. For each NLF, a single bolus&#xD;
      of product will be placed within the nasal pyriform aperture, on the periosteum. The location&#xD;
      of the puncture will also vary from previous trials, in which injections were performed&#xD;
      directly within the NLFs (to replace soft tissue volume). It is hypothesized that when these&#xD;
      two products are used for replacing bone loss due to age-related resorption in the pyriform&#xD;
      aperture, differences in efficacy will be observed that are not evident when they are used in&#xD;
      soft tissue for volume augmentation. It is expected that while aesthetic outcomes and&#xD;
      longevity of effect may be similar between the two products, the volumes required to achieve&#xD;
      these same results will differ significantly, due to their different particle sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Larger HA gel particles result in better lifting capacities. Therefore, Restylane Lyft should&#xD;
      display better efficacy in comparison to Restylane + Lidocaine when a &quot;firm&quot; product with a&#xD;
      high lift capacity is required, such as when trying to replace or reshape bone. This is in&#xD;
      contrast to replacing soft tissue volume, which was evaluated in earlier studies. However, as&#xD;
      previous authors have reported, when these two products are used to replace soft tissue&#xD;
      volume they both provide adequate lifting capabilities and thus result in similar efficacy&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
