  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Prescription in France is a major act of medical activity and must be in accordance with the&#xD;
      scientific evidence. The use of physiotherapy by primary physicians is becoming more and more&#xD;
      frequent and involves the performance of a prescription given to the patients so that they&#xD;
      can access to their care. The optimization of the use of this treatment is based on the&#xD;
      respect of several legal and regulatory provisions allowing physiotherapists (PT) to offer&#xD;
      the most appropriate treatment to the patient. Although these professionals can carry out a&#xD;
      physiotherapy diagnosis and the objectives of care, as well as the choice of the acts and the&#xD;
      techniques which seem to them the most appropriate. The performance of their treatment&#xD;
      remains conditioned by the indication to physiotherapy and the anatomical region formulated&#xD;
      by the prescription of the primary physicians. Primary physicians don't have the right to&#xD;
      include their diagnostic hypothesis on the physiotherapy prescription. Therefore, they could&#xD;
      transmit to the PT a supplementary report including all useful information for the PT which&#xD;
      could influence the progress of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported a frequent absence of diagnostic hypothesis formulated by the primary&#xD;
      physicians to the PT to justify the indication to these treatment with the prescription.&#xD;
      However, PT are led to formulate one or more diagnostic hypothesis following their clinical&#xD;
      assessment. This can lead to questioning the interest of prescription for referring the&#xD;
      patient from the primary physician to the PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative study by Panchout et al shows that 97.8% of the french private&#xD;
      physiotherapists included treat patients with musculoskeletal disorders and 95.5% received&#xD;
      those with back disorders. Back musculoskeletal disorders are the most common conditions&#xD;
      reported from french private PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No French study has yet analyzed the quality of prescriptions formulated by primary&#xD;
      physicians for private physiotherapists. Much foreign health systems have a different model&#xD;
      of access to physiotherapy services compared to the French system, involving direct access&#xD;
      physiotherapy for patients with musculoskeletal disorders. This care pathway gives patients&#xD;
      the ability to refer themselves directly to a PT without having to see another health&#xD;
      professional. Patients do not need a prescription in this model of access to physiotherapy&#xD;
      care to use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in order to optimize the relevance of the use of physiotherapy for patients with back&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders, we propose a prospective and cross-sectional observational study&#xD;
      of 60 physiotherapists. The first aim of this study is to assess the relevance of the&#xD;
      physiotherapy indication from primary care physicians for patients with back musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disorders and consulting physiotherapists.&#xD;

      The main objective is to describe the contents of the documents transmitted by the primary&#xD;
      physician to the physiotherapists relating to the physiotherapy management of patients with&#xD;
      back musculoskeletal disorders, as well as their conformity with the results of the initial&#xD;
      assessment of the physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the influence of the sociodemographic characteristics&#xD;
      concerning the presence or the absence of diagnostic hypothesis on the primary physician&#xD;
      documents transmitted to the physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is broken down into 9 steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physiotherapists practicing in France will be randomly selected from the list of&#xD;
           registered members of the National Regulatory Authority of Physiotherapists and drawn by&#xD;
           region to obtain a representative selection of territories of these professionals,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The sending of patients medical records indicated to the physiotherapy for the&#xD;
           management of a musculoskeletal condition whose prescription has been carried out by a&#xD;
           primary physician will start from the first contacted physiotherapist who has agreed to&#xD;
           participate in the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Each of the 60 physiotherapists contacted and who have agreed to participate in the&#xD;
           study will meet face-to-face about the progress of the project and the anonymization of&#xD;
           the files,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physiotherapists will be asked to provide 5 medical records of patients each. The file&#xD;
           may include: the prescription of physiotherapy given to the patient by the primary&#xD;
           physician and / or any associated medical report transmitted to the physiotherapist by&#xD;
           the primary physician before the start of treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To avoid selection bias, physiotherapists will collect patient data, not opposing their&#xD;
           participation in the study, presenting themselves consecutively with a first&#xD;
           prescription of physiotherapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Each physiotherapist will have to anonymise on the documents: first and last name and&#xD;
           contact information of the prescribing physician as well as the first name and the last&#xD;
           name of the patient appearing on the prescription and associated reports. Each&#xD;
           physiotherapist will be assigned a number (1, 2, 3, etc ...), similarly for primary&#xD;
           physicians who prescribed physiotherapy to patients the consultant and the patients seen&#xD;
           in consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be carried out at the end of the study using SAS v9.3® Software&#xD;
      under the responsibility of the clinical research unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be expressed as numbers (percentage). Percentage comparisons with a&#xD;
      Chi2 test (prescriptions without diagnostic hypothesis compared to prescriptions with&#xD;
      diagnostic hypothesis) on the factors studied as being able to influence this criteria will&#xD;
      be made. Comparisons of means with a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis (or Wilcoxon) test will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
