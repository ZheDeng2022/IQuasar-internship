  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose escalating study evaluating the safety of combining talazoparib and&#xD;
      low dose consolidative thoracic radiotherapy for small cell lung cancer patients. This study&#xD;
      will also determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of talazoparib in combination with low&#xD;
      dose thoracic radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will start on talazoparib on day 1 of study intervention, and will continue to&#xD;
      orally take talazoparib until the last day of radiation therapy. Up to 24 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to the study, where the first 3 patients will start with a starting dose level of&#xD;
      talazoparib is 0.5 mg PO once daily. This will increase to 1mg daily with each new cohort.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose escalating study evaluating the safety of combination talazoparib and&#xD;
      low dose consolidative thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      patients with at least stable disease after standard of care 4 - 6 cycles of chemotherapy (a&#xD;
      platinum agent and etoposide). This study will also determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of talazoparib in combination with low dose thoracic radiotherapy. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      will be to examine clinical outcomes, including locoregional recurrence within the radiation&#xD;
      field, progression-free survival, overall survival and acute/chronic toxicities up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will start on talazoparib on day 1 of study intervention, and will continue to&#xD;
      orally take talazoparib until the last day of RT. Patient will start low dose RT on day 6-9,&#xD;
      and will continue for 10 fractions throughout 2 weeks. Up to 24 patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
      the study, where the first 3 patients will start with a starting dose level of talazoparib is&#xD;
      0.5 mg PO once daily. This will increase to 1mg daily with each new cohort. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored weekly during study treatment, and followed up at 3 weeks, and every 3 months after&#xD;
      for 1 year.&#xD;
