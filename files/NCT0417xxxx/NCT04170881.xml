      CRESPI - RESPIratory health of Children in daycare&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRESPI study, will be a cohort of 1500/2000 children attending daycare in Paris region,&#xD;
      and will be initiated in November 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to study the impact of environmental exposures to cleaning products&#xD;
      and disinfectants on respiratory health of infants and toddlers (&lt; 3 years) in daycares&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two specific aims were defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluate environmental exposure to cleaning products by complementary and innovative&#xD;
           tools: air quality measurements in daycares, specific standardized questionnaire,&#xD;
           identification of compounds of the products via a database and a Smartphone application&#xD;
           to scan bar codes and inform on product use&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. evaluate the impact of early exposure in daycares and at home on respiratory health of&#xD;
           young children&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to cleaning products is an emergent risk factor for respiratory health of children.&#xD;
      In some studies, an association has been observed between the use of these products in&#xD;
      households and wheezing in young children (&lt;18 months). However, the specific chemical&#xD;
      substances associated with health hazards remain poorly known. A few studies suggested&#xD;
      associations between some specific organic volatile compounds (aldehydes, aromatics) and&#xD;
      asthma but only one study has been conducted in young children (&lt;3 years).&#xD;
      Detergents/disinfectants may contain sensitizers, irritants and endocrine disrupters.&#xD;
      Children who attend daycares may be particularly exposed: cleaning tasks are often performed&#xD;
      in their presence; moreover, babies and young children often put objects (eg, toys) in their&#xD;
      mouths and might be exposed through various routes (ingestion, inhalation, skin). The&#xD;
      importance of studying the health impact of early life environmental exposures has been&#xD;
      emphasized, especially in the context of the Developmental Origins of Health and Diseases&#xD;
      (DOHaD) research. However, few studies have focussed on environmental exposures in nurseries&#xD;
      in relation to children's respiratory health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The originality of the CRESPI cohort lies in the fact that no epidemiological survey focussed&#xD;
      on: 1) the effect of early exposure to cleaning products in daycares on respiratory health in&#xD;
      first years of life; 2) the use of complementary and innovative tools to improve evaluation&#xD;
      of such exposures, via a Smartphone application and measurements of pertinent volatile (VOCs)&#xD;
      and semi-volatile (SVOCs) organic compounds. 3) the use of complementary and innovative tools&#xD;
      to improve evaluation of children respiratory health, via a Smartphone application&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project CRESPI (http://crespi.vjf.inserm.fr/) is to set up an epidemiological survey&#xD;
      among young children attending daycares. A sample of 400 daycares (30-40 children/daycare) in&#xD;
      Ile-de-France (Paris region) has been drawn from a national file. We hypothesise that the&#xD;
      acceptance rate of daycares will be of 25% and those of parents at least of 50% (see French&#xD;
      OQAI study 2011), with an expected population of 1500 to 2500 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each daycare will be visited by trained interviewers to : i) precise the objectives of the&#xD;
      study to the parents/workers in the daycare and give all material to collect data&#xD;
      (questionnaire, smartphone); ii) collect dust samples (to measure SVOCs; triclosan, muscs&#xD;
      ...) via an adapted vacuum cleaner and install measuring equipment to evaluate air quality&#xD;
      (VOCs; ammoniac, glycol ethers ...); iii) collect information on the building (surface,&#xD;
      ventilation …) and activities of workers including a calendar of cleaning tasks in rooms&#xD;
      (toilets, bedroom ...) and surface (toys, windows, toddler beds …).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized questionnaire (http://crespi.vjf.inserm.fr/), as previously used in a&#xD;
      parent-child cohort (sepages.inserm.fr), collecting information on the use of products,&#xD;
      respiratory health and potential confounders will be completed by the parents. Respiratory&#xD;
      health of the children will also be evaluated by a group of experts (paediatricians) using&#xD;
      information available from medical records (children's health booklets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will take full advantage of innovative tools, i.e. Smartphone applications, to&#xD;
      evaluate 1) exposures : workers and parents will scan bar-codes of products used, in the&#xD;
      nursery and at home, and respond to a short questionnaire about their use, and 2) respiratory&#xD;
      health of children, with monthly follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses of the data will evaluate the associations between exposures and&#xD;
      respiratory health of children, after adjustment for potential confounders.&#xD;

        CRESPI is an epidemiological survey among young children - aged from 3 months to 3 years&#xD;
        old - attending daycares and daycare workers. A random sample, drawn from a national file,&#xD;
        of 400 nurseries in Paris region have been selected. Out of them, the 100 first daycares&#xD;
        (30-40 children/nursery) who accepted to participated will be visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The CRESPI project will include detailed characterization of chemical exposures in 100&#xD;
        daycare centers evaluated during a one-day visit, between 2019 and 2021. We expected to&#xD;
        enrol around 1500/2000 children and 600/800 adults workers (18-65 years old).&#xD;
