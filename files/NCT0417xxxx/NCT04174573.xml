      To determine the effectiveness of group therapy along with transcranial direct current (tDCS)&#xD;
      stimulation on motor symptoms, balance and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease(PD). 128 patient with PD will be recruited by the cluster sampling method for the two&#xD;
      group pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial. The patient with PD will be allocated in&#xD;
      two groups, Group therapy only (GTO) group and Group therapy with tDCS (GT-tDCS) treatment&#xD;
      group by block randomization technique. Both GTO group and GT-tDCS group will receive the&#xD;
      structured group therapy programme for one hour duration, twice a week for 6-weeks. In&#xD;
      addition to the structured group therapy programme, GT-tDCS group will receive 20 minutes of&#xD;
      tDCS application once a week for the 6-week duration. Data will be analysed at baseline, 3&#xD;
      weeks and 6 weeks of post intervention.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson disease (PD) occurs due to degenerative changes in the nervous system, dysfunctions&#xD;
      of basal ganglia. Patients affected with PD survive with the postural and mobility&#xD;
      impairments that leads to impaired quality of life. Medical and surgical procedures do not&#xD;
      provide the patient with a fully effective response.1 Literature suggests that physical&#xD;
      therapy can improve the quality of life and balance function in patients with PD. Group&#xD;
      therapy (GT) intervention is found to be significant intervention in aspects of mobility in&#xD;
      various neurological conditions. GT have been used as part of supervised group rehabilitation&#xD;
      to improve balance in patient with PD.2 Patients with PD have difficulties with learning of&#xD;
      new motor skills, but recent neuro-modulatory techniques by noninvasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      helps to facilitate motor skills and regulate neuroplasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a therapeutic device that is used to&#xD;
      improve motor symptoms of PD, when applied to primary motor cortex M1. Anodal tDCS can&#xD;
      increase M1 excitability, reduce cortical inhibition and results in improved functional&#xD;
      performance. When combined with other exercise training, it provides longer lasting effect in&#xD;
      motor function.3 However, no studies have investigated the concurrent use of anodal tDCS and&#xD;
      group therapy intervention in patient with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to determine the effects of a 3 weeks concurrent GT and anodal&#xD;
      tDCS intervention on measures of static and dynamic balance and to evaluate any long-term&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of group therapy and anodal tDCS will&#xD;
      improve balance and quality of life than group therapy or anodal tDCS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology of the proposed study Ethical statement and Subject recruitment The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the institutional research advisory committee (RAC) and registered&#xD;
      under the Universal Trial Number (UTN), U1111-1240-0949. The protocol will be registered&#xD;
      under ClinicalTrials.gov, under World Health Organization International Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Registry Platform and then the study will be submitted for the ethical approval by&#xD;
      institutional ethics committee of Maharishi Markandeshwar Deemed to Be University, Mullana,&#xD;
      and Haryana with unique reference number. The study will be executed in accordance with the&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Revised, 2013) and National ethical guidelines for&#xD;
      Biomedical and Health research involving human participants by Indian council for medical&#xD;
      research (ICMR, 2017). The purpose of the study will be clearly explained to the patient with&#xD;
      PD. Written informed consent form will be obtained from the recruited patients. The study&#xD;
      will be performed between October, 2019 and March, 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of mild neurocognitive disorders was based on the validated Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
           Assessment (MoCA) cutoff scores (&lt;23.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on the Hoehn-Yahr Stage (HYS) staging, severity of PD was categorized as mild (HYS&#xD;
           1&amp;2), moderate (HYS 3) and severe (HYS 4&amp;5). Patient with PD with mild and moderate will&#xD;
           be recruited Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with PD with associated comorbidities such as stroke, uncontrolled diabetes,&#xD;
           sensory impairments such as hearing, vision, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with PD who is not willing to participate in the study Total of X patient with&#xD;
           PD will be screened and through convenience sampling method, 34 children will be&#xD;
           selected based on the inclusion criteria for the two group pretest-posttest randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial. Demographic data will be recorded for all the recruited patient with&#xD;
           PD. The patient with PD will be allocated in two groups, Group therapy only (GTO) group&#xD;
           and Group therapy with tDCS (GT-tDCS) treatment group by block randomization technique.&#xD;
           The total required sample size of, n=128 will be randomized into both the groups.&#xD;
           According to it, there will be four blocks, with the matrix design of 4 × 32, where32&#xD;
           being rows. Each row could have four blocks, with one chit (SNOSE - sequentially&#xD;
           numbered, opaque sealed, envelopes) in each block containing either the name of GTO&#xD;
           group or GT-tDCS group. Total four chits (2 chits for each group) will be assigned to&#xD;
           each row and then patient with PD will be allotted to one of the two group based on the&#xD;
           randomly chosen chit (SNOSE). Once the entire first row will be allotted, then the next&#xD;
           row block will be opened for enrolment. The advantage of this method of randomization is&#xD;
           that the number of patients assigned to each group over time would have been&#xD;
           approximately equal. By this the unequal allocation of sample size, will be avoided. The&#xD;
           concealed allocation of patient with PD to the treatment groups will be explained by&#xD;
           using SNOSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both GTO group and GT-tDCS group will receive the structured group therapy programme for one&#xD;
      hour duration, twice a week for 6-weeks. In addition to the structured group therapy&#xD;
      programme, GT-tDCS group will receive 20 minutes of tDCS application once a week for the&#xD;
      6-week duration. Outcomes will be used to analysed the data at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks&#xD;
      post intervention.&#xD;
