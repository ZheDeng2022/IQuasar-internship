  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common, complex and costly chronic condition. Moreover, asthma is heterogeneous&#xD;
      in terms of treatment response. This heterogeneity contributes to the difficulty in both&#xD;
      studying and treating asthma. This is a pilot study to improve health outcomes in youths with&#xD;
      difficult to treat asthma with ongoing symptoms and healthcare utilization despite medium to&#xD;
      high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Asthma heterogeneity in both disease pathophysiology&#xD;
      and treatment response contributes to the difficulty in both studying and managing asthma. In&#xD;
      order to begin to develop personalized algorithms for patients, investigators need to model&#xD;
      novel biomarkers and other factors that contribute to individual differences in asthma&#xD;
      outcome and test other factors that contribute to individual differences in asthma outcome&#xD;
      and test personalized treatment strategies.&#xD;

      With this study investigators will conduct study visits to determine and quantify known&#xD;
      molecular, genetic, genomic, epigenetics, immunologic, and exposure biomarkers that will help&#xD;
      elucidate molecular disease endotype within the difficult-to-treat phenotype. This&#xD;
      information will be used along with clinical, psychosocial, and adherence data to develop a&#xD;
      personalized treatment plan. Following the personalized treatment plan, study clinicians will&#xD;
      prescribe the medications through a home delivery or routine pharmacy depending on the&#xD;
      family's preference and covered by the participant's health insurance. Investigators will&#xD;
      track disease outcome metrics including exacerbations, symptom-free days, and asthma symptom&#xD;
      scores to determine the effectiveness of this personalized approach.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study has 3 study phases: baseline, intervention, and observation. Each participant will independently transition through these study phases.&#xD;
Baseline period: Each participant will be given a treatment recommendation according to their asthma severity/control using the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP asthma guidelines).&#xD;
Intervention period: Each participant will be given a personalized treatment plan based on their asthma severity/control during the baseline period, biologic, and environmental factors.&#xD;
Observation period: All participants will be observed for at least 6 months. Investigators will track the participant's personal outcomes (comparing to baseline) for reutilization, symptom-free days, and quality of life.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>CASI was measured by questionnaire and is a severity score of symptom burden, exacerbations, healthcare utilization, lung function and dose of inhaled corticosteroids. The change in CASI score was calculated between V1 (Baseline), V2 (Guideline Care - before intervention), and V3 (12 Months).&#xD;
[The CASI score has a minimum value = 0, maximum value = 20, a higher score indicates greater asthma severity]</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Test (ACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ACT was measured by questionnaire, assessing frequency of reported asthma symptoms, rescue medication use, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, and overall asthma control. The change in ACT score was calculated between V1 (Baseline), V2 (Guideline Care - before intervention), and V3 (12 Months).&#xD;
[The ACT score has a minimum value = 5, maximum value = 25, a score 19 indicates well-controlled asthma]</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary Function Measured by Spirometry: Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) / Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is air volume exhaled in 1 second during spirometry. Forced vital capacity is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. The change in FEV1/FVC was calculated between V1 (Baseline), V2 (Guideline Care - before intervention), and V3 (12 Months). This will be used as a measurement in asthma severity.&#xD;
[A lower FEV1/FVC ratio indicates more severe asthma]</description>

    <measure>Adherence of Asthma Controller Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence was measured using the Propeller Health Inhaler monitor and web-based software management platform that tracks adherence of asthma medications. The change in adherence was calculated between V1 (baseline) to V3 (12 Months).</description>
