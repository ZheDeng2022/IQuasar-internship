      This randomized clinical trial (RCT) will evaluate 6-month outcomes following intra-articular&#xD;
      injections for arthritis of the thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) joint by comparing corticosteroid&#xD;
      plus local anesthetic versus saline (placebo) plus local anesthetic.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA) is increasing globally, having a&#xD;
      major impact on both health services and society. 1,2 The CMC joint of the thumb is the most&#xD;
      commonly affected joint in the upper extremity by OA, and may lead to pain, decreased hand&#xD;
      function and poor health-related quality of life. 3-6 The prevalence of CMC OA varies&#xD;
      depending on the population being studied and is not yet well defined. Haara et al. 6&#xD;
      reported age-adjusted CMC OA prevalence of 7% in men and 15% in women among adults thirty&#xD;
      years of age or older in Finland. The ROTTERDAM study7 showed that 67% of the women and 54.8%&#xD;
      of the men had OA in at least one hand joint, with 35.8% occurring at the CMC joint. The&#xD;
      Framingham Study reported higher prevalence of symptomatic hand OA in women (26.2%) compared&#xD;
      to men (13.4%) aged 70 year or older. Symptomatic participants in this cohort had 10% reduced&#xD;
      maximal grip strength, reported more difficulty with activities of daily living such as&#xD;
      writing, handling, or fingering small objects (odds ratio = 3.4), and increased difficulty&#xD;
      lifting over 10-pound objects (odds ratio = 1.7 and 1.6, respectively).8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treating CMC OA is challenging, since evidence is contradictory. A study looking at the&#xD;
      natural history of hand OA over a 6 year period showed variation in pain and functional&#xD;
      changes, with half of the population reporting deterioration of symptoms and the other half&#xD;
      reporting improvements of outcomes with different treatments. 9 Clinical changes (pain and&#xD;
      function) and radiographic progression of CMC OA were not related in this study. 9&#xD;
      Non-operative management (i.e. splints, medications, physiotherapy) is usually the first&#xD;
      choice of treatment for symptomatic CMC OA, followed by surgery if failed non-operative&#xD;
      management. 3,10 Current non-operative guidelines for treatment of hand OA are based on a&#xD;
      combination of research findings and expertise opinion. 11-13 2007EULAR, 2012 American&#xD;
      College of Rheumatology and 2014 NICE guidelines recommendations for the treatment of hand OA&#xD;
      include general considerations (i.e. clinical presentation, risk factors and associated&#xD;
      diseases), non-pharmacological (i.e. splint, education, exercises, thermal modalities), and&#xD;
      pharmacological (i.e. pain medications, oral and topical anti-inflammatories, opioids)&#xD;
      approaches. 11-13 2007EULAR and 2014 NICE also recommend intra-articular corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections as an adjunct treatment if patients didn't respond to other treatment approaches,&#xD;
      even though evidence is weak.11,13&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of guided intra-articular injections for CMC OA evidence is inconsistent. There&#xD;
      is only one published RCT looking specifically at efficacy of corticosteroid injections in&#xD;
      CMC OA that found no clinical benefit from intra-articular corticosteroid injection to&#xD;
      moderate to severe CMC OA compared with placebo injection. This study ended earlier due to&#xD;
      recruitment issues and is underpowered to detect true differences between groups. 14 A&#xD;
      meta-analysis investigating intra-articular injections of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      in thumb OA stated that corticosteroids may be helpful in decreasing pain and hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      in improving pulp pinch force in a period of 5 to 6 months. 15 Due to high heterogeneity of&#xD;
      included studies in this meta-analysis, the evidence is still inconclusive. Another RCT&#xD;
      compared the efﬁcacy of intra-articular hyaluronic acid and corticoid injections in CMC OA&#xD;
      and found that both study groups had decreased pain and improved function when compared to&#xD;
      baseline data, with no significant differences between groups. 16 A recent systematic review&#xD;
      on non-surgical therapies for hand OA found inconsistent evidence when comparing&#xD;
      intra-articular steroids and placebo. 17 They found three RCTs comparing intra-articular&#xD;
      steroids to placebo, with two studies showing no difference and one study showing significant&#xD;
      improvement in pain with movement between groups.17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the lack of strong evidence regarding the use of guided corticosteroid injections to&#xD;
      treat CMC OA, this randomized clinical trial (RCT) will compare 6-months outcomes following&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guided injections of corticosteroid plus local anesthetic or saline (placebo)&#xD;
      plus local anesthetic in adult participants with carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that participants undergoing guided intra-articular corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections will have better outcomes in the short -term, but not at the long term when&#xD;
      compared to the saline group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized Control Trial Sample Size: Sample size was calculated based on repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVA model with 2 groups and 4 time points (longitudinal approach), and group&#xD;
      effect (between subject effect) were examined for power analysis. Effect size (Cohen's f) was&#xD;
      considered from f=0.10 (small effect) to f=0.40 (large effect) increased by 0.05. Few&#xD;
      different correlations among repeated measures were considered (r=0.3 to 0.6 by 0.1). Based&#xD;
      on effect size f=0.25 (medium effect), approximately 62 to 90 participants will be required&#xD;
      as total sample size, with approximately 31to 45 participants per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment Procedures: Eligible participants presenting to primary care, rheumatologists or a&#xD;
      surgical consult will be introduced to the study. If the participant expresses interest, the&#xD;
      participant will complete the contact information form (assent to contact) and the Research&#xD;
      Coordinator will be notified. The Research Coordinator will contact the participant to&#xD;
      discuss the study in detail, obtain informed consent and book a baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Evaluation: Consented participants will undergo a baseline assessment with the&#xD;
      research coordinator who will be blinded to the treatment allocation. The assessment will&#xD;
      consist of 1) Quick-DASH, 2) Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), 3) grip and pinch&#xD;
      strength using a handheld dynamometer, 4) socio-demographics (age, gender, height, weight,&#xD;
      handedness, smoking status, work/recreational sports information, duration of symptoms, type&#xD;
      of onset (insidious / traumatic) data). The participant will also complete the Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain intensity (rest and movement), and concomitant treatments form&#xD;
      (medications, splints, physiotherapy,…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of the two groups once eligibility is confirmed and&#xD;
      participant is agreeable to be part of the study: Group A (intra-articular corticosteroid&#xD;
      injection + local anesthetic) or Group B (saline injection + local anesthetic). The&#xD;
      randomization sequence will be computer-generated in uneven blocks. Randomization codes will&#xD;
      be stored in opaque sequentially numbered envelopes and will be opened at baseline assessment&#xD;
      session. Participants and outcomes assessor will be blinded to the type of injection they&#xD;
      will be receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluoroscopic Guided Intra-articular Corticosteroid Injection plus local anesthetic:&#xD;
           Pre-filled opaque syringe containing 40 mg (1cc) of depo-medrol combined with 0.5 cc of&#xD;
           1% lidocaine (or 1cc saline + 0.5 cc 1% lidocaine) will be injected in the symptomatic&#xD;
           CMC joint using fluoroscopic imaging to ensure injection into the joint. If both CMC&#xD;
           joints are symptomatic, the most symptomatic joint will be injected. If both CMC joints&#xD;
           are equally symptomatic, the dominant hand will be injected. The surgeon and the&#xD;
           participant will be blinded to the injection content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluoroscopic Guided Intra-articular Saline Injection plus local anesthetic: Pre-filled&#xD;
           opaque syringe containing 0.5 cc of 1% lidocaine (or 1cc saline + 0.5 cc 1% lidocaine)&#xD;
           will be injected in the symptomatic CMC joint using ultrasound imaging to ensure&#xD;
           accuracy of injected location. If both CMC joints are symptomatic, the most symptomatic&#xD;
           joint will be injected. If both CMC joints are equally symptomatic, the dominant hand&#xD;
           will be injected. The surgeon and the participant will be blinded to the injection&#xD;
           content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-ups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up research assessments will occur at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • 6 weeks, 3- and 6-months: Assessment will be done by the research coordinator and will&#xD;
      include 1) Quick-DASH, 2) MHQ, 3) Grip and Pinch strength, 4) Pain at rest and with movement,&#xD;
      5) Concomitant treatments tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome assessor will be blinded to group allocation at all assessments points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes/ Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Pain with movement at 3 months- Pain will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
           (VAS) where zero equaled no pain and 10 the worst possible pain.18,19 VAS is a reliable&#xD;
           and valid method of measuring patient-reported pain and a minimal difference of 20 mm&#xD;
           (20%) among groups will be considered clinically important.20-22&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Quick-DASH) Questionnaire: it's a&#xD;
                11-item, patient-reported questionnaire that measures the function and psychosocial&#xD;
                impact of upper extremity musculoskeletal conditions in patients' quality of life.&#xD;
                It is scored between 0 (no disability) and 100(very disable).23 The Quick-DASH has&#xD;
                been widely used in clinical practice and research as a valid, reliable and&#xD;
                responsive tool to measure treatment outcomes from the patient's perspective after&#xD;
                upper limb injuries.24 The minimal important change expected is a 10-point&#xD;
                difference in mean DASH score among groups.24&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ): It is a 37-item self-administered&#xD;
                questionnaire that assess function, appearance, pain, and satisfaction in patients&#xD;
                with hand and wrist conditions and injuries, including arthritis.25 It is scored&#xD;
                between 1 (very good/not at all difficult/always/very mild/very satisfied) to 5&#xD;
                (very poor/very difficult/never/severe/very dissatisfied).25 The minimal important&#xD;
                change expected is a 3-point difference for pain, 11-points difference for function&#xD;
                and 13-point difference for activities of daily living (ADL) between groups.25&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pinch Strength: Pinch strength will be measured with a mechanical pinch gauge that&#xD;
                is a reliable and valid method to detect difference in thumb strength.26 Pinch&#xD;
                strength will be measured using the following standard positions: 1) Tip pinch:&#xD;
                pinch between the thumb and index finger, and 2) Tripod pinch: pinch between the&#xD;
                thumb, index and middle fingers.26 A minimal difference of 0.33 kg for tip and 0.35&#xD;
                kg for tripod pinch among groups will be considered clinically important.26&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis will use Intention-to-Treat approach with all&#xD;
      outcomes attributed to the assigned group. Descriptive statistics will be used for group&#xD;
      comparisons with independent t-tests for continuous and Pearson Chi-square or Fisher's Exact&#xD;
      tests for categorical variable at baseline and for possible complications/adverse events.&#xD;
      Linear Mixed Modeling (LMM), adjusted for gender and employment, will compare pain,&#xD;
      Quick-Dash, MHQ and pinch strength between groups over the 6-months evaluation period. The&#xD;
      level of significance will be set at α=0.05. Statistical analysis will use the following&#xD;
      software: SPSS version 25.0, SAS version 9.4, and R version 3.5.2.&#xD;
