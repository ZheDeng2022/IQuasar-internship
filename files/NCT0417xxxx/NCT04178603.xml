  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the regulation of muscle glucose utilization during exercise and&#xD;
      enhanced insulin sensitivity in recovery from exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be investigated in lean control subjects and obese insulin resistant subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will perform two trials (trial A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial A: During trial A the study subject will eat a morning meal at 6:00 a.m. corresponding&#xD;
      to 5% of the daily energy requirements and will arrive at the research laboratory at 8:00&#xD;
      a.m. It is requested that the study subject will arrive in a car or with public&#xD;
      transportation. After arrival the study subject will rest for 1 hour and at that time&#xD;
      catheters are inserted in both femoral veins and the femoral artery in one of the legs. At&#xD;
      9:00 a.m. the study subjects will perform one-leg knee extension exercise for 1 hour at an&#xD;
      intensity of 80% of maximal work capacity. In this work protocol there are inserted 3&#xD;
      intervals of 5 minutes duration where the study subject works at 100% of maximal intensity&#xD;
      with the purpose of securing a full activation/recruiting of all muscle fibers. Muscle&#xD;
      biopsies from the m. vastus lateralis muscle in both legs will be taken before (at 8.45&#xD;
      a.m.), immediately after (at 10:00 a.m.) and 2 hours after conclusion of exercise (at 12:00&#xD;
      p.m.) (in total of 6 biopsies). Pulmonary oxygen uptake is measured with the use of an online&#xD;
      system before, during and after exercise and is used for determination of substrate&#xD;
      metabolism. Blood samples from the femoral veins in both legs and the femoral artery in one&#xD;
      of the legs are drawn before (at 8:20 a.m., 8:40 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.), during exercise (at&#xD;
      9:20 a.m., 9:40 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.) and during the recovery period after exercise (at 10:10&#xD;
      a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 11:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.). At the same time blood flow is&#xD;
      measured in the femoral arteries in both legs with the use of Doppler technique.&#xD;
      Determination of arteriovenous difference (AV difference) by simultaneous measurement of&#xD;
      blood flow enables us to calculate skeletal muscle glucose uptake and uptake/release of&#xD;
      relevant substances (proteins, peptides and metabolites etc.). The experimental part of trial&#xD;
      A is completed at 12:00 p.m. The study subject will be given food and drink and will be&#xD;
      observed for one hour before they may leave the research laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial B: During test trial B the study subjects will eat a morning meal at 6:00 a.m.&#xD;
      corresponding to 5% of the daily energy requirements and will arrive at the research&#xD;
      laboratory at 8:00 a.m. It is requested that the study subject will arrive in a car or with&#xD;
      public transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During trial B the study subjects will perform the same one-leg knee extension exercise&#xD;
      protocol as in trial A. At 9:00 a.m. the study subject starts performing one-leg knee&#xD;
      extension exercise for 1 hour at 80% of maximal work capacity with 3 intervals of 5 minutes&#xD;
      duration where the load is at 100% of maximal work capacity. This work protocol ensures full&#xD;
      activation/recruiting of all muscle fibers. After the kicking exercise is completed the study&#xD;
      subject will rest in supine position for 6 hours. At the beginning of this resting period&#xD;
      catheters are inserted in the femoral veins in both legs and in the femoral artery in one&#xD;
      leg. Also catheters are inserted in each forearm vein (antecubital veins) for intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of insulin, glucose and stable 13C(u)-glucose. Intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      13C(u)-glucose is started 2 hours after conclusion of exercise in order to achieve a 10%&#xD;
      enrichment of blood glucose. 4 hours after cessation of exercise a hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
      euglycemic clamp of 120 minutes duration is started. This implies intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      insulin and glucose for 120 minutes in order to determine insulin sensitivity for glucose&#xD;
      uptake and metabolism of glucose. The clamp is started with a bolus injection of insulin (9.0&#xD;
      mU/kg) followed by a constant infusion (1.42 mU/kg/min). Simultaneously glucose infusion rate&#xD;
      will be adjusted so that euglycemia is maintained. Immediately before, after 30 minutes and&#xD;
      after 120 minutes of insulin infusion a muscle biopsy is taken from the vastus lateralis&#xD;
      muscle in both legs (a total of 6 biopsies). Blood samples from both femoral veins and one&#xD;
      femoral artery are taken before (at 12:00 p.m., 12:30 p.m., 1:00 p.m., 1:30 p.m. and 2:00&#xD;
      p.m.) and during (at 2:15 p.m., 2:30 p.m., 2:45 p.m., 3:00 p.m., 3:15 p.m., 3:30 p.m., 3:45&#xD;
      p.m. and 4:00 p.m.) the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Simultaneously blood flow is&#xD;
      measured in both femoral arteries with use of Doppler technique. Determination of&#xD;
      arteriovenous difference (AV difference) by simultaneous measurement of blood flow enables us&#xD;
      to calculate glucose uptake and uptake/release of relevant substances (proteins, peptides and&#xD;
      metabolites etc.). Indirect calorimetry for determination of whole body metabolism is&#xD;
      measured concomitantly, starting 2 hours after conclusion of exercise. The experimental part&#xD;
      of trial B is concluded at 4:00 p.m. The study subjects receive food and drink and are&#xD;
      observed for one hour before they may leave the research laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsies and blood samples from trial A and B are stored in a locked -80ÂºC freezer.&#xD;
      Muscle samples and blood samples will subsequently be used for miscellaneous analyses&#xD;
      described under background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trials (A and B) will be carried out in a randomized order and will be separated by a&#xD;
      minimum of 14 days.&#xD;
