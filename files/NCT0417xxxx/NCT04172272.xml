      This study evaluates the influence of the transversus abdominis plane block on the intensity&#xD;
      of postoperative pain and the concentration of proinflammatory and pain factors after&#xD;
      hysterectomy by laparotomy. The patients will be randomized in three groups.In the first&#xD;
      group, patients will receive intravenous, systemic, multimodal analgesia.In the second group&#xD;
      there will be patients in who will be given the TAP block. The TAP block will be given&#xD;
      postoperatively before waking. It will be given bilaterally in the before mentioned anatomic&#xD;
      region (the so-called lateral TAP block). In the third group there will be patients who will&#xD;
      be treated with TAP block in addition to systemic, mutimodal analgesia. The research will be&#xD;
      based on completing a questionnaire (VAS scale and QoR questionnaire) and taking peripheral&#xD;
      blood out. We expect that the concentration of proinflammatory and pain factors in patients&#xD;
      treated with a TAP block will be lower and the quality of recovery will be better than that&#xD;
      of patients receiving standard analgesic therapy (systemic multimodal analgesia).&#xD;

      The influence of the transversus abdominis plane block on the intensity of postoperative pain&#xD;
      and the concentration of proinflammatory and pain factors after laparotomy for gynecological&#xD;
      procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Showing the problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical operations. Indications for&#xD;
      hysterectomy are numerous and include benign and malignant etiology. Symptomatic leiomyomas,&#xD;
      pelvic organ prolapse, abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis, chronic pain, and&#xD;
      premalignant lesions are the most commonly benign indications for hysterectomy. The uterus&#xD;
      can be removed using an abdominal, vaginal or laparoscopic approach. Each of these approaches&#xD;
      is related to postoperative pain as well as on an increase in inflammatory factors that may&#xD;
      adversely affect the recovery of patients. Therefore, pain management has become one of the&#xD;
      major quality of life issues in the postoperative period. Post-operative pain is not only a&#xD;
      limitation for the patient but the long-term pain can have deleterious effects on&#xD;
      respiratory, cardiocirculatory and neuroendocrine function. Adverse physiological changes due&#xD;
      to inadequate or insufficient postoperative analgesia can lead to increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main assumption of the so-called &quot;preventive analgesia&quot; is to try to prevent the influx&#xD;
      of nociceptive stimuli (surgical trauma) to the spinal cord and thus reduce postoperative&#xD;
      pain. For this purpose, various anesthesiologic regional techniques (epidural analgesia,&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane block) are used for trying to reduce the activation of&#xD;
      postoperative pain. Timely application of &quot;preventive analgesia&quot; and its long enough and&#xD;
      intense action are essential as they could be captured all afferent nociceptive impulses. In&#xD;
      the choice of optimal analgesia, the type and location of the procedure, the duration of the&#xD;
      analgesic therapy required, individual risk factors and contraindications are of great&#xD;
      importance. Preventive analgesia may be initiated immediately before the onset of tissue&#xD;
      injury (eg epidural or spinal analgesia), immediately after surgery using regional blocks or&#xD;
      intravenous analgesia for a well-defined period of time (eg at intervals of 3 to 6 hours).&#xD;
      The goal of quality treatment of acute pain is not only optimal analgesia, but also for&#xD;
      reducing complications. One of the newer techniques for postoperative analgesia is a&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane block (TAP), which is part of regional anesthesia techniques. It&#xD;
      is a peripheral nerve block that blocks nerves located in the fascia layer between the m.&#xD;
      transversus abdominis and the m. obliqus internus, which innervate the anterolateral&#xD;
      abdominal wall. These nerves include the intercostal (Th7-Th11), subcostal (Th12),&#xD;
      iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal (L1) nerves. A local anesthetic administered in the layer&#xD;
      between the m. transversus abdominis and the m. obliqus internus results in anesthesia of the&#xD;
      anterolateral abdominal wall. This technique achieves analgesia of the skin, subcutaneous,&#xD;
      muscle, and parietal peritoneum in a given region. The blockage of these nerves is useful&#xD;
      primarily for postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery, including gynecologal too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In major surgical procedures such as uterine removal (hysterectomy), pain and stress caused&#xD;
      by surgical tissue injury stimulate a strong pro-inflammatory response, so establishing&#xD;
      effective postoperative analgesia which adequately relieved the pain is of great importance.&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will evaluate the effect of a transversus abdominis plane block&#xD;
      on the severity of postoperative pain as well as its effect on proinflammatory and pain&#xD;
      factors in patients following gynecologic surgery performed with a laparotomy approach. The&#xD;
      investigators will also compare the use of standard systemic multimodal analgesia and the TAP&#xD;
      block (as well as their combination) in the control of postoperative pain. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that both approaches are effective in controlling postoperative pain, but comparative studies&#xD;
      are rare, and none has so far examined the concentration of proinflammatory and pain factors&#xD;
      in operated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic hypothesis is that a transversus abdominis plane block reduces postoperative pain&#xD;
      in patients after gynecologic surgery performed with a laparotomic approach. The expectation&#xD;
      is that the concentration of proinflammatory and pain factors in patients treated with a TAP&#xD;
      block will be lower and the quality of recovery will be better than that of patients&#xD;
      receiving standard analgesic therapy (systemic multimodal analgesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the three forms of postoperative analgesia dividing patients in the three groups&#xD;
           (TAP block only, systemic multimodal analgesia only and combined TAP block with systemic&#xD;
           multimodal analgesia) after gynecological surgeries to show which one has the highest&#xD;
           value in controlling postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze the impact of the TAP block on postoperative pain, using a visual analogue scale&#xD;
           (VAS) in patients after gynecological surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze the impact of TAP block combined with systemic, multimodal analgesia on&#xD;
           postoperative pain, using the VAS scale, in patients after gynecological surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analyze the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines and pain factors (IL-1ß, IL-6,&#xD;
           cortisol, catecholamines) in the plasma of patients who will receive a TAP block after&#xD;
           gynecological surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analyze the impact of the TAP block on the quality of recovery, measured with quality of&#xD;
           recovery (QoR) questionnaire in patients after gynecological surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Correlate values of subjective assessment of postoperative pain intensity using VAS&#xD;
           scale with concentration of proinflammatory and biomarkers for pain (IL-1ß, IL-6,&#xD;
           cortisol, catecholamines) in patients in whom postoperative pain after gynecological&#xD;
           surgery will be treated with TAP block or systemic multimodal analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construction of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structure will be a prospective, randomized, single-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (Material)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of women enrolled in the study will be 75. Patients will be interviewed in detail&#xD;
      prior to surgery to be informed of planned anesthesia, surgery and postoperative pain&#xD;
      control, and will sign informed consent and consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From each patient by standard technique venous blood will be taken out from peripheral vein&#xD;
      at certain intervals after surgery. The patients will be asked by the examiner to complete&#xD;
      VAS scale or and the QoR questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterectomy and / or adnexectomy will be performed in patients included in the study due to&#xD;
      benign gynecological pathology with a laparotomy approach. Baseline patient data will be&#xD;
      determined based on a detailed medical history and medical records, clinical examination of&#xD;
      each patient and imaging tests. A definitive diagnosis of benign gynecological pathology will&#xD;
      be obtained after a histopathological analysis of the tissue. A detailed interview will be&#xD;
      done with the patients before surgery, and patients will be informed about the planned&#xD;
      anesthesia, surgery and postoperative pain control. After that patients will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent and the consent for participating in the study. For the purpose of the study,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into three groups regarding to the treatment technique for&#xD;
      postoperative pain. The doctor ( researcher) will, by the computer program Datlnf Ranolist do&#xD;
      the randomization. So that way the researcher will determine the type of analgesia the&#xD;
      patient will receive. In the first group, patients will receive intravenous, systemic,&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia: paracetamol 1 gram and ketoprofen 100 mg every 8 hours for 24 hours.&#xD;
      Analgesia will start immediately after surgery. If the pain persists, the patient will be&#xD;
      given &quot;rescue&quot; analgesia: tramadol 50 mg intravenously up to a maximum dose of 400 mg / 24 h&#xD;
      and other analgesics if needed. In the second group there will be patients in who will be&#xD;
      given the TAP block. The TAP block will be given postoperatively before waking. It will be&#xD;
      given bilaterally in the before mentioned anatomic region (the so-called lateral TAP block)&#xD;
      of 0.25% levobupivacin in 40 ml bilaterally. If such analgesia is not satisfactory, tramadol&#xD;
      50 mg intravenously, up to a maximum dose of 400 mg / 24h, and other analgesics will be given&#xD;
      at the request of the patient. In the third group there will be patients who will be treated&#xD;
      with TAP block in addition to systemic, mutimodal analgesia. If such analgesia is not&#xD;
      satisfactory, tramadol 50 mg intravenously, up to a maximum dose of 400 mg / 24h, and other&#xD;
      analgesics will be given at the request of the patient. The standardized protocol will&#xD;
      determine the general information of each patient to be included in the study: ID, age and&#xD;
      gender. 25 patients will be included in each group. The research will be based on completing&#xD;
      a questionnaire (VAS scale and QoR questionnaire) and taking peripheral blood out. Blood will&#xD;
      be taken from the peripheral vein by standard technique in a volume of 10 ml before surgery&#xD;
      and 6, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. VAS scale (at rest and in motion) will be determined&#xD;
      before surgery and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The QoR questionnaire will be&#xD;
      examined before surgery, 24 hours after surgery and 30 days after surgery. The concentrations&#xD;
      of individual cytokines (IL-1ß, IL-6) and hormones (catecholamines, cortisol) related to&#xD;
      inflammation and pain will be determined by standard laboratory methods from peripheral&#xD;
      blood. Cytokine and hormone concentrations will be determined by enzyme immunofluorescence&#xD;
      method according to the manufacturer's instructions. All results obtained through the&#xD;
      questionnaire or blood test will only serve for the purpose of the study and will not have&#xD;
      diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic value for the patients included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical data processing will be performed in the Statistica 12.0 computer program&#xD;
      (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). When calculating differences between experimental groups,&#xD;
      investigators will use the Kruskal Walis ANOVA nonparametric test for small independent&#xD;
      samples. Changes will be considered statistically significant with p &lt;0.05. We will use the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test subsequently to determine between which two of the more comparable groups&#xD;
      there is statistical significance. Correlations will be examined by Pearson or Spearman&#xD;
      correlation test, depending on the results of the data distribution analysis. Differences&#xD;
      between variables expressed at nominal level will be examined using the chi-square test.&#xD;
      Image and spreadsheet views of the results will be made in Microsoft Excel and Statistica&#xD;
      12.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected scientific contribution&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the results of the proposed study will shed light on the impact of various&#xD;
      anesthesiologic techniques (transversus abdominis plane block, intravenous systemic&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia and their combination) on postoperative pain and the concentration of&#xD;
      proinflammatory and pain factors after gynecologic surgery performed with a laparotomy&#xD;
      approach. Investigators expect that the use of regional analgesia technique (TAP block) will&#xD;
      lead to a reduction in postoperative pain and proinflammatory factors and pain factors&#xD;
      examined, thereby contributing to a faster recovery and better outcome of their treatment.&#xD;
