  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial or antibiotic agents, which are essential to prevent and treat bacterial&#xD;
      infectious diseases, have become one of the most widely used drugs in the world. In the&#xD;
      European region, the highest rates of antibiotic consumption are reported in Turkey. There is&#xD;
      a nearly fivefold difference between Turkey and the lowest consuming countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in dentistry evaluate participants according to the basis of predefined criteria.&#xD;
      History of antibiotic consumption is one of the most common exclusion criteria for&#xD;
      periodontal trials. However, there is still disagreement on how long the effect of systemic&#xD;
      antibiotic agents on the oral mucosa and periodontal tissue lasts. It is unclear whether the&#xD;
      timing of antibiotic consumption should be an exclusion criterion for genetic damage and&#xD;
      histological studies during the selection of healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal status of participants in study groups is described as with or without&#xD;
      periodontitis in many studies, because of the lack of clear definitions of periodontal health&#xD;
      and gingivitis. It should be recognized that even the lack of visual signs of inflammation,&#xD;
      some mild histopathological changes can be seen in the periodontium. Consequently, for the&#xD;
      real diagnosis of the clinically healthy periodontium, clinical findings should be supported&#xD;
      and confirmed with histological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micronuclei (Mn) are observed as abnormal nuclear structures and indicators of chromosomal&#xD;
      level DNA damage. The oral mucosa epithelium is an immunologic barrier and affected by&#xD;
      chemical factors such as antibiotic consumption. The Mn test to exfoliated epithelial cells&#xD;
      from the oral cavity is utilized as a non-invasive diagnostic technique for monitoring the&#xD;
      status of oral health. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on the comparison of&#xD;
      the impacts of the timing of antibiotic consumption on human periodontal tissues and oral&#xD;
      smear samples. The present study is undertaken to determine whether the different timing of&#xD;
      antibiotic (amoxicillin) therapy has effects on the histopathology of gingiva and genetic&#xD;
      damage of exfoliated cells from oral mucosa in healthy participants.&#xD;

    <description>Modified histological criteria was the measurement used for the semi-quantitative histological assessment of gingival damage. Cellular components, vascularization, cell infiltration, necrosis, pyknotic nucleus, hyperemia, fibrosis, ulceration, atrophy, apoptosis, and rete peg configuration were scored by using a scale ranging from 0 to 3 (none : 0, mild: 1, moderate: 2, and severe : 3) for each criterion.</description>

    <measure>Effects of antibiotics on buccal and oral smear confirmed by quantitative determination of the micronuclei.</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>The method has been applied both for monitoring chromosome damage and/or proteins may also result in unsuccessful attachment of a whole chromosome at anaphase stage which subsequently also gives rise to a micronucleus. Thus, quantitative determination of the micronuclei are unique amongst cytogenetic tests in that it provides a reliable measure of both chromosome loss and breakage.</description>

        A total of 45 systemically and periodontally healthy participants, who were referred to the&#xD;
        clinics of the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul Medipol&#xD;
        University between 2018 and 2019 for routine periodontal visits, were included in this&#xD;
        study. Participants were divided into three groups based on the history of oral antibiotic&#xD;
        (1 g amoxicillin bid, two times a day) consumption for upper respiratory tract infection in&#xD;
        the previous 12 months: group I (n = 19), participants used antibiotic between 12-6 months&#xD;
        before the sampling; group II (n = 13), participants used antibiotic between 6-3 months&#xD;
        before the sampling; group III (n = 13), participants used antibiotic within a period of&#xD;
        1-month before to sampling.&#xD;
