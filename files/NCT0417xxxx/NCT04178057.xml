      This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profiles,&#xD;
      immunogenicity of GB222 in Chinese patients with relapsed/progressive high-grade glioma;&#xD;
      moreover, changes in cerebral edema, changes in KPS score from baseline, objective response&#xD;
      rate (ORR), 4-month progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)will be evaluated.&#xD;
      The dose reduction of hormone during continuous administration period will be observed.&#xD;
