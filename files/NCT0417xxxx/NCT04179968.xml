      To goal of this research is to assess the ability of Gallium-68 (68Ga) Prostate-Specific&#xD;
      Membrane Antigen-11 (PSMA-11) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to&#xD;
      increase diagnostic accuracy in localizing primary and metastatic lesions in patients with&#xD;
      suspected prostate cancer and elevated Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS)&#xD;
      scores and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the added value of 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT for detection of&#xD;
      additional primary prostate cancer lesions compared to multiparametric magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (mpMRI) in a group of patients with elevated PI-RADS scores and PSA. We propose that&#xD;
      the addition of early dynamic 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging to the more usual delayed imaging&#xD;
      will enhance detection of primary lesions and additional lesions not detected on the mpMRI.&#xD;
      In addition, the dynamic imaging will allow us to evaluate the kinetics of uptake in the&#xD;
      prostate gland. It is possible that even in the absence of focal uptake, hyperemia of the&#xD;
      gland could indicate the presence of an occult primary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second purpose of this research is to examine the value of 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT in this same&#xD;
      group of patients in detecting metastatic disease at initial staging in comparison with&#xD;
      current standard of care imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with suspected prostate cancer (e.g., abnormal digital rectal exam, elevated&#xD;
             and/or rising PSA) as determined by referring physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had a diagnostic, standard of care mpMRI of the prostate with at&#xD;
             least one lesion with a PI-RADS v2.1 score ≥ 4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In men with PI-RADS v2.1 score 4, PSA should be ≥ 10 ng/mL. In men with at least one&#xD;
             PI-RADS v2.1 score 5 lesion, there is no restriction on PSA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be scheduled for biopsy or radical prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not have had any type of curative or palliative therapy for prostate&#xD;
             cancer before enrolling in the study&#xD;
