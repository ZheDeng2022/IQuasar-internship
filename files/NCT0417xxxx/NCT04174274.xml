  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP) is a high-mortality hospital infection that occurs in&#xD;
      patients undergoing invasive Mechanical Ventilation (MV) and is frequently encountered in&#xD;
      intensive care units. Prolonged mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospitalizations, excessive&#xD;
      use of antibiotics and increased medical costs are seen. Therefore, compliance with&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention methods is becoming increasingly important.&#xD;
      Therefore, in the investigator's study was to investigate compliance with&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention methods and the incidence of ventilator-associated&#xD;
      pneumonia in intensive care units.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the first stage of the study, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital&#xD;
      Anesthesia Reanimation 1-2-3-4, compliance with ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention&#xD;
      rules in neurology, neurosurgery, and internal medicine intensive care units will be&#xD;
      investigated. The researcher will visit the intensive care units included in the study twice&#xD;
      a day (10:00 and 14:00) by Dr. GÃ¶khan Erdem for 1 week at the same time of day and monitor&#xD;
      whether they work in accordance with VAP prevention rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAP prevention methods: Head angle 30-45 degrees, peptic ulcer prophylaxis, thromboembolism&#xD;
      prophylaxis, daily wake up test, use of chlorhexidine in oral care, bacterial filter use in&#xD;
      ventilator circuit, daily spontaneous breathing trials, silver-coated endotracheal tube use,&#xD;
      cuff pressure adequacy, hand hygiene , VAP nurse training, avoiding excessive distension of&#xD;
      the stomach, equipment contamination, mechanical tooth cleaning, daily assessment for patient&#xD;
      separation from mechanical ventilation, sterile aspiration technique, use of sterile gloves&#xD;
      before aspiration, aspiration of subglottic secretions will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage of the study, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital&#xD;
      anesthesia reanimation 1-2-3-4, demographic characteristics of all hospitalized patients for&#xD;
      neurological, neurosurgery, and internal medicine intensive care units, reason for&#xD;
      hospitalization in intensive care unit, APACHE score, duration of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      length of stay in ICU unit, blood transfusion, urinary infection, wound infection, presence&#xD;
      of infection in at least one site, duration and type of surgery if operated, post-op&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotic use, history of CPR, history of difficult intubation, shape and&#xD;
      duration of intubation, presence of tracheostomy , time from intubation to tracheostomy&#xD;
      opening, residence time in ICU, change of filters in mechanical ventilator circuits,&#xD;
      antibiotic use, low serum albumin value, sedative use, steroid use, feeding type, inotropic&#xD;
      requirement, prokinetic agent use, number of bed personnel and nurses, reentubation history,&#xD;
      transport history, glaskow coma score, frequency of endotracheal aspiration, peep need,&#xD;
      smoking history, nasogastric use, chest tube, central venous catheter, presence of arterial&#xD;
      catheter, history of dialysis, continuous infusion therapy, aerosol therapy, chronic diseases&#xD;
      will be recorded. Patients under 18 years of age who had previously been diagnosed with&#xD;
      pneumonia, lung expansion devices such as cpap, nasal peep, hypocpap were not applied via&#xD;
      tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation, and patients due to high frequency ventilation or&#xD;
      extracorporeal life support were excluded from VAP surveillance.&#xD;
