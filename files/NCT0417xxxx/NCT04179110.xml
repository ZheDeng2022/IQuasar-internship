    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, non-randomized single center study designed to evaluate response and&#xD;
      survival of treatment with the combination of pembrolizumab and ramucirumab in patients with&#xD;
      progressive metastatic TCC after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) in patients treated with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab and ramucirumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: The ORR will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published&#xD;
           literature of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab and ramucirumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: The PFS will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published&#xD;
           literature of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients treated with pembrolizumab and&#xD;
           ramucirumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: The OS will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published literature&#xD;
           of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: To evaluate differences in ORR, PFS and OS in patients treated with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab and ramucirumab stratified by Bellmunt criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: Patients with high Bellmunt criteria scores will have lower rates of ORR,&#xD;
           PFS and OS.&#xD;

    <description>The objective overall response rate (ORR) is the proportion of enrolled patients who have received any amount of either study drug, have at least 1 post baseline tumor image, and achieve a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The ORR will be assessed based on RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first study treatment until the date of the first observed radiographically documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS), including 1- and 2- year survival rates, is determined from the date of first study treatment until death due to any cause. If the patient was alive at the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis (or was lost to follow-up), OS will be censored on the last date the patient was known to be alive.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium (bladder,&#xD;
             urethra, or renal pelvis). Patients with mixed pathology are eligible only if they&#xD;
             have predominantly transitional cell tumor based on local pathology review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented disease progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria to at least one prior line of&#xD;
             systemic therapy and no more than three. Prior therapy for advanced disease must&#xD;
             include an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Prior therapy in an adjuvant or neoadjuvant&#xD;
             setting is not considered as a prior line of systemic chemotherapy, unless patient has&#xD;
             rapidly progressed as defined by ≤ 6 months of last dose in this setting. If it is ≤ 6&#xD;
             months, it will be regarded as a prior line of treatment. Prior treatment with&#xD;
             intravesicular chemotherapy, bacillus Calmette -Guérin (BCG), or platinum given as a&#xD;
             radiation-sensitizing agent will not be considered as a systemic line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A brain scan via CT with contrast or MRI is to be performed to confirm absence of&#xD;
             intracranial metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The presence of measurable disease based on the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
             Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as determined by the site study team. Tumor lesions&#xD;
             situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has&#xD;
             been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Measurable disease must still be present after pretreatment core-needle or&#xD;
             excisional biopsy.&#xD;

             schedules and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Provided tissue for biomarker analysis from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy&#xD;
             of a tumor lesion using a non-significant risk procedure prior to enrollment. Repeat&#xD;
             samples may be required if adequate tissue is not provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Age: 18 years of age or older on day of signing consent.&#xD;

         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A signed&#xD;
             informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient's urinary protein is ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA; if urine&#xD;
             dipstick or routine analysis is ≥2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must&#xD;
             demonstrate &lt;1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in this protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Adequate organ function, as defined in the table below, with all screening labs&#xD;
             performed within 14 days of treatment initiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients on full-dose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose (minimum duration 14&#xD;
             days) of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin. If receiving warfarin,&#xD;
             the patient must have an INR ≤ 3.0 and no active bleeding (i.e., no bleeding within 14&#xD;
             days prior to first dose of study treatment) or pathological condition present that&#xD;
             carries a high risk of bleeding (e.g., tumor involving major vessels or known&#xD;
             varices). Patients on anticoagulation therapy with unresected primary tumors or local&#xD;
             tumor recurrence following resection are not eligible.&#xD;

             for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. For female patients, are surgically sterile, are postmenopausal, or agree to use a&#xD;
             highly effective method of birth control (2 methods preferred) during the study and&#xD;
