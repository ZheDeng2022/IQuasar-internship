  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of repeat doses of 200 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) belimumab&#xD;
      administered via SC injection in pediatric participants 5 to 17 years of age with SLE on a&#xD;
      background of standard of care therapy. This bridging PK study is part of an extrapolation&#xD;
      strategy to support the use of SC belimumab in pediatric SLE participants, based on the&#xD;
      completed adult SLE study with SC belimumab and the pediatric SLE study with intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      belimumab. Part A is an open label 12-week treatment phase where participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled and allocated to treatment cohorts based on their body weight at baseline. The dose&#xD;
      and dosing regimens selected for SC administration in this pediatric population are intended&#xD;
      to achieve a similar average exposure as observed with the weekly 200 mg SC dosing regimen in&#xD;
      adult SLE patients. Part B is an optional 40-week open-label continuation phase, open to all&#xD;
      participants who have completed Part A. Dosing of SC belimumab may continue at the same&#xD;
      frequency in Part B or may require a change in frequency according to changes in participant&#xD;
      body weight. The total duration of the study will be 68 weeks including a 12-Week open label&#xD;
      treatment phase (Part A), an optional 40-week open-label continuation phase (Part B) and&#xD;
      16-week follow-up.&#xD;
