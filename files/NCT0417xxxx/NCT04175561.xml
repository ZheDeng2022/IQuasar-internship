  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The idea that spending time in natural environments can enhance one's health has been&#xD;
      researched for several years. However, the concept of green prescribing--or prescribing a&#xD;
      systematic nature-based intervention that can be monitored over time--has only recently&#xD;
      generated traction in practice (although the principles can be traced back to several hundred&#xD;
      years ago).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Green prescriptions (social prescribing with nature) could potentially help to reduce the&#xD;
      costs of mainstream healthcare and could have important 'co-benefits', for example, by&#xD;
      simultaneously enhancing the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are still a number of critical questions that need answering, such as what works best&#xD;
      for whom, where and when, and a number of key constraints need to be addressed. The&#xD;
      conceptual framework for this proposed trial has been informed by the results of a UK-wide&#xD;
      green prescribing questionnaire (Stage 1 of PhD) and recommendations from the Improving&#xD;
      Wellbeing through Urban Nature (IWUN) research project (www.iwun.uk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main (perceived) constraints to green prescribing acquired from the questionnaire&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A lack of funding for all stakeholders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research project aims to be cost-effective and not strictly reliant on other&#xD;
           organisations&#xD;
&#xD;
           - A lack of knowledge of how to start a green prescribing service&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The project aims to demonstrate how to start a green prescribing service&#xD;
&#xD;
           - A lack of opportunities and awareness of service availability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As above&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Patient motivation and ease of access/travel etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The novel situational aspect of the project (within the premises of GP practices) aims&#xD;
           to maximise access/minimise travel for patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           - A lack of knowledge of the evidence and mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research project aims to collect evidence on mental health, wellbeing and nature&#xD;
           connectedness via an RCT-style experimental design&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Referral and set-up time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As per funding objective - see top. The research project will also evaluate patient&#xD;
           appointments/attendances (number and frequency) via the RCT approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher is proposing to conduct a 3-6 month randomised controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      interventional study involving adult patients with mild-moderate depression as determined&#xD;
      using the well-established PHQ-9 questionnaire. A key aim is to sustain this green&#xD;
      prescribing service once the research is complete and to hopefully stimulate other trials&#xD;
      across Sheffield and the UK (providing opportunities for important meta-analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will include pocket gardening (activities in small, semi-permanent,&#xD;
      versatile gardens) and nature-based activities hosted in the premises of GP surgeries in&#xD;
      Sheffield's Network North region.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A green prescription is a prescribed nature-based health intervention designed for&#xD;
      individuals with a defined need (or to complement orthodox medical treatments). Common&#xD;
      examples of green prescribing activities include: therapeutic horticulture, biodiversity&#xD;
      conservation volunteering, care farming, wild crafts and nature walks. Green prescriptions&#xD;
      are typically provided for a set length of time (e.g. 12 weeks) but can be open ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a green prescribing activity, therapeutic horticulture has several potential benefits&#xD;
      including physical and mental health improvements, facilitating social co-mingling,&#xD;
      educational and reward-based e.g. harvesting natural produce. It has already proven&#xD;
      successful as a green prescribing activity in projects such as SAGE Greenfingers&#xD;
      (sagesheffield.org.uk), which was established following a community needs assessment&#xD;
      commissioned by Pitsmoor surgery in Sheffield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This kind of green prescription provides natural environmental features, social context and&#xD;
      meaningful activities - three important interacting phenomena in nature-based interventions.&#xD;
      By integrating other nature-based activities such as simply noticing the local wildlife, this&#xD;
      project also aims to open pathways (via senses, compassion, emotion meaning and beauty) to&#xD;
      nature connectedness - one's emotional relationship with the natural world. The novel&#xD;
      situational element of this project (i.e. hosted in GP surgery premises) aims to maximise&#xD;
      accessibility and minimise travel for the patients, and to minimise multi-stakeholder&#xD;
      logistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, several policy statements--informed by empirical evidence--were recently&#xD;
      published by the IWUN research project (www.iwun.uk). Amongst many other recommendations,&#xD;
      these call for GP practices to enhance the biodiversity in their premises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, the question of how GP practices can provide their own greenspaces to improve&#xD;
      the mental health of their patients is also raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-designing the outdoor spaces surrounding GP practices and/or integrating new nature-based&#xD;
      features and activities within these spaces could help to enhance patient (and staff)&#xD;
      wellbeing. Creating pocket gardens (small multifunctional gardens typically installed in the&#xD;
      pockets of empty urban spaces) and biodiverse spaces for green prescribing activities is one&#xD;
      potential route, and an evaluation of this concept forms the basis of the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a severe lack of randomised controlled trial experiments in green prescribing&#xD;
      research - further strengthening the rationale for the chosen experimental approach.&#xD;
