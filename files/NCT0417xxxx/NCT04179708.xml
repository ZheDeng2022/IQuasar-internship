    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that pain biology education, combined with a rehabilitation program,&#xD;
      reduces disability to 3 months, compared to conventional spinal physiology education.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention description Patients participate in a back school program including initial and final assessment, educational activities and therapeutic activities (eg. Physiotherapy, balneotherapy, physical activity, spine ergonomics, and so on) spread over 5 days. The therapeutic activities are the same in experimental and control group, only the educational activities differ.&#xD;
The educational activities represent 4 hours of intervention, ½ hours of educative initial assessment and ½ hour of educative final assessment.&#xD;
The content of Pain Neuroscience Education (experimental group) focuses on deconstruction of patho-anatomical and biomechanical believes, and the explanation of pain from the biology. This framework allows the introduction of coping strategies (eg gradual exposure to exercise, activity and physical activity) and regulation strategy (eg fragmentation of activity, stress management, and so on).</description>

The content of conventional education (control grou) focuses on patho-anatomical and biomechanical notions. This framework allows the introduction of protection strategies (eg education on good posture, good handling techniques, physical activity and therapeutic exercise in stretch and strenghten the spine in order to protect it).</description>
