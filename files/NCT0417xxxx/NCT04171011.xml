  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophagectomy is the cornerstone for treatment of esophageal cancer. However, it is&#xD;
      associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Studies suggest that systemic&#xD;
      inflammation after surgery has a negative impact on surgical outcomes. Attenuation of an&#xD;
      excessive inflammatory response within the perioperative period for high-risk surgical&#xD;
      procedures may reduce morbidity and mortality. The inflammatory response may be important in&#xD;
      the development of these complications and reduction of inflammatory cytokine may be&#xD;
      associated with an improved outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will evaluate the feasibility and safety of neuromodulation during&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery for esophageal cancer (esophagectomy) to assess impact on the&#xD;
      inflammatory response. During the esophagectomy, a stimulation lead will be placed on the&#xD;
      exposed nerves, and energy applied to the lead to test whether the nerves can be activated.&#xD;
      The study will also measure potential physiological responses to nerve activation.&#xD;

      Active dampening of the inflammatory response may be an important therapeutic target to&#xD;
      decrease complications and improve recovery following esophagectomy. The current study is&#xD;
      intended to evaluate the feasibility and safety of stimulating the exposed nerves in&#xD;
      esophagectomy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During minimally invasive esophagectomy, a neurovascular bundle (NVB) is exposed or partially&#xD;
      exposed as part of the obligatory lymph node dissection. At the point in the esophagectomy&#xD;
      when the NVB is being isolated, a lead will be applied laparoscopically to the NVB and&#xD;
      connected to an external pulse generator. An ultrasound transducer will be introduced to the&#xD;
      abdomen and placed on the NVB to visualize splenic arterial blood flow. The NVB will be&#xD;
      stimulated while physiologic responses are observed. Blood samples will be taken before, and&#xD;
      at certain pre-defined time points after, stimulation and recovery. The lead and ultrasound&#xD;
      transducer will be removed after completion of stimulation, and the esophagectomy surgery&#xD;
      will continue. Surgeon experience applying and removing the cuff electrode will be&#xD;
      documented, in addition to the responses to NVB stimulation. Post-operative safety will be&#xD;
      followed through 7-days (or day of discharge if earlier).&#xD;
