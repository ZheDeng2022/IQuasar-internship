  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse is a common pelvic floor disorder described as&#xD;
      descent of the vaginal apex after hysterectomy. The incidence of post-hysterectomy vault&#xD;
      prolapse has been reported to follow 11.6% of hysterectomies performed for prolapse and 1.8%&#xD;
      for other benign diseases. The majority of surgical repairs to correct post-hysterectomy&#xD;
      vault prolapse are approached via a transvaginal route. A common transvaginal procedure to&#xD;
      correct vaginal vault prolapse is the uterosacral ligament suspension. Traditionally, the&#xD;
      uterosacral ligaments have been accessed intraperitoneally to perform the vaginal suspension.&#xD;
      More recently, an extraperitoneal approach has been utilized with good results. There is&#xD;
      limited evidence comparing the the two approaches. Thus, the objectives of this study are to&#xD;
      compare compare operative time, hospital stay, cost, surgical success, and other&#xD;
      perioperative outcomes between the two approaches.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind surgical trial of women with&#xD;
      post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse desiring surgical treatment. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare outcomes of vaginal intraperitoneal uterosacral ligament suspensions and&#xD;
      vaginal extraperitoneal uterosacral ligament suspensions for the treatment of&#xD;
      post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse. The primary objective will be to compare operative&#xD;
      time between the two approaches. Secondary objectives of the trial will be to compare&#xD;
      hospital stay, cost, surgical success, and other perioperative outcomes between the two&#xD;
      approaches through 12 months using assessments at six weeks, six months, and twelve months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include subjects with stage 1-4 pelvic organ prolapse and descent of the&#xD;
      vaginal apex at least ½ way into vaginal canal (defined as POPQ Point C ≥ -TVL/2) that desire&#xD;
      vaginal surgical management for post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse. Subjects enrolled&#xD;
      into the trial will be randomized to either vaginal intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal&#xD;
      uterosacral ligament suspension with a 1:1 allocation using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization schedule. Patients will be blinded to their allocation. Patients in both groups&#xD;
      will receive the same standard of care for vaginal procedures as it currently exists in out&#xD;
      practice. This involves the standard anesthetics and opioid medications intraoperatively.&#xD;
      Randomization will be revealed to the surgeons in the operating room once the patient is&#xD;
      under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative data to be collected will include, operative time (minutes from surgical&#xD;
      incision time to surgery end time), estimated blood loss (ml), intraoperative complications,&#xD;
      and concurrent surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative and postoperative clinical measures to be collected will include POPQ&#xD;
      examination points and scores from three validated questionnaires (Pelvic Floor Disability&#xD;
      Index (PFDI-20) questionnaire, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaires (PFIQ-7) and the Pelvic and&#xD;
      Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12)). Postoperative clinical measures will be&#xD;
      collected at six week, six month, and twelve month post-operative visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical success or failure will be evaluated as a dichotomous composite outcome(objective&#xD;
      measures (POPQ examination points) and subjective measures(validated questionnaires) at six&#xD;
      week, six month, and twelve month post-operative visits.&#xD;

    <description>Sexual function in women with pelvic organ prolapse is measured by the PISQ-12. The scores range from 0-48 with lower scores indicating better sexual function. Scores are calculated by totalling the scores for each question with (4) always, (3) usually, (2) sometimes, (1) seldom, and (0) never. Reverse scoring is used for items 1, 2, 3 and 4. The short form questionnaire can be used with up to two missing responses.
