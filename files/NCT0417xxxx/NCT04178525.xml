    <textblock>
      Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic foot ulcer will be recruited and screened&#xD;
      for participation in the study. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to either&#xD;
      experimental or control group and undergo 10-weeks of treatment (as an addition to standard&#xD;
      care) and 4 weeks of follow-up to evaluate the effect of chitosan gel on chronic wound&#xD;
      (diabetic foot ulcer) healing.&#xD;

               1. Size of the wound 0,5 - 12 cm^2&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Wagner grade I or II&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Wound is not infected&#xD;
