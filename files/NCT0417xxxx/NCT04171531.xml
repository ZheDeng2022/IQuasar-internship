  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to compare the effectiveness of intradetrusor injection of 100 unit&#xD;
      injection of Botulinum toxin A to mid-urethral sling for change in MUI symptoms 6 months&#xD;
      following treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), defined as the presence of both stress urinary incontinence&#xD;
      (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), is a challenging condition for which clinicians&#xD;
      frequently use multiple sequential treatments that have undergone limited evaluation in&#xD;
      rigorous clinical trials. The Mixed Urinary Incontinence: Mid-urethral Sling vs. Botox A&#xD;
      (MUSA) trial will estimate the effect of Botulinum toxin A (Botox A ®) compared to&#xD;
      mid-urethral sling for the treatment of MUI symptoms in 146 women. MUSA is a randomized 2-arm&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of MUSA is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare treatment with either Botulinum toxin A (Botox A ®) or mid-urethral sling for&#xD;
           women with MUI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  characterize patient characteristics associated with treatment response&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to estimate the effect of intradetrusor injections Botulinum toxin A&#xD;
      (Botox A ®) compared to mid-urethral sling for treatment of MUI in 146 women 6 months after&#xD;
      treatment. The change in severity of MUI symptoms will be measured using the Urogenital&#xD;
      Distress Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include identifying predictors of treatment failure and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of treatments in this MUI population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will continue with an additional 6 month observational period until 12 months post&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A supplemental study will characterize baseline putative proteins/protein pathways in women&#xD;
      with MUI associated with change in UDI after treatment with MUS or onabotulinum toxin A.&#xD;
