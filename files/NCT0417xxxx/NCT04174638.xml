        <title>Change From Baseline in Adherence to Fluid Intake on the Fluid Control in Hemodialysis Patients Scale at Week 12</title>
        <description>This scale measure adherence to fluid intake.The scale had 24 items and 3 point likert scale. It was included three sub-dimensions: knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes. The knowledge sub-dimension included 7 items and it's score ranged from 7-21. A high score indicates that individuals have higher levels of knowledge about fluid intake. The behavior sub-dimension included 11 items and it's score ranged from 11-33. A high score indicates that individuals' behavior is positive in adherence to fluid intake. The attitudes sub-dimension included 6 items and it's score ranged from 6-18. A high score indicates that individuals' attitudes is positive in adherence to fluid intake. The Fluid Control in Hemodialysis Patients Scale is evaluated on the total score. The lowest and highest score is between 24 and 72. High score indicates that adherence to fluid intake is high.The scale was developed in Turkey. The change between week 12 score and baseline score was reported.</description>
