    <textblock>
      Integrative medicine raises public's attention due to either mainstream or traditional&#xD;
      medicine has its limitation. The topic &quot;dysmenorrhea&quot;, with prevalence up to 50%, troubled&#xD;
      many females with symptom as depression, reduced the quality of life; and even withdraw from&#xD;
      daily activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, gynecologists apply analgesic such as Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs, and&#xD;
      oral contraceptive pills or progestin as conventional therapy. As NSAIDs cause&#xD;
      gastrointestinal discomfort, while hormone therapy leads to other concerns; some women now&#xD;
      adopt acupuncture as an alternative therapy for its safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, laser acupuncture has been practiced in recent years for it integrates the&#xD;
      meridian theory and laser therapy; hence there are also some positive research in academic&#xD;
      field.Whether laser or traditional acupuncture is more effective is still under debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, investigators had published that the theory of yin/yang (meridian) is&#xD;
      compatible with autonomic nerve theory. As many women with dysmenorrhea suffered from&#xD;
      insomnia, anxiety, convulsion of the uterine muscle, which are related to autonomic nerve&#xD;
      dysfunction, investigators are intrigued to know whether the effect of acupuncture is related&#xD;
      to adjusting autonomic nerve system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators intend to investigate the efficacy of laser and manual acupuncture in&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea, and whether their mechanism is germane to hormone alternation or autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system adjustment. The points in this proposal are 1.evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      manual/laser acupuncture in dysmenorrhea in respects of symptoms and quality of life 2.&#xD;
      compare whether these types acupuncture will alter the prostaglandin or hormone and the&#xD;
      relationship between with the efficacy. 3. evaluate whether the mechanism of manual and laser&#xD;
      acupuncture is relevant to alternating the autonomic nerve activity and if not correspond to&#xD;
      Yin-Yang theory.&#xD;

      1.1 The prevalence and mechanism of dysmenorrhea Dysmenorrhea is a troubling problem affect&#xD;
      more than 50% reproductive-aged women and affect females' quality of life is not only&#xD;
      physical but also psychologic aspects. It costs a lot of health, social and economic burden.&#xD;
      The symptom is characterized by cramping pain in the lower abdomen, starting within the first&#xD;
      eight to 72 hours of menstruation. According to research, the severity of dysmenorrhea ranged&#xD;
      widely from mild, tolerable to incapability for 1 to 3 days each menstrual cycle, even&#xD;
      incapable of work or daily activity. Some women even suffer from autonomic dysfunction&#xD;
      symptoms such as dizziness, diarrhea, migraine, vomiting, unable to concentrate, negative&#xD;
      mood and anxiety or depression. The mechanism of pain associated with dysmenorrhea can be&#xD;
      addressed by two aspects: neuro-endocrine regulated and neuro-physiologic related. One is by&#xD;
      the action of prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2α, or&#xD;
      vasopressin-related from the endometrium at the onset of menstruation which stimulates pain&#xD;
      neurons and induces excessive contraction of the uterus. Prostaglandin production is&#xD;
      controlled by progesterone: when progesterone levels drop, immediately prior to menstruation,&#xD;
      prostaglandin levels increase. The other aspect is that the increasing uterine muscle&#xD;
      contractions and hormone secretion is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Therefore,&#xD;
      some scholars stress the importance of reducing sympathetic tone or re-imbalance the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous activity. Accordingly, investigators note that some research such as yoga,&#xD;
      or aerobic exercise applied in dysmenorrhea are designed through this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Current treatment of dysmenorrhea The conventional treatments adopt the use of&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) combined with oral contraceptives or&#xD;
      progestins. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line treatment for dysmenorrhea caused by&#xD;
      endometriosis. Topical heat, exercise, and nutritional supplementation may be beneficial in&#xD;
      patients who have dysmenorrhea. The NSAIDs may induce gastrointestinal disturbance while the&#xD;
      hormone treatment may increase the risk of some cancer or other heart problems; therefore,&#xD;
      around 25% of patients are refractory to conventional therapy. Some women choose alternative&#xD;
      therapies such as yoga, acupuncture, or massage for relieving their pain albeit the evidence&#xD;
      of these therapies is not enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 The role of acupuncture in dysmenorrhea Acupuncture, which is non-invasive and with few&#xD;
      side effects; has been proved with well anesthetic effect in pain control through varied&#xD;
      mechanisms. On one hand, some study propose that the mechanism of acupuncture in dysmenorrhea&#xD;
      is based on changes in neurophysiologic and neuro-hormonal activities such as endogenous&#xD;
      opioid, serotonin, and acetylcholine which results in pain reduction; on the other hand, some&#xD;
      study indicate that acupuncture has an effect in the reduction of inflammation, alterations&#xD;
      in uterine blood flow and changes in prostaglandin levels. Previous research confirmed that&#xD;
      acupuncture affects the autonomic status to some extent in diverting circumstances, yet the&#xD;
      style of acupuncture varied from manual to warm to laser acupuncture etc. In addition to pain&#xD;
      relieving, acupuncture has been reported with the efficacy in improving the quality of life&#xD;
      and decreasing NSAID use after regular treatment for 3 to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 manual acupuncture VS Laser acupuncture Laser acupuncture raises the public's attention&#xD;
      for its much less invasive than real acupuncture. In previous time, only TCM doctors or&#xD;
      acupuncturists could practice the acupuncture; yet since laser acupuncture is not invasive,&#xD;
      mainstream (western medicine) physicians could also practice laser therapy in the clinic,&#xD;
      more and more research about laser acupuncture was published in the field of pain control,&#xD;
      orthopedics, and internal medicine. Nevertheless, the research regarding laser acupuncture&#xD;
      applied in dysmenorrhea is rare, only one trial is noted in the Pubmed, which intrigues us to&#xD;
      further investigate the potential effect of laser acupuncture in dysmenorrhea now that&#xD;
      investigators already have abundant manual acupuncture experience in this issue.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is believed that acupuncture could attenuate pain or improve&#xD;
      microcirculation by regulating the autonomic nervous system. However, whether the effect of&#xD;
      manual and laser acupuncture on autonomic nerve activity is the same is still controversial.&#xD;
      Some study indicates laser acupuncture could be an alternative stimulate therapy for it has&#xD;
      the same effect as manual acupuncture on vagal activity whereas still, other studies note&#xD;
      laser acupuncture has a different effect from manual acupuncture on autonomic activity. As a&#xD;
      result, investigators aim to know more about these two types acupuncture's effect on HRV and&#xD;
      compare their effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Prospective of laser acupuncture in dysmenorrhea As many females troubled with the&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea and hormone or analgesics therapy has a certain effect, acupuncture is promising&#xD;
      for its less-invasiveness. Furthermore, if laser acupuncture is non-inferior to manual&#xD;
      acupuncture or even much more effective; then it could be another alternative therapy in this&#xD;
      issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6 The correlation of Meridian system and Autonomic system in acupuncture study In recent&#xD;
      decades, more and more researchers demonstrated that the meridian system corresponds to the&#xD;
      nervous system or has some overlapping with it. The study indicated that stimulating some&#xD;
      acupoints or meridians could change the autonomic activity and attain the goal of improving&#xD;
      some physiologic problem. Chien et al in 2014 indicated that acupoints stimulation could&#xD;
      modulate the autonomic nervous system to exert its physiological effect through the pathway&#xD;
      of the meridian system. Cui et al revealed that stimulating Heart Meridian may improve AMI by&#xD;
      inhibiting sympathetic discharges and elevating vagal discharges in AMI rats. These studies&#xD;
      confirmed the relationship between meridian and autonomic system, yet few studies compare the&#xD;
      efficacy or mechanism of different treatments (medication or different types acupuncture) in&#xD;
      applying in the same disease. That is why investigators intend to apply two different&#xD;
      acupuncture (manual and laser) to compare their effect on autonomic nervous system and&#xD;
      efficacy in clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7 Autonomic nerve activity V.S manual/ laser acupuncture V.S dysmenorrhea As has mentioned,&#xD;
      acupuncture works through regulating yin-yang and meridian energy. The interesting thing is&#xD;
      that from our previous study, investigators found that the concept of&#xD;
      parasympathetic/sympathetic system is compatible with yin/yang theory in Chinese Medicine to&#xD;
      a certain extent; while the promotion of energy is consistent with the &quot;De-Qi&quot; in performing&#xD;
      acupuncture. Since the symptoms related to dysmenorrhea such as pain, diarrhea, headache,&#xD;
      poor sleep are also related to autonomic dysfunction. (imbalance of&#xD;
      sympathetic/parasympathetic tone); investigators are intrigued by whether the mechanism of&#xD;
      acupuncture is relevant to the improvement of autonomic nerve activity in dysmenorrhea. Do&#xD;
      the manual and laser acupuncture work through the same mechanism on autonomic nerve system or&#xD;
      meridian network? Accordingly, under the context that acupuncture might have an effect on&#xD;
      reconciling the autonomic nervous imbalance and yin/yang in dysmenorrhea and to further&#xD;
      understand this issue, investigators intend to compare the manual, laser acupuncture and&#xD;
      conventional treatment reflecting in autonomic nervous activity and effect on dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.8 The relationship of hormone and dysmenorrhea Previous research noted that the&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea may be caused by the overproduction of uterine prostaglandins (PGs), which might&#xD;
      be regulated by progesterone, though not totally depend only on endocrine factors. All women&#xD;
      have increased levels of PGs during the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase of&#xD;
      ovulatory cycles. However, compared with eumenorrheic women, dysmenorrhea women have higher&#xD;
      levels of PGs and the concentration of progesterone per menstruation was significantly higher&#xD;
      in the eumenorrheic women than in the dysmenorrhea patients as well. Some gynecologists even&#xD;
      use prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor ( ex. Ibuprofen) in dealing with the dysmenorrhea. The&#xD;
      shift of estradiol/progesterone ratio in favor of estradiol contributes to the underlying&#xD;
      pathogenic principle of dysmenorrhea. Therefore, the change of hormones could present the&#xD;
      level of improvement of dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Acupuncture applied in dysmenorrhea From research, acupuncture is very popular when it&#xD;
      comes to some gynecologic problems, such as menopause symptoms or premenstrual syndrome.&#xD;
      However, most study focus on the comparison of acupuncture and sham acupuncture or NSAID and&#xD;
      the acupuncture protocol is not conclusive; some chose only one acupoint (SP6) while others&#xD;
      chose a group of acupoints. So far, none of the studies compares the efficacy and effect on&#xD;
      HRV or changes on hormone and prostaglandin between in manual and laser acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Heart rate variation (HRV) VS Cytokine and Acupuncture Regarding the connection of&#xD;
      acupuncture and autonomic nerve system or Heart rate variation (HRV), Acupuncture is&#xD;
      hypothesized to modulate the neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system and thereby&#xD;
      revitalize the balance of metabolism in the body. Investigators noted some evidence confirmed&#xD;
      that acupuncture could improve depression, fatigue through regulating cytokine and autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system. Nevertheless, whether there will be any relationship between the cytokine&#xD;
      change and HRV activity is uncertain. As a result, the study is designed for checking the&#xD;
      correlation of change in cytokine (Prostaglandin, estrogen, progesterone) and HRV activity in&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea beyond the evaluation of comparing efficacy. Investigators suppose the&#xD;
      phenomenon of decreased prostaglandins and increased progesterone will be noted in&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea patients benefit from acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators design not only aim to compare the efficacy of manual, laser acupuncture&#xD;
      and control group in dysmenorrhea but also further investigate whether their effect on HRV is&#xD;
      different. The acupoints investigators chose are most located in Yin meridians which&#xD;
      correspond to Yin-Yang theory that &quot; Yang masters Chi while Ying masters blood &quot;and &quot;Yang is&#xD;
      frequently in excess while yin is often in deficiency&quot;. Investigators aim to reconcile the&#xD;
      yin-yang through the special designed acupoints protocol. Additionally, investigators can&#xD;
      also confirm whether the effect of manual and laser acupuncture in dysmenorrhea is related to&#xD;
      the improvement of autonomic nerve activity and try to integrate our understanding about&#xD;
      neurophysiology and acupuncture along with TCM-Yin/Yang theory based on the previous study.&#xD;
      Whether acupuncture could change the hormone peptides or cytokine would be evaluated to&#xD;
      clarify the mechanism of how manual or laser acupuncture work. Investigators expect the study&#xD;
      can promote the crosstalk between the Chinese and western medicine and provide more&#xD;
      definitive evidence for acupuncture applied in dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and approach Investigators design a three-arms clinical randomized study, which&#xD;
      includes manual acupuncture, laser acupuncture and conventional therapy (NSAIDs and OCP) and&#xD;
      enrolls women with dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Specific aim 1: To compare the efficacy of manual and laser acupuncture and&#xD;
      control group (conventional therapy: including NSAIDs) in dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2:To evaluate whether the laser and manual acupuncture will affect the serum&#xD;
      prostaglandin, and hormone and the relationship between with the efficacy in dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim3: To identify the relationship between autonomic nerve activity change and laser&#xD;
      / manual acupuncture reflect in dysmenorrhea and integrate with the TCM -Yin/Yang and&#xD;
      meridian theory.&#xD;
