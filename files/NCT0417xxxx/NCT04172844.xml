  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study with a 3 + 3 dose escalation design followed by a dose-expansion&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the combination of pevonedistat, azacitidine, and venetoclax&#xD;
      will be effective, safe, and well tolerated in patients with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this portion of the study is to determine a recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of pevonedistat, azacitidine, and venetoclax. The investigators will use a variation&#xD;
      of the 3+3 design where both escalation and de-escalation are possible. A minimum of nine and&#xD;
      a maximum of 24 subjects will be needed for the phase 1 part of the study (dose-escalation&#xD;
      phase). The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period for dose escalation will be&#xD;
      during cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrolling patients at the next applicable dose level, all patients must complete the&#xD;
      DLT period of the current dose level. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review the&#xD;
      results of each dose level before the next applicable dose level opens for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Expansion Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this portion of the study is to confirm the feasibility and&#xD;
      tolerance of the combination of pevonedistat, azacitidine, and venetoclax in patients with&#xD;
      AML. Given that the dose-escalation phase described above will be able to establish the RP2D,&#xD;
      the dose-expansion phase will employ this dose. In addition to relapsed/refractory AML&#xD;
      patients, newly diagnosed AML patients can also be included in this phase to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and tolerance of this combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of six patients will be enrolled in the dose-expansion phase, which could be&#xD;
      expanded based on the safety and tolerability.&#xD;

    <description>This study uses a varied 3 + 3 design. Three patients will be started at a dose of 10 mg/m^2 days 1, 3 and 5. If no DLTs are observed in the first 3 participants, then a new cohort will be enrolled at the next planned dose level of 15 mg/m^2 days 1, 3 and 5. If two out of three subjects experience a DLT, then they will de-escalate one dose level. If one subject in three experiences a DLT, then expand up to three subjects at 20 mg/m^2 day 1, 3 and 5. If two out of six subjects experience a DLT, de-escalate one level. All subjects will receive Azacitidine and Venetoclax at the indicated dosages and timing.</description>
