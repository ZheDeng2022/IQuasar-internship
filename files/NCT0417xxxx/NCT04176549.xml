  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further develop a patient care pathway (incorporating a statistical model which uses the&#xD;
      values of biomarkers) in routine clinical practice that will aid the diagnosis and management&#xD;
      of women with an ectopic pregnancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose and design-There is a need for the patient care pathway to evolve in order to aid and&#xD;
      improve the diagnosis and management of women with a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) and&#xD;
      ectopic pregnancy (EP). There is potential for this to be achieved by the incorporation of a&#xD;
      statistical model that uses one or more novel markers identified by this study. These markers&#xD;
      may replace or add to the effectiveness of markers used in the current statistical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment-200 patients. Inclusion: Patients attending the Early Pregnancy Unit (EPU) in the&#xD;
      first trimester with a PUL or ectopic pregnancy on trans-vaginal ultrasound scan between the&#xD;
      ages of 18-50 years. Exclusion: Patients diagnosed with cancer, presence of acute medical&#xD;
      condition, patients aged less than 18 years, patients who cannot give fully informed study&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent - Posters will advertise the study. Patients in EPU will be invited to the study by a&#xD;
      member of the clinical care team. Written consent will be required for all aspects of the&#xD;
      study other than for 3-dimensional scanning of PUL and EP patients, where verbal consent will&#xD;
      be obtained. Patients will be given at least 24 hours to consider whether they wish to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality - The Chief Investigator will preserve the confidentiality of participants&#xD;
      taking part in the study and is registered under the Data Protection Act. Patient consent&#xD;
      forms will be stored securely within the study file. All patient identifiable information,&#xD;
      where required, will be stored electronically on National Health Service (NHS) approved&#xD;
      computers, accessible only by personnel involved in the study via password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of interest - None involved in the study have a conflict of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of results - No patient identifiable information will be included in the&#xD;
      research report or publication. Anonymised results will be disseminated to scientific&#xD;
      community by means of publication in peer-reviewed literature and presented at national and&#xD;
      international meetings.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Due to COVID-19, we have been unable to recruit to this study given the reconfiguration and&#xD;
    prioritisation of services and workforce. This has been the case since March 2020 and&#xD;
    unfortunately continues to be the case. Chief investigator is aware.&#xD;
