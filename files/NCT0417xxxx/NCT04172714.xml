    <textblock>
      The study proposes low-dose Y90 microspheres for therapy planning of HCC, as an alternative&#xD;
      to Technetium (99mTc) albumin aggregated (MAA), to be a bioidentical therapeutic Y90&#xD;
      surrogate marker to better predict and thus achieve optimal therapeutic dosing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is a second deadliest cancer in the world with less than 20% of&#xD;
      patients eligible for curative surgery at the time of diagnosis. Yttrium-90 (Y90)&#xD;
      radioembolization is palliative treatment with promising result. However, one of the most&#xD;
      important factors in the success of Y90 treatment is to ensure adequate dose of radioactive&#xD;
      material is delivered to the tumor. The technetium-99 macroaggregated albumin (MAA) which is&#xD;
      currently used for Y90 treatment planning and shunt study does not predict distribution of&#xD;
      Y90 in the lungs, tumors, and liver. Therefore, accurate and personalized treatment planning&#xD;
      cannot be performed using MAA. In this study, we are proposing using low-dose Y90&#xD;
      microspheres for the planning stage of the therapy to obtain an accurate estimation of&#xD;
      distribution of Y90 therapy dose. This will in turn allow us to ensure adequate dose of Y90&#xD;
      is delivered to the tumor(s) while minimizing dose delivered to non-tumor liver and lungs in&#xD;
      order to decrease the chance of treatment related toxicity to the liver and lungs.&#xD;

    <description>Y-90 radioembolization treatment requires estimating the activity shunted from the liver to the lungs, referred to as a lung shunt fraction (LSF). It is expressed in percentage, with higher percentage meaning a higher transit of Y-90 to the lungs (worse outcome) and lower percentage, lower transit of Y-90 to the lungs (better outcome).</description>

    <description>To identify tumor dose response threshold (TDRT) using Imaging Modified Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (m-RECIST), that is a method for measuring treatment response and measure of antitumor activity of cytotoxic drugs. This is measured using imaging: CT or MRI. The overall response is a combination of responses in each category: complete response (disappearance of any intramural arterial enhancement in all target lesions), partial response (at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of viable target lesions), stable disease (any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive disease) or progressive disease (an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable, enhancing target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable target lesions recorded since treatment started).</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo standard of care mapping study with 99TC-MAA to plan for Y90 radioembolization therapy. Additionally,non-standard of care, intervention will be to do a second mapping study using SIR-spheres microspheres with low-dose Y90 (15 mCi) before the therapeutic Y90 radioembolization.</description>

    <description>SIR-Spheres® Y-90 resin microspheres consist of biocompatible polymer resin microspheres of a median diameter of 32.5 microns (range between 20 and 60 microns) loaded with yttrium-90 (beta radiation penetrating an average of 2.5 mm in tissue to destroy tumor cells). The resin microspheres are small enough to become lodged in the arterioles within the growing rim of the tumor but are too large to pass through the capillaries and into the venous system. Since yttrium-90 has a half-life of 64.1 hours, most of the radiation (94%) is delivered to the tumor over 11 days.</description>
