  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the US, and obese women have a 20% to 40%&#xD;
      increase in the risk of developing breast cancer compared with normal-weight women. Bariatric&#xD;
      surgery is now considered the first line option for weight loss management in morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients with failure of medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong evidence that in early stages of cancer the breast undergoes inflammatory and&#xD;
      subsequently density changes that are observable in mammography. The aforementioned&#xD;
      alterations have been suggested to be magnified by obesity, potentially due to its&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory state. The investigators hypothesized that rapid weight loss following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and henceforth the reduction of inflammatory stress in the breast tissue&#xD;
      could potentially have a positive effect in improving breast density and consequently,&#xD;
      reducing the risk of breast cancer. In this order of ideas, with this study, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate how breast density is modified after bariatric surgery, and how&#xD;
      it impacts the risk of developing breast cancer using The Breast Cancer Surveillance&#xD;
      Consortium (BCSC) risk score and calculator in our population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational study involving patients selected for elective&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. Thirty-five women older than age 40 and younger than age 74 undergoing&#xD;
      primary bariatric surgery and having a BMI of ≥35 will be enrolled in this study. Patients&#xD;
      with previous diagnosis of breast cancer, previous diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ&#xD;
      (DCIS), previous breast augmentation and previous mastectomy will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Patients selected and consented for elective bariatric surgery will be recruited in the&#xD;
      Bariatric and Metabolic Institute at CCF, Weston FL and will undergo standard of care and&#xD;
      additional measurements before and after surgery as explained below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A first mammogram study will be performed between two to four weeks before bariatric&#xD;
           surgery, if the patient had a normal digital mammogram performed in the 12 months prior&#xD;
           to bariatric surgery, it would be accepted as the first mammogram study. This mammogram&#xD;
           is a part of the standard of care screening for this population group. Standard&#xD;
           measurements will be assessed including the BI-RADS® breast density score (radiologic&#xD;
           assessment of the density of breast tissue by a radiologist who interprets mammograms)&#xD;
           and The LIBRA (Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment) software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subsequent mammogram study (also part of the standard of care screening for this&#xD;
           population group) will be performed one year after the date of the bariatric procedure,&#xD;
           and standard measurements will be re-assessed, including re-stratification of BI-RADS&#xD;
           and LIBRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mammogram results will be obtained through medical records. If a patient had done a&#xD;
           mammogram at a non Cleveland Clinic facility, the investigator will ask them to sign an&#xD;
           authorization form to allow Cleveland Clinic Florida to request for their mammography&#xD;
           study from the previous year to the outside facility where it was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammatory markers including CRP, IGF1, IL6, TNF, will also be measured between two to&#xD;
           four weeks before bariatric surgery as a part of the pre-surgical blood work up and, one&#xD;
           year after the date of the bariatric procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory markers will be collected and processed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRP will be collected in a test tube containing lithium heparin (Green container). It&#xD;
           will be delivered between two hours of collection to our institutional laboratory for&#xD;
           processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IGF1 will be collected in a test tube containing SST (Gold container). It will be&#xD;
           delivered refrigerated between two hours of collection to our institutional laboratory&#xD;
           for processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL6 will be collected in a test tube containing SST (Gold container). It will be&#xD;
           delivered on ice ASAP upon collection to our institutional laboratory for processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TNF will be collected in a test tube containing SST (Gold container). It will be&#xD;
           delivered between two hours of collection to our institutional laboratory for&#xD;
           processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biometric measurements will be assessed before surgery and at the time of the&#xD;
                subsequent mammogram (one year after surgery). It will include weight, height, BMI&#xD;
                and Waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Basic demographics and comorbidities (Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, pulmonary&#xD;
                hypertension, sleep apnea, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney&#xD;
                disease, smoking status, alcohol use and hormonal replacement history) will also be&#xD;
                analyzed.&#xD;
