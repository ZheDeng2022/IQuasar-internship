      1. To determine if the adjunctive use of a Virtual Reality (VR) module on diaphragmatic&#xD;
           breathing (DB) can improve the quality of life (QOL) and symptoms of children with&#xD;
           functional constipation (FC) with pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) who are receiving&#xD;
           standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess if a VR module on DB can decrease healthcare utilization for children with FC&#xD;
           with PFD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will assess if the use a Virtual Reality (VR) module on diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breathing (DB) can improve quality of life, constipation symptoms, and decrease healthcare&#xD;
      utilization for children with functional constipation (FC) with pelvic floor dysfunction&#xD;
      (PFD). FC is a common pediatric condition with a high prevalence and $4.25 billion yearly in&#xD;
      healthcare expenditures. FC is often complicated with PFD as seen through stool withholding&#xD;
      behaviors. Children with FC with PFD are referred to occupational therapy for biofeedback and&#xD;
      DB training as standard of care. Occupational therapy uses to teach children with FC with PFD&#xD;
      to relax their abdominal muscles, and subsequently their pelvic floor muscles, facilitating a&#xD;
      more complete bowel evacuation. VR is a technology currently employed in rehabilitation&#xD;
      services, anesthesiology and surgery. VR can provide a fun, immersive environment with a&#xD;
      feedback component for children with FC to learn DB effectively and build a positive&#xD;
      association with toileting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine if a virtual reality module that teaches children&#xD;
      diaphragmatic breathing through an immersive game can improve the quality of life and&#xD;
      decrease health care utilization for children with functional constipation and pelvic floor&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;

    <description>Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM). The PAC-SYM (12-items) is a survey used to evaluate chronic constipation. Patients rank the symptoms on a 5 point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 4, 0 being absent and 4 being very severe. For each symptom, score changes of 0.5 points indicate minimal improvement, and changes in 1 point correspond to moderate clinical improvement.</description>
