  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the oral Factor D (FD) inhibitor ALXN2050&#xD;
      (ACH-0145228) monotherapy in patients with PNH that are treatment naïve, or patients&#xD;
      currently treated with eculizumab who still experience anemia and reticulocytosis, or&#xD;
      patients currently treated with ALXN2040 (danicopan) as monotherapy. After signing consent,&#xD;
      participants will have periodic visits through Week 12, at which time the primary endpoint&#xD;
      and key secondary assessments will be analyzed. Participants will continue on treatment past&#xD;
      12 weeks into a long-term extension portion of the trial.&#xD;

      Experimental: Open-label ALXN2050 Monotherapy orally&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients who are treatment naïve&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients who have received complement component 5 (C5) inhibition with eculizumab&#xD;
      for at least 6 months, who continue to experience anemia (hemoglobin [Hgb] &lt; 10 g/dL) and&#xD;
      reticulocytes above the upper limit of normal (ULN) who will switch to ALXN2050 monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Patients receiving danicopan monotherapy in study ACH471-103 will switch to ALXN2050&#xD;
      monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent form, participants will enter the screening period. During&#xD;
      the Screening Period, eligibility and screening assessments will be performed. Screening&#xD;
      assessments may be spread over more than one visit if necessary. At the baseline visit,&#xD;
      screened participants who continue to meet eligibility criteria will enter the Treatment&#xD;
      Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase will be followed by a long-term extension phase, where ALXN2050 will&#xD;
      continue to be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected to assess the efficacy endpoints, such as, change in hemoglobin&#xD;
      (Hgb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and other measures of hemolysis. Safety and transfusion&#xD;
      requirements will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue on treatment past 12 weeks in a long-term extension portion of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
