        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All children (â‰¥28 days old through 18 years of age) with an oncologic diagnosis&#xD;
             admitted to the PICU at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An oncologic diagnosis will include those with a cancer diagnosis or those being&#xD;
             treated at MSK for blood disorders, immunodeficiencies and complications of&#xD;
             transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preterm infants (&lt;44 weeks gestation at age of enrollment) as in these patients most&#xD;
             bleeding etiologies are specific to the neonatal period and the bleeding assessment&#xD;
             tool is not calibrated for this population&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known limitation of care at enrollment (standing Do Not Resuscitate order), as the&#xD;
             interventions and clinical outcome would be biased&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing bleeding disorders&#xD;
