    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how rigsertib sodium works in treating patients with Recessive&#xD;
      Dystrophic Epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) with locally advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC).&#xD;
      Rigosertib may selectively target Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) cancer cells while leaving&#xD;
      normal EB cells unaffected.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the anti-tumor activity of oral or IV rigosertib in RDEB patients with&#xD;
      advanced SCC that have failed prior standard of care, by determining the overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) which is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve either a CR or a PR by&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral rigosertib administered&#xD;
      either orally daily three weeks on, one week off or as 72h CIV infusions on day 1-3 of a two&#xD;
      week-cycle for 8 cycles and then on day 1-3 of a 4 week cycle thereafter&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess impact on quality of life (QoL) II. Biomarker analysis (to include markers of&#xD;
      PI3K/Akt and PLK1 pathways) performed on all archival tissue from all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Exome sequencing of patient tumors before, during, and after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients will receive rigosertib sodium as either oral capsules or IV infusion. Mode&#xD;
      of application is determined by the responsible investigator depending on participant's&#xD;
      needs, general condition, and possibility of ambulatory treatment or need of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will take oral rigosertib continuously for a total of three weeks of a four-week&#xD;
      cycle (three weeks on, one week off drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For IV treatment, patients will receive rigosertib IV administered as a 72-hr continuous&#xD;
      infusion on Days 1, 2 and 3 of a 2-week cycle for the first eight 2-week cycles, then on Days&#xD;
      1, 2 and 3 of a 4-week cycle thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment over a 52 week period. After completion of study treatment,&#xD;
      patients are followed periodically every 3 months over a 12 month period.&#xD;
