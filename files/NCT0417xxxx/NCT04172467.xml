      Retrospective, representative registry for quality assurance on diagnosis and therapy of&#xD;
      secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment structure analysis and recruitment (phase 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first step, data on care facilities, that treat patients with CLL or MM in Germany is&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 1 all centers in Germany that potentially treat patients with the CLL or MM are&#xD;
      contacted and data of its facility care level and its num-ber of treated patients is recorded&#xD;
      using a one-sided pen-to-paper form. In addition, the willingness of care facilities to&#xD;
      become involved in pa-tients' documentation is elicited (phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient documentation (phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve a reliable, representative sample of patients treated in Ger-many, the&#xD;
      distribution of cases to be documented is specified in the in-dividual indications amongst&#xD;
      the facilities involved. This is done using the facilities' data on patient numbers and&#xD;
      treatment structure obtained in phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating centers are assigned to clusters based on key distin-guishing features&#xD;
      (facility type, care level and number of patients treated). This sample is modulated&#xD;
      according to the previous treatment structure analysis. By taking this approach, the actual&#xD;
      percentages of the various care facilities in an indication area can be reflected&#xD;
      proportion-ally in the patient documentation sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 2 a multiple-page electronic case record form (eCRF) is com-pleted in order to&#xD;
      collect the original patient and treatment data, which are relevant to the purpose of the&#xD;
      study. All data is gathered retrospec-tively and anonymously using the patient files. Patient&#xD;
      and disease re-lated variables (age, general condition according to the Eastern Cooper-ative&#xD;
      Oncology Group (ECOG), relevant comorbidity, staging and rele-vant mutations), systemic&#xD;
      antineoplastic treatment (chemotherapy, an-tibodies, kinase-inhibitors, relevant&#xD;
      co-medication etc.) are recorded. Also, data on diagnosis of Ig-levels (IgG, IgA, IgM),&#xD;
      therapy of secondary immunodeficiencies as well as the number and severity of occurred&#xD;
      in-fections and their treatment is collected. Clusters for classification of in-fections will&#xD;
      be developed (e.g. life-threatening, need for hospitalization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure data quality, the scientific project lead will provide training for two&#xD;
      employees of the commissioned institute on matters re-garding the content of the study. This&#xD;
      knowledge will be incorporated into the programming of the user interface and the patient&#xD;
      databases so that the program will check for completeness and, as far as possible,&#xD;
      plausibility, on the basis of defined requirements and constraints. These checks accompany&#xD;
      the process of entering data into the eCRF and allow for validating data instantly. If&#xD;
      inconsistencies, mistakes or omissions are detected, data will be validated by an integrated&#xD;
      query management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians questionnaire (phase 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an additional step and alongside the patient documentation, the at-tending physicians in&#xD;
      participating centers will be surveyed (phase 3) on their competency profile, their&#xD;
      assessment of guideline quality and their approach to avoid infections of CLL and MM&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
