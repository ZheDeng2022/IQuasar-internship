  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional support and physical comfort are two important components of the patient experience&#xD;
      at the oncology outpatient clinic. However, current practices do not seem optimal for meeting&#xD;
      the psychosocial needs expressed by patients during chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comfort talk (CT) is a simple, inexpensive intervention that could maximize the feeling of&#xD;
      safety and comfort during chemotherapy. Identifying interventions that are interdisciplinary&#xD;
      and that can enhance the outpatient patient experience will facilitate access to quality&#xD;
      oncology care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of cancer cases requiring chemotherapy is on the rise in North America. About 84%&#xD;
      of chemotherapy treatments are administered by nurses in a outpatient clinic context.&#xD;
      Although outpatient oncology care are generally associated with a significant improvement in&#xD;
      the quality of life in cancer patients, one-third of patients believe that health&#xD;
      professionals (including nurses) are not doing everything in their power to comfort or&#xD;
      relieve discomfort during chemotherapy treatments. Among the known elements for enhancing the&#xD;
      well-being of oncology outpatients, comfort talk (CT) has been found to be very effective.&#xD;
      Indeed, CT is a simple and direct form of conversation that is inspired by the principles of&#xD;
      clinical hypnosis. While the soothing mechanisms of CT are poorly understood, involvement of&#xD;
      cortical regions involved in the modulation of emotions and pain is suggested in several&#xD;
      neuroimaging studies.This pilot trial serves as a proof of concept and aims to explore&#xD;
      whether CT can be used by nurses to optimize the perception of emotional support and physical&#xD;
      comfort during outpatient chemotherapy treatments. To do this, patients enrolled in a&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment cycle will be recruited during a visit to the oncology outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. Half of the patients will be assigned to enhanced routine care with an CT&#xD;
      intervention and the other half will receive routine care without CT. If there is an overlap&#xD;
      between CT mechanisms and those involved in the endogenous control of emotions and pain, a&#xD;
      significant interaction of these elements on the well-being of patients during chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatments is expected. The results of this pilot trials will be used to justify and prepare&#xD;
      for a larger study to evaluate the effects of CT on cancer symptom management and treatment&#xD;
      at the outpatient clinic.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This pilot trials will be conducted simultaneously in two outpatient oncology clinics located in the Montreal area: 1) Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, and 2) Hôpital de Saint-Eustache. These sites have been selected has they share the same hemato-oncologists, ensuring some consistency in treatment protocols. Site 1 will serve as the experimental site (combining CT with current care) and site 2 will serve as the control site (current care only).</intervention_model_description>
