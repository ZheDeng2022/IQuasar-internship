      Monocentric feasibility study for a new device for the treatment of anal fissure with&#xD;
      botulinum toxin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anal fissure is a common anal disease. This is a longitudinal tear in the distal part of the&#xD;
      anal canal. The fissure provokes a spasm of the internal anal sphincter and as such pain and&#xD;
      eventually bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently 3 different treatments. All available treatments tend to relax the anal&#xD;
      sphincter, which reduces pain and promotes fissure healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first treatment consists in the local application of cream into the anal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second option is the injection of botulinum toxin into the internal or external anal&#xD;
      sphincter. Finally the third option is a surgical intervention, most frequently a lateral&#xD;
      sphincterotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the usefulness of botulinum toxin to treat anal fissure has been demonstrated, the&#xD;
      results vary. This is most likely largely due to the fact that there is no standardized way&#xD;
      to inject botulinum toxin and that there is a significant learning curve. In addition, the&#xD;
      gesture is not without risk for the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of injecting botulinum toxin into the&#xD;
      anal canal with a new medical device for patients with anal fissure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a mono-centric pilot study conducted on 4 patients. The study is open,&#xD;
      prospective and all patients will be treated with the botulinum toxin injected using the new&#xD;
      medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device (single-use) under investigation and the botulinum toxin will be made available&#xD;
      free of charge to the patient.&#xD;
