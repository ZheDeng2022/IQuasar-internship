  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MANDATE-AF study was designed to address evidence needs in India for device-based&#xD;
      management of AF using AT/AF (Atrial Tachycardia/Atrial fibrillation) diagnostic features and&#xD;
      therapies such as Reactive Atrial anti tachycardia Pacing (rATP) within Medtronic Cardiac&#xD;
      Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED)and its impact on the time to persistent AF and&#xD;
      progression of AT/AF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New generation Cardiac Implantable Electronic devices (CIED's)such as Pacemakers, Implantable&#xD;
      Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) has diagnostic&#xD;
      and treatment delivery features which helps in slowing the progression of Atrial&#xD;
      Fibrillation. A Study conducted in Europe, called the MINERVA Trial, showed the efficacy of a&#xD;
      feature within Medtronic CIED's called (rATP)™, in the termination of abnormal rhythms by&#xD;
      pacing stimuli, and clinical benefit in reducing incidence of Atrial Fibrillation. However,&#xD;
      there is dearth of local evidence of this within the Indian population and also a need to&#xD;
      show that turning on rATP does not compromise on battery depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MANDATE-AF study is a prospective , Interventional , Randomized, single blind study&#xD;
      aiming to show that a reduced sequence programming of this rATP therapy ,can improve device&#xD;
      battery longevity and is as effective as the Minerva trial ATP programming when it comes to&#xD;
      showing its impact on time to persistent AF and on the progression of AT/AF within the Indian&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study analyses patients implanted with a Medtronic cardiac implantable device with an&#xD;
      atrial lead and equipped with atrial ATP therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an interventional arm including patients with a conservative atrial ATP therapies&#xD;
           programming setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a control, arm including patients with the same atrial ATP therapies programming setting&#xD;
           adopted in the Minerva Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular events will be collected prospectively for at least 24 months after&#xD;
      enrollment. Physicians will be recommended to schedule in clinic follow-up visits every 6&#xD;
      months and remote follow-up visits every 3 months in between. Every patient will be followed&#xD;
      for at least 24 months, until the last patient enrolled exits the study.&#xD;
