  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the neurological disorders that most often generates disability&#xD;
      in pediatric age. Children with CP have a very high nutritional risk since their motor&#xD;
      dysfunction causes coordination dysfunction in the processes of sucking, chewing and&#xD;
      swallowing, which lead to insufficient intake. There are other difficulties in relation to&#xD;
      feeding, such as the time required for feeding and the presence of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders. In addition, the families of children with CP develop different strategies that&#xD;
      allow them to face reality. This research plan seeks to investigate the relationships between&#xD;
      the nutritional status of children and adolescents with CP, food intake and family behavior&#xD;
      according to the strategies they develop. This study will be observational, cross-sectional&#xD;
      descriptive. The population will consist of children and adolescents from 2 to 18 years 11&#xD;
      months with a diagnosis of CP and their families attending health institutions in Córdoba.&#xD;
      The minimum sample size in 187 subjects was calculated for an expected prevalence of 25% of&#xD;
      feeding difficulties for an alpha 0.05 and a beta 0.20. It will be a successive sampling,&#xD;
      until the desired sample is completed. The variables studied will be: age, weight, height,&#xD;
      nutritional status, sex, type of CP, caloric and macro nutrient intake, type and feeding&#xD;
      time, clinical difficulties related to feeding and family strategies For data analysis,&#xD;
      normal continuous variables will be described in means with their standard deviations, with&#xD;
      non-normal distribution in medians with their interquartile ranges. The daily food intake and&#xD;
      macro nutrients will be calculated using the Food Analysis and Registration System software&#xD;
      (SARA1.2.25). The relationship between the average energy intake, the nutritional status of&#xD;
      children with CP and family strategies will be described. Interpretation of the data will be&#xD;
      carried out, showing the relationship between the different areas, analyzing the connectivity&#xD;
      of the ideas with the nutritional status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research was an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. The population was&#xD;
      made up of children and adolescents from 2 to 18 11 months years of age with CP diagnosis and&#xD;
      their families who attended public and private health institutions in the City of Córdoba. A&#xD;
      non-probability sequential sampling was carried out. The sample size was calculated for an&#xD;
      expected prevalence of at least 25% of nutritional deficit in children and adolescents with&#xD;
      CP to detect the strategies that predict good nutritional status with an odds ratio of at&#xD;
      least 2 in 94 patients (Ortega Calvo and Cayuela Dominguez 2002) The families were invited to&#xD;
      participate through the directors or managers of the educational centers or institutions.&#xD;
      They were communicated orally and then in writing what the project was about.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study included all children of both sexes from 2 to 18 years and 11 months with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of CP defined as a disability that describes a group of permanent developmental&#xD;
      disorders of movement and posture, which cause activity limitation, attributable to&#xD;
      non-progressive alterations that occur in the developing fetal or infant brain. CP motor&#xD;
      disorder is often accompanied by disturbances in sensation, perception, cognition,&#xD;
      communication, and behavior; due to epilepsy and secondary musculoskeletal problems, who&#xD;
      attend rehabilitation centers or public and private therapeutic educational centers in the&#xD;
      city of Córdoba and neighboring towns that agree to participate and whose parents, guardians&#xD;
      or caregivers sign the informed consent and want to participate. The CP diagnosis was taken&#xD;
      from the Unique Certificate of Disability and in those children who were not established, the&#xD;
      medical records were searched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality of the continuous data was tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and they&#xD;
      were reported as mean and standard deviations, while the non-normal distribution as medians&#xD;
      with their interquartile ranges. Discrete data were expressed in absolute frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages with 95% CI. The data that were non-parametric underwent a logarithmic&#xD;
      transformation for their conversion to parametric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional assessment, in accordance with the WHO reference parameters, was performed&#xD;
      using the WHO Anthro Plus V1.0.4 anthropometric assessment program which uses the official&#xD;
      WHO 2007 reference standards, providing accurate z-score values. Due to the fact that the&#xD;
      growth patterns of the WHO (2007) do not present weight-for-age data up to 18 years of age,&#xD;
      it was decided to use the Argentine references of the Argentine Society of Pediatrics,&#xD;
      standardizing the weight by sex and age (2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then a) Bivariate analysis will be carried out: The relationship between energy and&#xD;
      macronutrient intake, factors related to food and nutritional assessment of children with CP,&#xD;
      were analyzed using Chi-square tests with Fisher's test, t-test, or Mann-Whitney, as&#xD;
      applicable. Variables that were significant with a p value &lt;0.05 were placed in a&#xD;
      multivariate model. b) Multivariate analysis: A multiple logistic regression model was used&#xD;
      to identify significant predictors for adequate caloric and macronutrient intake, adjusted&#xD;
      for sex, age, and CP severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of nutrition in patients with CP is an emerging field that has not yet been&#xD;
      developed in our country, for which this work plan seeks to develop methodologies that&#xD;
      promote social inclusion by making substantial and necessary contributions to improve the&#xD;
      treatment and quality of life of children and adolescents with CP.&#xD;
