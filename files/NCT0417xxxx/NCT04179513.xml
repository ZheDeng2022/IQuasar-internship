    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of multiple abdominal subcutaneous injection of GB224 in&#xD;
      combination with oral methotrexate in Chinese patients with moderate and severe active&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis in two dose groups; the secondary objectives are to preliminarily&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical efficacy such as ACR20 at week 32, ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 at weeks 12&#xD;
      and 24, ACR50 and ACR70 at week 32, and DAS28 at weeks 12, 24 and 32 of multiple abdominal&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of GB224 in combination with oral methotrexate in Chinese patients&#xD;
      with moderate and severe active rheumatoid arthritis in two dose groups as well as to&#xD;
      preliminarily understand the immunogenicity and changes in pharmacodynamic variable (IL-6) of&#xD;
      multiple abdominal subcutaneous injection of GB224 in combination with oral methotrexate in&#xD;
      Chinese patients with moderate and severe active rheumatoid arthritis in two dose groups.&#xD;

             joints): swelling of 4 or more joints; tenderness of 6 or more joints; at least one of&#xD;
             the following criteria is met: erythrocyte sedimentation rate &gt;28mm/h or C-reactive&#xD;
             protein &gt;10mg/L (1.0mg/dL);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who have been treated with MTX treatment for at least 12 weeks before the&#xD;
             before the use of investigational products and the dose remains stable (10~15mg/week)&#xD;
             for at least 4 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The following DMARDs except MTX (including but not limited to chloroquine,&#xD;
