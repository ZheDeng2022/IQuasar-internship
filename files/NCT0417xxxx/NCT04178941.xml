  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to measure the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of&#xD;
      audit and feedback with educational outreach as a strategy to align continuous pulse oximetry&#xD;
      use in stable bronchiolitis patients with evidence and guideline recommendations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous pulse oximetry (SpO2) monitoring has revolutionized detection of oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation in operating rooms and other high-risk areas, improving outcomes in those&#xD;
      settings. However, research suggests that overuse of continuous SpO2 monitoring in stable&#xD;
      children with bronchiolitis who are unlikely to benefit from it is low-value care that places&#xD;
      some children at risk of adverse outcomes. Despite national guidelines discouraging&#xD;
      continuous pulse oximetry use in stable bronchiolitis patients, 46% of those infants and&#xD;
      children are continuously monitored. This pragmatic, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm&#xD;
      feasibility pilot will be performed on non-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospital units that care&#xD;
      for bronchiolitis patients. The primary subjects are hospital staff who order or manage&#xD;
      continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for bronchiolitis patients; secondary subjects are&#xD;
      patients age 2 through 23 months with a primary diagnosis of bronchiolitis.&#xD;
