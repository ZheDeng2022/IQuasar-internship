      Older adults at risk for dementia show a variety of cognitive deficits, which can be&#xD;
      ameliorated by different cognitive training (CT) exercises. The best combination of CT&#xD;
      exercises is unknown. The aim is to discover the most efficacious combination of CT exercises&#xD;
      as compared to cognitive stimulation (which will serve as a stringent, active control) to&#xD;
      modify the functional trajectories of older adults' with MCI, who are at high risk for&#xD;
      dementia. The primary objective of the U01 phase is to design and pilot-test an adaptive,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) of cognitive training (CT) combinations aimed to enhance&#xD;
      performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among persons with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI). The longitudinal endpoint goal is reducing incident dementia. The&#xD;
      primary aim of the study is to determine which CT combination has the best probability to&#xD;
      delay dementia by producing the largest IADL improvements. The study further aims to explore&#xD;
      neuroimaging and novel blood-based biomarkers.&#xD;

      Planning an Adaptive Clinical Trial of Cognitive Training to Improve Function and Delay&#xD;
      Dementia: The ACTIVE MIND Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the U01 phase, the primary objective is to design and pilot-test an adaptive, randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) of cognitive training (CT) combinations aimed to enhance performance of&#xD;
      instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among persons with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI). The longitudinal endpoint goal is delaying dementia onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the U01 phase are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To pilot test a plan to recruit and enroll under-represented minorities with the goal of&#xD;
      obtaining a sample representative of the USF population in race and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With additional funding and extension of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the efficacy of promising combinations of CT exercises to modify functional&#xD;
           trajectories in MCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the efficacy of promising combinations of CT to delay dementia onset&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore blood-based biomarkers as outcomes of CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore change in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3 (ADNI-3) MRI&#xD;
           protocol for neuroimaging to quantify brain structure, white matter hyperintensities&#xD;
           (WMH), hippocampal size, cerebral microbleed and perfusion, white matter integrity, and&#xD;
           resting state function as an effect of CT interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The design is an adaptive randomized trial to identify the best combination of CT&#xD;
      exercises to improve IADL function and thereby delay dementia onset among persons with MCI.&#xD;
      Four arms of CT will be compared to an active control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Determine which combinations of CT are efficacious to improve IADL performance, and&#xD;
      thereby most likely to reduce incident dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyday Function measures will include: Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and&#xD;
      iFunction. A composite of performance (measured by time and accuracy) will be derived from&#xD;
      principal component analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognition measures will include: Useful Field of View test (UFOV), Graduated Continuous&#xD;
      Performance Test (gradCPT), and Examiner. A composite will be derived from principal&#xD;
      component analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Duration Four combinations of computerized cognitive training and an active&#xD;
      control computerized stimulation will be investigated. The five arms will be equivalent in&#xD;
      terms of frequency and duration of each session (60 min/day, two-three days/wk, 16 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: In-person screening of 100 potential study participants are planned to enroll up&#xD;
      to 60 participants. The goal is to have at least 60 participants complete the U01 phase of&#xD;
      the study. Individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MCI will be included in the study.&#xD;
