  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study, data from patients treated with the antibiotic ceftobiprole in&#xD;
      the past will be collected. The sponsor of the study is Correvio International SÃ¡rl, based in&#xD;
      Switzerland. Correvio has committed to the health authorities to obtain further information&#xD;
      on possible side effects especially in patients suffering from impaired liver or renal&#xD;
      function or immune system deficiency and compare these effects to the ones observed in&#xD;
      patients without these health problems. Patient data are collected from historic patient&#xD;
      charts, patients will not be treated for the purpose of this data collection. All efforts are&#xD;
      being made to capture the data of all patients who meet the inclusion criteria and have&#xD;
      received at least one dose of ceftobiprole since this drug was first prescribed at the site.&#xD;

      Rationale and background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ceftobiprole is a beta-lactam antibiotic with bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum&#xD;
      of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, that was developed to treat patients with&#xD;
      pneumonia both in a hospital or community setting. Clinical trials were conducted in adult&#xD;
      immune-competent patients with normal or mild to moderate renal or hepatic function&#xD;
      impairment. The clinical trial program completed to date has excluded patients with immune&#xD;
      suppression and significant organ function impairment (hepatic or renal). The safety profile&#xD;
      of ceftobiprole in these patient groups was recognized during the marketing authorization&#xD;
      procedure as important missing information and the applicant committed to conduct a post&#xD;
      authorization safety study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized Phase 3 study in the indication of acute bacterial skin and skin structure&#xD;
      infections (ABSSSIs) is completed (NCT03137173), and a randomized Phase 3 study in the&#xD;
      indication of S. aureus bacteremia is ongoing (NCT03138733). This retrospective chart review&#xD;
      is conducted to further evaluate the safety profile of ceftobiprole in patient populations&#xD;
      with specific risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the proportion and the relative frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) and adverse event of special interest will be assessed in patients treated with&#xD;
      ceftobiprole and who have at least one of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impaired renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impaired hepatic function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events occurring after first study-drug administration,&#xD;
      up to 28 days after the completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events of Special Interest are the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyponatraemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatobiliary disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal toxicity (including potential interactions with nephrotoxic drugs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coombs test (DAT) positivity + clinical evidence of haemolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pseudomembranous colitis / C. difficile colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Convulsions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observed frequency of adverse events and adverse events of special interest in patients&#xD;
      with the above risk factors will be compared to the frequency of these adverse events and&#xD;
      adverse events of special interest in patients without these risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll patients in whom treatment with ceftobiprole has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient charts will be selected from hospital sentinel sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient observation would normally be planned for 28 days after completion of ceftobiprole&#xD;
      therapy. If, at the time of the review of any patient medical records, an AE has not been&#xD;
      resolved, these patients would be followed up until resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would continue until the target number of patients has been reached. The end date&#xD;
      of this study would be set at the date of the last patient record review, or in cases where&#xD;
      follow-up is extended beyond this period, until the end of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be identified from the patient charts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Year of birth and gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attribution to a specific population group (see inclusion criteria) and criteria to&#xD;
           assign the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start date of ceftobiprole&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stop date of ceftobiprole and main reason for stopping (if known)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescribed dose/regimen at treatment start&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in dose during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevant medical history (diagnosis within 1 year prior to treatment start)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigations undertaken as part of routine clinical practice and management&#xD;
           of the patient related to the outcomes of interest, e.g., serum sodium, AST (aspartate&#xD;
           aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), serum albumin, total bilirubin, GGT&#xD;
           (gamma-glutamyltransferase) and AP (alkaline phosphatase), prothrombin time, INR&#xD;
           (international normalized ratio), creatinine, haemoglobin, HCT (hematocrit), Coombs&#xD;
           (DAT), C. difficile toxin tests prior (within 1 month) and up to 28 days after&#xD;
           completion of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Findings of colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy (for C. difficile colitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medication at baseline and up to 28 days after completion of treatment with&#xD;
           focus on new onset use or dose modification of medications to treat&#xD;
           hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, convulsions, or C. difficile colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment-emergent AEs (event reports up to 28 days after completion of treatment), with&#xD;
           focus on AEs of special interest (AESIs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and cause(s) of death (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use during pregnancy (with follow-up until delivery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use data from patient charts, which includes physician and nurse notes,&#xD;
      admission and discharge summaries, consultancy reports, laboratory test sheets, and&#xD;
      microbiology sheets.&#xD;
