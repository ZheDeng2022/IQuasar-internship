  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood&#xD;
      and an important cause of acquired disability in children . Despite the heterogeneity, all&#xD;
      forms of JIA are characterized by prolonged synovial inflammation that can cause cartilage&#xD;
      and bone damage, with severe impairment of physical function and impact on the quality of&#xD;
      life. The presence of joint involvement in JIA may be expressed by ultrasonography findings&#xD;
      such as synovial proliferation, effusion, cartilage thinning and bone erosions. US has&#xD;
      demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting synovitis compared to clinical examination MSUS&#xD;
      is commonly regarded as a very useful tool in children, as outlined by the results of recent&#xD;
      national and international surveys among pediatric rheumatologists .For most of the&#xD;
      respondents, MSUS owned particular relevance for the ability to detect subclinical synovitis&#xD;
      and to improve the classification of patients in JIA subtypes, as guidance to intraarticular&#xD;
      corticosteroid injections and for capturing early articular damage. In addition, some&#xD;
      specific joints were considered as most suited to be studied by MSUS, specifically the&#xD;
      midfoot, the ankle, the hip, the wrist, the small joints of hands and feet. .&#xD;
