    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose,&#xD;
      dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of&#xD;
      PBCAR269A, with or without nirogacestat, in adults with r/r MM. Study subjects in Cohort A&#xD;
      will receive PBCAR269A and study subjects in Cohort B will receive PBCAR269A and&#xD;
      nirogacestat. At each dose level, study subjects in Cohort A and Cohort B will receive the&#xD;
      same dose of PBCAR269A. In Cohort B, all study subjects will follow the same dosing regimen&#xD;
      of nirogacestat.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose,&#xD;
      dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of&#xD;
      PBCAR269A, with or without nirogacestat, in adults with r/r MM. Before initiating the study&#xD;
      treatment PBCAR269A, all study participants will be administered lymphodepletion&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The initial lymphodepletion chemotherapy regimen will be composed of&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide during the Screening Period. Study subjects in Cohort B will&#xD;
      also receive nirogacestat. On Day 0 of the Treatment Period, study participants will receive&#xD;
      a single intravenous (IV) infusion of PBCAR269A. All subjects are monitored during the&#xD;
      treatment period through Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR269A, with or&#xD;
      without nirogacestat, will be followed in a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) study for 15&#xD;
      years after exiting this study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In Phase I, 3 escalating dose groups will be enrolled and treated sequentially, with the possibility of a single de-escalation. Within each dose group, at least 3 and at most 6 study participants will be treated with a single dose of PBCAR269A using a standard 3 + 3 design. The starting dose of PBCAR269A will be 6 x 105 CAR T cells/kg body weight. Subsequent dose groups will be treated with escalating doses to a maximum dose of 6 x 106 CAR T cells/kg. In the absence of DLTs, the dose will be increased using a fixed-dose scheme.</intervention_model_description>

The ORR is defined as the proportion of study participants meeting the definition of response within the study population to the response evaluable population. ORR will be summarized by number and percentage of study participants meeting the definition of ORR along with the corresponding exact 95% CIs. DoR, defined as the duration (days) from initial response to disease relapse, progression, or death will be descriptively analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The number of study participants achieving DoR at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months will also be calculated. Exploratory efficacy analyses include changes from Baseline in CBC counts, CAR T cells, cytokines, and CRP levels.</description>
