  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a relatively rare type of malignant tumor with an incidence of&#xD;
      1-2/100000. For unresectable or widely disseminated advanced STS, a combined clinical trial&#xD;
      is the best way to obtain evidence-based medical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anlotinib, a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is effective for various&#xD;
      histological types of STS and the safety is tolerable. TKIs may reverse drug resistance or&#xD;
      inefficiency of immunoassay inhibitors, and combination therapy has shown preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy in a variety of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the poor prognosis of refractory and advanced STS, there is no standard&#xD;
      second-line treatment. Therefore, combined therapies based on the original targeted drugs&#xD;
      would be paid more concentrations in the future. We focus on exploring the feasibility of&#xD;
      combination of anlotinib and Toripalimab monoclonal antibody in advanced, refractory and&#xD;
      progressive soft tissue sarcoma after failure of standard treatment, and look forward to&#xD;
      further improving the efficacy of soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a relatively rare type of malignant tumor. For patients with&#xD;
      recurrent/distant metastasis/unresectable advanced soft tissue sarcoma, chemotherapy with&#xD;
      doxorubicin and ifosfamide is the standard treatment, but the effect is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted drugs represented by anti-angiogenesis targeted drugs have had certain clinical&#xD;
      benefits in the treatment of sarcoma. Among them, anlotinib, a multi-target receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor, is effective for STS of various tissue types and the safety is tolerable.&#xD;
      Previous clinical studies have found that anlotinib has a certain effect on a variety of&#xD;
      solid tumors including thyroid cancer, lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, and kidney cancer.&#xD;
      In 2016, a phase II clinical study evaluated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib advanced&#xD;
      STS, especially synovial sarcoma and alveolar soft tissue sarcoma. The study included 154&#xD;
      patients with evaluable efficacy, with an ORR of 10.13% and a median PFS of 5.63 months. Even&#xD;
      so, the limited efficacy of targeted drugs remains a bottleneck. For advanced unresectable or&#xD;
      widely disseminated soft tissue sarcomas, a combined clinical trial is the best way to obtain&#xD;
      evidence-based medical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, anti-PD-1 antibodies have been reported as effective treatment in solid&#xD;
      tumors, and their clinical application has become increasingly widespread. The anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody Toripalimab has also been listed recently, and its clinical application prospects&#xD;
      are huge. Anti-PD-1 antibodies also have been proved effect better in combination with&#xD;
      targeted therapies. Multiple in vitro studies have shown that low-dose anti-angiogenesis&#xD;
      targeted drugs can reduce hypoxia, increase CD8+ T cell infiltration, reduce tumor-associated&#xD;
      macrophage (TAM) recruitment in non-small cell lung cancer and reduce tumor and serum. The&#xD;
      level of TGF-Î² is increased, thereby enhancing the anti-PD-1 antibody effect and&#xD;
      significantly inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. At the same time, by evaluating the&#xD;
      therapeutic effects of combination therapy in other tumors, we aim to investigate that&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis targeted drugs combined with anti-PD-1 antibodies have considerable&#xD;
      potential for sarcoma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, a number of clinical trials of anti-angiogenesis targeted drugs combined with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody for tumor treatment are underway or will be carried out, but the clinical&#xD;
      study of anti-PD-1 antibody with anlotinib has not yet started. In response to the above&#xD;
      problems, the aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and to assess the safety of&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody in the treatment of refractory and advanced STS patients with first-line&#xD;
      treatment failure, which would provide patients with STS better treatment options.&#xD;
