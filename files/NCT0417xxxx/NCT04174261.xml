  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) reduces periprocedural myocardial injury (PMI) after&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) through various pathways, including an&#xD;
      adenosine-triggered pathway. Ticagrelor inhibits adenosine uptake, thus may potentiate the&#xD;
      effects of RIPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized trial tested the hypothesis that ticagrelor potentiates the effect of RIPC&#xD;
      and reduces PMI, as assessed by post-procedural troponin release&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often complicated by peri-procedural myocardial&#xD;
      injury, with widespread adoption of sensitive cardiac biomarkers assays allowing detection of&#xD;
      smaller amounts of myocardial necrosis (1, 2). Peri-procedural cardiac troponin elevation has&#xD;
      been associated with new irreversible myocardial injury, detected by delayed-enhancement&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (3), and even though the prognostic significance of&#xD;
      peri-procedural cardiac troponin elevation has been highly debated (4), several studies have&#xD;
      reported that peri-procedural injury is associated with worse prognosis (5, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-procedural myocardial injury attenuation is expected to improve cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
      following PCI, and this could be achieved through such cardioprotective interventions as&#xD;
      ischemic preconditioning (IPC) (2). Converging experimental and clinical evidence suggests&#xD;
      that the long-established therapeutic potential of remote IPC or ischemic perconditioning may&#xD;
      find clinical use in the setting of elective PCI or ST-elevation myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (MI)(7-9). Nevertheless, recent clinical trials suggest that the cardioprotective effect of&#xD;
      remote IPC is moderate (10, 11), thus demonstrating the need to explore methods to augment&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ischemic conditioning signal is considered a summation of signals derived from multiple&#xD;
      disparate receptor-ligand interactions, which reaches a threshold once sufficient combined&#xD;
      signals are generated (12, 13). Adenosine, with its plasma levels increasing after cellular&#xD;
      stresses and ischemia, is a crucial trigger of the preconditioning cascade (14), however it&#xD;
      is rapidly taken up by cells through sodium-independent equilibrative nucleoside transporters&#xD;
      (ENT 1/2) and sodium-dependent concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNT 2/3) (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental data suggest that ticagrelor inhibits cellular reuptake of adenosine, thereby&#xD;
      increasing systemic and tissue adenosine levels (15-17). Moreover, the antiplatelet effects&#xD;
      of ticagrelor have been shown to be partly mediated by increased extracellular adenosine&#xD;
      levels and ticagrelor enhances the hyperemic response to adenosine (16, 18). Clinical&#xD;
      evidence suggests that in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) ticagrelor treatment&#xD;
      is associated with higher adenosine levels and an augmentation of coronary blood flow&#xD;
      velocity in response to adenosine (19, 20). The investigators hypothesized that ticagrelor&#xD;
      treatment would potentiate the effects of remote IPC and would thereby reduce peri-procedural&#xD;
      myocardial injury and the incidence of post-PCI MI.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The TRIP study was a randomized, assessor-blind, active comparator-controlled, clinical trial using a 2Ã—2 factorial design, with 1:1 patient allocation to ticagrelor or clopidogrel and within each treatment a 1:1 allocation to RIPC or control.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patient randomization in the ticagrelor and the clopidogrel group took place using sealed, opaque envelopes containing a computer-generated randomization scheme. Using a similar procedure, patients were then randomly assigned to RIPC or no RIPC within 1 hour before the procedure.</masking_description>

    <description>The primary outcome measure of the study was deltaTnI, defined as the difference between cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels at 24 hours post-PCI and cTnI levels before the procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peri-procedural MI (type 4a MI)</measure>

    <description>The prevalence of peri-procedural MI (type 4a MI) according to the third universal definition of MI (5xULN) was a secondary endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Chest pain during PCI: analog 10-point scale</measure>
    <time_frame>During the PCI procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Chest pain during PCI was assessed at the post-PCI clinical examination of the subject by an appropriately qualified person, who was unaware of patient's treatment allocation. An analog 10-point scale was used (0: no pain, 10: most severe discomfort ever experienced).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ST-segment deviation during PCI</measure>
    <time_frame>During the PCI procedure</time_frame>
    <description>ST-segment deviation during PCI was monitored by an appropriately qualified person, who was unaware of patient's treatment allocation. It was defined as the absolute value of ST-segment deviation at 60-80ms after the J-point in mm at the beginning of coronary angiography minus ST-segment deviation at 60-80ms after the J-point in mm during balloon occlusion.</description>
