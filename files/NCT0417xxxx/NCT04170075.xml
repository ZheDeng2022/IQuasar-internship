    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well whole body vibration works in improving the health and&#xD;
      functioning of participants with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy is a condition caused by exposure to chemotherapy drugs that may involve&#xD;
      numbness/tingling and/or pain in the hands and feet, which can have adverse effects on daily&#xD;
      life. Whole body vibration may cause weight loss and improve mobility and pain levels in&#xD;
      cancer survivors who report symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the feasibility and safety of whole body vibration (WBV) in adult cancer&#xD;
      survivors with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the effect of WBV training on physical functioning in adult cancer survivors&#xD;
      with CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore the effect of WBV training on symptom relief (neuropathy symptoms, pain,&#xD;
      fatigue) and readiness to exercise in adult cancer survivors with CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (WBV): Participants complete two 10-minute WBV sessions per day, 7 days per week for&#xD;
      12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (USUAL CARE [UC]): Participants receive usual care and keep their same physical&#xD;
      activity or dietary habits over 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by the Physical Performance Battery (PPB) to determine a person's ability to perform daily tasks independently. The PPB consists of 3 timed tests: 5 repeated chair stands, standing balance, and gait speed over 4 meters.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic changes in fatigue will be assessed using the PROMIS Fatigue Scale. This instrument includes 8 items rated on a 5 point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate worse fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 12 weeks</time_frame>

Severity is determined by the average of 4 items rated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Pain interference is determined by the average of 7 items rated from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the WBV group will participate in twice daily 10-minute WBV training sessions, 7 days a week. Each WBV session will consist of a series of timed stands on the vibration platform (Marodyne LiV). During a timed stand, participants will perform slow controlled weight shifting exercises and gentle squats. The vibration frequency will be set at 30Hz and the amplitude set at 50-200 microns, for a total body acceleration of 0.4g+/-20%.</description>
