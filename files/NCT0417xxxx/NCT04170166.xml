      This study aims to determine if there is any difference in terms of pain relief in patients&#xD;
      with shoulder subacromial pain syndrome, when given a steroid injection into the subacromial&#xD;
      space via an anterolateral approach compared to a posterior approach.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who present with subacromial pain syndrome (disorders such as subacromial bursitis,&#xD;
      rotator cuff tendinopathy, calcific tendinitis, subacromial inflammation with a partial&#xD;
      thickness rotator cuff tear) to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic are treated initially with&#xD;
      a subacromial steroid injection in addition to physiotherapy for a period of 3 months. This&#xD;
      applies to patients who have had no other treatments previously as well as to patients who&#xD;
      have had previous physiotherapy or steroid injections prior to presentation. Patients who do&#xD;
      not want to undergo the treatment offered are either treated with simple analgesia, sole&#xD;
      physiotherapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient with one of the above conditions agrees to go ahead with a steroid injection&#xD;
      followed by physiotherapy, the steroid injection is given at the earliest opportunity. The&#xD;
      steroid injection is given into the subacromial space either using the anterolateral&#xD;
      (front-side) approach (1 cm below and behind the anterior edge of the acromion with the&#xD;
      needle aiming towards the under surface of the acromion) or using the posterior (back-side)&#xD;
      approach ( 1cm inferior and medial to the posterlateral acromial edge with the needle&#xD;
      pointing towards the anterolateral aspect of the acromion). The exact approach is determined&#xD;
      according to the preference of the person carrying out the injection. As a routine we use a&#xD;
      10ml syringe containing 10mls of 0.25% Marcaine along with 40mg triamcinolone with an 18&#xD;
      gauge (green) needle. It is normal for patients to complain of some discomfort during the&#xD;
      injection. If a patient experiences any significant discomfort or they cannot tolerate the&#xD;
      injection for whatever reason, then the injection is discontinued and is not reattempted&#xD;
      using a different approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the injection, patients are questioned on any discomfort experienced during the&#xD;
      injection and on whether or not their pain has improved. They are then taken through a&#xD;
      protocol of physiotherapy for their shoulder over the subsequent 3 months. A protocol is&#xD;
      issued for guidance however therapists are allowed to use other modalities as per their&#xD;
      discretion. The frequency of appointments with physiotherapy will depend on patient's&#xD;
      symptoms as well as their progression. For study purposes a frequency record of these&#xD;
      meetings will be kept and matched to the overall OSS. Patients are seen routinely in 3 months&#xD;
      following an injection in order to assess any improvement in symptomatology using the OSS,&#xD;
      visual analogue score, DASH and SF36 questionaires. If the symptoms have improved then no&#xD;
      further intervention is taken. Further OSS, visual analogue pain score, DASH and SF36&#xD;
      questionaires will be posted out at 6 months and 1 year. On the other hand, if they are still&#xD;
      troubled with symptoms then the possibility of further injections or surgery is discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the two approaches that are currently used for&#xD;
      subacromial steroid injections, namely the anterolateral and posterior approach, with regards&#xD;
      to their effectiveness in improving shoulder symptoms. There will be no deviation from our&#xD;
      routine protocol other than randomising patients who agree to participate in this study to&#xD;
      either the anterolateral or posterior approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, it is patients who are seen in clinic with a subacromial pathology and&#xD;
      subsequently diagnosed with shoulder subacromial pain syndrome, who are offered an injection.&#xD;
      Those who agree to have an injection will then be invited to participate in the study. An&#xD;
      information leaflet will be given to all potential participants and they will be allowed&#xD;
      sufficient time to read through it, digest all the information and ask any questions they may&#xD;
      have before making a decision regarding their participation. Those who agree to participate&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated, using sealed envelopes to one of the two approaches for the&#xD;
      injection. The injection will then be administered via the selected approach by a clinician&#xD;
      who is qualified in carrying out the procedure. Patients will be asked about any discomfort&#xD;
      experienced during the injection, improvement in pain following the injection prior to&#xD;
      leaving hospital and overall satisfaction with the injection. Following this patients will&#xD;
      have physiotherapy as an outpatient as routine and will be seen at about 3 months post&#xD;
      injection for a further assessment at the clinic. Again the shoulder assessment will be&#xD;
      repeated on that occasion. Shoulder assessment questionaires will be posted out for&#xD;
      completion at 6 months and 1 year (OSS, pain on visial analogue scale, DASH and SF36) There&#xD;
      will be no change in patients care from routine practice other than the randomisation of the&#xD;
      approach used for the injection. Patients who are invited to participate in the study and&#xD;
      agree to participate will have their GP informed of their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to injection: assessment of pain using a visual analogue score, clinical&#xD;
           assessment of shoulder movement and completion of a modified Oxford Shoulder Score,&#xD;
           Disabilities of Shoulder, Arm and Hand questionaires and Short Form 36 Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 20-30 minutes Post injection: assessment of pain using a visual analogue score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prior to leaving hospital: pain experienced during the administration of the injection&#xD;
           and the overall satisfaction with the injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 3 months post injection: assessment of pain using a visual analogue score, clinical&#xD;
           assessment of shoulder movement and completion of a modified Oxford Shoulder Score,&#xD;
           Disabilities of Shoulder, Arm and Hand questionaires and Short Form 36 Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 6 months and 1 year post injection: assessment of pain using visual analogue score and&#xD;
           completion of a modified Oxford Shoulder Score, Disabilities of Shoulder, Arm and Hand&#xD;
           questionaires and Short Form 36 Health Survey via post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome for this study will be the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) at 3 months&#xD;
      post-injection. In addition to the standard OSS, the questionnaire will inquire about general&#xD;
      symptoms and signs, duration, hand dominance, previous injuries to the shoulder and previous&#xD;
      treatments to the shoulder. The follow up questionnaire will be identical to the initial&#xD;
      questionnaire but excluding questions on previous treatments, hand dominance, injuries and&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other demographics that will be recorded on the pre-designed pro forma include: number and&#xD;
      frequency of physiotherapy sessions pre and post injection, and subsequent need for further&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hard copies of data (questionnaires and forms) collected will be placed into the patient's&#xD;
      notes. At the same time this data will be recorded electronically on an Excel database and&#xD;
      saved on an encrypted, password protected memory stick. This memory stick will be stored in a&#xD;
      locked filing cabinet in the orthopaedic department at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. Please&#xD;
      note: The electronic data will contain NO identifiable information. Participants will be&#xD;
      identified by a unique study I.D number which can only be linked to them by members of the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
