  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover physiological study.&#xD;
      Designed to evaluate the effects of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) activation on brain&#xD;
      activity patterns and behavioural psychometric measures of sexual arousal during visual&#xD;
      erotic stimuli in approximately 40 right-handed, heterosexual, premenopausal women aged 18&#xD;
      years and over with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) for at least a 6 month duration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to recruit approximately 40 women to allow for subject and technical&#xD;
      drop-out, aiming for a minimum of 30 women in the final study who complete the full protocol&#xD;
      successfully. The investigators will collaborate with the Sexual Medicine clinic to identify&#xD;
      potential participants, as well as advertise via print (including local and regional&#xD;
      newspapers, transport network), radio and online advertisements. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will liaise with the local Clinical Research Network (CRN) to contact&#xD;
      potentially eligible patients via their General Practitioner (GP) surgery (via letter or text&#xD;
      message). Potential participants who contact us via advertisements will initially be&#xD;
      electronically sent a participant information sheet and self-report questionnaire, to be&#xD;
      returned via email. If, following this, they are happy to take part and no obvious exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are detected, they will be screened via telephone using a questionnaire. If&#xD;
      eligible, they will be invited for a formal screening interview, where further questions&#xD;
      regarding the study will be answered. After obtaining consent, a full medical and sexual&#xD;
      history will be taken as well as a review of the diagnosis of assessment, an ECG, urinalysis&#xD;
      to exclude pregnancy, clinical laboratory testing and completion of psychiatric and&#xD;
      psychosexual questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will then enter the Intervention phase. Participants will be randomised&#xD;
      (1:1) to one of two intervention sequences: a single dose of Bremelanotide or matching&#xD;
      placebo, administered subcutaneously. All participants will attend for two study visits each,&#xD;
      during which they will undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while&#xD;
      receiving either Bremelanotide or placebo. During the scan, participants will be presented&#xD;
      with visual erotic stimuli in order to activate the brain, so that Bremelanotide's modulation&#xD;
      of the melanocortin system can be measured. The participants will also be asked to use a&#xD;
      behavioural potentiometer whilst in the scanner to rate their degree of sexual arousal. The&#xD;
      crossover design, which allows participants to serve as their own control, will minimise&#xD;
      inter-participant variability. Participants will also be sent a short questionnaire 24-hours&#xD;
      after the study to assess the perceived duration of effect of Bremelanotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI data will be processed and analysed using current best practice methods, which will&#xD;
      include (but may not be limited to) application of the General Linear Model (GLM) for&#xD;
      neuroimaging data. Robust methods of correcting for multiple comparisons (e.g. permutation&#xD;
      testing) will be used for statistical analysis and thresholding of the statistical brain&#xD;
      images. Brain activation patterns will be presented by intervention and analysed by&#xD;
      whole-brain and region of interest (including amygdala, thalamus, posterior cingulate cortex&#xD;
      and entorhinal region. Correlations will be explored between brain activation and behavioural&#xD;
      data, corrected for visit order as appropriate (including Pearson and Partial Correlation&#xD;
      testing).&#xD;
