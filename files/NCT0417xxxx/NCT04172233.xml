      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and the preliminary efficacy of AK101，an&#xD;
      anti-IL-12/23p40 monoclonal antibody, when administered subcutaneously in subjects with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
