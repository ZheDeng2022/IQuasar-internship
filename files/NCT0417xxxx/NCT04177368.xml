      Normal growth can be divided into four important phases: prenatal, infantile, childhood and&#xD;
      pubertal. Nutrition is important at all phases of growth, but particularly so during the&#xD;
      infantile phase because the rate of growth is higher than at any other time of life and is&#xD;
      less dependent on growth hormone than during other phases. During the childhood phase, growth&#xD;
      becomes more dependent on the GH/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis; growth rate decelerates&#xD;
      continuously until the pubertal phase. The pubertal phase results from the coordination of GH&#xD;
      and sex steroid production. Together they have an anabolic effect on muscle mass, bone&#xD;
      mineralization and body proportions. It is another phase of rapid growth so that nutrition&#xD;
      can again modify the genetic growth potential.&#xD;

      Achieving an optimal nutritional status is essential for managing paediatric chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, and dietary guidance is frequently provided in clinical practice to achieve a&#xD;
      metabolic balance, which is vital for normal growth. Guidelines addressing optimal macro- and&#xD;
      micronutrient intake for children with CKD are available, with intake of sodium, potassium,&#xD;
      phosphorus, protein, and total calories being common targets of nutritional monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal nutrition can be defined as maintenance of normal growth and body composition.&#xD;
      Although it is agreed that nutritional assessment is important in chronic renal failure,&#xD;
      there is no single or easy definition or measure of inadequate nutritional status:&#xD;
      measurement of nutritional parameters are complicated in CRF because of salt and water&#xD;
      imbalances and the potential inappropriateness of using age matched controls in a population&#xD;
      that is short and may be delayed in puberty; it has been suggested that it is more&#xD;
      appropriate, therefore, to express measures relative to height age and/or pubertal stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition is common in hem dialysis patients and is a powerful predictor of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Although much progress has been made in recent years in identifying the causes and&#xD;
      pathogenesis of malnutrition in hemodialysis patients, as well as recognizing the link&#xD;
      between malnutrition and morbidity and mortality, no consensus has been reached concerning&#xD;
      its management. Along with such conventional interventions as nutritional counseling, oral&#xD;
      nutritional supplements, and dialectic parental nutrition, novel preventive and therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies have been tested, such as appetite stimulants, growth hormone, androgenic anabolic&#xD;
      steroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, with contradictory and non conclusive results.&#xD;
      Malnutrition still remains a great challenge for nephrologists in the third millennium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth failure is almost inextricably linked with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease.Growth failure in CKD has been associated with both morbidly and mortality .Growth&#xD;
      failure in the setting of kidney disease is multi factorial and is related to poor&#xD;
      nutritional status as well as co morbidities ,such as anemia, bone and mineral disorders, and&#xD;
      alterations in hormonal responses, as well as to aspects of treatment such as steroid&#xD;
      exposure. Initial reports of renal dwarfism date back to the turn of the twentieth century.&#xD;
      Despite advances in conservative treatment and renal replacement therapies, 30-60% of&#xD;
      patients with ESRD are short at adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoalbuminemia is the most powerful predictor of mortality in end-stage renal disease. Since&#xD;
      protein-calorie malnutrition can decrease albumin synthesis it is assumed that hypoalbu&#xD;
      minemia results principally from malnutrition in these patients, but albumin synthesis may&#xD;
      also be decreased as part of the acute-phase response, and hypoalbuminemia can also result&#xD;
      from redistribution of albumin pools or from albumin losses.Serum albumin has been identified&#xD;
      as a surrogate marker for nutritional status and morbidity / mortality in patients with&#xD;
      end-stage renal failure. Although serum albumin may be a reflection of nutrition, low levels&#xD;
      may be due to haemodilution, nephrotic syndrome or chronic infection / inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used assessment of nutrition is height and weight, along with head&#xD;
      circumference in younger children, plotted on percentile charts. Another way of expressing&#xD;
      the relative weight and height is the body mass index, which is important because extremes&#xD;
      are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Skin fold thickness is a measure of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat and mid-arm circumference is a reflection of muscle mass and may therefore&#xD;
      be more useful in determining body composition than the calculation of BMI alone.&#xD;
