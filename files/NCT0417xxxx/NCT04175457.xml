    <textblock>
      This is a human randomized controlled cross-over study where the effects of e-cigarette&#xD;
      inhalation (with or without nicotine) on vascular function, microcirculation and thrombosis&#xD;
      is assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-two healthy, female and male occasional smokers or snus users (age 18-55, 10&#xD;
      cigarettes per month, 10 pouches of snus per month) will be included. Research subjects are&#xD;
      required to refrain from intake of alcohol and caffeine during at least 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
      exposure. Tobacco usage (including Swedish moist snuff) or e-cigarette usage is not permitted&#xD;
      within 7 days prior to exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects have to complete a normal health declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized cross-over fashion, all subjects will inhale vapor (30 puffs for 30 minutes)&#xD;
      from one electronic cigarette, eVic-Primo SE (Shenzhen Joyetech Co., Ltd., China). in a&#xD;
      specially prepared room with adequate ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are plenty e-liquid manufacturers and distributors on the market. Independent content&#xD;
      analysis showed that nicotine variation across e-liquid batches is low and that the amount of&#xD;
      nicotine as stated by the manufacturer often is correct. E- liquid without any flavourings&#xD;
      (Valeo laboratories GmbH, Germany) without and with nicotine (19 mg/ml) will be used. Content&#xD;
      analysis is free available on the manufacturers homepage (http://www.e-liquid-wholesale.com).&#xD;
      A third-generation EC is used with settings (Temperature 230°C, Effect 32 W, Resistance 0,20&#xD;
      Ω).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research subjects are required to refrain from intake of alcohol during at least 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to the exposure sequences, as well as caffeine for 12 hours. The two occasions will be&#xD;
      separated by at least one week. Subjects rest for 15 minutes preceding the exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial 15 minute rest the measurements for various cardiovascular endpoints&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline and up to two hours following both exposures. This will be done&#xD;
      with the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of vascular function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photopletysmography (PPG) Arterial stiffness is an independent measure of vascular damage and&#xD;
      risk, and is best assessed with the gold-standard technique pulse-wave velocity (PWV).&#xD;
      However this method is technically demanding requiring special equipment (like SphygmoCor)&#xD;
      and educated study personell. Finger photoplethysmography, however, is potentially providing&#xD;
      the same information as PWV, and is ideal for continous measurment of arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      pulse propagation time (PPT), the interval from the systolic to the diastolic peak of the&#xD;
      pulse wave. PPT is an upcoming marker for arterial stiffness and vascular aging. At the same&#xD;
      time ECG and heat sounds by a microphone will be recorded making the analysis easier to&#xD;
      validate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculation Iontophoresis and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) Microcirculation is&#xD;
      assessed by a non-invasive method where two substances (acetylcholine and nitroprusside) is&#xD;
      applied in a small chamber (0,5 ml) on the surface of the skin. Changes in microcirculation&#xD;
      is measured with laser Doppler. The method is completely harmless and pain free. An uncommon&#xD;
      but plausible side effect is local temporary skin rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every heart-beat a pressure wave is generated reaching even the most peripheral parts of&#xD;
      the body. By measuring changes in light absorption it is possible to assess distensions (even&#xD;
      very small) in the peripheral arteries and arterioles in the subcutaneous tissue, in for&#xD;
      example the tip of the finger. Microcirculation can also be measured by laser speckle&#xD;
      contrast imaging (LSCI) which is a non-invasive completely pain free method for assessing&#xD;
      microcirculation of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure A semi-automatic oscillometric sphygmomanometer will be used to measure blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling Blood samples will be drawn into test tubes containing 1/10 0.129 M sodium&#xD;
      citrate, EDTA and serum at baseline, at 0 hour, 1 hour and 2 hours after exposure. Plasma is&#xD;
      later collected after centrifugation at 2 000g for 20 min in room temperature (RT) and then&#xD;
      frozen at -70°C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of thrombus formation (T-TAS) T-TAS® (Total Thrombus-formation Analysis System)&#xD;
      is a means of assessing thrombus formation during variable flow conditions using a small&#xD;
      blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of cotinine Levels of cotinine will be measured in serum using a commercial&#xD;
      available ELISA technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through direct microscopy of the capillaries of the nail bed of one of the fingers capillary&#xD;
      blood flow can be assessed (capillary blood cell velocity, CBV, mm/s). This is a completely&#xD;
      pain free and non-invasive method that takes about 15 minutes to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of MV Plasma is thawed and centrifuged at 2000g for 20 minutes at RT. The&#xD;
      supernatant is then re- centrifuged, at 13 000g for 2 minutes at RT. 20 μl of sample is&#xD;
      incubated for 20 minutes in dark with phalloidin-Alexa-660 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK),&#xD;
      lactadherin-FITC (Haematologic Technologies, Vermont, USA), CD42a-PE (Platelet-MP (PMP), BD,&#xD;
      Clone Alma-16), CD45- PC7 (Leukocyte-MV (LMV), Beckman Coulter, Dublin, Ireland) and&#xD;
      CD144-APC (Endothelial-MV (EMV), AH diagnostics, Stockholm, SWE). PMVs are also labeled with&#xD;
      CD154-PE (CD40L, abcam, Cambridge, UK) and EMVs with CD62E (E-selectin, Beckman Coulter,&#xD;
      Dublin, Ireland). MVs are measured by flow cytometry on a Beckman Gallios instrument (CA,&#xD;
      USA). The MV-gate is determined using Megamix beads (BioCytex, Marseille, France), which is a&#xD;
      mix of beads of with diameters of 0.5 μm, 0.9 μm and 3.0 μm, respectively. MVs are defined as&#xD;
      particles less than 1.0 μm in size, negative to phalloidin (in order to exclude cell membrane&#xD;
      fragments) and positive to lactadherin. Conjugate isotype- matched immunoglobulin (IgG1-FITC,&#xD;
      IgG1-PE, IgG1-APC and IgG1- PC7) with no reactivity against human antigens is used as a&#xD;
      negative control to define the background noise of the cytometric analysis. The absolute&#xD;
      number of MVs is calculated by means of the following formula: (MV counted x standard beads ⁄&#xD;
      L) ⁄ standard beads counted, (FlowCount, Beckman Coulter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether MVs are released due to activation or apoptosis MVs are labeled with&#xD;
      SYTO 13. SYTO 13 (Molecular Probes) is cell permeable and has a high fluorescent yield when&#xD;
      bound to DNA or RNA. Our hypothesis is that MVs released from apoptotic cells express more&#xD;
      DNA or RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pro-coagulant effect of MVs In vitro experiments are performed to investigate the influence&#xD;
      of MVs on thrombin generation, and the relative contribution of the negatively charged&#xD;
      surface provided by MVs. Briefly plasma samples are thawed and after the centrifugation steps&#xD;
      described above we further centrifuge the samples (twice 21 000g in 45 min, RT) to obtain an&#xD;
      MV enrich pellet. The pellet is then added to commercial plasma (Haemochrom, Diagnostica,&#xD;
      Essen, Germany) with no addition of TF or phospholipids. Thrombin generation in plasma is&#xD;
      determined by using the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) as originally described by&#xD;
      Hemker et al. The calculated area under the curve represents the total amount of thrombin&#xD;
      generated over time and is called the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). Time to the start&#xD;
      of thrombin generation (lag time), maximal concentration of thrombin generation (peak&#xD;
      thrombin) and time to maximal thrombin generation (time to peak thrombin) is also assessed in&#xD;
      CAT analysis.&#xD;
