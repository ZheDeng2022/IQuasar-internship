    <textblock>
      This study will consist of a randomized experimental group and a control group, In addition&#xD;
      to the control and experimental group, there will also be a non-randomized motivated&#xD;
      experimental group. Approximately 75 males and females from the ages of 18 to 80 will take&#xD;
      part in this study. Subjects will be randomly divided into a Control and Experimental Group.&#xD;
      Subjects for the control and experimental group will be recruited from a Tony Robbins&#xD;
      Facebook page, and subjects in the experimental group (DWD Group) will be admitted to the&#xD;
      Tony Robbins Date With Destiny Event (December 2019) in West Palm Beach for free, while the&#xD;
      subjects randomly assigned to the control group, will not attend the event, but instead be&#xD;
      required to a Gratitude Journaling experiment (Three Good Things Intervention). Psychological&#xD;
      assessment surveys will be taken before the event, directly after the event, and one month&#xD;
      following the event. The control group will take the psychological assessment before&#xD;
      beginning journaling, directly after completing journaling, and one month following&#xD;
      completion of journaling.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Pubmed or Google Scholar search reveals zero peer-reviewed articles examining Robbins'&#xD;
      events, techniques, or principles, despite Robbins' enormous impact on culture, psychology,&#xD;
      and individual lives. Furthermore, only poorly conceptualized studies testing clinically&#xD;
      irrelevant hypotheses were ever conducted on Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP), a&#xD;
      constitutive framework for part of Robbins' methodologies. Due to the intimate link between&#xD;
      beliefs, wellness, and disease, the investigators hypothesize that an intervention focused on&#xD;
      belief-restructuring, trauma release, psychoeducation, hope, inspiration, &amp; social support&#xD;
      like participation in a Tony Robbins' event (e.g. DWD) will demonstrate significant mental&#xD;
      and physical health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to obtain a better understanding of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether Tony Robbins' DWD improves affect, depression symptoms, and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Setup collaboration infrastructure and generate hypotheses for a future randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial to determine short- and long-term physiological and health effects of&#xD;
           Tony Robbins' interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tony Robbins, inventor of the term, life coach, and a coach to leaders around the world,&#xD;
      regularly sells out 14,000 person arenas worldwide to talk about psychology, mental health,&#xD;
      and wellbeing, and his website alone averages 1,000,000 unique visitors per month. Yet, a&#xD;
      literature search through PubMed &amp; Google Scholar reveals 0 empirical studies of Tony&#xD;
      Robbins' work. Considering patients prefer psychotherapy over medication, there are a rich&#xD;
      set of interventions to draw from Tony Robbins that could prove to be effective, accessible,&#xD;
      and affordable in treating &amp; preventing mental health issues including depression and&#xD;
      suicide. Understanding the science of Tony Robbins' work could provide new theoretical&#xD;
      frameworks and clinical interventions to inform non-pharmacological approaches to mental&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a randomized experimental group and a control group, In addition&#xD;
      to the control and experimental group, there will also be a non-randomized motivated&#xD;
      experimental group. Approximately 75 males and females from the ages of 18 to 80 will take&#xD;
      part in this study. Subjects will be randomly divided into a Control and Experimental Group.&#xD;
      Subjects for the control and experimental group will be recruited from a Tony Robbins&#xD;
      Facebook page, and subjects in the experimental group (DWD Group) will be admitted to the&#xD;
      Tony Robbins Date With Destiny Event (December 2019) in West Palm Beach for free, while the&#xD;
      subjects randomly assigned to the control group, will not attend the event, but instead be&#xD;
      required to a Gratitude Journaling experiment (Three Good Things Intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited by posting a Survey Monkey link on the DWD Facebook page as well&#xD;
      as via email and direct referral. All participants will complete a consent form and take a&#xD;
      brief eligibility survey administered digitally through Survey Monkey's secure system. Both&#xD;
      groups will be given surveys before DWD, immediately after DWD to assess acute changes, and&#xD;
      after 1 month after DWD to assess longitudinal changes. The experimental group will attend&#xD;
      DWD. After attending DWD, the experimental group will be asked to continue practicing&#xD;
      &quot;Priming &quot; daily for a month. A One-page &quot;priming&quot; cheat sheet will be given to the subjects&#xD;
      in the experimental group. The control group will be asked to engage in gratitude journaling&#xD;
      (protocol below) every day for a month. The control group will NOT attend the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third group called the Motivated Experimental Group (M Experimental) will consist of&#xD;
      participants who registered and paid for Tony Robbins Date with Destiny (DWD). They are&#xD;
      chosen as the motivated experimental as they will be paying full price for the event.&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited at the event, as well as through the facebook group. Two&#xD;
      investigators will follow up with subjects monthly by phone to assure consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surveys will be administered electronically through survey monkey. Informed Consent forms&#xD;
      will also be provided electronically to all subjects. All subjects that participate in this&#xD;
      study will receive a free book and audiobook, regardless of the group they were in upon&#xD;
      completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental Health (depression, anxiety, stress) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRBs will need to be Electronically Signed by all participants. All Variables will be&#xD;
      collected electronically over Survey Monkey. All questions will be extracted and worded&#xD;
      directly off of the physical copy of each questionnaire into Survey Monkey.&#xD;
