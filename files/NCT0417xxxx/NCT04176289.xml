      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed to investigate the effect of pupillary pain index (PPI)-guided&#xD;
      compared to non-PPI-guided postoperative pain therapy, conducted immediately at the end of&#xD;
      surgery, on total postoperative opioid consumption during the first 2 postoperative hours&#xD;
      after elective ENT surgery. Pupillometric pain measurements helps clinicians determine and&#xD;
      administer the optimized amount of opioids and so avoids opioid-induced side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of pain intensity during the immediate postoperative period in the operating&#xD;
      room (OR) is a key factor for post interventional pain treatment. However, this evaluation&#xD;
      may be difficult when patients are still intubated, restricted in consciousness or are&#xD;
      showing verbal impairment due to ENT surgery. Verbally impaired patients are at increased&#xD;
      risk of under treatment for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With rising opioid consumption, the risk of postoperative side effects like nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting, sedation with a longer recovery time or respiratory depression increases.&#xD;
      Especially in the cohort of ENT surgery patients, where a difficult airway is regularly&#xD;
      presented, such side effects should be avoided. A means of predicting immediate postoperative&#xD;
      pain after surgery and the response to opiate analgesics would therefore be highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pupillary dilatation reflex (PDR), measured by pupillometry, has been successfully used&#xD;
      to assess intraoperative analgesic component of anesthetic regimes and correlates with pain&#xD;
      intensity measured on a numeric rating scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim of this study is to investigate if a PPI-guided opioid administration immediately&#xD;
      postoperative in the OR leads to less opioid requirement during the first 2 postoperative&#xD;
      hours compared to a non-PPI guided treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim is to evaluate postoperative pain during the first 2 postoperative hours in&#xD;
      patients after PPI-guided versus non-PPI guided opioid therapy in the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis that through a targeted pain therapy based on the measurement of&#xD;
      immediate postoperative PPI score, opioid consumption and pain intensity can be reduced&#xD;
      during the first 2 postoperative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be done by observing postoperative pain intensity using pupillometry in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for elective ENT surgery, carrying out pain intervention (opioid therapy)&#xD;
      and re-observing to verify the effectiveness of the targeted postoperative opioid&#xD;
      administration in the OR. Pain on an 11-point verbal Likert response score and total opioid&#xD;
      consumption will be recorded by a blinded investigator at 30-minute intervals for the initial&#xD;
      2 postoperative hours.&#xD;

    <description>The pupillary dilatation reflex (PDR), induced by a standardized noxious stimulus will be measured as Pupillary Pain Index(PPI,11-point numeric scale, 0= no pain, 10= worst pain) determined with a portable pupillometer. Patients experiencing mild or more severe pain (PPI&gt; 3) will receive intravenous opioid titration (piritramid, 3 mg bolus steps) and PPI measurement performed before and after intravenous opioid titration.</description>
