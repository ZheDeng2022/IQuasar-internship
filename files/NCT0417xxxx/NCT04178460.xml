      This is a a Multicenter, Open-label, Single-arm, Phase Ib Dose Escalation and Multi-cohort&#xD;
      Expansion Clinical Study to Assess the Safety and Antitumor Activity of Niraparib in&#xD;
      Combination with MGD013 in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor Who Failed Prior&#xD;
      Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of dose escalation part and dose expansion part.'3+3'design will be&#xD;
      adopted in the dose escalation part in subjects with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer&#xD;
      who failed prior treatment. The dose of niraparib will be fixed and determined based on&#xD;
      baseline weight and platelet count of subjects. Dose expansion part will be expanded at the&#xD;
      specified dose level to further assess the safety and preliminary antitumor activity.&#xD;
