      Randomised cinical trial in demmita General Hospital.300 obese women pregnant with&#xD;
      gestational age &gt;38 wk ,theire age range from (25-35) years and BMI between (30 -40)&#xD;
      undergoing elective cesarean section were randomised into 3 groups (100 patients in each&#xD;
      group)and compare the role of subcutaneous tissue closure in post cesarean section wound&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3groups are: A- interrupted closure of subcutaneous tissue without drain. B-interrupted&#xD;
      closure of subcutaneous tissue with drain. C-non closure of subcutaneous tissue. All womenu&#xD;
      nder going CS with Pfannenstiel incision were considered to be eligible if time allowed&#xD;

&#xD;
      3groups are: A- interrupted closure of subcutaneous tissue without drain. B-interrupted&#xD;
      closure of subcutaneous tissue with drain. C-non closure of subcutaneous tissue. All womenu&#xD;
      nder going CS with Pfannenstiel incision were considered to be eligible if time allowed&#xD;
      informed consent before the surgery All surgical procedures were performed by obstetric and&#xD;
      gynecology residents under the supervision of attending physicians After the sequential&#xD;
      closure of the uterus and peritoneum, the fascia was closed with 2-0 polyglactin 910&#xD;
      (Vicryl). The depth of the subcutaneous adipose tissue was measured with a sterile ruler from&#xD;
      the fascia to the skin edge at the middle of the superior aspect of the skin incision.Women&#xD;
      with a subcutaneous tissue thickness of 4.0 cm or more were then formally enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized to one of the two subcutaneous closure techniques. Subcutaneous hemostasis was&#xD;
      achieved using electrocautery and skin was approximated&#xD;
&#xD;
      with subcuticular suture using 2-0 polyglactin910 (VicrylRapide). In the drain group, a&#xD;
      closed nonvacuum drain was inserted in the tissue and exited from the skin through a separate&#xD;
      opening and stitched to the skin. The subcutaneous tissue was sutured. Cautery was used for&#xD;
      hemostasis. The skin was closed with a continuous nonabsorbable polypropylene 2/0 (Acufirm;&#xD;
      Ernst Kratz, Germany) subcuticular sutures. Operative time was estimated from the start of&#xD;
      skin incision until the end of skin suturing. The drain was left until the drainage rate was&#xD;
      less than 50 ml/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomized women received standard postoperative wound care. Surgical dressing was&#xD;
      removed on the first postoperative and all participants were discharged 24 h after the CS.&#xD;
      The participants were invited to two follow-up in the first and second week post&#xD;
      operativewith regard to postoperative pain, postoperative fever, hospital stay duration,&#xD;
      wound infection, wound seroma, wound disruption, and the need for redressing. T he&#xD;
      postoperative pain was judged after 24 h using visual analogue scale, in addition any time&#xD;
      clinically indicated. Patients and physicians who assessed the incision postoperatively were&#xD;
      blinded towards the study group. The data of the patients who did not attend hospital for&#xD;
      examination were collected through telephone interview&#xD;
