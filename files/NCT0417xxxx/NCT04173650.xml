      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT: AGLE-102 is an allogeneic derived extracellular vesicle (EV) product&#xD;
      derived from normal donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDICATION AND RATIONALE: The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      AGLE-102 in the treatment of lesions in subjects with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, non randomized, multi-center, ascending dose, study to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-102 on lesions in subjects with EB.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, non randomized, multi-center, ascending dose, study to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-102 on lesions in subjects with EB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo a one-month observation period to confirm that the targeted&#xD;
      wound is chronic (only single wounds with evidence of less than 20% closure over that period&#xD;
      will be eligible for treatment). Once this has been established, up to 6 administrations of&#xD;
      BM-MSC EVs will occur, at each to be given over a period of no more than 3 months. A maximum&#xD;
      of 50 cm2 in total wound surface will be treated, and each administration will occur 14 days&#xD;
      (+/- 7 days) but no less than 7 days apart. If the wound closes prior to 6 administrations,&#xD;
      no additional doses will be given. Wound closure will be determined by complete&#xD;
      re-epithelialization that is not subject to re-injury during dressing changes or as a result&#xD;
      of normal daily activities (e.g. wearing clothing, eating, sleeping). After the 6 doses of&#xD;
      BM-MSC EVs are given, the wound will be followed monthly for a period of 4 months to the&#xD;
      termination of the study at 8 months or, in the event the wound closes before receiving all 6&#xD;
      doses, for 4 month after the wound closes. The ARANZ SilhouetteStarTM will be used to measure&#xD;
      the target lesion at all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to determine the safety of applying single&#xD;
      administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to DEB wounds&#xD;
      between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to determine the safety of applying&#xD;
      multiple administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to&#xD;
      DEB wounds between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month and to determine&#xD;
      if there is clinical benefit (&gt;50% closure) of applying BM-MSC EVs to DEB wounds&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANNED SAMPLE SIZE: 10 subjects will be treated on the protocol with AGLE-102.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The first 2 subjects must be 18 years or older at the time of signing the informed&#xD;
             consent. If approved by the SRC, additional subjects (after the first 2 subjects) may&#xD;
             be 6 years or older at the time of signing the informed consent; otherwise additional&#xD;
             subjects must be 18 years or older until such time it is considered by the SRC as&#xD;
             appropriate to lower the age limit to 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who have a confirmed diagnosis of DEB as determined by electron microscopy,&#xD;

             absent Col VII/no anchoring fibrils) and milder forms of DEB (e.g., RDEB patients with&#xD;
             reduced Col VII and/or anchoring fibril levels) will be eligible.&#xD;
