  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR) using immune RECIST (iRECIST) criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =&gt;30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is &gt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is &lt;30% decrease or &lt;20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR) using RECIST 1.1 criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the disease progression/recurrence based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants experiencing grade 3 or above drug-related toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>When calculating the incidence of adverse events (AEs), each AE (as defined by NCI CTCAE v5.0) will be counted only once for a given subject. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>
