      Subjects diagnosed with Endometriosis will be eligible for enrollment. During a Screening&#xD;
      Period of 2 weeks, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed to determine if they are&#xD;
      eligible to move into the Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Treatment, subjects will randomly receive either BOL-DP-o-08 or placebo TID for 16&#xD;
      weeks. At the end of the treatment, a follow-up visit for safety assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted 4 weeks after the termination visit.&#xD;
