  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pivotal study in patients admitted/visiting the cardiology ward and/or&#xD;
      outpatient clinics for various indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two stages. The first stage will comprise a pilot study with&#xD;
      10 subjects, which will be completed and analyzed prior to initiation of the second stage.&#xD;
      The two studies are independent and are included in the same protocol for logistical reasons.&#xD;
      The second stage of the study, which will include 120 subjects, is pivotal and intended to&#xD;
      validate the Gili BioSensor System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing procedure will include seating the subject in either a steady chair in front of a&#xD;
      table, or in bed with the bedrest raised in front of a cardiac table (or similar). The&#xD;
      subject will be seated for 5 minutes to reach a physiological steady state. During this time,&#xD;
      the subject will be connected to the reference device according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      guidelines. The investigational device will be placed on a stable surface in front of the&#xD;
      subject (table / cardiac table or similar) and will point to the left side of the subject's&#xD;
      chest. Both the investigational and reference devices will be temporally synchronized to&#xD;
      maintain coordinated recording. Following the 5-minute resting period, both investigational&#xD;
      and reference devices will be activated for a comparative recording session to acquire at&#xD;
      least 180 seconds (3 minutes) of evaluable data. Each 60-sec interval will be used separately&#xD;
      for comparative analyses.&#xD;

    <description>Heart rate will be compared to a reference:&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>During the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Gili BioSensor System functions without physical contact with the inspected subject, and is compared in this study to a reference device routinely used as standard of care (SOC). Consequently, we do not expect any safety issues. At the same time, any adverse events (AE) observed during the procedure and/or during the study and/or follow-up period will be recorded in the CRF.</description>
