      Pre-market, multi-center, international, double-blind, randomized, controlled, prospective,&#xD;
      first-in-human clinical investigation of a Class IIb Investigational Medical Device, in which&#xD;
      Patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (AUGIH) and due to undergo a&#xD;
      plasma transfusion, will be randomized to receive a one-time infusion (up to 8 hours) of up&#xD;
      to two 250 mL units of plasminogen-depleted plasma (PDP) or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of transfusions needing more than two units, the third unit and above will consist in&#xD;
      regular plasma for both treatment groups. Patients will be continuously monitored for 8 hours&#xD;
      following the transfusion, and will be assessed between 8-12 hours after plasma transfusion&#xD;
      or the following morning (the earlier of the two options), between 24-48 hours after plasma&#xD;
      transfusion or at discharge (the earlier of the two options) and after 30+/-3 days after&#xD;
      transfusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH) is one of the most common gastrointestinal&#xD;
      emergencies, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Acute upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage (AUGIH) management guidelines call for aggressive hemodynamic&#xD;
      resuscitation, prevention and treatment of complications and treatment of bleeding, which&#xD;
      generally includes endoscopic intervention and transfusion of appropriate blood components.&#xD;
      However, in many cases, spontaneous hyperfibrinolysis occurs, jeopardizing pharmacological&#xD;
      control of AUGIH. Antifibrinolytic drugs are considered effective in counteracting&#xD;
      hyperfibrinolysis, but are associated with various side effects, such as neurotoxicity and&#xD;
      accelerated fibrinolysis upon prolonged use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrin clot breakdown is actively mediated by plasmin, a serine protease which cleaves&#xD;
      fibrin. Administration of plasma depleted of plasminogen, the precursor of plasmin, may shift&#xD;
      the balance towards coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PlasFree Ltd. has developed ClearPlasma, a single-use, extracorporeal plasma filtration&#xD;
      device which extracts plasminogen from plasma to reduce fibrinolysis. The resulting&#xD;
      plasminogen-depleted plasma (PDP) is expected to reduce risk of fibrinolysis and re-bleeding&#xD;
      in Patients undergoing plasma transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Objective of this trial is to assess the safety profile of a one-time infusion of&#xD;
      up to two units of PDP obtained through filtration with ClearPlasma in Patients presenting&#xD;
      with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and to compare it to the same procedure carried&#xD;
      out using FFP units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of a one-time infusion of up&#xD;
      to two units of PDP obtained through filtration with ClearPlasma in the reduction of&#xD;
      re-bleeding in Patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (as a measure&#xD;
      of the performance of ClearPlasma) and to compare it to the same procedure carried out using&#xD;
      FFP units.&#xD;
