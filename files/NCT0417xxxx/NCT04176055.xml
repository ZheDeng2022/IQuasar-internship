      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the gastrointestinal (GI) system, the most well-described manifestation of prolonged&#xD;
      cannabis use is cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS is characterized by severe cyclic&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting and associated with abdominal pain.Currently, the generally accepted&#xD;
      management for CHS is complete cannabis abstinence as traditional anti-emetics appear to be&#xD;
      minimally effective. Preliminary reports from emergency departments suggest that intravenous&#xD;
      haloperidol, a typical anti- psychotic, provides effective symptomatic relief in CHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To learn more about how cannabis use relates to the management of CHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To learn if haloperidol is effective in treating the symptoms of CHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alberta residents with ongoing cannabis use, who have completed the baseline study, are ≥ 18&#xD;
      years and ≤ 65 years, and have gastrointestinal symptomology as measured by GCSI &gt; 2 or&#xD;
      PAGI-SYM &gt; 2 (upper or lower abdominal pain subscale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer a series of questionnaires online. Study specific questions relating&#xD;
      to symptoms, cannabis use, and anxiety and depression will be administered. Confirmation of&#xD;
      cannabis cessation will be assessed with urine creatinine and cannabis metabolite measures.&#xD;
      Salivary cortisol will be used to asses the stress response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the gastrointestinal (GI) system, the most well-described manifestation of prolonged&#xD;
      cannabis use is cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS is characterized by severe cyclic&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting and associated with abdominal pain.The pathophysiology of CHS is poorly&#xD;
      understood but may involve alterations gut motility and/or activation of the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our endogenous endocannabinoid system contains the cannabinoid receptor type I (CB1) and type&#xD;
      II (CB2), and their ligands, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG). CB1 receptors&#xD;
      are widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, including the&#xD;
      myenteric plexus of the GI tract. In humans, oral Δ9-THC (an active cannabis compound)&#xD;
      reduces gastric emptying and patients with slow transit constipation have increased&#xD;
      expression of endogenous endocannabinoids and higher CB1 receptor expression. In CHS, chronic&#xD;
      cannabis use may cause significant activation of peripheral, gut-located CB1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis, the main neuroendocrine system activated in&#xD;
      response to stressful stimuli may also be involved in CHS. Activation of centrally located&#xD;
      CB1 receptors by 2-AG plays a crucial role in down-regulating the HPA axis in recovery from&#xD;
      stress. Reduction in 2-AG activity within the hypothalamus by stress, leads to reduced&#xD;
      hypothalamic CB1 receptor activation; this reduced CB1 activation is also observed in&#xD;
      prolonged cannabis use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the generally accepted management for CHS is complete cannabis abstinence as&#xD;
      traditional anti-emetics appear to be minimally effective.Preliminary reports from emergency&#xD;
      departments suggest that intravenous haloperidol, a typical anti- psychotic, provides&#xD;
      effective symptomatic relief and has become a first-line agent for acute CHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints will look at the correlation between quantitative weekly cannabis use&#xD;
      and gastrointestinal symptoms at week 8 and the mean change of the GI symptoms from week 8 to&#xD;
      week 12 during.&#xD;
