    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive lethal disorders affecting&#xD;
      1:2.500 newborns among Caucasians. CF patients are peculiarly susceptible to infection and&#xD;
      colonization of the respiratory tract with pathogens. In particular, Methicillin-resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become the third most prevalent bacterium in CF in the U.S.&#xD;
      and has been increasing in other countries. Apart from the difficulty of treating the&#xD;
      infection because of its antimicrobial resistances, MRSA is transmissible between individuals&#xD;
      with and without CF. Chronic MRSA infection is associated with worse outcomes, and&#xD;
      treatment/eradication is challenging. Antibiotic dosing and choices should be optimized to&#xD;
      minimize further resistance and to maximize chances of successful therapy. Yet, MRSA has&#xD;
      several mechanisms to escape clearance by the immune system and antibiotic killing. For these&#xD;
      reasons, a better understanding of preventive measures and early therapy is of key&#xD;
      importance. In consideration of all these assessments there is an emerging consensus that&#xD;
      MRSA is an important pathogen in CF rather than simply a marker of severe disease. However,&#xD;
      to date there are no guidelines or recommendations on the choice of antibiotics for MRSA in&#xD;
      CF. Glycopeptides are an important class of antibiotics active against Gram-positive&#xD;
      pathogens. These include teicoplanin and vancomycin, which are currently in widespread use&#xD;
      and are active against MRSA. Teicoplanin is often preferred to vancomycin for intravenous&#xD;
      treatment because of its better safety profile but its use in MRSA lung infection is limited&#xD;
      by its limited lung penetration. Teicoplanin is mainly used for injection/infusion.&#xD;
      Inhalation of anti-microbial drugs is a cornerstone in the treatment of patients with CF,&#xD;
      since inhaled antibiotics decrease the rate of decline of lung function, improve the quality&#xD;
      of life, and reduce the frequency of exacerbations and hospital admissions. It is expected&#xD;
      that, using inhalation route, efficacy would be improved and risk of resistance reduced. At&#xD;
      present, no antibiotic active against MRSA is available as an inhaled formulation. The&#xD;
      objective of this phase I, first-in-man clinical study is to identify the dose providing,&#xD;
      after single inhalation administration, a sputum Teicoplanin concentrations exceeding the&#xD;
      drug concentration required to inhibit bacterial growth for at least 8 hours, while&#xD;
      minimizing the development of resistance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      INTRODUCTION &amp; STATE-OF-ART Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive&#xD;
      lethal disorders affecting 1 in 2.500 newborns among Caucasians. CF lung disease reflects a&#xD;
      failure in the capacity of airway epithelia to normally hydrate their surface. Poor hydration&#xD;
      of airways surfaces leads to reduced mucociliary clearance, adhesion of mucus to airway&#xD;
      surfaces and, ultimately, chronic bacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On regard the therapeutic strategy, lung infection in CF was mainly treated with antibiotics,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators and mucolytics. In addition, patients with&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis were often given other types of medicines such as pancreatic enzymes and food&#xD;
      supplements. They were also advised to exercise and to have physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CF are peculiarly susceptible to infection and colonization of the respiratory&#xD;
      tract with patho-gens. In particular, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has&#xD;
      become the third most prevalent bacterium in cystic fibrosis (CF) in the United States and&#xD;
      has been increasing in other countries. Apart from the difficulty of treating the infection&#xD;
      because of its antimicrobial resistances, MRSA is transmissible between individuals with and&#xD;
      without CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With increasing survival due to improvements of care, an increased frequency of pulmonary&#xD;
      infections with new and resistant pathogens has been identified. In particular, the&#xD;
      prevalence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in respiratory cultures of&#xD;
      CF patients has increased over the past decade. MRSA pneumonia is likely to be severe and&#xD;
      life threatening, with high mortality, compared with non-MRSA pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of MRSA on outcomes in CF is not fully understood. In a large epidemiologic study&#xD;
      was shown that lung function decline is more rapid in CF children and adolescents with&#xD;
      persistent MRSA compared with those without MRSA. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that&#xD;
      persistent infection with MRSA is associated with increased use of intra-venous antibiotics,&#xD;
      increased hospitalizations, a faster decline of lung function, as well as shortened life&#xD;
      expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During chronic infection, MRSA shows the adaptive mode of growth, which enhances the&#xD;
      bacterias' ability to withstand the immune system and antibiotic therapy. In the setting of&#xD;
      chronic infection, however, reduction in bacterial density in sputum and increased clinical&#xD;
      stability may be appropriate outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic MRSA infection is associated with worse outcomes, and treatment/eradication is&#xD;
      challenging. Antibiotic dosing and choices should be optimized to minimize further resistance&#xD;
      and to maximize chances of successful therapy. Yet, MRSA has several mechanisms to escape&#xD;
      clearance by the immune system and antibiotic killing. For these reasons, a better&#xD;
      understanding of preventive measures and early therapy is of key importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different approaches have been considered in the prevention and management of MRSA infections&#xD;
      among patients with CF. In consideration of all these assessments there is an emerging&#xD;
      consensus that MRSA is an important pathogen in CF rather than simply a marker of severe&#xD;
      disease. However, to date there are no guidelines or recommendations on the choice of&#xD;
      antibiotics for MRSA in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycopeptides are an important class of antibiotics active against Gram-positive pathogens.&#xD;
      Teicoplanin and vancomycin, are two glycopeptide antibiotics currently in widespread use and&#xD;
      are active against MRSA. Teicoplanin susceptibility is considered when minimal inhibition&#xD;
      concentration (MIC) is &lt; 2 ug/mL. Teicoplanin is produced by Actynoplanes teichomycietus and&#xD;
      acts by inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Teicoplanin is often preferred to vancomycin for&#xD;
      intravenous treatment because of its better safety profile but its use in MRSA lung infection&#xD;
      is limited by its limited lung penetration. Teicoplanin has been marketed for &gt;20 years in&#xD;
      most EU countries. Teicoplanin is mainly used for injection/infusion; the oral route of&#xD;
      administration is used only for the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis by Clostridium&#xD;
      difficilis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhalation of anti-microbial drugs is a cornerstone in the treatment of patients with CF, by&#xD;
      providing high drug concentrations locally in the lung while minimizing systemic exposure and&#xD;
      thus the potential for side effects. Nebulized antibiotic therapy directly targets airways&#xD;
      and lung parenchyma, thereby resulting in increased local concentrations and hence&#xD;
      potentially improving efficacy. In CF, inhaled antibiotics decrease the rate of decline of&#xD;
      lung function, improve the quality of life, and reduce the frequency of exacerbations and&#xD;
      hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of nebulized Teicoplanin directly to the bronchial tree may offer improved efficacy.&#xD;
      It is expected that, using the inhalation route, lung concentrations will be higher than MICs&#xD;
      for most bacteria, improving efficacy and reducing the risk of resistance. At present, no&#xD;
      antibiotic active against MRSA is available as an inhaled formulation; vancomycin dry powder&#xD;
      for inhalation is currently under clinical investigation in the U.S.A. for the treatment of&#xD;
      MRSA lung infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY OF NON-CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Teicoplanin inhibits the growth of susceptible organisms&#xD;
      by interfering with cell wall biosynthesis at a site different from that affected by&#xD;
      beta-lactams. Specific binding to D-alanyl-D-alanine residues blocks peptidoglycan synthesis.&#xD;
      The spectrum of activity of Teicoplanin, like that of vancomycin, is restricted to&#xD;
      Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Teicoplanin is generally more active than&#xD;
      vancomycin against streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes; the two agents exhibit similar&#xD;
      activity against S. aureus (including MRSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance to Teicoplanin is rare but not unknown. SUMMARY OF CLINICAL DATA In clinical&#xD;
      trials, Teicoplanin is associated with fewer side effects than vancomycin, while caution is&#xD;
      recommended in the elderly, patients with compromised renal function, pre-existing hearing&#xD;
      problems or with a history of allergic reactions to vancomycin. Common adverse reactions&#xD;
      (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10) include rash, erythema, pruritis, pain at injections site and pyrexia while&#xD;
      less common reactions (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) include leucopenia, thrombocytopenia,&#xD;
      eosinophilia, anaphylactic reactions dizziness, headache, phlebitis, bronchospasm, diarrhoea,&#xD;
      vomiting, nausea and transient increases in transaminases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal failure has been reported in patients treated with Teicoplanin; patients with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency, and/or in those receiving Teicoplanin in conjunction with or sequentially with&#xD;
      other medicinal products with known nephrotoxic potential (aminoglycosides, colistin,&#xD;
      amphotericin B, cyclosporin, and cisplatin) should be carefully monitored, and should include&#xD;
      auditory tests. Since Teicoplanin is mainly excreted by the kidney, the dose of Teicoplanin&#xD;
      must be adapted in patients with renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with other glycopeptides, ototoxicity (deafness and tinnitus) has been reported in&#xD;
      patients treated with Teicoplanin. Patients who develop signs and symptoms of impaired&#xD;
      hearing or disorders of the inner ear during treatment with Teicoplanin should be carefully&#xD;
      evaluated and monitored, especially in case of prolonged treatment and in patients with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency. Patients receiving Teicoplanin in conjunction with or sequentially with other&#xD;
      medicinal products with known neurotoxic/ototoxic potential (amino-glycol¬sides, cyclosporin,&#xD;
      cisplatin, furosemide and ethacrynic acid) should be carefully monitored and the benefit of&#xD;
      Teicoplanin evaluated if hearing deteriorates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of Teicoplanin has been confirmed by pharmacovigilance data based on approximately&#xD;
      30 years of use in Gram-positive severe infections. There are no human data concerning the&#xD;
      use of inhaled Teicoplanin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY OF CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS Teicoplanin is currently administered primarily by the&#xD;
      parenteral route (intravenous, IV or intra¬muscular, IM). Following intravenous&#xD;
      administration, the disposition kinetics are tri-exponential, and the majority of drug is&#xD;
      excreted unchanged by glomerular filtration. In patients with normal renal function, the&#xD;
      terminal half-life is 87 h. The volume of distribution at steady-state is 860 mL/kg,&#xD;
      clearance is 11.4 mL/h/kg and renal clearance is 8.3 mL/h/kg. Teicoplanin is highly bound in&#xD;
      plasma to albumin (fraction unbound = 0.1). The pharmacokinetics are linear over a wide dose&#xD;
      range (2 to 26 mg/kg). As expected, clearance is higher in children than in adults, and lower&#xD;
      in the elderly, associated with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate with advancing&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teicoplanin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and shows negligible oral&#xD;
      bioavailability. After IM administration, the bioavailability of Teicoplanin is 90%. After&#xD;
      six daily IM administrations at 200 mg, the mean ± SD maximum Teicoplanin concentration&#xD;
      (Cmax) is 12.1 ± 0.9 mg/L and occurs at 2h after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY The objective of this phase I, first-in-man clinical study is to&#xD;
      identify the dose providing, after single inhalation administration, a sputum Teicoplanin&#xD;
      concentrations exceeding the drug concentration required to inhibit bacterial growth for at&#xD;
      least 8 hours, while minimizing the development of resistance. To this end, the study is&#xD;
      designed with single daily escalating doses in subjects with CF. Up to now, no Teicoplanin&#xD;
      product for nebulization has been approved either in EU or U.S.A.. Nevertheless, Teicoplanin&#xD;
      containing solutions are often used off-label to manage MRSA lung infections in patients with&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis, usually with nebulization of 200 mg in 3 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhalation by nebulization is a typical topical therapy and its efficacy depends on the&#xD;
      physicochemical characteristics of the drug solution and of the nebuliser used to generate&#xD;
      the aerosol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial the first dose has been selected after aerodynamic assessment of nebulised&#xD;
      aerosol in accordance with European Pharmacopoeia 9th and USP 28. A starting dose of 150 mg&#xD;
      will be most likely well tolerated and possibly able to reach the expected concentration in&#xD;
      the target tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of PK features of Teicoplanin (elimination half-life of the product varies from&#xD;
      100 to 170 hours in blood), of time-dependent killing characteristic, of the mechanism of&#xD;
      action and of the expected MIC, an AUC0-12 h of more 300 μg/mL*h in the sputum will be&#xD;
      effective in controlling MRSA infection. This value is thus an appropriate end point for a&#xD;
      preliminary pilot study after single local administration and will likely allow optimal&#xD;
      evaluation of the doses to be applied to test clinical efficacy on the basis of the following&#xD;
      considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeated administrations, to be applied in later studies, will produce proportionally&#xD;
           higher AUC values than single administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local ratio between AUC and MIC necessary to achieve killing of MRSA are likely lower&#xD;
           than systemic ratio;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teicoplanin &quot;off-label&quot; experience is usually based on administration of doses unlikely&#xD;
           to produce a AUC0-12 h above 300 μg/mL*h in the sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, on the basis of literature data an AUC0-12 h above 300 μg/mL*h in the sputum&#xD;
      is achievable within the planned protocol, is likely to be clinically relevant in patients&#xD;
      with MRSA lung infection and is likely well tolerated even by patients with chronic lung&#xD;
      inflammation as those who will be enrolled in the proposed study.&#xD;
