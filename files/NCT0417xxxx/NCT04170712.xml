  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to establish a bank at UVa of tampon samples, cervical swabs,&#xD;
      blood, associated tumor specimens that would otherwise be discarded, and relevant medical&#xD;
      data from consenting patients that have suspected and/or confirmed gynecological cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses. The specimens collected will be saved for analysis on future projects to determine&#xD;
      if factors in the specimens are predictive and/or correlated to gynecological cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses and/or outcomes&#xD;

      The purpose of this project is to establish a bank at UVa of tampon samples, cervical swabs,&#xD;
      blood, associated tumor specimens that would otherwise be discarded, and relevant medical&#xD;
      data from consenting patients that have suspected and/or confirmed gynecological cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses. The specimens collected will be saved for analysis on future projects to determine&#xD;
      if factors in the specimens are predictive and/or correlated to gynecological cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses and/or outcomes. The bank will contain: 1) 10cc of blood drawn through venipuncture&#xD;
      annually; 2) tampons placed in the patients vagina prior to surgery or clinic visit; 3) swabs&#xD;
      of the endocervical canal; 4) freshly collected leftover and to-be-discarded tumors from&#xD;
      ovarian, uterine, cervical, as well as leftover normal tissue, and ascites fluid, from&#xD;
      samples collected for diagnostic purposes. These samples and patient-associated medical&#xD;
      record data will be banked and used for future research and analyses. Samples will be saved&#xD;
      in multiple formats for later tumor profiling (i.e. FFPE, snap frozen, in RNA-later, etc).&#xD;
      These samples and information will be used to determine the underlying causes of cancers and&#xD;
      chemoresistance, so that better methods of treatment, management, and prevention of&#xD;
      gynecological cancers may be discovered in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be linked and coded, with all HIPAA protected information removed, for storage&#xD;
      and sharing with other investigators to protect patient information. Only coded samples and&#xD;
      clinical information will be used in this protocol for when samples, information, and/or data&#xD;
      are shared with other investigators at UVa or outside institutions in the future. A separate&#xD;
      password protected/encrypted file will contain the patient identifiers and the key to the&#xD;
      coded sample numbers. This file will only be accessible by the PI or study team listed on&#xD;
      this protocol on UVa premises, and will only be stored on a UVa server behind the UVa&#xD;
      firewall, and will not be stored or accessed on personal computers. Thus, identified patient&#xD;
      information will not be accessible to any individual, except the PI or study team listed on&#xD;
      this protocol, ensuring protection of patient information. In addition, coded patient samples&#xD;
      and medical data from specimens obtained from the University of Alabama-Birmingham, that were&#xD;
      previously collected by the PI under local IRB approval (IRB-HSR #18042), have been&#xD;
      transferred to UVA under a fully executed MTA, and will be assimilated into this databank at&#xD;
      UVa for future research.&#xD;
