  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of an mobile-health strategy to&#xD;
      improve patient-reported symptoms, promote life-saving medication adherence, and encourage&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle behaviors in early stage breast cancer survivors receiving adjuvant&#xD;
      Aromatase inhibitors, while beginning to predict psycho-social and demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of those who benefit most from this approach. This will provide preliminary&#xD;
      experience and evidence for larger, randomized clinical trials evaluating this methodology,&#xD;
      which will have immediate and scalable influence on cancer survivor ship.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective, observational study enrolling up to 50 patients to the&#xD;
      intervention in groups of 10 within Indiana University Simon Cancer Center. Subjects must&#xD;
      meet eligibility at the time of informed consent. Once 10 eligible subjects are identified&#xD;
      and have signed informed consent, each subject will return for their baseline visit and begin&#xD;
      the app intervention with their group of 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective Evaluate the feasibility of a smartphone application, LifeExtend-AI, in&#xD;
      patients with early stage breast cancer currently prescribed aromatase inhibitor therapy,&#xD;
      determined by patient usage of the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine a preliminary estimate of effect size of the app intervention on medication&#xD;
           adherence, by self- report using the Brief Medication Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine a preliminary estimate of effect size of the app intervention on patient&#xD;
           -reported AI arthralgia, as measured by the Basic Pain Inventory (BPI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine a preliminary estimate of effect size of the app intervention on patient&#xD;
           reported health associated quality of life, measured by the Functional Assessment of&#xD;
           Cancer Therapy- Endocrine symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine a preliminary estimate of the effect size of the app intervention on patient&#xD;
           satisfaction with healthcare team communication, measured by the FACIT- Treatment&#xD;
           Satisfaction-Patient Satisfaction questionnaire (FACIT-TS-PS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine a preliminary estimate of effect size of the app intervention on patient&#xD;
           reported health depression and anxiety, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
           Depression Scale (HADS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Determine a preliminary estimate of effect size of the app intervention on patient&#xD;
           reported physical activity level, as measured by the International Physical Activity&#xD;
           Questionnaire (IPAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Investigate psychosocial and behavioral determinants of application usage and subsequent&#xD;
           medication adherence, including perceived AI necessity, fear of cancer recurrence,&#xD;
           health self-efficacy, and e-health literacy.&#xD;

    <description>LifeExtend-AI (LX-AI) will be piloted by adding Aromatase Inhibitor (AI)- specific features to LifeExtend, an already existing healthy lifestyle behavior application produced by LifeOmic. This application includes features for tracking activity, diet, sleep, and body weight, as well as creating &quot;to-do&quot; lists and participating in closed social networking for support and encouragement. LifeExtend-AI will add features to track AI adherence and patient-reported joint pain, with alerts sent to both the participant and the healthcare team in response to these parameters. In addition, the app contains educational videos and articles, to which articles addressing management of AI- related toxicities (including exercise) will be added.</description>
