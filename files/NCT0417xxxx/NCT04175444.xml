  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine reference values of the VisuALL Field Test in&#xD;
      pediatric population. Standard Automatic Perimetry (SAP) is the gold standard test for the&#xD;
      evaluation of different diseases of the visual pathway like glaucoma. Its main goal is to&#xD;
      measure the differential light sensitivity at several locations in the central field of&#xD;
      vision. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the current devices is limited by several factors such&#xD;
      as the inherent inconsistency of the psychophysical test, stressful examinations and&#xD;
      frequency of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several devices have been developed since the advent of the Octopus Perimeter and the&#xD;
      Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) in an effort to improve the early detection of glaucoma.&#xD;
      Several of these visual field test variants are implemented using laptops, iPads, and virtual&#xD;
      reality headsets. These modalities bring portability but lack fixation methods, environmental&#xD;
      control, and hardware standardization. These deficiencies may limit their wide usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study is to develop an initial pediatric reference database of a novel&#xD;
      visual field test ecosystem that takes advantage of a Head Mounted Device (HMD).&#xD;

      This is a cross-sectional observational study. The primary endpoint of the study will be at&#xD;
      the end of the recruitment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants that qualify for the study will be invited to a clinical site of the&#xD;
           Vanderbilt Eye Institute or equivalent testing space and best corrected visual acuity&#xD;
           will be checked with standard Snellen Acuity chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once vision is confirmed to meet study requirements, the child will be instructed on how&#xD;
           to use the headset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test will be generated and participant will complete various testing strategies&#xD;
           including suprathreshold, full threshold and individual point testing and possibly other&#xD;
           strategies for frequency of seeing curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with pathology may be confirmed with formal standard of care visual field&#xD;
           testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short survey will be administered to inquire on ease of device use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be submitted for analysis&#xD;
