      The aim of this project is assess a non-invasive functional liver tests in patients with the&#xD;
      Fontan circulation that may be used for prognostic purposes. Specifically, we aim to&#xD;
      determine whether there are alterations in Methacetin Breath Test (MBT) in the Fontan patient&#xD;
      and if so, whether it is related to conventional tests of liver and cardiac function. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that MBT CPDR 20 in the Fontan patient is abnormal as a result of alterations&#xD;
      in liver perfusion, liver cell metabolic capability and transhepatic resistance secondary to&#xD;
      hemodynamics unique to the Fontan as well as end-organ liver damage. Due to lack of robust&#xD;
      biomarkers or other risk stratification schemes, we aim to determine whether there is&#xD;
      prognostic value in hepatic MBT CPDR 20 in the Fontan patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims - The aims of this study are three-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure MBT parameter in a cohort of patients with Congestive (Dilated)&#xD;
           Cardiomyopathy and a group of Fontan patients and compare results to published normal&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore any association between MBT parameter and clinical parameters already&#xD;
           available, including Fontan hemodynamics as assessed by either of the following tests:&#xD;
           cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, non-invasive imaging of the liver (CT or&#xD;
           MRI), non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness (ARFI, MRE or Fibroscan), laboratory&#xD;
           investigations, and clinical characteristics (i.e. age of patient, time since Fontan&#xD;
           operation, type of Fontan etc.) within 12 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether MBT is predictive of clinical outcomes: heart failure, clinically&#xD;
           significant ascites, and time to transplant or death.&#xD;

      Research Design and Methods Study Design: This is a prospective pilot cohort study in 20&#xD;
      patients with Dilated Congestive Cardiomyopathy (10) and a group of adult Fontan (10)&#xD;
      recruited from an adult congenital heart disease clinic in a tertiary care center. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will be prospectively followed for 3-5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Timelines: We anticipate that it will take approximately 2 years to recruit patients&#xD;
      who are to be included in this study. Patient will followed 3-5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The aim of this project is assess a non-invasive functional liver tests in&#xD;
      patients with the Fontan circulation that may be used for prognostic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES INVOLVED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Screening and consent Eligible patients will be screened and recruited through the&#xD;
      outpatient Hepatology Clinic, Heart Failure Clinic and the Adult congenital heart disease&#xD;
      clinic. They will be approached the day of the scheduled outpatient appointment by the PI or&#xD;
      a study coordinator in a private room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained by the principal investigator, a sub-investigator or a&#xD;
      member of the study team who is authorized to give consent. This will allow the potential&#xD;
      subject sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and this will&#xD;
      minimize the risk of influence or coercion. The subject will be informed of what the research&#xD;
      entails. Any foreseeable risks or discomforts will be discussed with the subject. The&#xD;
      protection of confidentiality will be discussed with subjects as well as the subject will be&#xD;
      given the name(s)/number(s) of persons to contact should they have any further questions&#xD;
      before signing the informed or consent or once they have enrolled in the study. It is&#xD;
      reiterated to the subject that participation is voluntary and not participating will not&#xD;
      affect present or future medical care. The subject will ask and have answered any and all&#xD;
      questions before signing the informed consent. The subject is given a signed copy of the&#xD;
      informed consents(s) and HIPAA authorization(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBT testing The ¹³C-Methacetin Breath Test (MBT) is a non-invasive test for assessing liver&#xD;
      metabolic function. The BreathID® MCS System consists of the BreathID® MCS device and a test&#xD;
      kit containing a breath collection cannula and a non-radioactive isotope 13C-Methacetin&#xD;
      solution. It measures and computes the ratio between 13CO2 and 12CO2 in the patient's exhaled&#xD;
      breath. The components of the MBT system include the (1MBT BreathID® MCS unit; (2&#xD;
      13C-Methacetin solution. A dedicated flash memory stick for automatic raw data download will&#xD;
      be provided to all participating investigative sites. All components of the MBT system will&#xD;
      be provided by Exalenz Bioscience Ltd., The MBT BreathID® MCS Unit Exalenz Bioscience Ltd.&#xD;
      has developed a molecular correlation spectrometer, based on specific optical-radiation&#xD;
      emission and absorption by 13CO2 and 12CO2 gases. This device continuously senses exhaled&#xD;
      breath and analyzes CO2 in real-time through a breath collection cannula connected to the&#xD;
      patient. Based on Molecular Correlation Spectrometry (MCS), the BreathID® MCS device&#xD;
      continuously measures 13CO2 and 12CO2 concentrations from the patient's breath and&#xD;
      establishes the 13CO2/ 12CO2 ratio. The cannula continuously transports the breath sample&#xD;
      from the patient to the BreathID® MCS device. Depending upon the status of the patient, the&#xD;
      cannula may be nasal (for conscious patients) or an adaptor may be used for connection to the&#xD;
      ALF-MBT Protocol Page 15 Version 2.0 (19Nov2015) Confidential respiratory line (for intubated&#xD;
      patients). Results are displayed in real time on the device screen and are printed after the&#xD;
      completion of the test. The BreathID® MCS device calculates the delta over baseline (DOB),&#xD;
      which can be translated into the percent dose recovery (PDR) and the cumulative percent dose&#xD;
      recovery (CPDR) for each time point derived from the ratio difference compared to baseline&#xD;
      (normalized/adjusted to the patient's body weight and height as well as substrate dose)&#xD;
      throughout the course of the test. The maximum value of the PDR is called the PDRPeak. The&#xD;
      13C-Methacetin metabolism begins almost immediately since liquid passes through the stomach&#xD;
      to the duodenum, where it is absorbed, without delay. The default breath collection test time&#xD;
      is one hour after ingestion of 13C-Methacetin. The light sources are 13CO2 and 12CO2&#xD;
      discharging lamps. By using 13CO2 and 12CO2 discharging lamps as light sources, light&#xD;
      absorption will be solely due to the existence of 13CO2 and 12CO2 in the gas mixtures.&#xD;
      Furthermore, by using 13CO2 and 12CO2 discharging lamps as light sources, background&#xD;
      radiation will be substantially reduced, leading to highly sensitive absorption curves. These&#xD;
      highly sensitive absorption curves enable detection of very small variations in 13CO2 and&#xD;
      12CO2 concentrations and the 13CO2/ 12CO2 ratio. The BreathID® MCS System can detect&#xD;
      variations of less than 1/1000 in the 13CO2/ 12CO2 ratio measurement. The actual breath&#xD;
      collection is automatically done by the device and is not operator dependent. If the patient&#xD;
      is not connected properly (e.g. the breath does not reach the device), the BreathID® MCS&#xD;
      device will prompt the operator to adjust the nasal cannula. The cannula transports the&#xD;
      breath sample from the patient to the BreathID® MCS device. The cannula test kit is a&#xD;
      single-use kit and is comprised of a plastic sampling line with an in-line hydrophobic filter&#xD;
      (used to reduce the amount of moisture present from the patient's breath) and a Luer-lock&#xD;
      connector for connection to the BreathID® MCS device. The device is designed to accommodate&#xD;
      an extended range of respiratory rates. 3.3.3 13C-Methacetin Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. will&#xD;
      supply a ready to use, non-radioactive isotope ¹³C-Methacetin solution for single-use oral&#xD;
      administration (75 mg in 150 ml purified water), dispensed in thermoplastic polyester (PTE)&#xD;
      bottles sealed with a plastic child resistant stopper. The ¹³CMethacetin solution can be&#xD;
      administered via typical oral. 13C-Methacetin meets all of the qualifications for a liver&#xD;
      function test substrate: it is a nontoxic small molecule; is administered orally; is rapidly&#xD;
      absorbed; and is exclusively metabolized by the liver. Furthermore, 13C can be easily&#xD;
      synthesized into a key location within this molecule. No related adverse events have been&#xD;
      reported when using this substance, including in vulnerable populations, and the compound&#xD;
      remains stable over time. The 13C-Methacetin substrate is a well-known diagnostic reagent&#xD;
      that has been described in the literature and used for over 30 years by researchers around&#xD;
      the world. ¹³C-Methacetin is rapidly absorbed and metabolized by the hepatic mixed function&#xD;
      oxidase, via O-demethylation. This process is carried out by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes&#xD;
      that produce two products, acetaminophen and formaldehyde, which is transformed through two&#xD;
      successive oxidative steps to 13CO2. Toxicology testing results in animals and other clinical&#xD;
      information support the safe use of Methacetin in humans. Based on the acute toxicity studies&#xD;
      in mice and rats where relatively high LD50 values of 1190mg/kg were administered, the&#xD;
      Methacetin dose administered in human breath tests in adults of 75 mg, or approximately&#xD;
      1mg/kg, has a safety ratio in excess of 1000- fold (10). There have been no reports of any&#xD;
      complications with the use of this substance in over 2500 patients tested worldwide (see IDE&#xD;
      filing). The main metabolite of Methacetin is acetaminophen which has wide routine clinical&#xD;
      use at much higher doses than orally administered dose of 13C-Methacetin of 75mg used in this&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Based Monitoring: To ensure compliance with GCP, local regulations and scientific&#xD;
      integrity, monitoring of this trial will be managed and oversight retained by the Sponsor or&#xD;
      designee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Requirements for Administration of Substrate: Fasting Subjects will perform the breath test&#xD;
      once enrolled into the trial and when the following criteria have been met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral administration of substrate: The subject should be fasting from solid food for a&#xD;
           minimum 6 hours and from oral medications for a minimum of 1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject has not ingested acetaminophen-related medications (e.g. Tylenol) within the&#xD;
           past 24 hours (subjects with acetaminophen intoxication may be included 24 hours after&#xD;
           ingestion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject has not had any products containing caffeine for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject has not received general anesthesia in the last 24 hours. Performance of the&#xD;
           Breath Collection will be performed after the substrate is administered to the subject;&#xD;
           no waiting period is required once the substrate has been administered. Breath is&#xD;
           collected automatically via a nasal cannula for a total of 75 minutes (up to 15 minutes&#xD;
           for baseline measurement and 60 minutes following ingestion of Methacetin). All&#xD;
           test-specific equipment will be supplied by Exalenz&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Feasibility: The Clinical Research Unit will provide essential resources for the&#xD;
      conduct of the proposed research. Study coordinator already experienced form other studies&#xD;
      with the Breath ID machine and protocol will be required for administration of the test.&#xD;
      Subjects are expected to spend approximately 2 hours in the CRU for administration of MBT&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Limitations: One major limitation to this study is the unknown ability to correlate MBT&#xD;
      with various clinical data, specifically variables derived from cardiac catheterization, if&#xD;
      not available. Cardiac output, which is measured by cardiac catheterization, is a determinant&#xD;
      of hepatic blood flow and likewise, Fontan pressure can influence hepatic perfusion. Cardiac&#xD;
      catheterizations are not routinely performed in healthy Fontan patients and any analysis&#xD;
      using this variable represents a selection bias towards a symptomatic and potentially sicker&#xD;
      subgroup. There is merit in adding a non-invasive test like MBT when looking at FALD&#xD;
      patients, given the difficulty to predict liver outcome in these patients.&#xD;
