  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to validate if photoacoustic imaging potentially reduces benign&#xD;
      surgeries without compromising cancer detection sensitivity. The study will also explore&#xD;
      whether using the photoacoustic imaging/ultrasound technique has any potential with early&#xD;
      ovarian cancer detection in a group of high risk patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In primary and secondary objectives, the investigators will consent patients who are at risk&#xD;
      for ovarian cancer, or who have an ovarian mass possibly suggestive of a malignancy and are&#xD;
      counseled to undergo oophorectomy. Patients will be identified by the GYN physicians and&#xD;
      consented by the study coordinator prior to the date of the scheduled surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In exploratory objectives, the investigators will consent patients who are at risk for&#xD;
      ovarian cancer and wish to be followed within one or two years before making decision to&#xD;
      undergo prophylactic oophorectomy. Patients will be identified based on the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria by the physicians and consented by the study coordinator prior to the follow up&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

For the exploratory outcome measure for high risk participants (approximately 10 participants), the transvaginal ultrasound (standard of care) followed by transvaginal ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging will be performed additionally every 2 weeks at follicular phase and at the luteal phase for 3 months</description>

    <ipd_description>Sharing of data collected by this project is essential to gain knowledge on how to improve and manage the current standard of care on high-risk and ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;
The investigators will share data through multiple channels including:&#xD;
Publication of results and findings at various stages in peer-reviewed journals&#xD;
Presentation of results and findings at national and international conferences&#xD;
Public access to data collected from this project upon reasonable request when the study is completed.</ipd_description>
