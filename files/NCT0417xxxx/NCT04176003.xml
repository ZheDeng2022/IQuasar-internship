  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain patient and stakeholder perspectives on what outcome&#xD;
      measures should be included in future trials on CPPD (Calcium PyroPhosphate Deposition), a&#xD;
      common form of inflammatory arthritis. This will form part of a wider OMERACT (Outcome&#xD;
      Measures in Rheumatology) study, involving multiple international sites, to determine a core&#xD;
      domain set (an agreed set of outcome measures) for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, up to 10 patients with CPPD and their caregivers, healthcare professionals who&#xD;
      care for patients with CPPD, and other stakeholders, which may include government&#xD;
      organisations, non-government organisations, pharmaceutical representatives and health&#xD;
      advocacy groups, will be invited to participate in a single, semi-structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be face-to-face or telephone, last up to one hour and digitally&#xD;
      audio-recorded. For patients and their caregivers, interviews will explore their lived&#xD;
      experience of CPPD, its impact on their daily lives, and the perceived relevance of outcome&#xD;
      measures used in previous studies. For healthcare professionals and other stakeholders,&#xD;
      interviews will explore their experience dealing with patients with CPPD, how they perceive&#xD;
      CPPD impacts patient lives, and the perceived relevance of the outcome measures used in&#xD;
      previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following analysis of the data, participants will be sent a short report with the&#xD;
      researchers' findings, and asked to check the accuracy of these and provide brief written&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will also take place with patients, caregivers, healthcare practitioners and&#xD;
      stakeholders at the other international sites where ethics committee approval will be sought&#xD;
      locally. It is anticipated that around 30 participants will be recruited across all sites.&#xD;
      Analysis of all interviews will be primarily conducted and managed at the UK site.&#xD;

    <description>This is a qualitative interview study, the primary aim is to collect patient and stakeholder perspectives on existing outcome measures of CPPD. Currently there are no recommended core outcome measure sets for CPPD and this work is being undertaken within the framework of OMERACT. Thematic analysis will be undertaken of interview transcripts and therefore there is no defined outcome measure.</description>

    <description>This is a qualitative interview study, the secondary aim is to collect patients' experiences of living with CPPD as well as their and stakeholders perception of the impact of CPPD symptoms, to identify any further outcome measures that could be used in studies of CPPD. Currently there are no recommended core outcome measure sets for CPPD and this work is being undertaken within the framework of OMERACT. Thematic analysis will be undertaken of interview transcripts and therefore there is no defined outcome measure. There is no specific recall period for which experiences will be assessed as this will be dependent on each individual's disease duration.</description>
