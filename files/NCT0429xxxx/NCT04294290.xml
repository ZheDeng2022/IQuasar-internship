  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, prospective study of one intravenous infusion of human umbilical cord&#xD;
      tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC) in toddlers with autism spectrum disorder&#xD;
      (ASD). Toddlers 18 to 48 months of age with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate. Diagnosis will be confirmed at the time of the eligibility visit at the Duke&#xD;
      Center for Autism and Brain Development. All participants will receive a single intravenous&#xD;
      dose of 2x106/kg hCT-MSC per kilogram at baseline. Assessments will be conducted at baseline&#xD;
      and 6 months, with remote follow-up assessments at 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility. Safety assessments&#xD;
      include monitoring of acute infusion reactions, adverse events, incidence of infections, and&#xD;
      markers of alloimmunization. Clinical outcome measures will also be described. A key clinical&#xD;
      outcome measeure is the change in social communication abilities from baseline to 6 months&#xD;
      based on the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI), a commonly-used and well-validated&#xD;
      coding system for rating the quality and quantity of social communication skills in toddlers&#xD;
      with and without ASD.91 JERI coding rates social communication abilities on a 1 to 7 scale&#xD;
      and factors in both the quantity and quality of skills. The total joint engagement score as&#xD;
      well as ratings on all JERI subscales that comprise the total score will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other clinical endpoints will include the PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) autism composite&#xD;
      score, the mean of the Socialization Subscale Standard Score and Communication Subscale&#xD;
      Standard Score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-3), the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression Scale (CGI) - Severity and Improvement Scales, the Communicative Development&#xD;
      Inventories (CDI-2): Words &amp; Sentences subscales, attention abilities via eye-tracking, and&#xD;
      brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory clinical endpoints will include autism symptoms measured by an app that elicits&#xD;
      and records autism symptoms on an iPad (SenseToKnow), Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale&#xD;
      (ADOS-2) Calibrated Severity Score (overall, social affect, and repetitive behavior), PDD&#xD;
      Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) Subscales, and VABS-3 Standard Score and age equivalent for the&#xD;
      following subscales: Socialization, Communication, and Daily Living and the Standard Score&#xD;
      and age equivalent for the VABS-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and VABS-3 assessments will also be conducted remotely at three and 12 months.&#xD;
      Duration of study participation will be 12 months from the time of the baseline infusion.&#xD;
