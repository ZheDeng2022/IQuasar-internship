    <description>To evaluate the performance of YVOIRE Y-Solution 360 on overall Lip 12 weeks after treatment, the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks will be measured using 5-point Lip Fullness Rating Scale (LFRS). LFRS Grades are 0 (None/Minimal), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Pronounced), and 4 (Very Pronounced).</description>
