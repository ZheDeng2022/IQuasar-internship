  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cancer inpatient settings, intravenous (IV) opioids are frequently administered in a bolus&#xD;
      fashion in order to obtain immediate pain relief. However, data on the abuse liability (AL)&#xD;
      potential of IV opioids in cancer patients is limited. No study has investigated the effect&#xD;
      of different IV infusion rates on AL potential in patients receiving parenteral opioids for&#xD;
      pain control. This phase IV trial will determine the AL potential of a slow IV hydromorphone&#xD;
      (SH) bolus administration compared with a fast IV hydromorphone (FH) bolus administration&#xD;
      among inpatients with cancer pain. It will also determine the analgesic efficacy and adverse&#xD;
      effect profiles of SH versus FH bolus infusions, and explore the relationship between&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of hydromorphone.&#xD;
      This study will eventually help develop evidence-based guidelines regarding the best style of&#xD;
      IV opioid administration which will achieve the most optimal pain control while avoiding the&#xD;
      undesirable complication of nonmedical opioid use&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the abuse liability potential of slow intravenous (IV) hydromorphone bolus&#xD;
      infusion rate with fast IV hydromorphone bolus infusion rate among inpatients with&#xD;
      breakthrough cancer pain (from the &quot;DRUG LIKING&quot; scale of the Drug Effects Questionnaire&#xD;
      [DEQ] questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the abuse liability potentials of slow IV hydromorphone bolus with fast IV&#xD;
      hydromorphone bolus among inpatients with breakthrough cancer pain (from the other scales of&#xD;
      the DEQ questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the analgesic efficacy of slow IV hydromorphone bolus with fast IV&#xD;
      hydromorphone bolus among inpatients with breakthrough cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the adverse effects of slow IV hydromorphone bolus with fast IV hydromorphone&#xD;
      bolus among inpatients with breakthrough cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the abuse liability potential of slow IV hydromorphone bolus with fast IV&#xD;
      hydromorphone bolus among the sub group of patients who achieved successful analgesia,&#xD;
      defined as at least a two point or 30% reduction in pain intensity score on a 0-10 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To obtain exploratory data regarding the relationship between pharmacogenetics and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of hydromorphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PHASE I: Patients concurrently receive IV hydromorphone over 2 minutes and IV&#xD;
      placebo over 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PHASE II: Patients are then crossed over to concurrently receive IV hydromorphone&#xD;
      over 15 minutes and IV placebo over 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PHASE I: Patients concurrently receive IV hydromorphone over 15 minutes and IV&#xD;
      placebo over 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PHASE II: Patients are then crossed over to concurrently receive IV hydromorphone&#xD;
      over 2 minutes and IV placebo over 15 minutes.&#xD;
