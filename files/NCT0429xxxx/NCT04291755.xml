  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at understanding the impact of gut microbiota on efficacy of cancer&#xD;
      therapies, in particular checkpoint inhibitors, and using the resulting information to design&#xD;
      microbial immunotherapies. Although animal models are of use to determine the influences of&#xD;
      gut and other microbiota on cancer treatment modalities, they are limited due to differences&#xD;
      between mouse and human physiology and immunology, as well as the inherent differences in gut&#xD;
      microbial populations between the two mammalian organisms. Therefore, samples obtained as&#xD;
      donations from human subjects undergoing cancer treatment are of great value for the&#xD;
      identification and determination of bacteria and their metabolic processes that are involved&#xD;
      in the successful cure and remission of cancer by checkpoint inhibitor therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to collect 3 samples each of blood, urine, and stool in&#xD;
      subjects with cancer. This is a non-interventional, 2 site study in 100 people who are&#xD;
      undergoing any type of cancer immunotherapy. Subjects who meet the entry criteria will&#xD;
      provide 5 samples each of blood, urine, and stool over a 12-month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence indicates that the composition of the gut microbiome can influence&#xD;
      the efficacy of cancer drugs. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that the&#xD;
      presence of certain microbes in the gut is correlated with better responsiveness to the new&#xD;
      immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors. Providing these particular microbes as a&#xD;
      co-therapy may be a way to improve the overall success rate of these drugs. However, very&#xD;
      little is currently known about the mechanisms involved in these observed positive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to systematically identify how the presence or absence of particular microbes&#xD;
      modulates responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapy drugs, Persephone&#xD;
      Biome is building a biobank comprised of donated samples from a diversity of cancer patients&#xD;
      undergoing various anti-cancer treatments. These samples will be analyzed using metabolic&#xD;
      models and machine learning approaches to identify microbial species, gene functions, and&#xD;
      metabolic pathways that are associated with efficacy and toxicity of treatments. Ultimately,&#xD;
      these data will facilitate the development of live biotherapeutics as co-therapies to various&#xD;
      cancer drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-interventional, 2 site study in 100 subjects who are undergoing any type of&#xD;
      cancer immunotherapy. It is preferred that enrollment is balanced by sex; however, it is not&#xD;
      required. Subjects who meet the entry criteria will provide 5 samples each of blood, urine,&#xD;
      and stool over a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, subjects will receive a stool sampling kit and instructions on&#xD;
      how and when to collect the stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to Visit 2, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with&#xD;
      the shipping material provided. At Visit 2 subjects will have blood drawn and urine&#xD;
      collected. A stool sampling kit will be dispensed with instructions on how and when to&#xD;
      collect the stool sample. Visit 2 must be conducted prior to the start of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to Visit 3, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with&#xD;
      the shipping material provided. At Visit 3 subjects will have blood drawn and urine&#xD;
      collected. A stool sampling kit will be dispensed with instructions on how and when to&#xD;
      collect the stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to Visit 4, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with&#xD;
      the shipping material provided. At Visit 4 subjects will have blood drawn and urine&#xD;
      collected. A stool sampling kit will be dispensed with instructions on how and when to&#xD;
      collect the stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to Visit 5, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with&#xD;
      the shipping material provided. At Visit 5 subjects will have blood drawn and urine&#xD;
      collected. A stool sampling kit will be dispensed with instructions on how and when to&#xD;
      collect the stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to Visit 6, subjects will collect a stool sample and return it to the laboratory with&#xD;
      the shipping material provided. At Visit 6 subjects will have blood drawn and urine&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All concomitant medications and adverse events will be recorded. In the event of an adverse&#xD;
      event, every effort should be made to collect stool, blood, and urine samples (considered an&#xD;
      unscheduled visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a subject discontinues from the study prior to the 12-month visit (Visit 6)&#xD;
      all efforts should be made to carry out the assessments for that visit. Visit 6 will also&#xD;
      serve as the end of study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject is identified by a unique central identification code that is unique to the&#xD;
      study site. This code is only used for study purposes. After informed consent, every person&#xD;
      will be given a subject number. The subject code consists of a non interventional study (NIS)&#xD;
      code followed by an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) country code, and&#xD;
      the subject number. For the duration of the study and afterwards, only the subject's&#xD;
      physician will be able to identify the subject based on the subject identification code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data to be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF) include demographics,&#xD;
      medical history, cancer history, tobacco and alcohol history, diet, prior and concomitant&#xD;
      medications, adverse events, and results of tumor scans using the Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumours (iRECIST) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trained investigator site staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the&#xD;
      eCRFs from source documents (e.g., medical records and study-specific data capture tools as&#xD;
      needed) directly into the study database on a central server. All information in the eCRFs&#xD;
      must be traceable to these source documents. Data recorded directly into the eCRFs will be&#xD;
      defined before study start and the eCRFs will be considered the source data. Clinical&#xD;
      Research Associates (CRAs) and a Data Manager will review eCRFs entered by investigational&#xD;
      staff for completeness and accuracy. Automatic quality programs check for data discrepancies&#xD;
      in the eCRFs and the resulting queries will be notified to the investigational site using an&#xD;
      electronic data query process within the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Designated&#xD;
      investigator site staff are required to respond to queries and make any necessary changes to&#xD;
      the data. Details of the data correction process will be specified in the Data Management&#xD;
      Plan. A validated, electronic database will be employed from the EDC system. An audit trail&#xD;
      of all changes to this database, including the date, reason for the data change and who made&#xD;
      the change, will be maintained within the same database. The audit trail will be part of the&#xD;
      archived data at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complete data management process (data capture, data entry, data validation, checks on&#xD;
      plausibility, query handling, data editing after entry, coding, data base closure, etc.) will&#xD;
      be defined in advance within a data management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automatic queries will be defined according to the data management plan. These queries will&#xD;
      be auto-generated in the EDC system for data correction and accuracy. Corrections will be&#xD;
      entered directly into the system. This procedure will be repeated until all queries are&#xD;
      resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor will conduct a site visit to verify the qualifications of each investigator,&#xD;
      inspect the site facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and the&#xD;
      procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation. The investigator is required to&#xD;
      prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations&#xD;
      and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. All information recorded on&#xD;
      the eCRFs for this study must be consistent with the subjects' source documentation (i.e.,&#xD;
      medical records).&#xD;
