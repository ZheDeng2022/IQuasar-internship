  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of ticagrelor vs placebo for the reduction&#xD;
      of Vaso-Occlusive crises in paediatric patients with Sickle Cell Disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  HESTIA5 will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ticagrelor versus placebo&#xD;
           in children with SICKLE CELL DISEASE during treatment for at least 12 months and up to a&#xD;
           maximum of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The target population are children (males and females) aged 6 months to &lt;18 years and&#xD;
           body weight ≥6 kg diagnosed with homozygous sickle cell or sickle beta-zero-thalassaemia&#xD;
           confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography or hemoglobin electrophoresis. The&#xD;
           aim is to randomise 20 patients in the age group 6 to &lt;24 months. At least 50 patients&#xD;
           should be randomised in each of the age groups: ≥2 to &lt;12 years and ≥12 to &lt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to randomisation in this study, patients aged 6 to &lt;24 months will undergo a&#xD;
           14-day Run in period in which they will receive open-label ticagrelor twice a day for 14&#xD;
           days according to weight. Run-in period includes 4 visits, called R1, R2, R3 and R4. The&#xD;
           run-In period is to ensure that the treatment is well-tolerated, and that the exposure&#xD;
           is in line with model-based predictions following repeated twice a day dosing with&#xD;
           ticagrelor in this age group. At the end of the Run-in period (Visit R4), the patient&#xD;
           will take his/her final dose of open-label IP and await the independent Data Monitoring&#xD;
           Committee chairman's evaluation of tolerability, safety and exposure before being&#xD;
           eligible to enter the Screening period for randomisation. Patients who complete the&#xD;
           Run-in period according to the protocol must also meet all the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria detailed in Protocol, to proceed to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To be eligible for the study, patients must have experienced at least 2 VASO-OCCLUSIVE&#xD;
           CRISES (defined as painful crisis and/or ACUTE CHEST SYNDROME) events in the past 12&#xD;
           months prior to Visit 1, (patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years) and prior to visit R1 (patients&#xD;
           aged 6 to &lt;24 months) indicating that the severity of the patient's disease justifies&#xD;
           preventive chronic long-term treatment. Even if painful VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES are&#xD;
           uncommon in infants and become more frequent in older children, data show that symptoms&#xD;
           like dactylitis precede more severe events and confirm that children who have early&#xD;
           dactylitis are more likely to have severe events later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants should receive standard of care for SICKLE CELL DISEASE, adjusted to&#xD;
           the individual patient at the discretion of the investigator, including routine health&#xD;
           care screening examinations and immunizations to local guidelines and health care&#xD;
           programmes. Study drug will be given on the background of standard treatments for SICKLE&#xD;
           CELL DISEASE. Study participants are not withheld from any other treatments that may be&#xD;
           used in SICKLE CELL DISEASE (eg., hydroxyurea) during the trial, which is important&#xD;
           considering the use of a placebo control group. However, restrictions apply to some&#xD;
           medications and interventions that may be necessary for the patient's health and&#xD;
           well-being during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are to be followed until a common study end date (CSED) is reached defined as&#xD;
           12 months after the last patient is randomized. Treatment duration is at least 12 months&#xD;
           for study participants, and patients will continue on treatment until 12 months after&#xD;
           last randomized patient or up to a maximum of 24 months. The expected average follow-up&#xD;
           is 18 months, assuming a uniformly distributed enrolment period of 12 months.&#xD;
           Considering inclusion of patients with at least 2 VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES in the past&#xD;
           year, this treatment duration is considered long enough to evaluate effects on&#xD;
           VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES events as well as to capture safety and tolerability data&#xD;
           supporting a potential future long term use of ticagrelor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Due to ticagrelor mechanism of action and the potential to reduce symptoms caused by&#xD;
           ischemia during a vaso-occlusion, a composite endpoint with painful crises and/or ACUTE&#xD;
           CHEST SYNDROME has been selected for the primary endpoint. Painful crisis is the most&#xD;
           common reason for emergency department visits for patients with SICKLE CELL DISEASE with&#xD;
           a significant impact on young patients' lives, affecting them physically and&#xD;
           emotionally. Secondary endpoints are included to broaden the understanding of effects in&#xD;
           patients with SICKLE CELL DISEASE and to also assess potential benefits on symptomatic&#xD;
           disease burden and health-related quality of life (HRQL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated with 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 mg twice a day or matching placebo,&#xD;
           depending on body weight.&#xD;

    <description>Vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) defined as the composite of a painful crisis and/or an Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) . Each component is defined as:&#xD;
A painful crisis is an onset or worsening of pain that lasts at least 2 hours, for which there is no explanation other than vaso-occlusion and which requires therapy with oral or parenteral opioids, parenteral NSAIDs, or other analgesics prescribed by a health care provider in a medical setting (such as a hospital, clinic or emergency room visit) or at home.&#xD;
An ACS is an acute illness characterized by fever and/or respiratory symptoms, accompanied by a new pulmonary infiltrate on a chest X-ray.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent prior to any study specific procedures&#xD;
             not part of standard medical care (local regulations and international guidelines are&#xD;
             to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Children aged 6 months to &lt;18 years of age and body weight ≥6 kg diagnosed with HbSS&#xD;
             or HbS/β0 as confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or haemoglobin&#xD;
             electrophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have experienced at least 2 VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES (painful crisis and/or ACUTE CHEST&#xD;
             SYNDROME) as judged by the Investigator in the past 12 months prior to Visit R1&#xD;
             (patients aged 6 to &lt;24 months) or Visit 1 (patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years). These&#xD;
             VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES need to be documented in the patient's medical records or in&#xD;
             other documents that can be reconciled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If aged 2 to ≤16 years, must have had a TCD within the past year prior to Visit 2. If&#xD;
             this is not the case, a TCD examination must be done before randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If aged ≥10 years, must have had an ophthalmological examination within the past year&#xD;
             prior to Visit 1. If this is not the case, the patient must be examined by an&#xD;
             ophthalmologist before proceeding in the study. If local guidelines dictate&#xD;
             ophthalmological examination at younger ages, those local guidelines should be&#xD;
             followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If treated with hydroxyurea or L-glutamine, the weight-adjusted dose must be stable&#xD;
             for 3 months before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Suitable venous access for the study-related blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior to dosing on day of randomisation (Visit 2), a negative urine (dipstick)&#xD;
             pregnancy test performed at Enrolment (Visit 1) and at Visit 2 must be available for&#xD;
             female patients of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Females of childbearing potential (after menarche) must not become pregnant during the&#xD;
             study. Sexually active females must use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
             which results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year). If use of effective&#xD;
             contraception cannot be secured in sexually active females, the patient cannot be&#xD;
             included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of unsuitability which in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (ischaemic or&#xD;
             haemorrhagic), severe head trauma, intracranial haemorrhage, intracranial neoplasm,&#xD;
             arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or proliferative retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Findings on TCD: Current or previous values for time averaged mean of the maximum&#xD;
             velocity (TAMMV) that are Conditional or Abnormal. Patients with Conditional TAMMV&#xD;
             values or higher (≥153 cm/sec using TCD imaging technique [TCDi] which is&#xD;
             corresponding to ≥170 cm/sec by the non-imaging technique). Both the middle cerebral&#xD;
             artery and the internal carotid artery should be considered. Any other criteria that&#xD;
             would locally be considered as TCD indications for chronic transfusion would also&#xD;
             exclude the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pathological finding on any other imaging assay indicating increased risk for&#xD;
             intracerebral bleeding or thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. International normalised ratio (INR) &gt;1.4 or active pathological bleeding or increased&#xD;
             risk of bleeding complications according to Investigator.&#xD;

             &lt;24 months) or at Enrolment (Visit 1) (patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Undergoing treatment with chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Chronic use of NSAIDs defined as continuous intake &gt;3 days per week that cannot be&#xD;
             discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Receiving chronic treatment with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs that cannot be&#xD;
             discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Moderate or severe hepatic impairment defined as laboratory values of alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2×upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin &gt;2×ULN (unless&#xD;
             judged by the Investigator to be caused by haemolysis), albumin &lt;35 g/L (3.5 g/dL) and&#xD;
             INR &gt;1.4, or symptoms of liver disease (eg, ascites) from test performed at Visit R1&#xD;
             and Visit 1 (patients aged 6 to &lt;24 months) or at Enrolment (Visit 1) (patients aged 2&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Patient considered to be at risk of bradycardic events (eg, known sick sinus syndrome&#xD;
             or second- or third-degree atrioventricular block) unless already treated with a&#xD;
             permanent pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Concomitant oral or intravenous therapy with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)&#xD;
             inhibitors, CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, or strong CYP3A&#xD;
             inducers, which cannot be stopped at least 5 half-lives before randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
