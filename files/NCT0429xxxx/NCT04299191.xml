  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label, non-randomized study in pediatric patients with advanced high-grade gliomas&#xD;
      and other solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in two phases: a dose escalation phase in up to 18 patients&#xD;
      following a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design to establish dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and a &quot;safe&quot; dose&#xD;
      of 2-OHOA followed by an expanded safety cohort of up to 10 patients treated at the Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD). If the MTD is well tolerated in the expanded safety cohort, that dose&#xD;
      becomes the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioma patients and other solid tumor patients (including non-glial brain tumors) will be&#xD;
      treated as a single cohort. Patients with either tumor type will be allowed to enroll on the&#xD;
      study as positions are made available. No tumor type will be given priority over another and&#xD;
      there is no minimum number of glioma patients or solid tumor patients that must be enrolled&#xD;
      on the trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose of 2-OHOA each patient will receive will depend on the dose cohort into which they&#xD;
      are enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient is allocated a dose of 2-OHOA (either in the dose escalation phase or the&#xD;
      expanded safety cohort), it is planned that they will continue to receive the same dose on a&#xD;
      daily basis in treatment cycles of 21 days (3 weeks), which may be repeated continuously&#xD;
      without therapy interruption, until any criterion for discontinuation is met (clinical or&#xD;
      radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, or another &quot;general&quot;&#xD;
      discontinuation criterion is met as defined in Section 5.5). In the event of significant&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity, the treatment schedule may be modified from continuous dosing to&#xD;
      an intermittent regime (e.g. 1 week of dosing followed by 1 week not dosing), except during&#xD;
      Cycle 1 of the dose escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of toxicity, the dose of 2-OHOA may be reduced or delayed by no more than 14 days&#xD;
      at the discretion of the Investigator. Treatment &quot;holidays&quot; of no more than 14 days are also&#xD;
      permitted for reasons other than toxicity, except during Cycle 1 of the dose escalation&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-patient dose escalation may be permitted in certain specific circumstances (and only if&#xD;
      ≤ Grade 2 toxicity was observed during previous treatment cycles), but toxicity will not be&#xD;
      considered for definition of DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that most patients will receive between one and 6 cycles of 2-OHOA for a&#xD;
      treatment period of 3 to 18 weeks. The treatment period may be extended provided that no DLT&#xD;
      has been observed and if in the opinion of the Investigator the patient is showing benefit&#xD;
      from treatment with 2-OHOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients demonstrating clinical benefit from 2-OHOA will have the option of continuing&#xD;
      treatment under compassionate use once the study has concluded.&#xD;

    <description>The dose level corresponds to 80% of the maximum tolerated dose of 2-OHOA in adult patients when adjusted for body surface area. The escalation will be to the 100%, and 120% of the maximum tolerated dose of 2-OHOA in adult patients when adjusted for body surface area. Dose escalation decisions will be made by all active Investigators in collaboration with the Medical Monitor when at least three patients have completed the DLT observation period (Cycle 1) at each dose level. When the third patient at any given dose level has received 14 days of therapy, an &quot;escalation teleconference&quot; will be scheduled after that patient has completed the DLT observation period (Cycle 1). The decision to progress to the next dose level will be made on the basis of review of all significant 2-OHOA-related toxicities.</description>

    <description>Once a patient is allocated a dose of 2-OHOA, they will receive the same dose on a daily basis in treatment cycles of 21 days (3 weeks), which may be repeated without therapy interruption until a criterion for discontinuation (clinical or radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, or another &quot;general&quot; criterion) is met.&#xD;
The starting dose will be 2.8 g/m2 twice daily. If tolerated, doses will be escalated to 3.5 g/m2 twice daily and then to a third dose level of 4.2 g/m2 twice daily. These dose levels correspond to 80%, 100%, and 120% of the maximum tolerated dose of 2-OHOA in adult patients when adjusted for body surface area. A total of 3 dose cohorts are anticipated for the dose escalation phase of the study, with up to 6 patients enrolled at each dose level according to a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design. During each dose cohort, at least 1 week must elapse between the first and subsequent patients receiving treatment with 2-OHOA.</description>
