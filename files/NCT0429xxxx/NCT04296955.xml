      A randomized controlled study (RCT) aiming to test the effect of a new health literacy&#xD;
      intervention for renal transplant recipients, KnowMAP (knowledge management for renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year about 250-300 kidney transplantations are performed at Oslo University Hospital in&#xD;
      Norway. Considerable improvements have recently emerged within kidney transplantation in&#xD;
      relation to survival and quality of life. However, after transplantation, adherence to&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drug therapy and other medical advices is crucial for staying healthy,&#xD;
      keeping the graft, and retain good quality of life. In case of graft loss the patient has to&#xD;
      return to dialysis, representing reduced functioning, fatigue and negative impact on quality&#xD;
      of life. Dialysis also leads to higher costs for the society and in many cases a need for&#xD;
      re-transplantation. A key challenge to adherence is the ability to gain access to, understand&#xD;
      and use health information, defined as health literacy by the WHO. For renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients preparedness for handling information and going through transplantation is&#xD;
      essential. Hence, supporting the patients becoming reflective and health literate knowledge&#xD;
      users is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a RCT this project aims to test the effect of a new health communication&#xD;
      intervention, KnowMAP (knowledge management for renal transplant recipients), as compared&#xD;
      with standard care in patients undergoing renal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KnowMap is a novel intervention designed by clinicians and researchers at Oslo University&#xD;
      Hospital (OUS), University of Oslo (UiO) and University of Stavanger (UiS). The intervention&#xD;
      is targeting knowledge management skills of patients by using motivational interview (MI)&#xD;
      techniques. It represents 4 sessions of individual patient counselling starting the first&#xD;
      week after the transplantation.&#xD;

    <measure>Health literacy (HL)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>HL measured by the HLQ (Health Literacy Questionnaire): The HLQ includes 44 items over nine independent scales, each representing a different element of the overall HL construct. Each scale includes 4-6 items. The first five scales comprise items asking the respondents to indicate level of agreement [ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree (range 1-4)]. The remaining scales (6-9) have domains of self-reported capability (range 1-5: 'cannot do' to 'very easy'). The questionnaire has no total score, as that could potentially mask individual needs in specific HL domains. The HLQ appears robust for its intended purpose of assessing HL in a range of settings and has shown excellent reliability.</description>
