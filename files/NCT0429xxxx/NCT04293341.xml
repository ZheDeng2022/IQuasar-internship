  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a brief, efficient, and effective treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with depressive/anxiety disorders. However, CBT is largely underutilized within&#xD;
      the Department of Veterans Affairs due to the cost and burden of trainings necessary to&#xD;
      deliver all of the related disorder-specific treatments (DSTs). Transdiagnostic Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy (TBT), in contrast, is specifically designed to address numerous distinct disorders&#xD;
      within a single protocol in Veterans with depressive/anxiety disorders, including&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder. The proposed research seeks to evaluate the efficacy of TBT by&#xD;
      assessing psychiatric symptomatology and related impairment outcomes in Veterans with&#xD;
      depressive/anxiety disorders via a randomized controlled trial of TBT and existing DSTs in&#xD;
      Veterans with major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder.&#xD;
      Assessments will be completed at pre-, mid-, and post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
      Process variables also will be investigated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objective To examine efficacy of Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy (TBT) on improving&#xD;
      psychiatric symptomatology and related impairments in Veterans with major depressive disorder&#xD;
      (MDD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder and agoraphobia (PD/AG)&#xD;
      compared to disorder-specific treatments (DSTs) via a non-inferiority design. Patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and predictors of feasibility (attendance and discontinuation) also will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Strategy and Feasibility of Recruitment Veterans will be recruited through the&#xD;
      Primary Care Mental Health Integration, General Outpatient Mental Health, and CBT Clinic&#xD;
      programs at the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC and all affiliated VA community-based outpatient&#xD;
      clinics. IRB-approved study flyers will be distributed through each clinic/setting. Within&#xD;
      these programs, all Veterans reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety meet with a mental&#xD;
      health staff member to complete a clinical interview and self-report measures. If Veterans&#xD;
      endorse symptoms consistent with a depressive/anxiety disorder, interest in participating in&#xD;
      research will be assessed and, if agreeable, the Veteran will be referred to project staff. A&#xD;
      research assessment will be completed with the project staff to first complete consent&#xD;
      documentation and then assess inclusion/exclusion criteria (with a targeted sample of 216&#xD;
      VAMC patients), including a semi-structured clinical interview and self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      focused on psychiatric symptomatology and related impairments (described later). Participants&#xD;
      who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized into a study condition and will be&#xD;
      assigned to a project therapist. Because most VA Medical Center (VAMC) patients who meet&#xD;
      study criteria likely will present with multiple depressive/anxiety disorders, principal&#xD;
      diagnosis, or the most impairing of the diagnosable disorders, will be used to inform&#xD;
      randomization. Principal diagnosis will be determined via diagnostic severity scores in the&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-5 (ADIS-5). To balance diagnoses across the two&#xD;
      conditions, a stratified random assignment based on principal diagnosis will be used (MDD,&#xD;
      PTSD, and PD/AG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Eligible VAMC patients will be randomized into one of two treatment conditions:&#xD;
      TBT or DSTs. Both treatment conditions will include 12 weekly 45- to 60-minute treatment&#xD;
      sessions. The general format of sessions will involve: 1) brief check-in; 2) review of&#xD;
      materials from previous sessions; 3) review of homework assignments; 4) overview of new&#xD;
      materials and in-session exercises; and 5) assignment of homework for next session.&#xD;
      Attendance and homework completion will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Procedures Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of the two study&#xD;
      arms (n = 108 per arm) using a permuted block randomization procedure. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by diagnostic group (PTSD, PD/AG, MDD) and block size will be varied to minimize&#xD;
      the likelihood of unmasking. After determining eligibility and completing consent and&#xD;
      baseline assessment materials, enrolled participants will be assigned to their treatment&#xD;
      condition by the Research Project Therapist/Coordinator using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transdiagnostic Behavior Therapy TBT was developed as a streamlined protocol to address&#xD;
      transdiagnostic avoidance via the use of four different types of exposure techniques&#xD;
      (situational/in-vivo, physical/interoceptive, thought/imaginal, and positive emotional). From&#xD;
      the transdiagnostic avoidance perspective, the four exposure practices are matched to the&#xD;
      type(s) of avoidance experienced by patients based upon their cluster of symptoms/disorders.&#xD;
      Per protocol, the first six sessions of TBT are designed to educate on, prepare for, and&#xD;
      practice the four different types of exposure techniques. The next five sessions are focused&#xD;
      on practicing and refining exposure practices as participants work through their lists of&#xD;
      avoided situations/sensation/thoughts. The final session reviews treatment progress and&#xD;
      relapse prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSTs Control Condition Matching and Assignment To provide an evidence-based comparison for&#xD;
      the TBT condition, DSTs will be used that are matched to the participant's most severe&#xD;
      diagnosis, based upon the average of the ADIS interference and distress scores. If the scores&#xD;
      are equivalent for two or more diagnoses, participants will be asked to list which&#xD;
      diagnosis/symptoms that they find most impairing. DSTs will be included for each of the three&#xD;
      targeted diagnoses, including PTSD (Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD), PD/AG (Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy for PD/AG), and MDD (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for MDD). Each of these&#xD;
      DSTs have published manuals for administration and have received extensive support in the&#xD;
      literature (Barlow, 2014). All three DSTs have been shown to improve comorbid symptomatology&#xD;
      and therefore may be a more accurate comparison to TBT as compared to other available DSTs&#xD;
      that may have less effect on comorbidity (e.g., applied relaxation for PD/AG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Psychiatric Symptomatology, and Treatment Satisfaction The battery of&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires and a diagnostic interview will be completed pre-, mid-, and&#xD;
      post-treatment and at the 6-month follow-up to track participants' progression through&#xD;
      treatment and maintenance. To reduce the likelihood of missing data, all assessments will be&#xD;
      scheduled separately from normal treatment sessions. Assessments of disorder-specific&#xD;
      symptomatology, as well general symptoms of the depressive/anxiety disorders and related&#xD;
      impairments, were chosen due to the transdiagnostic focus of the proposed study.&#xD;
