    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of incorporating manually&#xD;
      adjustable sit-stand desks in the classroom environment of 9-10 year olds in reducing&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour at school during a full school year. Secondary aims include evaluating&#xD;
      the effects of the intervention on health and learning outcomes as well as comparing the&#xD;
      impact of full classroom allocation of sit-stand desks to a classroom of partial sit-stand&#xD;
      desk allocation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of overweight and obesity and related chronic disease risk factors in children have&#xD;
      increased worldwide over the past decades. Whilst it is widely acknowledged that regular&#xD;
      physical activity provides health benefits, prolonged sedentary behaviour (sitting or&#xD;
      reclining) has been shown to adversely affect children's health, independent of the child's&#xD;
      physical activity levels. Adverse associations between sedentary behaviour and risk factors&#xD;
      for disease, such as obesity, blood pressure, and high levels of cholesterol have been&#xD;
      observed in children. In addition, prolonged sedentary behaviour has been linked to reduced&#xD;
      cognitive development and academic achievement in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in our environment and lifestyle have resulted in children not only becoming less&#xD;
      physically active, but also spending unnecessarily long periods of time sitting, particularly&#xD;
      in the classroom. Sedentary behaviour is the most prevalent behaviour exhibited by children&#xD;
      in developed countries, comprising &gt;65% of waking hours. The impact of unhealthy lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviours, such as prolonged sitting, on children's health and development is concerning&#xD;
      given the importance of childhood for the establishment of lifestyle behaviours that can&#xD;
      track into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term vision of our research is to re-address the balance between sedentary and&#xD;
      non-sedentary (i.e. standing and all forms of physical activity) behaviours by changing&#xD;
      environments which are traditionally associated with prolonged periods of sedentary&#xD;
      behaviour, such as the school classroom. This study will make environmental changes to the&#xD;
      classrooms of Year 5 students (aged 9-10 years) from one school in Bradford, in the UK,&#xD;
      through the provision of manually adjustable sit-stand workstations. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      compare the effects of this novel strategy using both full desk allocation (one per child) in&#xD;
      one classroom and partial desk allocation (six standing desks in a class along with standard&#xD;
      desks) in a second classroom on children's classroom sitting and standing time. Comparisons&#xD;
      will also be made between the two intervention classrooms in the one school to children's&#xD;
      sitting and standing behaviour measured in a control school (following usual practice).&#xD;
      Secondary aims include evaluating the effects of the two interventions on time spent in&#xD;
      different intensities of physical activity, health, learning and cognitive function outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study expands on the success of the nine week pilot study, conducted in 2014, by&#xD;
      implementing the intervention over a full academic year, having an additional intervention&#xD;
      group, including an extra school for a control group, and including more key outcome measures&#xD;
      (blood glucose, self-reported comfort) to better understand the impact of sit-stand desks. If&#xD;
      successful this study will support the concept of sit-stand desks as an effective long term&#xD;
      school based intervention for benefits in health and learning in children across all&#xD;
      demographics&#xD;
