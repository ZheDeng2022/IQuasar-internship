  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental restorations should mimic sound tooth structures in terms of color and optical&#xD;
      properties especially in the anterior region. However, closely matching natural teeth with a&#xD;
      restoration can be one of the most challenging procedure in restorative dentistry. Shade&#xD;
      matching includes color determination, color communication with dental lab and color&#xD;
      reproduction with dental restoration for indirect techniques or color determination and&#xD;
      selection of the appropriate material and application method when using direct techniques.&#xD;
      Therefore color selection is the first critical step in the restoration procedures and should&#xD;
      be carried out properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color determination must be carried out before any of the restorative procedures, isolation&#xD;
      or impression. Most of the dental procedures cause dehydration and increase the opacity of&#xD;
      the enamel and teeth appear whiter. Few clinical and in vitro studies evaluated the degree of&#xD;
      color change after dehydration and rehydration periods. However, inconsistencies exist&#xD;
      between studies in terms of color change degree and duration of return to appreciable values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of color change in half an hour&#xD;
      dehydration period of the teeth and to determine if color return to baseline after half an&#xD;
      hour or 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the null hypotheses of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no perceptible difference occur after tooth dehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tooth color will not return to baseline values after half an hour or 24 hours&#xD;
           rehydration periods.&#xD;

      Color measurements Color measurements were performed with a spectrophotometer (SpectroShade&#xD;
      Micro, MHT Optic Research AG, Niederhasli, Switzerland) by the same experienced dentist in&#xD;
      the present study. Spectrophotometer was calibrated and used according to manufacturer&#xD;
      instructions before each set of measurements. All participants were asked for not to mouth&#xD;
      breath during color measurements. All of the color measurements were carried out under&#xD;
      standard light conditions with the aim of minimizing the possible inaccurate readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dehydration procedure Spectrophotometric color measurements were performed at the study&#xD;
      inception and baseline color parameters were recorded. Lips were retracted by using a lip and&#xD;
      cheek retractor which placed within 10 s. Upper central and lateral incisors were isolated&#xD;
      with cotton rolls and air dried for 5 s. Excess saliva was removed with a suction and&#xD;
      participants keep their mouth half-opened with the help of silicone mouth bite blocks.&#xD;
      Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out three times during 30 min with 10 min&#xD;
      intervals during the dehydration period for each test tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehydration procedure At the end of the dehydration procedure, lip retractor and cotton rolls&#xD;
      were removed and full-mouth rinse with water was done for 30 s. Participants asked to drink a&#xD;
      bottle of water and close their mouth for 30 min. Participants were asked to return to&#xD;
      routine daily activity, but not to consume staining beverages such as coffe or red wine.&#xD;
      Tooth rehydration process was started when test teeth get in contact with saliva.&#xD;
      Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out at 30 min and 24 h of rehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIELAB color parameters (L*,a*,b*) were used to calculate color differences (ΔE) between&#xD;
      baseline and other measurement periods for each tooth and gingival, middle and incisal thirds&#xD;
      separetely. Color difference was calculated by using an equation;&#xD;
      ΔE*=[(ΔL*)2+(Δa*)2+(Δb*)2]1/2. ΔE values were compared to threshold values of&#xD;
      acceptability(ΔE*=3,7) and perceptibility(ΔE*=1). 11 Color difference and color parameters of&#xD;
      30 min and 24h dehydration was compared to baseline color parameters.&#xD;
