  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single day&#xD;
      dosing and a separate multiple day dosing of 18-MC HCl administered orally, each part of the&#xD;
      study having a different set of healthy male and female volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single day and multiple day&#xD;
      dosing, in healthy, non-smoking, male and female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Single Ascending Dose (SAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven (7) healthy male and female volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      18-MC HCl (n=5) or placebo (n=2) in each cohort. These volunteers will receive 18-MC HCl&#xD;
      twice in 1 day (bid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 phases: Screening, Enrollment and Follow-Up. All participants will be assessed&#xD;
      for safety and tolerability for 28 days. Screening begins when a participant reports to the&#xD;
      clinical unit (CU) for a screening visit to undergo safety and compliance assessments on this&#xD;
      day. Participants that meet all eligibility criteria will be admitted to the CU on the day&#xD;
      prior to receiving study drug. Enrollment begins on Day 1 where participants will receive two&#xD;
      doses of study drug for 1 day, will be assessed for 18-MC PK up to 48 hours, and will remain&#xD;
      admitted at the CU until Day 3, at which time they will be discharged. For follow-up the&#xD;
      participants will return for safety and tolerability assessments at Days 7, 14, 21 and Day&#xD;
      28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Multiple Day Ascending Dose (MAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven (7) healthy male and female volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      18-MC HCl (n=5) or placebo (n=2) in each cohort. These volunteers will receive 18-MC HCl&#xD;
      twice over 7 days (bid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 phases: Screening, Enrollment and Follow-Up. All participants will be assessed&#xD;
      for 42 days. Screening begins when a participant reports to the clinical unit (CU) for a&#xD;
      screening visit to undergo safety and compliance assessments on this day. Participants that&#xD;
      meet all eligibility criteria will be admitted to the CU on the day prior to receiving study&#xD;
      drug. Enrollment begins on Day 1 where participants will receive two doses of study drug&#xD;
      every day for 7 days, will be assessed for 18-MC PK up to 48 hours on Day 1 and Day 7, and&#xD;
      will remain admitted at the CU until Day 9, at which time they will be discharged. For&#xD;
      follow-up the participants will return for safety and tolerability assessments at Days 14,&#xD;
      21, 28, 35 and Day 42.&#xD;

    <description>Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.</description>
