    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is designed to study the clinical and radiologic response, as well as,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
      in patients with localized high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer who are eligible for&#xD;
      definitive radiation therapy (RT) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A similar hormone-driven cancer akin to breast cancers is prostate cancer. These tumors are&#xD;
      driven by androgen receptor signaling, and CDK4/6 has also been found to be a bona fide&#xD;
      target pre-clinically for advanced prostate cancer cell models. Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibition&#xD;
      can act as a radiation sensitizer through its effects on the DNA damage response and&#xD;
      interactions with cell cycle pathway proteins. For example, it has been found that expression&#xD;
      of DNA repair proteins can be regulated by E2F, a transcription factor necessary for the G1&#xD;
      to S phase transition. Also, cyclin D1 has been found to exert a direct role in DNA repair.&#xD;
      Lastly, CDK4/6 inhibition has been found to modulate the DNA damage response. These data&#xD;
      support the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors as a modulator of DNA damage to enhance sensitivity to&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the role of CDK4/6 in tumor resistance to endocrine therapy, in activation of the DNA&#xD;
      damage response, and in promoting radiation resistance, we hypothesize that the targeting of&#xD;
      CDK4/6 with abemaciclib will enhance the cytotoxicity in combination with blockade of the&#xD;
      androgen receptor pathway. Therefore, we propose a pilot phase II investigator initiated&#xD;
      trial in patients with high-risk prostate cancer testing the tolerability and toxicity of&#xD;
      abemaciclib in combination with ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive ADT for 2 years and will start 3 months before radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Abemaciclib will start with initiation of ADT and pause 2 weeks prior to start of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Abemaciclib will resume with the first ADT administration post-radiation, which is&#xD;
      about 1 month post radiation therapy. Abemaciclib and ADT will continue for a total ADT&#xD;
      period of 24 months. Patients will receive study treatment until development of toxicity or&#xD;
      disease progression on treatment or any reasons of withdrawal or a maximum of 24 months of&#xD;
      therapy with ADT. Patients are seen every 4 weeks with laboratory evaluation. For toxicity or&#xD;
      adverse events, patients will undergo labs, physical examination and grades of toxicities&#xD;
      will be determined using NCI CTCAE version 4.03.&#xD;
