  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is to be conducted based on the AIS patient data collected from CNSR I, II,&#xD;
      and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the temporal changes in the proportion of intravenous recombinant&#xD;
           plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) treatment from 2007 to 2017 among Intravenous&#xD;
           Thrombolytics (IVT) eligible patients (patient groups B and B') and overall AIS patients&#xD;
           (patient group A) in China;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the temporal changes in IV rtPA treatment time intervals from 2007 to&#xD;
           2017 among IV rtPA treated patients (patient groups C and C') in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the IV rtPA treated patients&#xD;
      (patient groups C and C'), IVT eligible patients (patient groups B and B') and the overall&#xD;
      AIS patients (patient group A) from 2007 to 2017 from the CNSR I to III.&#xD;
