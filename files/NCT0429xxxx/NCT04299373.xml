  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve administration of alcohol in a controlled laboratory setting to&#xD;
      individuals who are scheduled for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, and then asking them to&#xD;
      return for another laboratory session 3 months following their surgery. A small number will&#xD;
      be asked to return again 9 months following their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for this research is to collect pilot data on the effects of metabolic&#xD;
      surgery (MS), also known as bariatric surgery, on the metabolism of alcohol. These data will&#xD;
      be used as preliminary evidence in support of a subsequent application for funding, to be&#xD;
      submitted to the National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective for this research is to determine the extent to which MS changes&#xD;
      reactivity to alcohol-related cues. Heightened reactivity (e.g., attention bias; craving) to&#xD;
      alcohol-related cues is known to signify increased risk for heavy drinking and AUD. No&#xD;
      research to date has examined whether the increased sensitivity to alcohol that occurs as a&#xD;
      result of MS changes cue-reactivity responses, which in theory reflect an individual's&#xD;
      history of learning to associate alcohol consumption with its subjective effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory objective is to compare metabolism of alcohol administered orally versus&#xD;
      intravenously. IV infusion of alcohol bypasses so-called &quot;first pass metabolism&quot; of alcohol&#xD;
      after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, compared to oral ingestion, infusion&#xD;
      can achieve the same blood alcohol concentration (BAC) with substantially less total alcohol&#xD;
      dosage. Following the hypothesis, this should mean that, compared to oral ingestion, infusion&#xD;
      will be associated with less production of liver fat, while also mimicking in pre-surgery&#xD;
      patients what the investigators observe with oral ingestion following surgery. This&#xD;
      comparison will permit better specification of when (during metabolism) and how alcohol is&#xD;
      converted to liver fat, and will allow the investigators to separate effects of initial&#xD;
      sensitivity to alcohol (a person's subjective response to the initial introduction of alcohol&#xD;
      into the body) from effects associated with tolerance (i.e., the body's attempts to&#xD;
      re-establish homeostasis after alcohol is introduced).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Multiple intervals following alcohol administration, up to 4 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' self-reported feelings of stimulation, sedation, and intoxication following exposure to a controlled dose of alcohol in the lab will be assessed using the Subjective Effects of Alcohol Scale (Morean, Corbin, &amp; Treat, 2013). Possible score values range from 0 to 140, where a score of 0 indicates the absence of any subjective feelings related to consumed alcohol. This scale and its psychometric properties were first described in the following publication:&#xD;

    <measure>Alcohol Urge Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed prior to acute alcohol exposure, approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Cue-induced craving for alcohol will be assessed using a beverage presentation procedure. Participants complete a self-report measure of craving, the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire. Participants then are presented with a glass containing an alcoholic beverage and are instructed to pick it up and sniff it 5 times over a 3-min period. Then the AUQ is completed again. Change in AUQ score from baseline to the post-alcohol assessment provides a cue-induced craving score. Scores at each assessment can range from 0 to 48, where 0 indicates the total lack of any craving for alcohol.&#xD;

    <measure>Alcohol Sensitivity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-surgery and 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Individual differences in self-reported sensitivity to alcohol's effects will be assessed using the Alcohol Sensitivity Questionnaire. This measure contains 15 items, each describing an effect people typically experience when drinking alcohol (e.g., feeling more talkative). For each item, participants indicate (1) whether they have ever experienced the effect in question from drinking alcohol, and (2) if so, the number of standard drinks they typically require in order to experience that effect.&#xD;

    <measure>Reactivity to alcohol cues: motivational approach bias</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed prior to acute alcohol exposure, approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The tendency to approach alcohol-related cues will be assessed using a laboratory task known as the Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task. In this task, images of alcoholic beverages, nonalcoholic beverages, and non-consumable liquids (e.g., motor oil) are presented on a computer monitor one at a time. Participants are instructed to push or pull on a computer joystick in response to each image, depending on whether it appears to be tilted 3 degrees to the right vs. the left. Each type of image is presented in both orientations multiple times. Approach bias is defined for each image type as the difference in response time for images shown in the 'pull' minus the 'push' condition.&#xD;
