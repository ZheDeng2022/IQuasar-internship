  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to statistics from the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO), taking&#xD;
      into account the definition of overweight and obesity recommended by the International&#xD;
      Obesity Task Fort (IOTF), the prevalence of overweight (including obesity) in European&#xD;
      children aged 7 to 17 years is 16-22% and the prevalence of obesity is 4-6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some review studies3 and meta-analysis4,5 have reported an inverse relationship between dairy&#xD;
      products consumption and the prevalence or incidence of overweight and obesity. However, some&#xD;
      methodological issues arise from these analyses. For instance, the combination of studies&#xD;
      with different exposures (e.g. full fat milk, total milk) in the total dairy product&#xD;
      analysis. Moreover, since the publication of the lasts meta-analysis in 2016, new&#xD;
      epidemiological studies evaluating the association between dairy product consumption and&#xD;
      overweight or obesity risk have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The aim of this work is to systematically review and assess the associations&#xD;
      between total dairy consumption and its different subtypes with the prevalence and incidence&#xD;
      of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents.&#xD;

      Searches: We will search the following electronic bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed)&#xD;
      and The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register&#xD;
      of Controlled Trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The search strategy will include only terms relating to or describing the exposure. There&#xD;
      will be no language restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction (selection and coding):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first step duplicate studies will be removed. Secondly, studies will be screened based&#xD;
      on the title and abstract in order to exclude those that do not meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      In the last step, articles will be reviewed in full to select those that meet all the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two reviewers (LL and MM) will independently extract relevant data and assess the risk of&#xD;
      bias following a standardize proforma. Relevant data will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Authors, journal and year of publication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Title&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study name&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Country/location of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characteristics of the subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up duration (for prospective cohort studies)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sources of funding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of exposure and assessment method&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome and assessment method&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Odd ratios, risk ratios or hazard ratios and 95%CI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of bias (quality) assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two review authors will independently assess the risk of bias in included studies by&#xD;
      considering the following tools: The New-Castle Ottawa scale will be used to assessed the&#xD;
      quality of the included prospective cohort studies, whereas the NIH National Heart, Lung and&#xD;
      Blood Institute. Study quality assessment tools will be used for cross-sectional studies. Any&#xD;
      disagreement will be solved by consensus or consulting with a third author (NB-T).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy for data synthesis The meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions and results will be reported following the&#xD;
      meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. The generic&#xD;
      inverse-variance method with random-effects models or fixed-effects models, when at least 5&#xD;
      or less than 5 comparisons are available, respectively, will be used to obtain summary&#xD;
      estimates. Inter-study heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochrane Q statistics (p&lt;0.10&#xD;
      will be considered significant) and quantified by the I2 statistic (≥ 50% will indicate&#xD;
      substantial heterogeneity). Possible sources of heterogeneity will be explored by conducting&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses, in which one study will be systematically removed at a time. If 10 or&#xD;
      more comparisons are available, researchers will also explore sources of heterogeneity by a&#xD;
      priori subgroup analyses (including, age, gender, geographical area and study quality).&#xD;
      Meta-regression will assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroup analyses.&#xD;
      Linear and non-linear dose response relationship will be assessed by using generalized least&#xD;
      squares trend (GLST) estimation models and spline curve modelling (MKSPLINE procedure),&#xD;
      respectively. Publication bias will be assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and the&#xD;
      Egger and Begg tests when at least 10 trial comparisons are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of subgroups or subsets:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior subgroup analysis are planned to be conducted if at least 10 study comparisons are&#xD;
      available. This will include: age (&lt; or &gt; of the median), gender (boys, girls and mixed),&#xD;
      geographical area (America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania), study quality (high vs low&#xD;
      quality).&#xD;
