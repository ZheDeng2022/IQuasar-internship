  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cysts are found incidentally on 15-50% of CT and MRIs for all indications and&#xD;
      their prevalence is increasing. Many of these cysts may be precursors to pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      and thus pose a substantial risk, however, the vast majority are benign. Increased detection&#xD;
      of pancreatic cysts provides an opportunity to diagnose pancreatic malignancy at an early,&#xD;
      curable stage yet also increases the potential to over-treat clinically insignificant&#xD;
      lesions. This presents a clinical challenge to prevent unnecessary resection of indolent&#xD;
      disease, with associated risks of infections, bleeding, diabetes, and costly disability.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is little information on the epidemiology and natural history of&#xD;
      pancreatic cysts to help guide management. This study develops a large, prospectively&#xD;
      managed, electronic, patient-directed pancreatic cyst registry based at UCSF using the&#xD;
      NIH-funded Eureka Health platform. PANC Cyst will facilitate work to improve clinical care&#xD;
      and understanding of pancreatic cysts by prospective follow-up of patients with cystic&#xD;
      lesions, especially the diagnostically challenging small cysts, to identify factors related&#xD;
      to cyst formation and progression to malignancy. Longitudinal data capture that includes&#xD;
      clinical outcomes will also enable us to more precisely define anatomic, radiographic and&#xD;
      biomarker information that can be used to differentiate populations of patients for whom&#xD;
      surgery is indicated, surveillance is warranted, or no further evaluation is necessary.&#xD;

      Patients in this study will have the option of donating blood for biobanking, approximately&#xD;
      10cc of plasma and 10cc of serum. Patients will also have the opportunity to donate a saliva&#xD;
      sample at the time of study registration, or at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, samples that are routinely collected for diagnostic purposes may be collected and&#xD;
      banked at the time of their clinically routine procedure. If a patient consents to the use of&#xD;
      extra material for research purposes, the biological samples will be banked and the blood,&#xD;
      and/or pancreatic juice/cystic fluid, tissues, and saliva will be used for identification and&#xD;
      characterization of potential biomarkers from de-identified samples.&#xD;

        natural age distribution of pancreatic cysts. There will be an approximately even&#xD;
