    <textblock>
      This Phase I trial will enroll 36 healthy adult volunteers. The study will enroll a sentinel&#xD;
      group of 6 younger adults aged 18 to 49 years followed by approximately 30 healthy older&#xD;
      adults aged 50 to 75 years. All participants will receive two doses, 28 days apart. The&#xD;
      vaccine will be administered as nose drops to both the low and high dose cohorts.&#xD;

             and withdrawal are not considered highly effective methods of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female participants who are in same sex relationships are not required to use&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;

             bilateral oophorectomy) or using an acceptable, highly effective double barrier&#xD;
             contraceptive method from Screening until until 28 days after the final vaccination.&#xD;
             Acceptable methods of double barrier contraception include the use of condoms AND the&#xD;
             use of an effective contraceptive for the female partner that includes: OCPs,&#xD;
             long-acting implantable hormones, injectable hormones, a vaginal ring or an IUD.&#xD;
             Participants with same sex partners (abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse) are&#xD;
