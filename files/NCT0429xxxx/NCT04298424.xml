  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients have the deficiency of motivation and confidence in self-management that are&#xD;
      mainly influenced by physiological function, social psychology, emotion and low health&#xD;
      literacy, resulting in poor self-management and glycemic control. According to the study,&#xD;
      elderly patients can learn the skill of self-management more effectively through the peer&#xD;
      leaders who have the same culture background, the life experience in disease care and the&#xD;
      successful self-management experiences. The Self-Management Program of diabetes for the&#xD;
      elderly will be in progress with the peer leadership concept.( the Peer-Led Self-Management&#xD;
      Program). The aim of the pilot study was to explore the feasibility and effects of the&#xD;
      Peer-Led Self-Management Program (PLSM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study uses two groups of block randomized controlled trials with pretest and&#xD;
      posttest study. The test group will conduct a four-week Peer-Led Self-Management Program and&#xD;
      the general outpatient care while the control group will implement the general outpatient&#xD;
      care. In this study, the physiological parameters of Diabetes were used to evaluate the&#xD;
      difference between the pre-and post-intervention measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Most current self-management programs are developed for implementation by healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. These professionals cannot fully perceive disease management needs and&#xD;
      obstacles of older adults due to a lack of similar illness experience. To develop a&#xD;
      self-management training program for older adult peer leaders with diabetes and to assess its&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted in three stages. In stage 1, the peer leader training program was&#xD;
      developed using experiential learning theory as the framework and self-regulation theory as&#xD;
      the strategy for activity design. The 4-week training program was implemented for 4&#xD;
      hours/week. In stage 2, the feasibility of the training program was assessed. A peer leader&#xD;
      training assessment tool was developed and used to evaluate peer leaders' leadership skills&#xD;
      for self-management programs. Peer leaders' attendance rate and their viewpoints toward the&#xD;
      training program through qualitative interview, willingness to lead self-management programs&#xD;
      for older adults with diabetes in the community in the future were also assessed. In stage 3,&#xD;
      This pilot study will take elderly diabetic patients in a community health station in Taiwan.&#xD;
      The program will be conducted by peer leaders who have completed training to lead elderly&#xD;
      diabetic patients and promote interaction, sharing, and support among peers. Improve&#xD;
      self-confidence by guiding elderly diabetic patients to reflect on past self-management&#xD;
      challenges and share successful self-management experiences. At the same time, learn how to&#xD;
      find self-management problems, set goals and develop action plans, and other strategies to&#xD;
      help elderly patients with diabetes set goals for their own health problems, develop and&#xD;
      implement self-suitable, feasible and sustainable self-management behaviors to strengthen&#xD;
      Self-management skills for elderly diabetic patients. The 4-week program was implemented for&#xD;
      2 hours/week.&#xD;
