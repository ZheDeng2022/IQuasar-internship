  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is called Test@Work. In this project the investigators will offer general health&#xD;
      checks and tailored health advice to up to 650 employees in the construction industry at&#xD;
      sites across the East Midlands. The investigators will assess reach and uptake, and evaluate&#xD;
      the views and perceptions of employees, managers and the delivery team. Health checks will&#xD;
      include Body Mass Index (BMI; weight/height), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, mental&#xD;
      health screen, sexual health consultation and an opt-in rapid screening test for human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Employees will be provided with a resource pack with&#xD;
      information and signposting around physical activity, diabetes risk, diet, and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health. A digital resource providing information and signposting about&#xD;
      workplace health screening and HIV testing will be developed and provided to managers at the&#xD;
      participating worksites 2 weeks before their health check event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employees will be offered an additional text messaging service involving receipt of a series&#xD;
      of messages with advice around HIV and testing alongside general health information.&#xD;
      Employees will complete post-health check exit questionnaires and an exit interview. Managers&#xD;
      will complete a post-event evaluation questionnaire and post-event interview. Mixed-methods&#xD;
      evaluation will include assessment of reach, uptake, and intervention implementation&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will collect evaluation data with employees and company representatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employees: will complete exit-questionnaires and be invited to a brief exit interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect by anonymous questionnaire: age, gender, country of birth,&#xD;
      ethnicity, postcode, sexual orientation, employment status (FT/PT, permanent, agency,&#xD;
      contract worker), reasons for attending, health perceptions, prior HIV testing history,&#xD;
      influence of work on health, perceptions of employers provision for health and wellbeing,&#xD;
      perceptions towards HIV testing in the workplace, range of tests undertaken, views about the&#xD;
      workplace health check and future health intentions. Personal identifiers will not be&#xD;
      collected and questionnaire data will not be provided to employers. Those employees who agree&#xD;
      to be interviewed after the health check will be invited to a brief independent confidential&#xD;
      interview with the project researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Company representatives: will complete brief post-event questionnaire and be invited to&#xD;
      post-event interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will ask about the organisational/employee profile, their perceptions of&#xD;
      company provision for health and wellbeing, perceptions towards the usefulness of the&#xD;
      implementation toolkit and towards HIV testing in the workplace, method of delivery and their&#xD;
      confidence to support employees who disclose a positive test outcome, views about the&#xD;
      workplace health check and future implementation intentions.&#xD;
