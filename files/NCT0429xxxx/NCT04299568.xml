  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a very common disorder affecting majority of elderly population. There&#xD;
      is considerable functional disability associated with this disorder. The financial burden&#xD;
      associated with this disease is quite high. Although various forms of pharmacologic and non&#xD;
      pharmacologic therapies exist for its management, but most of these interventions only deal&#xD;
      with symptoms without taking into account the associated factors aggravating the condition.&#xD;
      Research suggests that abnormal loading of an arthritic joint will only increase the pain and&#xD;
      disability. Participation in a regular exercise program involving weight bearing activities&#xD;
      is a successful way to reduce or prevent decline in functional abilities. But the major&#xD;
      problem with this approach lies in its abnormal loading of joint leading to altered&#xD;
      biomechanics resulting in more joint damage. To counter this problem, lower body positive&#xD;
      pressure or anti gravity treadmills have been designed. These treadmills provide up to 80%&#xD;
      body weight support, thus considerably un-weighing the joint while retaining proper joint&#xD;
      biomechanics. So with the help of this specialized training unit, elderly population will be&#xD;
      better equipped to cope with arthritic changes leading to greater functional independence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a very common chronic joint disease resulting in functional disability.&#xD;
      Knee OA is considered to be most common form of arthritis in western countries. Knee OA is&#xD;
      mainly characterized by presence of pain, radiographic evidence of reduced joint space, wear&#xD;
      and tear of articular cartilage and formation of osteophytes i.e., new bone formation at the&#xD;
      center and margins of joint. Pain and resultant joint changes causes a change in joint&#xD;
      biomechanics and an eventual disuse of limb leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. According&#xD;
      to an estimate from a study, knee OA nearly affects 10% of people older than 55 years of age,&#xD;
      resulting in severe functional disability in a quarter of this affected population. In&#xD;
      elderly population, knee OA poses almost the same risk of disability as caused by heart&#xD;
      disease and a larger threat than due to any other medical condition. The prevalence of OA is&#xD;
      reported to be as high as 28% in urban and 25% in rural areas of Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature on knee OA treatment suggest that weight bearing activities in the form of walking&#xD;
      are useful in the management of joint symptoms. Loading across the joint must be optimal so&#xD;
      that there is no abnormal stress on any compartment of the joint. Abnormal valgus and varus&#xD;
      stress results in 4 fold and 5 fold increase in lateral and medial compartments OA of the&#xD;
      knee respectively. But this increased loading on an already worn joint can cause considerable&#xD;
      pain and damage to the joint. For this purpose, aquatic exercises and hydrotherapy are&#xD;
      usually used to counteract the forces acting on the joint. Then there are different types of&#xD;
      harness systems and robotic devices to physically lift the patients for unloading the joint.&#xD;
      But the problem with these interventions is that they do not account for proper joint&#xD;
      kinematics necessary for optimal distribution of forces across the joints. For this purpose,&#xD;
      anti gravity treadmills or lower body positive pressure treadmills are designed which take&#xD;
      into account the proper joint kinematic s while partially un-weighing the joint. These&#xD;
      treadmills are based on NASA technology used for astronauts to counteract the joint problems&#xD;
      experienced by them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These treadmills consist of an air tight chamber surrounding the lower body in which&#xD;
      increased pressure is applied, so that the treadmill causes an upward lifting force. This&#xD;
      results in successfully decreasing the body weight and gravitational forces on the lower&#xD;
      extremity to an adjustable level with a high degree of consistency. Body weight can then be&#xD;
      adjusted to as small increments as 1% and as large as 80% by using positive air pressure.&#xD;
      This method is considered superior to other methods of un-weighing (harness systems and&#xD;
      aquatic therapy) because there is uniform application of pressure over the lower limbs,&#xD;
      thereby decreasing the creation of pressure points (common with harness systems) while&#xD;
      retaining normal muscle activation and gait patterns (which are changed during water based&#xD;
      activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help the patients suffering from osteoarthritis to rehabilitate in a pain&#xD;
      free environment focusing on proper joint kinematics.&#xD;
