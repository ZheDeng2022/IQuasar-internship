      Kidneys retrieved from deceased donors will be randomized for conventional perfusion&#xD;
      (University of Wisconsin: UW) with or without supplementation of thiosulfate, a major H2S&#xD;
      metabolite, and transpl anted thereafter. Recipient's renal function will be assessed&#xD;
      prospectively to determine if thiosulfate improves allograft function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The rise in the incidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) is both a national and&#xD;
      international concern. Renal transplantation is currently the best available treatment for&#xD;
      established renal failure as it not only offers freedom from dialysis but improves survival,&#xD;
      provides better quality of life and is more cost effective.1 Unfortunately there is a&#xD;
      widening discrepancy between the incidence of ESRD and the number of available organs for&#xD;
      transplantation. The number of organs available from these donors has never been sufficient&#xD;
      for all of the patients on the transplant waiting lists. Over the past decade, donation after&#xD;
      cardiac death (DCD) has gained popularity as a method to increase the number of organs&#xD;
      available for transplantation. As expected, our attempts at maximizing usable organs for&#xD;
      transplant with DCD kidneys comes at a price with a higher risk of delayed graft function&#xD;
      (DGF) and graft loss compared to kidneys from standard criteria donors.2 Given that the DCD&#xD;
      group is inherently plagued by longer warm ischemic times and labile cardiovascular&#xD;
      physiology at the time of the donor operation, up to 30% of recipients of DCD kidneys lose&#xD;
      their renal grafts within 5 years and up to 50% in 10 years.3,4 This results in up to 25% of&#xD;
      those patients going back onto renal replacement therapies and then becoming relisted for&#xD;
      transplantation. If current trends continue, the deficit in organ allocation is expected to&#xD;
      rise over the next 20 years due to projected global incidences of obesity, diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension5, which will lead to an increased use of organs procured from increasingly&#xD;
      marginal donors to keep up with the demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a complex biological process involving cell death,&#xD;
      microcirculatory compromise, altered transcription, inflammation and immune activation.&#xD;
      Modulation of IRI particularly in DCD organs (characterized by prolonged warm ischemia&#xD;
      followed by periods of long hypothermic storage), could impact both short and long term&#xD;
      patient and graft outcomes. Importantly, IRI affects all donor kidneys, but the effect&#xD;
      appears to be greatest in the DCD cohort. Indeed, significant efforts have been applied in&#xD;
      the experimental and pre-clinical setting to develop strategies to ameliorate the negative&#xD;
      effects of IRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is currently no active pharmacological agent used during transplantation to&#xD;
      reduce the impact of IRI. Efforts to curb IRI during transplantation have involved either&#xD;
      pulsatile (machine perfusion) or static storage of donor kidneys in various preservation&#xD;
      solutions at hypothermic (4ºC) conditions during the peri-transplant period. Hypothermia&#xD;
      slows cellular metabolism and subsequent ATP depletion during the ischemic period, while&#xD;
      organ preservation solutions contain a myriad of electrolytes and other solutes which help to&#xD;
      maintain osmotic conditions, scavenge free radicals and stimulate cellular metabolism upon&#xD;
      reperfusion. University of Wisconsin (UW) solution is the most commonly used preservation&#xD;
      solutions that has been shown to be the most effective at decreasing the risk of DGF&#xD;
      following renal transplantation.6 H2S has long been known for its unsavory &quot;rotten eggs&quot;&#xD;
      smell and toxic effects at high concentrations. However, it has been later discovered that&#xD;
      H2S is also produced endogenously in mammalian cells mainly via the metabolism of L-cysteine&#xD;
      by two cytosolic enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine -lyase (CSE) and&#xD;
      one mitochondrial enzyme, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various H2S donation strategies have been developed and tested in vitro and in vivo. The two&#xD;
      most often used salts NaHS and Na2S, are among the simplest sources of H2S. They dissociate&#xD;
      very rapidly at physiological pH to generate H2S. The resulting bolus of instantly generated&#xD;
      H2S does not mimic the endogenous, constitutive enzymatic synthesis of small amounts of&#xD;
      H2S.7-9 Another possibility is the use of sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3, STS), a major&#xD;
      metabolite of H2S, commercially available compound and typically available as the&#xD;
      pentahydrate, Na2S2O3·5H2O. It also has functions as a preservative in table salt (less than&#xD;
      0.1 %) and alcoholic beverages (less than 0.0005 %). While these amounts are very small, they&#xD;
      indicate that the general population is consuming STS (Sodium thiosulfate) on a regular basis&#xD;
      and increasing the dose may have important therapeutic applications, especially in ESRD and&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical studies, STS has been used in the treatment of some rare medical conditions&#xD;
      including calciphylaxis in hemodialysis patients with end-stage kidney disease10,11.&#xD;
      Moreover, short term therapeutic use of STS has been proven safe12. STS is also proposed to&#xD;
      be an antioxidant10 and HC-approved for use in cyanide poisoning13,14or cisplatin toxicity15.&#xD;
      Furthermore, vasodilating properties of STS itself have been described16. However, the effect&#xD;
      of STS on the protection of kidney injury and renal graft function post transplantation has&#xD;
      not been described clearly. We hypothesize that supplementation of preservation solutions&#xD;
      with STS will inhibit IRI injury, improve renal function and graft survival in kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients and that this effect will be heightened in recipients receiving kidneys&#xD;
      obtained from DCD donors.&#xD;
