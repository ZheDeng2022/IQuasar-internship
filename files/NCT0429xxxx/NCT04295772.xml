  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single-group, multi-site, open-label study of an islatravir/doravirine&#xD;
      (ISL/DOR, MK-8591A) fixed dose combination (FDC) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in pediatric participants who are virologically suppressed&#xD;
      (VS) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥3 months or are treatment-naive (TN). The primary&#xD;
      purposes of the study are 1) to examine the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of ISL in&#xD;
      plasma; 2) the steady-state PK of ISL-triphosphate (ISL-TP) in peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMCs); and 3) to examine the safety and tolerability of ISL/DOR.&#xD;
