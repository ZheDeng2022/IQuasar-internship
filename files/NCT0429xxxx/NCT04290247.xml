      This study evaluates the sensitivity of Ultrasound for Diagnostic of Fractures of the upper&#xD;
      extremity compared to conventional x-ray in Children 0-18.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the upper extremity are common in children. Approximately 200 children with a&#xD;
      suspected upper extremity fracture are treated every month in the paediatric emergency room&#xD;
      (pER) of the University Hospital of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Land (UKBB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a fracture is suspected in the emergency room, two separate X-ray images have to be&#xD;
      obtained to diagnose or exclude a fracture, according to the current standard operating&#xD;
      procedure (SOP). This procedure has several disadvantages as X-ray imaging exposes children&#xD;
      to radiation and transfer to the X-ray facility is time-consuming. Depending on the suspected&#xD;
      fracture, the broken limb needs to be positioned for the two separate perspectives of the&#xD;
      images, resulting in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this procedure is time-consuming as the work routine of the attending emergency&#xD;
      room physician is interrupted once the child is sent to the imaging facility and then returns&#xD;
      to the emergency room after the procedure. The time between the request of the examination&#xD;
      and interpretation of the results is called therapeutic turnaround time or brain-to-brain&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-ray images are interpreted by the pER paediatrician, and treatment is based upon this&#xD;
      interpretation. A secondary reading by a paediatric radiologist for quality control is only&#xD;
      done later on. This procedure has been adopted by several hospitals internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-ray interpretation by pER paediatricians has been evaluated by various studies, and the&#xD;
      accuracy compared to paediatric radiologist interpretation is around 90% in most studies,&#xD;
      with extremes ranging from 84% to 99%. In the past few years, ultrasound diagnosis of upper&#xD;
      extremity fractures in adults and children has been studied. However, the evidence of its&#xD;
      effectiveness is still limited, and its application in routine care is uncommon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has several advantages over X-ray imaging. It does not expose patients to&#xD;
      radiation; devices are mobile, the examination can be performed in the child's preferred&#xD;
      antalgic position without moving the affected limb, it is always available, and it can be&#xD;
      executed directly by an emergency room physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to demonstrate that ultrasound is at least as sensitive as X-ray imaging and is thus&#xD;
      non-inferior to the standard-of-care diagnostics with X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include pain and time necessary for ultrasound vs X-ray If non-inferiority&#xD;
      can be confirmed in this study, we expect a change in SOPs to replace initial X ray imaging&#xD;
      by sonographic fracture diagnosis for simple fractures of the upper-extremity long bones.&#xD;
