    <textblock>
      Patients who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomized 1:1 to either the lidocaine or&#xD;
      the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lidocaine group, at the end of the induction of general anesthesia, a bolus injection&#xD;
      of lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg, calculated using the patient's ideal body weight and given as an&#xD;
      infusion over 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of lidocaine at 1.5 mg/kg per&#xD;
      hour for the whole surgical procedure and will be discontinued at the end of surgery. In the&#xD;
      placebo group, the same volume of normal saline will be administered during anesthesia.&#xD;

      hour for the whole surgical procedure and will be discontinued at the end of surgery.&#xD;
      Postoperative pain management during the first 72 postoperative hours will involve the use of&#xD;
      a PCIA device, which will contain lidocaine 30mg/kg, sufentanil 2 μg/kg, granisetron 12 mg&#xD;
      diluted to 200 mL in 0.9 % normal saline. In the placebo group, the same volume of normal&#xD;
      saline will be administered during anesthesia. The postoperative PCIA device will contain&#xD;
      sufentanil 2 μg/kg, granisetron 12 mg diluted to 200 mL in 0.9% normal saline solution with a&#xD;
      total volume of 200 ml. All the background infusions of PCIA will set at 2 ml/h, the bolus&#xD;
      volume of each PCIA press is 2 ml and the lockout interval is 15 min.&#xD;
