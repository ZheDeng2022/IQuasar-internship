      This study assesses the content validity of the PGSQ for parents/carer of children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy and GORD, including features such as readability, face validity and&#xD;
      acceptability for completion. This will be done via 6 interviews, with the PGSQ being altered&#xD;
      as identified as required. Reliability (test-retest) of the adapted version of the PGSQ being&#xD;
      assessed with a sample of 20 parents/carers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition, where acid from the stomach&#xD;
      leaks up into the oesophagus (food pipe) causing highly unpleasant symptoms and sometimes&#xD;
      needing hospital admission. Children with cerebral palsy suffer from a poorly contracting&#xD;
      food pipe (oesophageal dysmotility). As a result, GORD is more problematic in these children&#xD;
      and more common; of the 8000 children with cerebral palsy aged 5-16 in the UK, around half&#xD;
      suffer from reflux disease. This is treated with medicines or surgery. There is not an&#xD;
      accurate measure of their symptoms, though there is a suitable questionnaire in well children&#xD;
      (the PGSQ). National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have recommended&#xD;
      research to assess the effectiveness of medicines to treat GORD in these children (NG1&#xD;
      research recommendation). In the first phase, the investigators will ask 6 parents/carers&#xD;
      their opinions about the PGSQ using qualitative interviews, and alter the PGSQ if needed;&#xD;
      then in the second phase, ask 20 parents/carers about their child's symptoms to understand&#xD;
      the reliability of the PGSQ at two time points 2 weeks apart (test-retest). The investigators&#xD;
      won't do any invasive tests on the children but will ask parents about their opinions of&#xD;
      their children taking part in pH-impedance monitoring, which is used to assess severity of&#xD;
      GORD and may be useful in designing future studies.&#xD;
