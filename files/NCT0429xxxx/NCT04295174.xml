      Kidney cancer is a highly malignant disease with 950 new cases every year in Denmark.&#xD;
      Diagnosis and treatment of kidney cancer patients presents many challenges because that early&#xD;
      stages of the disease are often asymptomatic and the disease is thus often at advanced stage&#xD;
      or even metastatic when discovered. Metastasis is a predictor of bad prognosis, because the&#xD;
      presence of metastases excludes the possibility of curative treatment (surgery). Systemic&#xD;
      (medical) treatment is used for metastatic disease. It is of increasing importance to monitor&#xD;
      how patients are responding to the treatment and switch to a different product if the tumor&#xD;
      is not responding. Improved methods for detection of metastatic lesions would be of great&#xD;
      advantaged for the clinicians in order to select the optimal treatment strategy for the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we aim to identify tumor markers in the blood and more specific we want&#xD;
      to investigate whether circulating tumor-DNA can be used as a biomarker for monitoring the&#xD;
      development of the disease during and after treatment. We want a better understanding of the&#xD;
      tumor's heterogeneity and development. Furthermore we want to evaluate the diagnostic value&#xD;
      of dual time FDG- PET/CT for the detection of bone and lymph node metastases in patients with&#xD;
      kidney cancer&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 2-3% of all malignancies, and the European&#xD;
      prevalence is approximately 84,400 cases per year [1]. In Denmark 950 new cases of Kidney&#xD;
      Cancer (KC) are diagnosed per year, and the incidence is increasing annually. KC is more&#xD;
      common in men than in women and the cancer debuts most frequently in the age of 60-70 years&#xD;
      [2]. Early stages of KC are often asymptomatic and the disease is thus often at advanced&#xD;
      stage or even metastatic when discovered. Metastases including lymph node metastases are a&#xD;
      predictor of bad prognosis. Surgical removal of cancerous lymph nodes has been shown to&#xD;
      improve response to systemic treatment and prolong survival [3], but the current methods for&#xD;
      detection of especially lymph node metastases are insufficient. Improved methods for&#xD;
      detection of metastatic lesions at the time of diagnosis would be of great help for the&#xD;
      clinicians who have to select the optimal treatment strategy for the patients. Surgery is the&#xD;
      only curative treatment and also the predominant choice of treatment when possible. Systemic&#xD;
      treatment is only used in case of metastatic disease. Metastatic KC is generally&#xD;
      non-responsive to chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy [2], but a range of other systemic&#xD;
      treatment options has been developed over the last decade. This means that it is of&#xD;
      increasing importance to monitor how patients are responding to the selected treatment and&#xD;
      switch to a different product if the tumor is not responding. The number of patients with KC&#xD;
      identified by chance has increased along with an increasing use of routine imaging for a&#xD;
      number of others disorders [4]. It is still likely that new and improved methods for early&#xD;
      detection of cancer would improve the survival in KC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) is a&#xD;
      well-established method of diagnosing and staging several types of cancer.&#xD;
      2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is the most common PET tracer used in oncologic&#xD;
      studies. PET/CT is not a standard modality in the diagnosis and staging of RCC [5]. The&#xD;
      sensitivity as to detection of the primary tumor is hampered by the physiological excretion&#xD;
      of FDG in the urine. Furthermore, histological characteristics of the tumor such as grade and&#xD;
      expression of glucose transporters can affect the FDG uptake negatively [6]. However, PET/CT&#xD;
      performs well in detection of extra-renal metastases [7, 8] and proved to be of prognostic&#xD;
      value in recurrent RCC [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG is accumulated in cells with increased glycolysis, in particular cancer cells. FDG&#xD;
      accumulation is not specific to tumors and is also seen in benign processes such as&#xD;
      inflammation and infection. This makes it diï¬ƒcult to distinguish malignant neoplastic lesions&#xD;
      from the benign ones [10]. In recent years the concept of dual-time point (DTP) imaging has&#xD;
      evolved. The increase in FDG uptake seems to continue for hours after injection in malignant&#xD;
      tissue whereas FDG uptake in normal or inflamed tissue reaches maximum uptake earlier and&#xD;
      declines thereafter. Thus, late imaging is thought to result in increased FDG uptake,&#xD;
      decreased blood and urine activity and, thus, a better target-to-background ratio and,&#xD;
      therefore, a higher sensitivity [11]. Several studies using DTP PET/CT have been performed on&#xD;
      tumors in the breast, liver, lung, and prostate. Results indicate that the pattern and rate&#xD;
      of FDG uptake over time vary considerably between malignant and benign processes and that DTP&#xD;
      PET/CT allows for distinction between them [12,13]. Hitherto, the use of DTP imaging in RCC&#xD;
      was scantily reported. A recent paper considered the value of DTP imaging of the primary&#xD;
      renal tumor but not of the metastases [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating tumor DNA There is a general and increasing interest in circulating cancer&#xD;
      biomarkers because they might constitute representative readouts of both primary tumor and&#xD;
      metastatic deposits. Furthermore, circulating markers may provide a tool for monitoring&#xD;
      response to systematic adjuvant therapies even after the primary tumor has been removed.&#xD;
      Promising results have been obtained for blood-born cell free DNA (cfDNA) which can be&#xD;
      isolated from a simple blood sample, often referred to as a liquid biopsy. In contrast to&#xD;
      tissue biopsies, detection of cfDNA from peripheral blood is a minimally invasive way to&#xD;
      monitor the disease during treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cfDNA is assumed to be released from most or all of the cells in the body and is present in&#xD;
      healthy as well as sick individuals. Several studies report that specific alterations from&#xD;
      tumor tissue is mirrored in cfDNA and that it is thus possible to discriminate circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA (ctDNA) from normal cfDNA. Studies applying sequencing of somatic mutations in&#xD;
      well-known cancer driver genes like TP53, PIK3CA, and KRAS have been reported and promising&#xD;
      results have been obtained for using these markers for early detection of recurrence in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer [15] breast cancer [16] and lung cancer [17]. A drawback in this approach&#xD;
      is that a considerable fraction of solid tumors do not contain mutations in these candidate&#xD;
      genes. This challenge can be met by using next generation sequencing of tumor tissue to&#xD;
      identify tumor-specific alterations which may then be monitored in plasma. Two recent studies&#xD;
      applied low-coverage whole genome sequencing of tumor tissue to detect tumor-specific&#xD;
      breakpoint and subsequently used PCR-based assays targeting these breakpoints to detect and&#xD;
      monitor ctDNA burden in patients with colorectal cancer [18] and breast cancer [19]. The&#xD;
      method proved to be highly sensitive and specific in the discrimination between patients with&#xD;
      and without recurrence, and they were able to detect metastatic recurrence with a lead time&#xD;
      of 10 and 11 months, respectively, compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, Reinert and&#xD;
      co-workers [18] also demonstrated that the level of ctDNA varied with administration of&#xD;
      therapy and that ctDNA may be used as a tool to monitor treatment response. One of the most&#xD;
      significant and early hallmarks of tumors are genomic instability which represents a driving&#xD;
      force behind the development of therapy resistance and metastasization. Genomic instability&#xD;
      is one of the major challenges in the systemic treatment of cancer because the resulting&#xD;
      tumor heterogeneity is not only difficult to uncover, but also dynamic and thus challenging&#xD;
      to monitor in time. Genetic profiles of tumors are commonly obtained from tissues biopsies,&#xD;
      however these may not reveal relevant tumor heterogeneity and the invasiveness of the&#xD;
      procedure makes them unsuitable for sequential monitoring during disease progression. ctDNA&#xD;
      may represent a minimally invasive way to monitor not only tumor load but also tumor&#xD;
      heterogeneity and evolution towards metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase in FDG uptake continues for hours after injection. Late imaging (DTP FDG&#xD;
           PET/CT) should result in increased FDG uptake, decreased blood and urine activity and,&#xD;
           thus, a better lesion-to-background ratio. By combining this with the pathological&#xD;
           report it might be possible to get a better staging of the kidney cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumor burden, heterogeneity and dissemination is reflected in circulating tumor-DNA&#xD;
           (ctDNA), which can be measured in a simple blood sample. Analysis of ctDNA can be&#xD;
           expected to provide information about changes in tumor load before - and during&#xD;
           treatment, and in patients with metastatic disease and during their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The primary purposes of these prospective trials are to investigate the use of DTP FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT in staging of lung, bone- and lymph node metastasis in patients with KC and to&#xD;
      investigate if ctDNA can be used as a tool for assessment of tumor load, tumor heterogeneity,&#xD;
      dissemination, for monitoring during treatment and disease progression in KC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KIDSTAGE I: DTP FDG PET/CT for detection of lung-, bone- and lymph node metastases in&#xD;
      patients with KC Population All patients diagnosed with KC in The Urological Department and&#xD;
      in The Oncological Department of OUH are eligible for enrolment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KC patients at Urological- and Oncological departments of OUH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to speak and understand Danish&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients below 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with mental impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other malignancy Methods Patients included in the study will have a DTP FDG-PET/CT scan.&#xD;
           The scans will be performed before the nephrectomy/administration of oncological&#xD;
           treatment. The Department of Nuclear Medicine perform the scans with acquisition 1 and 3&#xD;
           hours after administration of the FDG tracer. Images are interpreted by a specialist in&#xD;
           nuclear medicine. Images are interpreted based on visual evaluation with supplementary&#xD;
           measurements of Standardized uptake values (SUV). SUVmax will be determined for both the&#xD;
           early and late acquisition (SUVearly and SUVlate). A retention index (RI) will be&#xD;
           calculated as (SUVlate - SUVearly)/SUVearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary target imaging variables will be &quot;metastases to the lungs&quot; (yes/no), &quot;metastases to&#xD;
      lymph nodes&quot; (yes/no) and &quot;metastases to bone&quot; (yes/no). Secondary analyses will be&#xD;
      lesion-based. In according to lymph node detection, lesion-based describe each lymph node&#xD;
      group. Activity in regional lymph nodes will be recorded according to their location; &quot;renal&#xD;
      hilus (dx/sin)&quot;, &quot;retroperitoneal para aortic&quot; and &quot;para cavale&quot;[2]. During the nephrectomy&#xD;
      the lymph nodes from the above mentioned stations will be removed and placed in separate&#xD;
      containers marked as: &quot;renal hilus dx.&quot;, &quot;renal hilus sin.&quot;, &quot;para aortic&quot; and &quot;para cavale&quot;.&#xD;
      Pathologists will examine the tissue samples. The results of the PET/CT will not be available&#xD;
      to the pathologist. The results of the PET/CT will be compared to results of histological&#xD;
      examination (Gold Standard) and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive&#xD;
      value will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results regarding lung and bone metastases will be compared to the results of the diagnostic&#xD;
      CT scan of thorax/abdomen that is already made for each patient as a part of the standard&#xD;
      examination program. In case of agreement between the scans, the patient will proceed to&#xD;
      clinical treatment as usual. In case of disagreement between the modalities concerning bone,&#xD;
      a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be performed of the lesion of interest. If the&#xD;
      results after MRI are still inconclusive a bone biopsy with emphasis on getting marrow tissue&#xD;
      as well as bone matrix, will be performed. This will in many cases not be possible due to the&#xD;
      size of the lesion and in these cases MRI will serve as reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results will be coded and given an ID according to patientÂ´s CPR number using the RedCap&#xD;
      informatic coding system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KIDSTAGE II: Circulating biomarkers in KC and tumor heterogeneity Population All patients&#xD;
      with KC at The Urological Department of OUH who undergo surgery and all patients admitted at&#xD;
      the departments at OUH who undergo kidney biopsy for suspect renal tumor will be considered&#xD;
      potentially suitable for the enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with KC without metastases treated at Urological Department of OUH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to speak and understand Danish Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As in KIDSTAGE I Methods Sample collection A blood sample (20 ml) will be taken&#xD;
           pre-operatively from each patient participating in the study. The sample collection will&#xD;
           be repeated at the first postoperative day while the patient is still hospitalized and&#xD;
           after 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months. All samples will be coded and given an ID according&#xD;
           to patientÂ´s CPR number using the RedCap informatic coding system. Furthermore, a biopsy&#xD;
           of the tumor on the surgically removed kidney will be sent to the Department of&#xD;
           Pathology. The tumor sample will also be coded according to RedCap. Sizes of the&#xD;
           histological specimen as ported for the study will be of 5 mm x 5 mm x 5mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis The blood samples will be delivered to the Department of Clinical Genetics at&#xD;
      OUH and will be centrifuged to separate plasma from blood cells and both fractions will be&#xD;
      stored at -80C. Isolation of DNA from tumor tissue, lymphocytes and plasma (cfDNA) will be&#xD;
      performed using commercial kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KIDSTAGE IIa: DNA isolated from tumor tissue will be subjected to low coverage (approximately&#xD;
      1-3 X) whole genome sequencing with 2 X 100 paired end reads and long inserts. Sequencing&#xD;
      will be performed using an Illumina HiSeq1500 located at Department of Clinical Genetics in&#xD;
      Odense. The large somatic mutations will be filtered to avoid known germline copy number&#xD;
      variations and will finally be validated as somatic mutations by personalized assay of DNA&#xD;
      from lymphocytes. A considerable number of large somatic mutations are expected to be&#xD;
      identified in all tumors using this pipeline. A smaller number of 2-3 mutations from each&#xD;
      tumor will be implemented in a personalized PCR set-up covering the breakpoints of identified&#xD;
      somatic mutations. Quantification will be performed using digital PCR and a number of&#xD;
      housekeeping genes will be used for normalization. The assays will be applied to 1) plasma&#xD;
      samples to detect and quantify ctDNA and 2) DNA isolated from the cell fraction of the blood&#xD;
      sample in order to validate that the mutations are somatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KIDSTAGE IIb: For 20 patients tumor heterogeneity will be studied by isolating DNA from 4&#xD;
      independent biopsies from the resected primary tumor and from normal tissue (normal blood&#xD;
      cells). Whole exome sequencing is performed at 100X coverage, suspected somatic point&#xD;
      mutations are called by comparing sequences from tumor and normal tissue [20] validation and&#xD;
      accurate estimates of allele frequencies are obtained by ultra deep (&gt;1000X) targeted&#xD;
      sequencing of suspected mutations. The subclonal structure is deciphered by bioinformatics&#xD;
      analysis. This procedure was successfully applied in one of our previous studies [21]. In&#xD;
      order to determine to what extent the heterogeneity is reflected in ctDNA, the ultra deep&#xD;
      sequencing will also be performed on the ctDNA from the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample storage discharge Purified samples will be anonymously stored in a research biobank&#xD;
      for a maximum period of 10 years from collection. After that time, all samples will be&#xD;
      destroyed. In case of performance of further analyses on the samples, than to those&#xD;
      illustrated in the present protocol, both for the aims of the present study or for new&#xD;
      studies, explicit allowance will be previously requested to the ethical committee and to the&#xD;
      respective organs in charge for these purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
      KIDSTAGE III: Circulating biomarkers in metastatic KC and tumor evolution Population All&#xD;
      patients with metastatic KC treated at The Oncological Department of OUH will be considered&#xD;
      potentially suitable for the enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically verified and metastatic KC treated in Oncological&#xD;
           Department of OUH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to speak and understand Danish Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As in KIDSTAGE I Methods Sample collection For patients with metastatic KC in the &quot;good&quot;&#xD;
           and &quot;intermediate&quot; prognosis groups the first line treatment is Pazopanib 800 mg given&#xD;
           daily. This is given continuously until progression. Evaluation of treatment response is&#xD;
           performed by a clinical control at the Department of Oncology every 4 week and with a&#xD;
           CT-scan every 3 month. For patients in the poor prognosis group and for patients with&#xD;
           not clear-cell-type the first line treatment is Sunitinib 50 mg. This is given daily for&#xD;
           4 weeks and then a break for 2 weeks. Evaluation of treatment response is performed by a&#xD;
           clinical control at the Department of Oncology every 6 week and with a CT-scan every 3&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample (20 ml) will be taken from each patient before initiating the oncological&#xD;
      treatment. Sample collection will be repeated after 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months. All samples&#xD;
      will be coded and given an ID according to patientÂ´s CPR number using the RedCap informatic&#xD;
      coding system. An ultrasound guided biopsy of the primary tumor and the metastases will be&#xD;
      taken and sent to the Department of Pathology, OUH. This is a standard procedure for patients&#xD;
      with metastatic disease, who are planned for oncological treatment. The tumor sample will&#xD;
      also be coded according to RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis KIDSTAGE IIIa: As in KIDSTAGE IIa KIDSTAGE IIIb: For 20 patients tumor&#xD;
      evolution is studied by isolating DNA from biopsies from primary tumor, metastasis and normal&#xD;
      cells. Like in IIb whole exome sequencing, variant calling and ultra deep sequencing are&#xD;
      performed. The genomic evolution from primary tumor tp metastasis is deciphered by&#xD;
      bioinformatics analysis, as we reported previously [22,23]. In order to determine to what&#xD;
      extent this evolution is reflected in ctDNA, ultra deep sequencing will be performed on ctDNA&#xD;
      too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample storage discharge As in KIDSTAGE II Sample size Annually 100-120 patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with KC undergo surgery at The Urological Department of OUH and 70-80 patients with&#xD;
      metastatic KC are treated at The Oncological Department of OUH. Approximately 75 patients&#xD;
      will be a realistic no of patients to enroll in the overall study. Since this is an&#xD;
      explorative study and no other larger studies have investigated this, it has not been&#xD;
      possible to make power calculations for the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility The patients will be enrolled in the study when a diagnosis of KC has been made&#xD;
      in The Urological Department or in The Oncological Department of OUH. Contact to the patients&#xD;
      will be facilitated by Louise Geertsen. Collection of blood samples will be performed by&#xD;
      technicians or by Louise Geertsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing, data analysis and ddPCR will be performed at the Department of Clinical Genetics&#xD;
      at OUH. The department has the Illumina HiSeq technology and computing power for Next&#xD;
      Generation Sequencing (NGS) and has implemented NIPT as a clinical analysis. Prof. Torben A.&#xD;
      Kruse and his team has years of experience with NGS and cancer research, and comprehensive&#xD;
      technical and bioinformatical knowledge including detection of breakpoints and copy number&#xD;
      variations from NGS has been obtained[20,21,22,23]. The DTP PET/CT scans will be performed at&#xD;
      The Department of Nuclear Medicine, OUH. The department has years of experience in performing&#xD;
      and interpreting FDG PET/CT and DTP FDG PET/CT [24,25,26]. The images will be interpreted by&#xD;
      Jane Simonsen, PhD and consultant at The Department of Nuclear Medicine or a substitute for&#xD;
      her. Histological examination of tumor biopsies will be facilitated by our collaboration&#xD;
      partner Niels Marcussen, professor and consultant at the Department of Pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects to be considered in KIDSTAGE I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients will be 60 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis, and few if any will&#xD;
      be younger than 50 years. In Denmark the theoretical lifetime risk of dying due to cancer is&#xD;
      approximately 25% for a 25-year old subject. For each Sv the risk of inducing cancer is&#xD;
      increased by 5% compared to the overall risk in the population. By exposure of a radiation&#xD;
      dose of 28 mSv = 0.028 (0.03) the risk increases by 5% * 0.03 = 0.2% after participation in&#xD;
      the study. However, the risk is age-dependent and due to the national guidelines [27] the&#xD;
      present project can be considered as a category IIb research project, because all patients&#xD;
      will be above the age of 50 years. For a research project of this category to be approved,&#xD;
      the benefits of the project should be expected to be &quot;directed towards diagnosis, cure or&#xD;
      prevention of disease&quot; - which is exactly the case for the present study. The increased risk&#xD;
      due to radiation has to be held up against the potential benefit for the patient&#xD;
      participating in the study and for future patients. The potential benefit for the patient&#xD;
      participating in the study is foremost a possibly better staging of the disease. Furthermore,&#xD;
      if the study on lymph nodes shows trends towards usefulness in detecting lymph node&#xD;
      metastases, then this could be of immense benefit for future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations that apply in KIDSTAGE II and III: When we determine the DNA sequence&#xD;
      of the entire genetic material, there is a small risk of finding genetic defects in the&#xD;
      genome. Some genetic defects can cause hereditary diseases and can affect the health of the&#xD;
      patient and the patientÂ´s family. In some cases, it is possible to treat or even prevent the&#xD;
      disease caused by that gene defect and in other cases it is not. In the written information&#xD;
      that the patient is given, this risk will be mentioned and the patient is given the&#xD;
      opportunity to decide how much information they want to know of their own genetic material.&#xD;
      In situations where we find a defect in the genome that can cause disease in the long term,&#xD;
      and where the patient wanted to be informed, the patient will be invited for an interview in&#xD;
      the clinic. During this interview, there will be a genetic counsellor present. The genetic&#xD;
      counsellor will inform the patient about what the information means for the patient and the&#xD;
