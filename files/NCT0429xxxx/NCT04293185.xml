      This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-site, single-dose, Phase 3 study in approximately&#xD;
      35 adults and pediatric subjects ≥2 and ≤50 years of age with sickle cell disease (SCD). The&#xD;
      study will evaluate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) using bb1111 (also&#xD;
      known as LentiGlobin BB305 Drug Product for SCD).&#xD;
