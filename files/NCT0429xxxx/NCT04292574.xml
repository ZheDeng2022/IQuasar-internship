  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a group of different genetic disorders which manifest&#xD;
      themselves in muscle weakness due to loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem.&#xD;
      SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder therefore all forms of SMA are caused by inheritance&#xD;
      of a mutated gene from each parent. If both parents are carriers each infant has a 25% chance&#xD;
      of developing the illness. All forms of SMA have an estimated combined incidence of 1 in&#xD;
      6,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births, with a carrier frequency of 1/40-1/60. SMA is the second&#xD;
      most common fatal autosomal recessive disorder after cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to facilitate a questionnaire based research study in order to better characterise&#xD;
      and understand the disease in the UK. By maintaining a national registry this will help&#xD;
      identify potential participants eligible for clinical trials in the future.&#xD;

      The UK SMA Patient Registry (https://www.treat-nmd.org.uk/registry/) is a joint venture&#xD;
      between the John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre at Newcastle University and the&#xD;
      patient group SMA UK (formerly known as the Jennifer Trust, then SMA Support UK). SMA UK is a&#xD;
      UK national charity dedicated to supporting people affected by SMA and investing in essential&#xD;
      research into causes, treatments and eventually a cure for the condition. The UK SMA Patient&#xD;
      Registry is affiliated with the TREAT-NMD Alliance which is an organisation experienced in&#xD;
      the design and implementation of rare disease registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the UK SMA Patient Registry is to register SMA patients from the UK and&#xD;
      Ireland so that they may be considered for relevant clinical trials, receive the most&#xD;
      up-to-date information regarding standards of care for their disease and help provide the&#xD;
      research community with an understanding of SMA prevalence. Anonymised data from patients who&#xD;
      register in the UK SMA Patient Registry will also be shared with TREAT-NMD as part of its&#xD;
      global network of national SMA registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with a confirmed SMA diagnosis (or pending diagnosis) are eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
