  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of patient knowledge about ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) is a leading cause of&#xD;
      treatment fear with 60% of ECT patients reporting high levels of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using Virtual Reality (VR) to allow patients' to&#xD;
      experience a virtual ECT education session before treatment is useful in lowering treatment&#xD;
      anxiety and increasing knowledge about ECT if compared to standard treatment. In addition,&#xD;
      measuring heart rate and blood pressure levels before ECT treatment will allow us to assess&#xD;
      changes in anxiety levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who choose to participate will be placed (participant will have a 50% chance to&#xD;
      be placed in either group) to view either a virtual reality video to experience a virtual ECT&#xD;
      session, or to receive standard preparation, i.e. a discussion with a psychiatrist. Before&#xD;
      and after this session participants will be asked to complete a measurement of their anxiety&#xD;
      level and knowledge about ECT (ECT Attitude &amp; Knowledge Questionnaire). Just before ECT&#xD;
      treatment, blood pressure, heart rate and anxiety level will be measured. Participants will&#xD;
      also complete cognitive and depression assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help to develop a relationship between healthcare providers and patients and&#xD;
      their families to help with education before ECT treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being used in healthcare, in particular as a form of&#xD;
      exposure therapy for patients with psychiatric disorders. It immerses patients into&#xD;
      hospital-based procedures. We and others showed that VR prep reduces anxiety levels for&#xD;
      elective surgical patients (manuscript submitted). However, the efficacy of VR in reducing&#xD;
      peri-procedural anxiety in vulnerable psychiatric populations has not been assessed. This&#xD;
      will be the first RCT utilizing VR to reduce patient anxiety before ECT through education. If&#xD;
      VR education reduces anxiety in this vulnerable population (as proof of concept), it could&#xD;
      increase ECT success by decreasing anesthetic requirements. Using VR technology, our study&#xD;
      will provide patients and their families with a balanced and in-depth look at ECT safety and&#xD;
      efficacy, and its recent advances in management of psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives of this study are to assess whether creating a VR-ECT-360 video that&#xD;
      immerses and educates patients and their families in the ECT experience 1) enhances factual&#xD;
      knowledge and reduces stigmatizing attitudes toward ECT, and 2) reduces pre-procedure anxiety&#xD;
      as compared to traditional 2D video. The secondary objective is to investigate the ease of&#xD;
      use of VR technology in a vulnerable psychiatric patient population. Given the high rate of&#xD;
      treatment refusals in this population, we hypothesize that implementation of our approach&#xD;
      will reduce anxiety through patient education thereby decreasing chances for treatment&#xD;
      refusal and drop-out rates. We suggest that use of VR will be a clinically relevant approach&#xD;
      in such a vulnerable population (as proof of concept) and could increase ECT success by&#xD;
      decreasing anesthetic requirements (anesthetics suppress desired seizure activity).&#xD;
