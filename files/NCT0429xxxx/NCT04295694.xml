  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fever is a well-known side effect of immunizations. When a febrile infant presents to a&#xD;
      healthcare site, such as an emergency room, a large number of tests are usually performed,&#xD;
      which may include a procalcitonin (PCT) level. PCT is being increasingly recognized as an&#xD;
      inflammatory marker suggestive of serious bacterial infection, and is being used in clinical&#xD;
      practice in the workup for acute febrile illness. Based on an elevated PCT level, further&#xD;
      testing may be done, antibiotics may be started, and the patient may get admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital for observation before identifying the cause of the elevated PCT level. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that immunizations can cause an increase in PCT levels in the absence&#xD;
      of an acute infection. Thus, a finding of elevated procalcitonin in a recently immunized&#xD;
      child may not have the same clinical implication as it does in other clinical scenarios. To&#xD;
      investigate this, the investigators designed this pilot prospective study to compare PCT&#xD;
      levels immediately before and forty-eight hours after the administration of routine infant&#xD;
      immunizations. The investigators will enroll healthy infants presenting for their two, four,&#xD;
      and six-month well child visits at FamilyCare - Children's Medicine Center and receiving&#xD;
      routine immunizations as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.&#xD;

      This pilot study is a prospective study enrolling infants who are currently healthy, have no&#xD;
      acute illness in preceding fourteen days, and were born full term that are presenting at&#xD;
      FamilyCare - Children's Medicine Center (CMC) for their 2, 4, and 6-month well child visit&#xD;
      that includes routine immunizations. Following informed consent, a blood sample will be&#xD;
      obtained from enrolled infants for PCT testing prior to their routine, scheduled&#xD;
      immunizations. The infants will return to CMC to have their PCT levels re-tested at 2 days&#xD;
      post immunization. An infant will be included in the study for only one well child visit; if&#xD;
      an infant presents for a subsequent well child visit falling within our sample visit age, the&#xD;
      infant is not eligible for study re-enrollment. The parent/guardian will be contacted via&#xD;
      telephone at week post second blood draw to determine if the infant has experienced symptoms&#xD;
      or received medical care during that time period. The patient population targeted for this&#xD;
      pilot study will be infants presenting to their pediatricians at FamilyCare - Children's&#xD;
      Medicine Center for two, four, or six-month well child visits on a Monday, Tuesday, or&#xD;
      Wednesday and receiving their vaccines as recommended by the 2014 CDC schedule.10 This is a&#xD;
      pilot study, and therefore had no power analysis performed to calculate sample size. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that there will be a high rate of patients not returning for the&#xD;
      second blood draw, approximately 50%, based on prior patient experience of the investigators.&#xD;
      To achieve the sample of at least 20 patients completing both blood draws and the phone&#xD;
      interview, the investigators will enroll 45 patients.&#xD;
