      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the second most common cause of U.S. cancer deaths in women. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      drugs use a person s immune system to fight cancer. Researchers want to see if a new&#xD;
      combination of immunotherapy drugs can help treat breast cancer that has gone to places in&#xD;
      the body outside of the breast (metastasized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if a new combination of immunotherapy drugs can shrink tumors in people with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older who have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, such as Triple&#xD;
      Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) or ER-/PR-/HER2+ Breast Cancer (HER2+BC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      disease confirmation (or tumor biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      tumor scans (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or bone scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (measures the heart s electrical activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
      echocardiogram (creates images of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The drugs they get will be based on the group&#xD;
      they are in. Drugs are given in cycles. Each cycle = 3 weeks. Participants will be seen in&#xD;
      clinic every 3 weeks, prior to the start of a new cycle. At each visit, participants will&#xD;
      have an clinical exam, have blood drawn and will be asked about any side effects. They will&#xD;
      repeat the screening tests during the study. New scans, like a CT scan, will be done every 6&#xD;
      weeks to see if the treatment is working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get BN-Brachyury. It is 2 different vaccines - a prime and a boost.&#xD;
      First the priming vaccines, called MVA-BN-Brachyury help to jump start the immune system.&#xD;
      Next the boosting vaccines, called FPV-Brachyury help to keep the immune system going. They&#xD;
      are injected under the skin during different cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get M7824 (also known as Bintrafusp alfa ), which is an immunotherapy&#xD;
      drug. Some participants will get a commonly used drug is HER2+ breast cancer called&#xD;
      adotrastuzumab emtansine (also known as T-DM1DM1 or kadcyla). For both, a needle is inserted&#xD;
      into a vein to give the drugs slowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will take Entinostat weekly by mouth. It is in tablet form. Participants&#xD;
      will keep a pill diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue on their assigned treatment until their cancer grows, they develop&#xD;
      side effects or want to stop treatment. About 28 days after treatment ends, participants will&#xD;
      have a follow-up visit or a telephone call. Then they will be contacted every 3 months for 1&#xD;
      year, then every 6 months for 1 year. They may have more tumor scans or continue treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current greater than or equal to 2nd line treatments for metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
           provide modest response rates, and modest improvement in progression-free survival but&#xD;
           no treatments are curative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bavarian-Nordic (BN)-Brachyury vaccine is a recombinant poxvirus vaccine against the&#xD;
           transcription factor brachyury, which plays an important role in the&#xD;
           epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer. A recently completed phase 1&#xD;
           study of BN-Brachyury vaccine showed the vaccine was well tolerated and generated an&#xD;
           immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M7824 is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody against&#xD;
           human PD-L1 fused to the soluble extracellular domain of human TGF-Beta receptor II&#xD;
           (TGF-BetaRII), which functions as a TGF-Beta trap.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1 or Kadcyla) is an antibody drug conjugate used in&#xD;
           second- and third- line treatment of metastatic HER2+ breast cancer (HER2+BC). T-DM1&#xD;
           activates ADCC, dendritic cell maturation, increases TILs, increased PD-L1 expression,&#xD;
           and increased immunomodulatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entinostat is a class 1 histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) which suppresses tumor&#xD;
           initiating cells, regulatory T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as&#xD;
           well as enhances cytotoxic T-cell mediated lysis, direct natural killer (NK) lysis, NK&#xD;
           cell activation, increases PD-L1 expression and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity&#xD;
           (ADCC). In addition, entinostat may also be able to overcome HER2 resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose a Phase 1b trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the stepwise&#xD;
           combination of the BN-Brachyury vaccine, M7824, T-DM1 and entinostat in metastatic&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;

      This study contains three separate, single arm phase 1b trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 will evaluate M7824 and BN-Brachyury in patients with TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If this doublet is determined to have acceptable toxicity (0-1 DLTs of the first 6&#xD;
           patients), up to 19 patients will be enrolled on Arm 2 in which BN-Brachyury, M7824 and&#xD;
           T-DM1 will be evaluated in patients with advanced HR-/HER2+ BC with disease progression&#xD;
           after treatment with THP or intolerance to THP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If this triplet is determined to have acceptable toxicity (0-1 DLTs of the first 6&#xD;
           patients), 19 patients will be enrolled on Arm 3 in which BN-Brachyury, entinostat,&#xD;
           M7824 and T-DM1 will be evaluated in patients with advanced HR-/HER2+ BC with disease&#xD;
           progression after treatment with THP or intolerance to THP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 51 evaluable patients will be recruited for this study, with an accrual ceiling&#xD;
           set at 65 patients.&#xD;

             bilirubin within the normal range and less than 20% of the total. Total bilirubin will&#xD;
             be permitted up to 5 mg/dL, if patients have historical readings consistent with the&#xD;
             definition of Gilbert s syndrome prior to entering study. Adequate hepatic function&#xD;
             for patients with known liver metastases is defined as AST and ALT levels less than or&#xD;
             equal to 5 X ULN.&#xD;

             effects including oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence (pulmonary hypoplasia,&#xD;
             skeletal malformations and neonatal death). For this reason:&#xD;
