    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial aimed at influencing the improvement of major organ functions,&#xD;
      especially the objective response rate, in Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis involving&#xD;
      myocardium.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed according to the 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography&#xD;
      imaging, which successfully demonstrated a significant reduction in the amount of amyloid in&#xD;
      the heart when administered by merging thalidomide and dexamethasone in patients involving&#xD;
      myocardium, and reported that this reaction leads to an improvement in cardiac function.&#xD;
      Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis patients at age 19 or older with refractory or relapsed who&#xD;
      participants should have never been exposed to lenalidomide within 5 years. Planned initial&#xD;
      dosage of the current regimen are as follow;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide : D1~D21 daily oral administration, starting dose 15mg, with an increase of&#xD;
           5mg every cycle, if tolerated, up to 25mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone : D1~D4 daily oral administration or intravenous injection, 40mg(or 20mg&#xD;
           for age for age ≥ 65 years old) Patients will be treated every 4 weeks as one cycle, and&#xD;
           up to 12 cycles of treatment will be conducted. The investigator is working on a total&#xD;
           of 30 patients, the primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate and&#xD;
           secondary endpoints are cardiac/renal/hepatic function, 18F-florbetaben positron&#xD;
           emission tomography imaging parameter, overall survival period, progression-free&#xD;
           survival period, toxicity profile.&#xD;
