  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, there is an increased use of non-medical, invasive cosmetic treatments globally&#xD;
      without sufficient awareness of possible health risks. A particular problem is young men&#xD;
      injecting large amounts of paraffin oil into skeletal muscles especially on upper arms and&#xD;
      chest to increase the visible size of the muscles. Several case reports have suggested that&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of paraffin oil induces foreign body reaction and granuloma formation&#xD;
      and subsequently hypercalcemia. Our hypothesis is that increased generation of activated&#xD;
      vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) in the marcrophages may be responsible for the persistent&#xD;
      hypercalcemia. Now trhe investigators want to include a large group of men who injected&#xD;
      100-10.000 ml paraffin oil to identify risk factors for developing hypercalcemia and try to&#xD;
      understand the pathogenesis of the disease. Additionally, granuloma tissue from selected&#xD;
      patients will be cultured ex vivo to investigate whether they produce 1,25(OH)2D3 or PTHrP&#xD;
      and to test which drugs can most effectively be used to lower calcium levels in these men.&#xD;
      Subsequently, we will try to stratify the men according to the severity of the changes in&#xD;
      calcium homeostasis as we suggest that this stratification will be the basis for future&#xD;
      intervention trials&#xD;

      Today, there is an increased use of non-medical, invasive cosmetic treatments globally&#xD;
      without sufficient awareness of possible health risks. A particular problem is young men&#xD;
      injecting large amounts of paraffin oil into skeletal muscles especially on upper arms and&#xD;
      chest to increase the visible size of the muscles. Several case reports have suggested that&#xD;
      intramuscular injection of paraffin oil induces foreign body reaction and granuloma&#xD;
      formation. The formation of granuloma probably precedes the marked hypercalcemia that often&#xD;
      develops and appears to be difficult to treat. The largest study to date included 14 men and&#xD;
      showed that practically all men developed serious hypercalcemia, but the etiology was&#xD;
      unclear. Foreign body granulomas are like other granulomatous diseases such as Tuberculosis&#xD;
      or sarcoidosis rich in macrophages, (ref) and it has been proposed that increased generation&#xD;
      of activated vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) in the marcrophages may be responsible for the&#xD;
      persistent hypercalcemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated primarily by vitamin D, Parathyroid hormone (PTH)&#xD;
      and Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that rapidly modifies intestinal absorption, renal&#xD;
      excretion and calcium mobilization from the skeletal compartment in response to immediate&#xD;
      changes in serum calcium (ref). Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) is normally formed by UV-B&#xD;
      radiation of the skin and requires two enzymatic reactions before it can bind and activate&#xD;
      the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Conversion of cholecalciferol to 25-hydroxydvitamin (25OHD) is&#xD;
      the first activation step; it is un-regulated and generally exerted by the hepatic CYP2R1.&#xD;
      25OHD is not biologically active and must undergo 1-alpha hydroxylation by renal CYP27B1 to&#xD;
      form the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3. The main actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 is to promote calcium&#xD;
      and phosphate absorption and decrease calcium excretion until inactivated by CYP24A1.&#xD;
      1,25(OH)2D3 is also a powerful inhibitor of PTH and inducer of FGF23, which ensures an&#xD;
      important feedback-loop to maintain an adequate vitamin D status (ref). PTH which is a potent&#xD;
      inducer of CYP27B1, mobilizes calcium and phosphate from the skeleton and increases phosphate&#xD;
      excretion. In contrast, FGF23 that inhibits CYP27B1, induces the in-activating CYP24A1 and&#xD;
      promotes phosphate excretion. Almost all organs has the ability to activate, respond to, and&#xD;
      inactivate vitamin D because CYP27B1, VDR and CYP24A1 are expressed also in most non-renal&#xD;
      tissues. However, regulation of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 is strikingly different in these organs&#xD;
      where high intracellular levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 activates VDR that induces transcription of&#xD;
      CYP24A1 and thereby increases in-activation to restore normal intracellular levels of all&#xD;
      vitamin D metabolites. This autoregulatory control of vitamin D metabolites secures under&#xD;
      normal circumstances that high concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 are not released into&#xD;
      circulation. Regulation of vitamin D homeostasis is different in the macrophages present in&#xD;
      granulomas because they retain a splice variant of CYP24A1 that is not upregulated in&#xD;
      response to high 1,25(OH)2D3 levels, which in part explains the increased release of&#xD;
      1,25(OH)2D3 in granulomatosis disease. Another important issue is aberrant regulation of&#xD;
      CYP27B1 in macrophages, which is induced by inflammatory signals such as interleukin-2 and&#xD;
      TNF-alpha rather than PTH. Previous case reports have detected CYP27B1 expression in&#xD;
      granuloma tissue by immunohistochemistry. However, these findings have to our knowledge never&#xD;
      been corroborated by a more comprehensive analysis of enzyme activity and a recent study&#xD;
      questioned the etiology because most men with granulomas had normal levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 in&#xD;
      serum (ref).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators want to include a large group of men who injected&#xD;
      100-10.000 ml paraffin oil to identify risk factors for developing hypercalcemia and try to&#xD;
      understand the pathogenesis of the disease. Additionally, granuloma tissue from selected&#xD;
      patients will be cultured ex vivo to investigate whether they produce 1,25(OH)2D3 or PTHrP&#xD;
      and to test which drugs can most effectively be used to lower calcium levels in these men.&#xD;
      Subsequently, elucidate whether it is possible to stratify the men according to the severity&#xD;
      of the changes in calcium homeostasis as such a stratification may be required prior to and&#xD;
      form the basis for future intervention trials&#xD;
