  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At CHUS Fleurimont, one in five patients hospitalized for this condition needs to be&#xD;
      transferred to an intensive functional rehabilitation unit (URFI) located in another&#xD;
      establishment of the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de service sociaux de l'Estrie&#xD;
      - Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CIUSSS de Estrie-CHUS). Patients and their&#xD;
      relatives must therefore adapt to a new environment and a new care team, which can cause&#xD;
      additional concern and uncertainty for their new condition. Thus, the importance of educating&#xD;
      the patient and their family so that they understand the nature of the stroke, as well as the&#xD;
      elements and stages of rehabilitation that lie ahead, are essentials so that they can make an&#xD;
      informed choice about acceptance and type of rehabilitation. However, to date, little&#xD;
      material is available to facilitate communication between the professional and the patient&#xD;
      and his/her family. In this perspective, our research team has developed a video which aims&#xD;
      to improve the knowledge of people and loved ones on intensive functional rehabilitation&#xD;
      (RFI) and its care settings. The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect of viewing the video on post-stroke patients and their relatives on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perceived stress&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knowledge on intensive functional rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure participants satisfaction regarding the video&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the association between socio-demographic outcomes (age, sex, degree of&#xD;
           impairment, relation with the patient, NIHSS, MRS) and perceived stress, anxiety and&#xD;
           knowledge regarding rehabilitation.&#xD;

      Rational :&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main recommendations of a committee of experts on the provision of rehabilitation&#xD;
      services in Quebec is that people who have had a stroke should start rehabilitation as soon&#xD;
      as possible once their medical condition has stabilized. This rehabilitation therefore begins&#xD;
      in the hospital center, in acute care, but can continue if necessary in a rehabilitation&#xD;
      center specialized for this purpose. At CHUS Fleurimont, one in five patients hospitalized&#xD;
      for this condition needs to be transferred to an intensive functional rehabilitation unit&#xD;
      (URFI) located in another establishment of the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de&#xD;
      service sociaux de l'Estrie - Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CIUSSS de&#xD;
      Estrie-CHUS). Patients and their relatives must therefore adapt to a new environment and a&#xD;
      new care team, which can cause additional concern and uncertainty for their new condition.&#xD;
      Thus, the importance of educating the patient and their family so that they understand the&#xD;
      nature of the stroke, as well as the elements and stages of rehabilitation that lie ahead,&#xD;
      are essentials so that they can make an informed choice about acceptance and type of&#xD;
      rehabilitation. However, to date, little material is available to facilitate communication&#xD;
      between the professional and the patient and his/her family. In this perspective, our&#xD;
      research team has developed a video which aims to improve the knowledge of people and loved&#xD;
      ones on intensive functional rehabilitation (RFI) and its care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this project are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect of viewing the video on post-stroke patients and their relatives on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perceived stress&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knowledge on intensive functional rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure participants satisfaction regarding the video&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the association between socio-demographic outcomes (age, sex, degree of&#xD;
           impairment, relation with the patient, NIHSS, MRS) and perceived stress, anxiety and&#xD;
           knowledge regarding rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to meet the objectives of the study, a pre-experimental study (pré-/post-test with a&#xD;
      single group will be used. A first data collection will take place (T1) as soon as the&#xD;
      consent form is signed, comprising the following variables: 1) socio-demographic data, 2)&#xD;
      perceived stress, 3) level of anxiety and 4) knowledge of intensive functional&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The video will then be viewed once by the participants during this same&#xD;
      visit. The Intensive functional rehabilitation Knowledge Questionnaire will be&#xD;
      re-administered immediately after viewing the video. Before the discharge from the stroke&#xD;
      unit, between 24 and 72 hours after recruitment, a second assessment (T2) will take place.The&#xD;
      assessments will then be administered a second time. In addition, a questionnaire on&#xD;
      satisfaction regarding the video will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results :&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results of this study are conclusives, the video could be used with all patients&#xD;
      requiring intensive functional rehabilitation following a stroke, but also with patients&#xD;
      presenting other health problems such as head trauma and other polytrauma requiring intensive&#xD;
      functional rehabilitation. The video could also be used and adapted for the other CIUSSS&#xD;
      hospital centers of Estrie-CHUS such as the CH center hospitalier Mégantic, Granby and&#xD;
      Cowansville which also treat this type of clientele.&#xD;
