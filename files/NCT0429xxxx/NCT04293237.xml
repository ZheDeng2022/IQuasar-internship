  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess various aspects of reliability and validity of two&#xD;
      sit-to-stand tests, the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (5TSTS) and the 30-Second Sit to Stand&#xD;
      Test (30SSTS). The tests will be performed by patients after lower-limb amputation who have&#xD;
      been newly fitted with a prosthesis. Each test will be performed with and without the&#xD;
      prosthesis on two occasions: on the first day when the patients will be able to walk&#xD;
      independently with their prosthesis and two weeks later. On the same two occasions, the&#xD;
      patients will also perform three walking tests (in randomised order): the L-test, the&#xD;
      10-Metre Walk Test and the 6-Minute Walk Test. In addition, the patients will repeat the&#xD;
      5TSTS and the 30SSTS one day after the first assessment. The results will be used to detect&#xD;
      the presence of a floor effect, assess repeatability and concurrent validity, as well as&#xD;
      estimate minimal detectable change and effects size for the effect of rehabilitation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the tests will be performed using standardised protocols and technical aids. The&#xD;
      assessments will be performed in the afternoon (after the daily rehabilitation program). The&#xD;
      patients who will be able to perform the 5TSTS will perform that test first. If those&#xD;
      patients will bill able to stand up within 30 seconds on each of the five trials, the 30SSTS&#xD;
      will be performed next; otherwise, the number of times that the patient was able to complete&#xD;
      the transition to the standing position will be recorded and taken as the 30SSTS result.&#xD;
      Repetition of the outcome measurements will not serve to simply use the differences as the&#xD;
      actual outcomes, but will serve to assess floor effect (the percentage of patients attaining&#xD;
      the minimum possible score) on each occasion, to assess repeatability (intra-class&#xD;
      correlation between the measurements on two consecutive days), minimal detectable change&#xD;
      (calculated from the standard error of measurement, which will be estimated from the&#xD;
      correlation between the measurements at the start and after two weeks) and effect size&#xD;
      (difference between the mean measurements at the start and after two weeks, divided by the&#xD;
      standard deviation at the start). In addition, the repeated measurements will be used to&#xD;
      assess concurrent validity in terms of the correlation between the sit-to-stand tests and the&#xD;
      walking tests on two occasions (at the start and after two weeks).&#xD;

    <description>The L-test is a performance-based measure of functional mobility. It is a modification of the Timed Up and Go test that overcomes the ceiling effect in higher-functioning patients. The participant must stand up from the chair, walk 7 m, turn 90 degrees, walk 3 m, then turn 180 degrees, and return along the same path to sit in the chair.</description>
