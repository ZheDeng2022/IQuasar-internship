      Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of fetal right heart doppler&#xD;
      findings in determination of pulmonary maturity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Pregnant women refered to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      at Karadeniz Technical University were included in the study. Pregnant women with&#xD;
      pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, thyroid dysfunction and&#xD;
      fetal abnormality aneuploidy were not included in the study. The study was planned on women&#xD;
      with late preterm and term pregnancy. Late preterm cases between 34-37 weeks were included in&#xD;
      study group and term cases over 37 weeks were in control group. The doppler findings of main&#xD;
      pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery, mitral valve e/a wave ratio and lamellar body&#xD;
      count were determined as the main outcomes. During caesarean section, 5cc amniotic fluid was&#xD;
      taken to measure lamellar bodies count. Perinatal results of patients were recorded. p&lt;0.05&#xD;
      was considered as statistical significance.&#xD;

      MATERIAL AND METHODS This study is a prospective clinical study and it was initiated after&#xD;
      the approval of Karadeniz Technical University Faculty of Medicine Clinical Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee numbered 2017/88.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 2017-2019 years, pregnant women included in the study who admitted to the Department&#xD;
      of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Karadeniz Technical University. The study was planned on&#xD;
      cases who will undergo cesarean section over 34. week of gestation. They were not included in&#xD;
      the study if pregnant women with pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus, morbid&#xD;
      obesity, thyroid dysfunction and fetal anomaly diagnosed aneuploidy or anomaly. Demographic&#xD;
      data, ultrasonographic data and doppler parameters of all patients were recorded and&#xD;
      evaluated prospectively. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to&#xD;
      participation to work. Newborn results after birth were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were divided into two groups. The study group consisted of late preterm cases (34-37&#xD;
      weeks of gestation) and the control group consisted of term cases (&lt;37 weeks of gestation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler data of main pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery, mitral valve e/a wave ratio&#xD;
      and lamellar body count were determined as the main research parameters. In both groups,&#xD;
      fetal thorax and heart circumference ratio, mitral e/a wave ratio, right pulmonary artery and&#xD;
      main pulmonary doppler indexes (PI, RI, S / D, AT / ET) were evaluated before cesarean&#xD;
      section. All ultrasonographic examinations and measurements were performed by a single&#xD;
      operator with color doppler ultrasonography device. Doppler measurements were performed in&#xD;
      supine and slightly left-facing position. Doppler index measurements of two groups were&#xD;
      recorded separately for each pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lamellar Body Count Lamellar body counting; at least 2cc of amniotic fluid not infected with&#xD;
      blood during the cesarean section was taken into the EDTA tube and not centrifuged in&#xD;
      thestudy. The sample was studied by using automatic blood counting device which is used for&#xD;
      counting the shaped elements of blood called Coulter Counter which makes automatic blood&#xD;
      count in hematology laboratories. The value specified in the platelet count part was accepted&#xD;
      as the number of lamellar bodies in the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All data were analyzed using with IBM SPSS Statistics 11 (IBM SPSS,&#xD;
      Turkey). In addition to descriptive statistical methods, Student's t test was used to compare&#xD;
      the quantitative data.&#xD;
