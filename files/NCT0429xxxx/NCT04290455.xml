      Objective: To investigate the efficacy of microblepharoexfoliation by BlephEx™ as an adjunct&#xD;
      to eyelid cleansing in the treatment of anterior blepharitis and to validate the grading&#xD;
      score of lid contamination to describe the severity of anterior blepharitis. Design: A&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, paired-eye trial. Methods: One of patients' eyes will be randomized&#xD;
      into the microblepharoexfoliation group which will use the BlephExTM device during the&#xD;
      in-house lid cleansing procedure. The other eye will be in the control group which will&#xD;
      receive conventional lid cleansing. The parameters indicating the efficacy of the&#xD;
      microblepharoexfoliation procedure including the symptom scoring system; the Standard Patient&#xD;
      Evaluation of Eye Dryness Questionnaire (SPEED), lashes contamination, lid margin redness,&#xD;
      number of preservative free artificial tears used per day, meibomian gland quality and&#xD;
      expressibility will be recorded at the screening visit and 3-week follow-up visit. The&#xD;
      patient will be instructed to do warm compression and lid cleansing at home once a day with&#xD;
      Optase eyelid scrubs for 3 weeks on both eyes before follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be prospective, randomized, paired eye trial. Twenty patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic anterior blepharitis with or without meibomian gland dysfunction who have a lash&#xD;
      contamination score &gt;1 and the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness Questionnaire score&#xD;
      (SPEED score) &gt;= 1 will be included in the study. The criteria for grading of lashes&#xD;
      contamination is defined as: 0= Clear lashes, 1=Slight contamination (involvement of lashes&#xD;
      &gt;0 but &lt;25%), 2=Mild (&gt;=25% but &lt; 50%), 3=Moderate (&gt;=50% but &lt; 75%), and 4=Severe (&gt;=75%).&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the Dry Eye Clinic, Jules Stein Eye Institute, UCLA. The&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from each patient. Patients who have been given a topical&#xD;
      corticosteroid within 6 weeks before entering the study or need a topical corticosteroid or&#xD;
      topical antibiotics as an adjunct to lid cleansing will be excluded from the study. Patients&#xD;
      with concurrent conjunctivitis or keratopathy will also be excluded. Previous topical&#xD;
      medications before patients enter the study such as anti-glaucoma medications and artificial&#xD;
      tears will be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the patients' eyes will be simply randomized into the interventional group in which&#xD;
      the BlephExTM device(1) will be used to perform eyelid margin and lash cleansing. The other&#xD;
      eye will be entered into the control group in which eyelid cleansing in a conventional way&#xD;
      will be done using Optase wipes. In the screening visit, the Standardized Patient Evaluation&#xD;
      of Eye Dryness (SPEED) questionnaire score and eyelid contamination will be assessed to&#xD;
      recruit eligible patients. Before eyelid cleansing, images of the eyelid margin will be&#xD;
      obtained by Oculus Keratograph 5M, Wetzlar, Germany and will be used to grade lashes&#xD;
      contamination and lid margin redness by two independent observers. Parameters of interest of&#xD;
      each eye will be evaluated separately. The primary outcomes are symptoms which will be scored&#xD;
      using the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness Questionnaire (SPEED)(2) and lashes&#xD;
      contamination which will be graded as described above. Other outcomes of interest are lid&#xD;
      margin redness, and the number of preservative free artificial tears used per day. The lid&#xD;
      margin redness is graded as 0=Clear/white 1=Slight redness 2=Mild redness 3=Moderate redness&#xD;
      4=Severe redness. Patients will also be evaluated for concurrent meibomian gland dysfunction&#xD;
      by evaluating meibum quality and expressibility of meibomian glands according to the&#xD;
      International Workshop on Meibomian Gland dysfunction 2011(3). Meibum quality is assessed in&#xD;
      each of eight glands of the central third of the lower lid on a scale of 0 to 3 for each&#xD;
      gland: 0, clear; 1, cloudy; 2, cloudy with debris (granular); and 3, thick, like toothpaste&#xD;
      (total score range, 0-24). Expressibility is assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 in five glands in&#xD;
      the lower or upper lid, according to the number of glands expressible: 0, all glands; 1,&#xD;
      three to four glands; 2, one to two glands; and 3, no glands. Patients who have minimally&#xD;
      altered secretion grade ≥ 2-4 and expressibility ≥ 1 will be diagnosed with MGD. The images&#xD;
      of eyelids will be taken again immediately after eyelid cleansing and eyelid contamination&#xD;
      scores will be evaluated. The patient will then be instructed to perform lid cleansing at&#xD;
      home once a day with eyelid cleansing wipes (Optase) for 21 days. The technique will be&#xD;
      demonstrated to the patient in clinic. The follow-up visits will be at 21 days. At the&#xD;
      follow-up visit, all of the data obtained in the screening visit will be repeated.&#xD;
