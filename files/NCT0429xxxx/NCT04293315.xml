      Introduction: Early detection of certain types of cancer significantly increases the&#xD;
      likelihood of successful treatment and reduces mortality from these causes. However, the use&#xD;
      of screening and the early detection of selected tumors such as colorectal cancer (CRC) are&#xD;
      lower than those expected in our country. The objective of this project is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a multicomponent strategy that improves the screening and early detection of&#xD;
      CRC in the population at risk of Primary Health Care Clinics (PCCs) of the public health&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: people leaving in the catchment area of 10 selected primary care clinics from the&#xD;
      public health system in the province of Mendoza, Argentina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods: a Randomized clinical study by clusters. 10 PCCs will be included: 5 will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive an intervention to increase the CRC screening rates&#xD;
      (improvement cycles) and 5 to the control arm (usual care). 150 participants will be included&#xD;
      in each PCCs, in total, 1500 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: An innovative vision is proposed, which combines a participatory and dynamic&#xD;
      methodology based on improvement cycles. This approach includes the implementation of&#xD;
      participatory learning sessions for health providers, involving the effectors of the design&#xD;
      of the intervention. In the intervention branch at least 3 workshops (sessions) will be held&#xD;
      with the members of the care system, in order to identify opportunities for improvement&#xD;
      oriented to the design and application of an innovative intervention based on best practices.&#xD;
      Each one of the sessions will constitute an analysis of the improvement cycle, following the&#xD;
      following steps: 1) Selection of participants of the initial workshop; 2) Development of work&#xD;
      model based on bibliographic review and initial qualitative phase; 3) Initial workshop with&#xD;
      effectors for training in continuous improvement, objectives, interventions and data&#xD;
      collection; 4) Learning workshops to discuss results, applicability of interventions and&#xD;
      modifications to the work plan; 5) Closing session to evaluate preliminary results and&#xD;
      discuss continuity of interventions beyond the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: 1) Percentage of the population at risk that completes the screening; 2) Percentage&#xD;
      of the population classified as at habitual risk or increased by risk factors.&#xD;
