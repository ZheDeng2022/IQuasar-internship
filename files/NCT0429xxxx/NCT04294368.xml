      This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing standard fortification of donor breast&#xD;
      milk to targeted fortification of donor breast milk in preterm infants. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to determine if there is a benefit to target fortifying donor breast milk in the&#xD;
      preterm population. The investigators hypothesize that infants receiving targeted&#xD;
      fortification of donor breast milk will have improved growth compared to infants receiving&#xD;
      standard fortification of donor breast milk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast milk is the best food for premature infants due to its ability to protect infants from&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late onset sepsis. When a premature infant's mother's own&#xD;
      milk supply is not enough to provide all the milk that her premature infant needs, donated&#xD;
      breast milk is the next best option. One of the downsides of donor breast milk is that it&#xD;
      often does not contain as much nutrition for the developing infant compared to the milk of a&#xD;
      mother of a premature infant. This means a higher likelihood for poor growth in infant&#xD;
      receiving mostly donor breast milk compared to mom's own milk. Due to an inability to easily&#xD;
      measure the nutritional content of donor breast milk, standard practice has been to assume&#xD;
      that the milk has a certain amount of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Based on these&#xD;
      assumptions, a set amount of additional nutritional fortifier is added to both donor and&#xD;
      mom's own breast milk prior to it being given to the infant. Studies show that there is often&#xD;
      less nutrition in the donor breast milk to start with than assumed. Technology is now&#xD;
      available which uses a small volume sample to measure fat, protein, and carbohydrates in&#xD;
      human milk, and hence, calculate the calories in the milk. Using this technology, in this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will customize the fortification of donor breast milk by first&#xD;
      measuring what is in the milk and then adding any additional fortification that is needed to&#xD;
      reach the recommended goals for fat, protein, and carbohydrates. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that infants receiving this customized milk, so-called &quot;target&quot; fortified donor&#xD;
      breast milk, will have better growth than infants receiving the standard amount of&#xD;
      fortification added to their donor breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design involves measurement of macronutrient and calorie content of donor breast&#xD;
      milk using a point-of-care human milk analyzer (Miris, AB). The individual macronutrient&#xD;
      (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) concentrations will be targeted in the intervention group&#xD;
      such that the infant will receive protein of 4 g/kg/day, fat of 6.6 g/kg/day, and&#xD;
      carbohydrates of 11.6-13.2 g/kg/day. Fortification will be added in a step-wise fashion daily&#xD;
      over a 3-4 day period starting when the infant reaches about 80 ml/kg/day in feeding volume.&#xD;
      Fortifiers that may be used in this study include: Abbott Similac Human Milk Fortifier&#xD;
      Extensively Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrated Liquid, Abbott Liquid Protein, Nestle Microlipid,&#xD;
      and Medica Nutrition SolCarb. Participants in the control arm will receive donor milk that is&#xD;
      fortified in the standard fashion at this institution; that is, 4 packets of Human Milk&#xD;
      Fortifier will be added to 100 ml of donor breast milk. Additional fortification such as&#xD;
      liquid protein or microlipid may be added to the donor milk and mom's own milk in response to&#xD;
      poor growth for participants in both groups, as is standard of care in this Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Patients in both experimental and control groups will always&#xD;
      receive mom's own milk first when it is available. Mom's own milk will not be analyzed and&#xD;
      will always be fortified in the standard fashion for both groups. The participants will be&#xD;
      studied until they reach 34 weeks corrected gestational age.&#xD;
