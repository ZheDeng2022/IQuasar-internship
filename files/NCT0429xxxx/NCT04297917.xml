  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first in human study of ChAdOx1-HBV. The study will be conducted in 40&#xD;
      healthy participants and 12 participants with CHB and virally suppressed with oral antiviral&#xD;
      medication. This will be an open-label, non randomised dose escalation study comparing the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 2 different doses of ChAdOx1 HBV vaccine. T cell&#xD;
      responses in healthy participants who have received a prior two-dose series of AZD1222 will&#xD;
      be compared with those who have received the Pfizer mRNA COVID 19 vaccine or the Moderna&#xD;
      COVID 19 vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in man human study of a therapeutic vaccine for chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
      infection(ChAdOx1-1HBV). The vaccine will be given to participants in a dose escalation&#xD;
      strategy (two doses). Five healthy participants will be administered the low dose first&#xD;
      (cohort 1). Dose escalation will only be initiated in the next 5 healthy participants (cohort&#xD;
      2) following Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six CHB participants will be administered the low dose (cohort 3) before the dose escalation&#xD;
      is initiated in the remaining 6 CHB participants (cohort 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty healthy participants (15 who have received two doses of AZD1222 [cohort 5] and 15 who&#xD;
      have received two doses of Pfizer/Moderna mRNA COVID 19 vaccine [cohort 6]) will be dosed in&#xD;
      parallel with the high dose used in cohorts 2 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive 1 dose of the vaccine (intramuscular injection). Participants&#xD;
      (Volunteers &amp; patients) in cohorts 1 to 4 will attend up to 9 study visits and cohorts 5 &amp; 6&#xD;
      will attend up to 4 visits in total. The last visit will be 24 weeks after vaccination for&#xD;
      cohorts 1 to 4 and 12 weeks for cohorts 5 &amp; 6.&#xD;
