      The study should evaluate the biological distribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in patients&#xD;
      with Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non Hodgkin Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the distribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in normal tissues and tumors at&#xD;
           different time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the safety and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose after a single&#xD;
           injection in a diagnostic dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To compare the obtained 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose SPECT imaging results with the data of CT&#xD;
      imaging and/or 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) and immunohistochemical (IHC)&#xD;
      studies in Lymphoma patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Phase I of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodistribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non Hodgkin&#xD;
      Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the distribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in normal tissues and tumors in&#xD;
           patients with Lymphoma at different time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose based on the pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
           of the drug after a single intravenous administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose after a&#xD;
           single intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional research tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To conduct a comparative analysis of the diagnostic information obtained in the&#xD;
      visualization of Lymphoma by SPECT using 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose with data obtained by CT&#xD;
      and/or positron emission tomography (PET) and immunohistochemical (IHC) research of&#xD;
      postoperative material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of&#xD;
      the labeled tracer.&#xD;
