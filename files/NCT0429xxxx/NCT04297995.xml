      A mutilpe-center, open-label, Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and the safety&#xD;
      of HLX10 in combination with HLX07 in patients with advanced advanced head and neck tumors&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study. Sample size recommendations for this phase II study are&#xD;
      determined according to Simon's two-stage Optimal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, 13 patients will be accrued. The patients will receive 3 mg/kg of HLX10&#xD;
      every two weeks infusion combined with 600 mg HLX07 weekly (stage 1L). These patients will be&#xD;
      assessed for treatment response after 8 weeks of first infusion of study drugs. If there are&#xD;
      3 or fewer responsive patients in these 13 patients, additional 13 patients will be accrued.&#xD;
      These additional 13 patients will receive 3 mg/kg of HLX10 every two weeks infusion combined&#xD;
      with 800 mg HLX07 weekly (Stage 1H). If 3 or fewer responses after eight weeks treatment&#xD;
      noted in these 13 patients in stage 1H, the trial will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 4 or more patients are responsive to therapy in stage 1, the trial will be continued to&#xD;
      stage 2, 30 additional patients will be accrued to reach a total of 43 patients. These&#xD;
      additional 30 patients will receive the same dose of regimen as the prior patients.&#xD;
