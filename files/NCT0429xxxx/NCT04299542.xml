    <textblock>
      Image-guided percutaneous lung biopsy is an essential procedure in lung cancer management,&#xD;
      where it is integral to confirming the diagnosis and determining tumour histology. An ideal&#xD;
      percutaneous lung biopsy also needs to have a short procedure time with accurate needle&#xD;
      placement to minimize the inherent risk of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1970s, conventional Multi-detector CT (MDCT) has been the modality of choice in&#xD;
      percutaneous lung biopsy. Recent research has proposed CT fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT (CBCT)&#xD;
      as alternative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual guidance has been developed to improve target visibility and access for these complex&#xD;
      cases. More specifically, it plans a potential computed 3D needle path before the procedure,&#xD;
      using the CBCT images. This 3D path can be transposed onto real time fluoroscopic images to&#xD;
      guide the biopsy, thus potentially improves patients' safety due to more accurate needle&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Image-guided percutaneous lung biopsy is an essential procedure in lung cancer management,&#xD;
      where it is integral to confirming the diagnosis and determining tumour histology. In this&#xD;
      era of personalized medicine where knowledge of specific cellular pathways and molecular&#xD;
      characterization relies on obtaining optimal tissue sampling, the critical question is how to&#xD;
      obtain a high-quality biopsy tissue sample that could be processed for various pathological&#xD;
      assessment from a single, minimally invasive percutaneous image-guided approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ideal percutaneous lung biopsy also needs to have a short procedure time with accurate&#xD;
      needle placement to minimize the inherent risk of the procedure, including the stochastic&#xD;
      effect of radiation, and injuries to structures resulting in pneumothorax, pulmonary&#xD;
      hemorrhage, and air embolism, which could all be potentially life threatening. Previous&#xD;
      studies have also shown that post-biopsy haemorrhage or pneumothorax requiring chest tubes&#xD;
      insertion had worse outcome, increased length of hospital stays, and respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1970s, conventional Multi-detector CT (MDCT) has been the modality of choice in&#xD;
      percutaneous lung biopsy, which requires repeated scanning of the target lesion during the&#xD;
      procedure and the interventional radiologist entering and leaving the CT suite after each&#xD;
      needle adjustment. Recent research has proposed CT fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT (CBCT) as&#xD;
      alternative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual guidance has been developed to improve target visibility and access for these complex&#xD;
      cases. This involves image registration where the real-time imaging dataset is matched to a&#xD;
      reference dataset, where the position of a device is displayed on the current imaging dataset&#xD;
      in real time. Syngo iGuideTM is a novel navigational software which has the potential for&#xD;
      accurate needle guidance in percutaneous biopsy. More specifically, it plans a potential&#xD;
      computed 3D needle path before the procedure, using the CBCT images. An integrated laser&#xD;
      crosshair is also projected onto the patient's skin to indicate the entry point and angle of&#xD;
      the needle at no additional radiation dose to the patient and staff. This 3D path can be&#xD;
      transposed onto real time fluoroscopic images to guide the biopsy, thus potentially improves&#xD;
      patients' safety due to more accurate needle placement.&#xD;

    <description>Conventional CT biopsy will be performed using a 64 slice CT scanner. A preliminary plain CT is acquired covering the entire target lesion with a skin marker, and the interventional radiologist would decide on the skin puncture site and the needle pathway. A post-procedural CT scan will be made to detect pneumothorax or pulmonary haemorrhage. All images will be archived in the picture achieving and communication system (PACS).</description>

    <intervention_name>Percutaneous lung biopsy CBCT</intervention_name>
    <description>CBCT guided biopsy will be performed in the angiography suite. A preliminary CBCT (DynaCT) is acquired covering the entire target lesion is first performed. Image data will be displayed and processed using Syngo iGuide system. A potential needle trajectory will be drawn from skin to lesion. Integration of the cross-sectional images and real time fluoroscopy will result in three system positions: one bull's eye view and two progression views. During fluoroscopy, the planned needle trajectory and target will be overlaid on the real time fluoroscopy image. After the needle reaches the target, another CBCT will be performed to confirm needle position. Biopsy using coaxial system and post-procedural CT scans will be performed in similar fashion as the conventional CT group.</description>
