      Background Stroke-related medical complications and health problems are common among stroke&#xD;
      survivors. Post-stroke Checklist (PSC), developed by an international expert group, and can&#xD;
      be used as a clinical tool to identify common and treatable stroke-related health problems.&#xD;
      PSC has not been systematically tested in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To test the feasibility of a structured and multimodal follow-up model for stroke&#xD;
      systematically, to test the validity of the PSC as a screening tool for stroke-related health&#xD;
      problems and to study the prevalence of, and changes over time, of stroke-related health&#xD;
      problems Study population We plan to include 200 consecutive patients with acute stroke,&#xD;
      treated in-hospital at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö and discharged straight to own&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The intervention consists of a structured follow-up visit, managed by a stroke&#xD;
      nurse, 3 months after stroke followed by a multidisciplinary team rounds resulting in an&#xD;
      individual treatment plan for stroke-related health problems, and a final follow-up at 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility will be evaluated, as well as burden of stroke-related health problems and&#xD;
      interventions prompted by the visits.&#xD;

      Background Approximately 600 patients with acute stroke are treated in-hospital at Skåne&#xD;
      University Hospital in Malmö. Of those, approximately 450 patients can be discharged straight&#xD;
      to their own home after hospital stay. Currently, there is no structured follow-up routine&#xD;
      for patients with stroke discharged from Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, and Primary care&#xD;
      health providers are managing most follow-ups for stroke depending on individual patient&#xD;
      needs. Previous research has shown that one in four patients with stroke are not followed up&#xD;
      within three months after hospital discharge in Skåne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke-related medical complications are common both in the acute phase after stroke and in&#xD;
      the longer term. Acute medical complications comprise infections, falls and fractures,&#xD;
      confusion, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and also epileptic seizures. The&#xD;
      risk of medical complications increases with co-morbidity, but can also be a consequence of&#xD;
      the stroke itself. Beyond the acute phase, other stroke-related health problems occur in the&#xD;
      majority of patients. They comprise fatigue, impaired cognition, low mood, incontinence,&#xD;
      sexual impairment, post-stroke pain, spasticity, relational problems, isolation, inadequate&#xD;
      secondary preventive treatment and impaired mobility and daily activities. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that these problems are common and can persist for years post-stroke. Knowledge of&#xD;
      how to best organize and manage stroke and stroke-related health problems in the long-term is&#xD;
      sparse, even though there are guidelines on some general principles for secondary prevention&#xD;
      and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-stroke Checklist (PSC) was developed by an international stroke expert group. It is a&#xD;
      simple checklist collecting eleven common stroke-related health problems, and can be used as&#xD;
      a clinical tool to identify common and treatable complications to stroke. The feasibility of&#xD;
      the 11-items PSC as a screening tool for stroke-related health problems has been tested&#xD;
      systematically and it has been considered implementable. Modified versions of PSC are being&#xD;
      implemented in different countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSC can be used both by nurses, physicians and other health professions. The National&#xD;
      Guidelines for Stroke Care in Sweden from 2018 recommend the use of PSC for stroke follow-up.&#xD;
      PSCs use has not been systematically tested in Sweden though and PSC is not yet routinely&#xD;
      used. A modified 14-item PSC is recommended by Region Skåne (the county council of Southern&#xD;
      Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aims of this study are to test the feasibility of a structured and multimodal&#xD;
      follow-up model for stroke systematically, as well as to test the validity of the PSC as a&#xD;
      screening tool for stroke-related health problems. The study aims further at studying the&#xD;
      prevalence, and changes over time, of stroke-related health problems as well as survival,&#xD;
      functional outcome following stroke, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working plan Study design The study design is longitudinal and explorative. This is a&#xD;
      feasibility and validation study where the intervention consists of a structured follow-up&#xD;
      visit, a multidisciplinary team rounds resulting in an individual treatment plan for&#xD;
      stroke-related health problems, and a final follow-up at 12 months. Individual items in PSC&#xD;
      will be validated towards routinely used validated tools. The prevalence, and changes over&#xD;
      time, of stroke-related health problems will be investigated, as well as survival, functional&#xD;
      outcome following stroke, and patient satisfaction. The study takes place in the clinical&#xD;
      setting at the stroke unit, using clinical stroke team professional to mimic the normal&#xD;
      clinical situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population We plan to include 200 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke or&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage, treated in-hospital at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö and&#xD;
      discharged straight to own home. The estimated inclusion rate is 3- 5 patients per week, and&#xD;
      the estimated time for including 200 patients is one year. Two hundred patients represent 40%&#xD;
      of the total population of the 500 patients who can be discharged straight to own home, and&#xD;
      are expected to be representable of the population with respect to age, sex, vascular risk&#xD;
      and stroke severity. The generalizability of the population will be assessed through&#xD;
      comparison to the Swedish Stroke Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for inclusion Eligible patients are identified daily in the stroke ward and&#xD;
      included by written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up procedure The three-months visit is managed by a stroke nurse and include the&#xD;
      semi-structured PSC interview, additional validated diagnostic tools, secondary prevention&#xD;
      status, comorbidity, and functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three-months visit is followed by a multidisciplinary team rounds with stroke physician,&#xD;
      stroke nurse, occupational therapist and if needed physiotherapist, speech therapist,&#xD;
      dietician, psychologist and/or social worker. The rounds result in an individual treatment&#xD;
      recommendation plan that is sent to the family doctor and other relevant instances. The&#xD;
      amount and type of referrals and other interventions warranted by the results of the&#xD;
      follow-up visits and rounds are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12-months visit is managed by a stroke nurse and include a new semi-structured PSC&#xD;
      interview, secondary prevention status, comorbidity, and a met needs assessment. The 12-month&#xD;
      visit is followed by a multidisciplinary team rounds leading to referrals and other&#xD;
      interventions are if warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of other register data Patient baseline characteristics and three- and 12-month data on&#xD;
      living conditions and functional level will be obtained from the Swedish Stroke Register&#xD;
      (Riksstroke). Mortality at 12 and 18 months will be obtained by linkage to the Swedish Causes&#xD;
      of Death register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management, statistical analyses and ethical considerations The database will be built&#xD;
      and managed in close cooperation with Clinical Studies Sweden, Forum South. Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed on de-identified data after the dataset has been closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be performed in SPSS. Data will be presented using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and graphs, as well as linear models. Power calculations are not relevant for this&#xD;
      study type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local Ethics approval committee has approved of the project (Dnr 2017/1028)&#xD;
