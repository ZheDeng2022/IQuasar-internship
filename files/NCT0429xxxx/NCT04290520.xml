  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of embryo transfers after freezing has increased over the last 10 years due to&#xD;
      improvements in embryo freezing techniques and in particular the development of&#xD;
      vitrification. This has also been made possible by changes in clinical protocols favouring&#xD;
      freezing in patients at high risk of hyperstimulation and by different methods of endometrial&#xD;
      preparation to receive embryos after rewarming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, embryo transfer requires endometrial preparation to make implantation possible.&#xD;
      There are various protocols for endometrial preparation. Endometrial preparations in the&#xD;
      natural cycle, with or without induction of ovulation by FSH, require more regular&#xD;
      monitoring, and allow the development of a main follicle that will give a corpus luteum that&#xD;
      will secrete progesterone in the luteal phase, which can be supported by the supply of&#xD;
      exogenous progesterone. In contrast, endometrial preparations in hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      (HRT) cycles are done by administering estradiol orally or transdermally to stimulate&#xD;
      endometrial growth while blocking the patient's gonadotropic axis, and administering&#xD;
      progesterone in the luteal phase to differentiate the endometrium. This preparation has the&#xD;
      advantage of being simpler to monitor and organize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no consensus on a type of preparation that would give better results, and&#xD;
      although the literature seems to show that there would be more miscarriages in a substituted&#xD;
      cycle, there does not seem to be any difference in the birth rate per cycle in the end,&#xD;
      whatever the type of endometrial preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some teams have shown that in HRT, there appears to be more miscarriage when the progesterone&#xD;
      level measured on the day of the frozen embryo transfer is lower, especially below a&#xD;
      threshold of 9ng/mL. Labarta showed ESHRE in July 2019 that modifying the endometrial&#xD;
      preparation if the progesterone level is below 9ng/mL on the day of transfer by adding&#xD;
      subcutaneous progesterone (Progiron) resulted in a lower miscarriage rate, comparable to the&#xD;
      usual miscarriage rates in spontaneous pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, if the miscarriage rate is higher in HRT than in the natural cycle, and if this is&#xD;
      related to &quot;luteal insufficiency&quot; characterized by a lower circulating serum progesterone&#xD;
      level, the hypothesis of this study in the investigator's population would be that the serum&#xD;
      progesterone level on the day of the frozen embryo transfer would be lower in HRT than in the&#xD;
      spontaneous cycle.&#xD;
