  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the incidence of postoperative urinary retention&#xD;
      related to spinal anesthesia with morphine and spinal anesthesia associated with peripheral&#xD;
      blockade in orthopedic procedures of lower limbs. Secondary objectives are assessing the&#xD;
      incidence of nausea and vomiting; postoperative pain and opioid consumption at 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery with each of the techniques. A total of 52 patients submitted to a lower limb&#xD;
      orthopedic procedure were randomized to the intervention groups: spinal anesthesia with&#xD;
      morphine versus spinal anesthesia without opioid associated with peripheral nerve block.&#xD;
      After surgery, bladder ultrasound will be performed in post-anesthesia care unit to identify&#xD;
      urinary retention and patients will be followed for 24 hours to assess outcomes.&#xD;

      This is a randomized clinical trial with simple blinding (the outcome evaluator is blind).&#xD;
      Approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre under&#xD;
      number 20160043 and Plataforma Brasil CAAE 57623815.1.0000.5327.To calculate the sample size,&#xD;
      the program WinPEPI, version 11.43, was used. Considering 80% power, 5% significance level&#xD;
      and data reported by Tomaszewski, Balkota and Machowicz (RUPO incidence of 42.86% of the&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia group with morphine requiring urinary catheterization and 6.25% in patients&#xD;
      undergoing peripheral nerve block ). The sample size found was 26 subjects in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS STATISTICS software version 23. Absolute and&#xD;
      percentage frequencies were calculated for qualitative variables. And mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation and interquartile range for quantitative variables. The normality of the&#xD;
      quantitative variables was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The chi-square test was used to&#xD;
      assess the difference in the incidence of catheterization in the two groups and the incidence&#xD;
      of nausea and vomiting in 24 hours. To evaluate the difference in the mean time to urination,&#xD;
      even after sounding, the Student's t test for independent samples was used. Doses of codeine&#xD;
      and morphine at 24 hours and assessment of pain on movement and rest at 12 and 24 hours (by&#xD;
      the visual analog scale of pain) were assessed by the Mann Whitney test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The 52 patients included in the survey were&#xD;
      allocated randomly to one of the study groups. Randomization was performed immediately before&#xD;
      the interventions studied using the electronic random allocation application Randomizer for&#xD;
      Clinical Trial for iPad / iPhone, developed by the company Medsharing&#xD;
      (http://www.ecrfmedsharing.com/iphone_ipad_randomization.php).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received spinal anesthesia. The technique included sterile preparation of the&#xD;
      puncture site at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 level using Whitacre 27G or 25G needles. Group 1 patients&#xD;
      received subarachnoid block with 20 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine + 200 mcg of morphine and&#xD;
      group 2 patients received subarachnoid block with 20 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve block.Peripheral nerve blocks were performed after spinal anesthesia, before&#xD;
      the start of the surgical procedure under ultrasound visualization associated with the use of&#xD;
      neurostimulator. The choice of the nerve to be blocked was based on the innervation related&#xD;
      to analgesia of the surgical site: femoral nerve block or sciatic nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-anesthetic care unit, the following parameters were assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for bladder catheterization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time for spontaneous urination (time in minutes between subarachnoid block and&#xD;
           spontaneous urination);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of pain and the need to use opioids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of nausea / vomiting and the need to use antiemetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated at 12 and 24 hours after the surgical procedure for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for bladder catheterization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time for the first spontaneous urination (with or without previous relief bladder&#xD;
           catheter);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of nausea / vomiting;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain assessment by analogue-visual scale from 0 to 10, at the operated site, at rest and&#xD;
           during movement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need to use opioids, noting which opioid and dose used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative prescription was standardized:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracetamol 500 mg orally 6/6 hours fixed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dipyrone 1 g intravenous 6/6 hours fixed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Codeine 30 mg orally 6/6 hours, if mild to moderate pain using an analogue-visual scale&#xD;
           (1 to 6);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morphine 3 mg intravenously up to 3/3 hours, if severe pain by analogue-visual scale (7&#xD;
           to 10);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ondasentron 4 mg intravenously up to 8/8 hours, if nausea / vomiting is present.&#xD;
