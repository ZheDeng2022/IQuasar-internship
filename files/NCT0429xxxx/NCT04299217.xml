  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effects of a single dose of Zynamite® on performance across a&#xD;
      number of cognitive domains (attention, working memory, episodic memory, executive function),&#xD;
      as well as during a period of cognitively demanding task performance, and during&#xD;
      laboratory-induced stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-two healthy healthy males (50%) and females (50%) aged 18-45 years will be recruited&#xD;
      from the general population. Participants will be randomised to receive either Zynamite® or&#xD;
      placebo at testing visit 1, then the treatment they have not already received at testing&#xD;
      visit 2. A single acute dose will be administered on each of the two testing visits, with at&#xD;
      least a seven day washout period in between. The study is quantitative; participants will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires assessing mood, cognitive tasks and an Observed Multitasking Stressor&#xD;
      (OMS) task (with saliva samples, and blood samples for 50% of the sample). The cognitive/mood&#xD;
      assessments will take place at baseline, then at 30, 180 and 300 minutes post-dose. The OMS&#xD;
      assessments will take place at baseline then between 90 and 130 minutes post-dose. For&#xD;
      participants in the bloods sub-sample, blood samples will be taken at baseline and after the&#xD;
      300 minute post-dose assessment. Both testing visits will be identical apart from the&#xD;
      treatment allocated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the effects of a single dose of Zynamite® on performance&#xD;
      across a number of cognitive domains (attention, working memory, episodic memory, executive&#xD;
      function), as well as during a period of cognitively demanding task performance, and during&#xD;
      laboratory-induced stress. Zynamite®'s effects will also be assessed in terms of mood, and&#xD;
      its ability to modulate the physiological and psychological response to an acute stressor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over&#xD;
      design, with treatment (Zynamite®, placebo) as a factor. Seventy-two healthy males (50%) and&#xD;
      females (50%) aged 18-45 years will be recruited using opportunity sampling. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomised to receive either Zynamite® or placebo at testing visit 1, then the&#xD;
      treatment they have not already received at testing visit 2. A single acute dose will be&#xD;
      administered on each of the two testing visits, with at least a seven day washout period in&#xD;
      between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will take place in a suite of testing facilities at the Brain, Performance and&#xD;
      Nutrition Research Centre with participants visually isolated from each other. Participants&#xD;
      will attend the laboratory on 3 separate occasions, an introductory visit and two testing&#xD;
      days (Day 1 and Day 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (screening/training) The Introductory visit to the laboratory will comprise: briefing&#xD;
      on requirements of the study, obtaining of informed consent, health screening, completion of&#xD;
      the Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (CCQ), training on the cognitive and mood measures and&#xD;
      collection of demographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 Participants will attend the laboratory at a pre-arranged time in the morning having&#xD;
      consumed a standardised breakfast of cereal and/ or toast at home no later than an hour&#xD;
      before arrival. They must have refrained from alcohol for 24 hours and caffeine overnight. On&#xD;
      arrival on each day participants will have a baseline rested measurement taken of their heart&#xD;
      rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) taken, will complete the Profile of Mood States&#xD;
      (POMS)(Mood/depression/arousal) followed by a 60 minute computerised cognitive assessment&#xD;
      (COMPASS - including the Cognitive Demand Battery). This will be followed by completion of&#xD;
      the Observed Multitasking Stressor (OMS) test session. This 5-10 minute OMS takes place under&#xD;
      observation (which will include being observed by a panel and video and voice recordings)&#xD;
      comprises provision of a saliva sample, completion of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (STAI)-state, and visual analogue scales (VAS) which are completed before and after the&#xD;
      stressor. The stressor comprises the performance of a verbal Serial 7s subtraction task&#xD;
      whilst concomitantly performing a computerised tracking task. Finally a further saliva sample&#xD;
      is taken. HR and GSR are recorded throughout. After the first cognitive/OMS assessment&#xD;
      participants will take their treatment for the day and will undergo cognitive/mood&#xD;
      assessments identical to the above at 30 minutes, 180 minutes and 300 minutes post-dose. The&#xD;
      post-dose OMS assessment will take place between 90 and 130 minutes post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken from 50% of the participants both before the pre-dose, baseline&#xD;
      assessment and after the 300 minute post-dose assessment. The two testing days (Day 1/Day2)&#xD;
      will be identical, with the exception that participants will take a different treatment on&#xD;
      each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (at least 7 days later) The methodology during this visit will be identical to visit&#xD;
      2, with the exception that participants will consume a different treatment during this visit.&#xD;
