    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      intralesional injection of STP705 in adult patients with Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma in&#xD;
      situ (isSCC, Bowen's disease). The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of various doses of STP705 administered as Intralesional injection&#xD;
      in subjects with isSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safe and effective recommended dose of STP705 for the treatment of&#xD;
           isSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of biomarkers common to isSCC formation pathway including TGF-β1 and COX-2.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This open label, dose escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      various doses of STP705 administered as an intralesional injection in subjects with cutaneous&#xD;
      in situ squamous cell carcinoma (isSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      various doses of STP705 administered as an Intralesional injection in subjects with cutaneous&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma in situ skin cancer (isSCC). This study seeks to establish a safe and&#xD;
      effective recommended dose of STP705 for the treatment of isSCC. Expression of biomarkers&#xD;
      common to the isSCC formation pathway, including TGF-β1 and COX-2, will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the proportion of participants with histological clearance of&#xD;
      treated isSCC lesion at the End of Treatment (EOT). Histological clearance (HC) will be&#xD;
      defined as the absence of detectable evidence of isSCC tumor cell nests as determined by&#xD;
      central pathology review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include i) time to histological clearance of treated isSCC lesion&#xD;
      over the 6 week treatment period, ii) proportion of participants with complete clinical&#xD;
      clearance of treated isSCC lesion based on investigator assessment at the End of Treatment&#xD;
      (EOT), iii) time to complete clinical clearance of treated isSCC lesion based on investigator&#xD;
      assessment over the 6 week treatment period, and iv) the change in size of the treated isSCC&#xD;
      lesion over the 6 week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the number of incidence of adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      and serious adverse events (SAEs); the incidence of AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuation&#xD;
      of trial medication; the incidence and severity of Local Skin Response (LSR);&#xD;
      hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation following treatment; and the tolerability of repeated&#xD;
      Intralesional administration of STP705 as assessed by investigator-evaluation of injection&#xD;
      site reactions for all patients and within each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, safety measures will include clinically relevant changes or new abnormal&#xD;
      findings in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical&#xD;
      examination variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 adult patients are planned to be enrolled in the study. They will be divided equally among&#xD;
      5 cohorts (10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 μg dose levels) of 5 subjects each. Enrollment of the first&#xD;
      two subjects in each dosing cohort will be staggered by at least 48 hours. Participants in&#xD;
      the first cohort will attend the study center once weekly for an injection of STP705 into the&#xD;
      isSCC lesion. The participants will receive injections of STP705 once a week for up to 6&#xD;
      weeks. The clinician will evaluate the tumor for clinical changes and reduction in size at&#xD;
      each treatment visit for up to 6 weeks. If during the 6 weeks of treatment there is complete&#xD;
      clinical clearance of the tumor, the treatments will end. At the End of Treatment visit, the&#xD;
      residual tumor, or former tumor location will be excised for analysis. In the absence of dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLT), the subsequent cohorts will receive increasing doses of STP705,&#xD;
      following the same schedule of administration as the first cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of the SAEs or dose limiting toxicities outlined above has occurred, the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will conduct independent review of the data and will make a final&#xD;
      decision for dose escalation to the next cohort.&#xD;
