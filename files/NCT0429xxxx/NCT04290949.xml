      To assess the platelet indices in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is a type of acute coronary artery disease (CAD), It is a&#xD;
      highly prevalent group of emergency diseases, associated with high morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACS include ST- elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), non ST-Elevation Myocardial&#xD;
      Infarction (NSTEMI) and Unstable Angina (UA) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACS characterized by plaque rupture and acute thrombosis formation in the coronary arteries&#xD;
      (3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      platelet morphology and function have vital roles in the pathogenesis of many diseases&#xD;
      related to coagulation, thrombosis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets play a crucial role in thrombotic episodes, its activation is acritical factor in&#xD;
      the creation and evolution of atherothrombosis. (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not only platelets are essential for the thrombotic vascular occlusion at the ruptured&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque but also they contribute to the obstruction and impairment of coronary&#xD;
      micro circulation (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk stratification plays a crucial role in the management of patients with ACS (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients estimated to be at higher risk may be managed with earlier and more aggressive&#xD;
      treatment, whereas those with lower risk may be managed with less intensive treatment (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many biomarkers have been evaluated, and various scores have been created for risk&#xD;
      stratification of ACS patients (9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean platelet volume (MPV) has been proposed as a primary marker for platelet activation, as&#xD;
      larger sized platelets have been associated with higher pro-thrombotic risk, and its&#xD;
      measurement is easy and time effective (10-14)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So It may elevate in patients with ACS and its role, It could be a useful bio marker of&#xD;
           risk of stratification (15)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet Distribution Width (PDW) measured on admission is a cheap and generally&#xD;
           available biomarker which allows for predicting the development of heart failure in&#xD;
           patients with ACS after PCI (16)&#xD;
&#xD;
      showed that an increased level of PDW was related to the severity of CAD in patients with ACS&#xD;
      (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies support the association of Mean platelet volume (MPV) with adverse cardiac&#xD;
      outcomes as restenosis stent thrombosis in patients with ACS (19-24) al.2011&#xD;
