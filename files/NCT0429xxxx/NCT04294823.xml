    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection can be diagnosed by invasive (i.e., endoscopy and&#xD;
      biopsy) and non-invasive techniques . The most accurate non-invasive tests for diagnosing&#xD;
      active H. pylori are the 13C-urea breath test and the stool antigen test3 Several guidelines&#xD;
      for the management of dyspeptic patients in primary care settings recommend the use of&#xD;
      non-invasive tests for H. pylori in the initial management of dyspeptic patients (test and&#xD;
      treat strategy)3 . This strategy has been tested in a number of clinical settings and has&#xD;
      been shown to be effective from both a clinical and a cost perspective The urea breath test&#xD;
      (UBT) and the stool antigen test are very sensitive and specific except in patients taking&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI) 678 In patients taking PPI, a positive test remains reliable for&#xD;
      the detection of H. pylori but the number of false negative tests rises dramatically reducing&#xD;
      the sensitivity of these tests. PPI are widely available and are over-thecounter agents in&#xD;
      some countries (e.g. USA, Sweden). Clinicians are frequently confronted with making a&#xD;
      diagnosis of H. pylori infection in patients who may knowingly or unknowingly be taking PPI.&#xD;
      Currently available breath and stool tests are reliable 12 - 14 days after discontinuation of&#xD;
      the PPI. This results in the cost and inconvenience of another visit and the possibility of&#xD;
      symptoms in some patients when the PPI is withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanism by which acid inhibition causes a false negative reaction is&#xD;
      unclear, some studies have suggested that acidification of the stomach may reverse the&#xD;
      abnormality Results have been inconsistent, however, and how to acidify the stomach and to&#xD;
      what extent this should be done is unclear. Standardised test meals are routinely&#xD;
      administered with the breath test substrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the 13C-urea breath&#xD;
      test administered with the new test meal in patients with dyspepsia and GERD taking PPI.&#xD;

    <description>In every breath sample the 13C02 / total C02 ratio will be determined at baseline and at 30 min after ingestion of the urea-BC solution.&#xD;
The delta over baseline (DOB) or AÃ¶-value [0/00] will be calculated from the difference of the 13C02 / total C02 ratio 30 min after intake of the BC solution and at baseline. urea- The test for the standard test meal is positive if DOB or the A6-vaIue is greater than 4 0/00.&#xD;
The test for the new test meal is positive if DOB or the A6-vaiue is greater than 2.5 0/00. Coefficients of correlation between DOB and the histology score for H. pylori in antrum and corpus using the Updated Sydney System, sex, age and BMI.</description>

    <description>An internal physical examination including vital signs measurements and a 13C-UBT with the standard test meal (Helicobacter Test INFAI) will be performed. Patients with a positive UBT will undergo upper endoscopy. All biopsy samples will be analysed in the local laboratory of the centre. Patients with a negative UBT will undergo also upper endoscopy. Endoscopic procedures and subsequent investigations will be identical in patients with a positive and with a negative UBT. H. pylori positive and negative patients will perform the 13 C-UBT breath tests with new test meal on Day 30. The study will be conducted in outpatients. Starting on Day 1, H. pylori positive and negative patients will take Nexium mups 40 mg orally once daily, 30 min before breakfast. Patients will return to the hospital/medical practice for UBT breath tests with new test meal on Day 30. Patients will be followed-up for 7 days after discontinuation of PPI treatment.</description>
