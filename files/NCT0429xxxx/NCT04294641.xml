      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) can occur after a person has had a stem cell or&#xD;
      bone marrow transplant. In cGVHD, the donor cells attack the recipient s body. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see if a drug called ibruntinib can block one of the proteins that lead to the immune&#xD;
      reaction that causes cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if ibrutinib as a first-line treatment can help people with newly diagnosed cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 and older with newly diagnosed moderate or severe cGVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with&#xD;
&#xD;
      medical and medicine histories&#xD;
&#xD;
      physical exam and vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (to measure heart function)&#xD;
&#xD;
      assessment of their ability to perform daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      assessment of their general well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the Clinical Center every 2 weeks for the first 2 months. Then they&#xD;
      will visit every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take ibrutinib by mouth once every day of every cycle. One cycle is 28&#xD;
      days. Treatment will last up to 2 years. Participants will keep a medicine diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take tests to measure lung function. They may have computed tomography&#xD;
      scans of their chest. They will complete questionnaires about their symptoms and how cGVHD is&#xD;
      affecting their body and quality of life. They will repeat the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have optional blood tests and/or skin biopsies to better understand the drug&#xD;
      s effect on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by phone 30 days after treatment ends. They will also be&#xD;
      contacted once a year for 2 years to discuss how they are feeling and if they have taken any&#xD;
      other medicines to treat cGVHD.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is the leading cause of late morbidity and&#xD;
           non-relapse mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
           (alloHSCT), occurring in 40-60% long-term survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic GvHD occurs due to the dysfunctional peripheral tolerance during post-transplant&#xD;
           hematopoietic reconstitution that allows the development and persistence of alloreactive&#xD;
           donor-derived T and B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone is the front-line therapy; however, about 50% of participants have&#xD;
           steroid-refractory disease and there is no standard second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most attractive approach for controlling chronic GvHD would be early therapy&#xD;
           intervention which could prevent the most severe and irreversible clinical&#xD;
           manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-B-cell therapy delivered early in chronic GvHD could be effective and&#xD;
           steroid-sparing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ibrutinib, reversible small molecule inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase, has been&#xD;
           shown to be well-tolerated and effective in phase 1b/2 trial for steroid refractory&#xD;
           chronic GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate efficacy of ibrutinib as a first-line treatment for persons with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      chronic GvHD by measuring the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial&#xD;
      response [PR]) at 6 months, according to the 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newly diagnosed, moderate or severe chronic GvHD according to the 2014 NIH Consensus&#xD;
           Criteria, requiring systemic immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of prior alloHSCT; any donors, conditioning regimens and graft sources are&#xD;
           allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate cardiac, hepatic and other organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate laboratory parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-center, non-randomized, phase II study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two-stage design will be used to determine the overall response rate (CR + PR) at 6&#xD;
           months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous daily dose of ibrutinib 420 mg by mouth, with the potential for dose&#xD;
           reductions to 280 mg and 140 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The accrual ceiling will be set at 40 participants, allowing for a total of up to 28&#xD;
           evaluable subjects.&#xD;

             ibrutinib,&#xD;
&#xD;
