      This trial studies the impact of the breast cancer pathways program on the patient&#xD;
      experience, including decision making and quality of life. Measuring how the breast cancer&#xD;
      pathways program affects decision making and quality of life in patients may help doctors&#xD;
      improve cancer education.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the impact of breast cancer pathways on patient experience, burden of decision&#xD;
      making and quality of life in tertiary cancer center and community oncology practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify modifiable factors that affect provider adoption of breast cancer pathways in&#xD;
      tertiary cancer center and community oncology practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Participants receive standard chemotherapy educational materials. Participants also&#xD;
      complete surveys over approximately 22 minutes at the time of first chemotherapy infusion,&#xD;
      and approximately 8 weeks after first chemotherapy infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Participants receive personalized information about their cancer, treatment, and&#xD;
      side effects. Participants also complete surveys over approximately 22 minutes at the time of&#xD;
      first chemotherapy infusion, and approximately 8 weeks after first chemotherapy infusion.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment includes intravenous chemotherapy for breast cancer for primary disease as&#xD;
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, or for recurrent and/or metastatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Can provide consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are able to comprehend written materials in English or Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Will receive their chemotherapy at Roswell Park sites in Buffalo or Amherst, New York&#xD;
             (NY), or Roswell Park Oncology primary care (PC) sites in Niagara Falls, Amherst, West&#xD;
             Seneca, or Jamestown NY&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast cancer patients receiving oral therapy alone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not able to comprehend written materials in English or Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who will not receive chemotherapy at a Roswell Park site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not able to comprehend written materials will not be included in this&#xD;
             study, as the consent document will be administered in multiple infusion centers that&#xD;
             cannot be all staffed daily with a research associate. The study instruments used are&#xD;
             standardized tools that have been developed as best as possible with appropriate&#xD;
             literacy levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled in clinical trials for their breast chemotherapy will be excluded&#xD;
             from this study because they will require alternative educational materials that are&#xD;
             specific to the trial drugs being administered&#xD;
