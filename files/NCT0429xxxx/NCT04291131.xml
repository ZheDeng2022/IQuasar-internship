    <textblock>
      Persons with COPD have both chronic musculoskeletal pain and dyspnea that require accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment, ultimately to optimize functional status. The investigators propose&#xD;
      to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand central mechanisms of chronic pain,&#xD;
      dyspnea, and physical activity promotion in COPD. The investigators' novel proposal to&#xD;
      correlate subjective symptoms (chronic pain and dyspnea) with an objective central biomarker&#xD;
      (resting state functional connectivity) and examine their changes in response to a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological, non-addictive physical activity intervention will personalize the care&#xD;
      of Veterans with COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is the nation's third leading cause of death and affects up to 11% of all VA healthcare&#xD;
      patients. Patients with COPD experience significant dyspnea despite optimization of medical&#xD;
      therapy. In addition, over half of patients with COPD experience chronic pain--largely&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain. Clinically, in patients who suffer from both chronic pain and dyspnea,&#xD;
      it is difficult to distinguish a patient's perception of one symptom modulated by the other.&#xD;
      Novel objective diagnostic tools are needed to complement patient self-report and accurately&#xD;
      distinguish symptoms in patients who have both chronic pain and dyspnea to optimize clinical&#xD;
      management. It is also important to study chronic pain and dyspnea in COPD because they are&#xD;
      common barriers to engaging in physical activity (PA) and exercise. The clinical course of&#xD;
      COPD is characterized by a downward spiral of dyspnea and chronic pain, physical inactivity,&#xD;
      and significant functional limitation. Although chronic pain and dyspnea can be barriers, PA&#xD;
      and exercise are powerful, but underused, non-addictive therapies for management of these&#xD;
      symptoms in COPD. The investigators developed Every Step Counts (ESC), a technology-mediated&#xD;
      intervention based on the Theory of Self-Regulation, to promote PA in COPD. The investigators&#xD;
      have demonstrated ESC's safety, feasibility, and efficacy to increase PA and improve&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in Veterans with COPD. In two separate studies using&#xD;
      questionnaires, ESC has been shown to improve dyspnea in COPD and relieve chronic back pain&#xD;
      in Veterans. An important next step is to understand the mechanisms of benefit of PA&#xD;
      interventions, like ESC, in the many COPD patients with both chronic musculoskeletal pain and&#xD;
      dyspnea to ultimately design better PA interventions and optimize treatment of these&#xD;
      symptoms. Currently, the central mechanisms of chronic pain and dyspnea, and how they change&#xD;
      in response to PA promotion in COPD are largely unknown. It has been shown that pre-stimulus&#xD;
      resting state functional connectivity determines pain perception in healthy humans. Resting&#xD;
      state fcMRI evaluates interactions between brain regions before a sensory event or when an&#xD;
      explicit task is not being performed. These communications are altered in older adults with&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain. Functional connectivity among regions specifically within the&#xD;
      &quot;default mode&quot; network (DMN) (posterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobes, and medial&#xD;
      frontal gyrus) have been examined in clinical disease states, as this network is reliably&#xD;
      detected and well-characterized. Functional connectivity may be a novel biomarker of chronic&#xD;
      pain and dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Characterize and correlate the relationship between functional connectivity and&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain and dyspnea in 30 persons with COPD (10 with both symptoms, 10&#xD;
      with chronic pain, and 10 with dyspnea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Explore changes in functional connectivity and changes in symptoms in 30 persons with&#xD;
      COPD after use of the ESC intervention to increase PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' proposed design will leverage enrollment of well-characterized&#xD;
      participants with COPD already using the ESC PA intervention as part of a distinct and&#xD;
      ongoing RR&amp;D Merit Award. This proposal will provide insight into the biologically complex&#xD;
      relationships between symptoms (chronic pain and dyspnea), behavior (PA), and biology at the&#xD;
      central level (functional connectivity).&#xD;
