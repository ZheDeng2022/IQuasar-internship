    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase 2 trial which includes patients with high risk acute GVHD defined&#xD;
      as Ann Arbor score 2 or 3. The purpose of the study is to improve the outcome of these&#xD;
      patients in terms of response to treatment and treatment related mortality. All patients will&#xD;
      receive the study intervention (ECP with Uvadex). The study hypothesis is that the treatment&#xD;
      plan will produce a day 28 complete response rate higher than or equal to 52%, which will&#xD;
      represent an improvement of 15% compared with the standard of care (37%). The rate of&#xD;
      complete response to standard of care treatment is based on observed data in similar patients&#xD;
      treated within the Mount Sanai Acute GVHD International Consorium (MAGIC). Patients will be&#xD;
      treated for 56 days and followed for one year to also enable evaluation of long term outcome.&#xD;

      This study is a single arm phase 2 study for adult patients who have acute GVHD Grade II-IV&#xD;
      according to Glucksberg and Ann Arbor score 2 or 3 after first allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. The staging according to Glucksberg is based on clinical parameters while&#xD;
      Ann Arbor scoring is based on the MAGIC biomarkers. Patients will receive standard acute GVHD&#xD;
      treatment consisting of 2mg/kg methylprednisolone plus extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP)&#xD;
      with Uvadex. Day 0 of the study will be the first day of ECP, which will be performed 3x&#xD;
      weekly for the first 2 weeks, 2x weekly for the next two weeks and thereafter once weekly&#xD;
      until day 56. A taper schema for methylprednisolone is proposed but not obligatory. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed until one year after start of ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to enroll 72 patients in order to be able to detect a 15% difference in rate&#xD;
      of complete responses on day 28, assuming a type I error rate of 0.05. Patients treated on&#xD;
      this study will have three possible comparators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort of patients with high risk aGvHD who received standard treatment and whose data&#xD;
           were prospectively reported to MAGIC during the last 2 years preceding the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort of patients with high risk aGvHD who received standard treatment and whose data&#xD;
           are reported to MAGIC during the trial period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort of patients with high risk aGvHD treated within the ongoing prospective MAGIC USA&#xD;
           phase 2 Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to an ECP treatment each patient will be assessed by a physician to verify that the&#xD;
      patient is acceptable for ECP treatment. This assessment will include vital signs (diastolic&#xD;
      and systolic blood pressures, pulse, temperature) which will be taken prior to and at the end&#xD;
      of each ECP treatment. Blood cell counts will be analyzed prior to each treatment. If a&#xD;
      patient's WBC count is below 1 X 109/L or platelet count is below 20 X 109/L ECP should be&#xD;
      postponed until rise in WBC or platelet counts. Platelet transfusions and use of cytokines is&#xD;
      permitted. Whenever possible, peripheral venous access is preferable to central venous&#xD;
      catheters. In patients with platelet counts below 40 X 109/L acid citrate dextrose (ACD)&#xD;
      instead of heparin should be used for ECP. When severe acute infections occur during study&#xD;
      ECP should be discontinued until the infection has been controlled under appropriate therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical therapy for acute GvHD of the skin and non-absorbable steroids for GI GvHD are&#xD;
      allowed. Ancillary/supportive care measures for acute GvHD such as the use of anti-motility&#xD;
      agents for diarrhea, including octreotide, is allowed at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician. Use of ursodiol to prevent/reduce gall bladder sludging, or prevent hepatic&#xD;
      transplant complications is also allowed according to institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to prescribed study drug plus corticosteroids, all patients should receive the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfusion support per institutional practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-infective prophylaxis against herpes virus is required but otherwise institutional&#xD;
           practice can be followed for the medication to be used and the dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-infective prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci, bacterial and fungal&#xD;
           infections according to standard institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-infective prophylaxis against fungi (aspergillosis) is required but otherwise&#xD;
           institutional practice can be followed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-emptive monitoring and treatment for CMV and EBV infections are required but&#xD;
           otherwise institutional practice can be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and stopping rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of the treatment plan will be assessed by the proportion of patients with complete&#xD;
      response at day 28. The treatment plan will be considered efficacious if it produces a day 28&#xD;
      CR rate of ≥ 52%, representing an improvement over the day 28 CR rate of approximately 15%&#xD;
      achieved with the standard of care. Stopping boundaries for efficacy are presented in Table&#xD;
      5, in terms of the number of observed positive responses out of the total number observed.&#xD;
      Our expectation is represented by a prior distribution for a positive response that has a&#xD;
      mean of 0.37, or 37%. Characterizing our expectation as a distribution of values, rather than&#xD;
      a fixed value, naturally accounts for uncertainty in the response. The prior is based on&#xD;
      observed data treating similar patients with the standard of care. More specifically, let θS&#xD;
      be the day 28 CR rate of patients treated with the standard of care. Likewise, let θE be the&#xD;
      day 28 CR of patients treated with ECP and high dose systemic corticosteroid. Assume that θS&#xD;
      ~ beta (37, 63) and θE ~ beta (0.74, 1.26) so that each prior has a mean of 0.37. Let the&#xD;
      improvement of the experimental treatment over the standard, δ, be 0.1. The study will be&#xD;
      stopped when P (θS + δ &gt;θE |observed data)&gt;0.90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The boundaries provide guidelines for determining when treatment with ECP and high dose&#xD;
      systemic corticosteroid is inferior to what would be expected if patients were treated with&#xD;
      the standard of care. We will initiate these guidelines with the 10th outcome, and enroll a&#xD;
      maximum of 72 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further stopping rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the individual patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any of the following criteria will lead to study discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator or Sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for ending protocol therapy and the date the patient was removed from treatment&#xD;
      will be documented in the study record. All patients who discontinue treatment should comply&#xD;
      with protocol specific follow-up procedures as outlined in Section 13.13. The only exception&#xD;
      to this requirement is when a patient withdraws consent for all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may withdraw from the study treatment at their request at any time. If they&#xD;
      withdraw, they will be asked to perform a study termination visit and be documented in eCRF&#xD;
      as &quot;early termination&quot;. The reasons should be documented in the eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the entire study cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole study can be discontinued by the Coordinating Investigator in case of excessive&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, a study termination visit should be performed and the included patients&#xD;
      should be further followed-up until disease progression or death from any cause (relapse or&#xD;
      other reason).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once we have enrolled 10 patients, and for additional patients thereafter, we will assess the&#xD;
      cumulative number of patients with overall response and NRM and stop the trial if the&#xD;
      observed number responses or NRM equals or exceeds the thresholds specified in section 19.&#xD;
