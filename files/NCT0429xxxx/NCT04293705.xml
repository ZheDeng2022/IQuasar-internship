  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at evaluating the feasibility and the efficacy of the Teen On-line Problem&#xD;
      Solving program (TOPS) in improving executive functioning and behavior problems in&#xD;
      adolescents aged 11-19 years with congenital disability due to brain malformation/syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to control for placebo effects, participants are randomized into two intervention&#xD;
      conditions. Group 1 performs the regular version of the TOPS, while Group 2 performs a&#xD;
      modified version containing no activities on executive functions, behavioral strategies and&#xD;
      social skills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with congenital brain malformation/syndrome often present with executive&#xD;
      dysfunction and behavioral and social problems. Ad hoc rehabilitation may significantly&#xD;
      ameliorate such difficulties. With this aim, the Teen On-line Problem-Solving program (TOPS)&#xD;
      could represent a suitable opportunity of intervention, as it aims at helping children to&#xD;
      improve executive and behavioral functioning. The program consists of a web-based platform&#xD;
      composed of 10 core sessions and eventual supplementary sessions, providing information and&#xD;
      activities on executive functioning, behavioral strategies, social skills and injury-related&#xD;
      issues and health and wellness. The program is delivered remotely, with patients performing&#xD;
      the intervention at home, together with their families. Biweekly Google Meet sessions with a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist are scheduled along the entire duration of the&#xD;
      intervention to monitor the activities related to the program and the real-life&#xD;
      problem-solving process that patients are required to perform during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of executive functions and behavioral problems is conducted before and after the&#xD;
      training (immediate post training assessment and follow-up assessment 6 months after the end&#xD;
      of the training), in order to investigate the presence of significant changes after the&#xD;
      intervention. Both questionnaires and performance-based measures are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized into two groups: Group 1 performs the regular version of the&#xD;
      TOPS, while Group 2 performs a modified version containing no activities on executive&#xD;
      functions, behavioral strategies and social skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the average effect of TOPS program reported by a meta-analysis available in the&#xD;
      literature (Corti et al., 2019; Hedge's g = 0.39) we estimated a small-to-moderate effect&#xD;
      size of f =0.2 (f was calculated based on Hedge's g value). Power analysis was conducted by&#xD;
      using GPower3 software. Assuming a correlation of 0.50 between repeated measures and setting&#xD;
      the alfa level at P &lt; 0.05, a sample size of 21 subjects per group is required to obtain 80%&#xD;
      of power with our 2 groups x 3 time points design.&#xD;

    <description>The BRIEF questionnaire is aimed at assessing executive functioning at home and school and contains 63 items in different clinical scales and validity scales. The questionnaire is administered to parents, which have to rate the frequency of dysexecutive problems of their children on a 3-point Likert Scale. Raw scores of the global scale range from 63 to 189. T scores (M = 50, SD = 10) are used to interpret the level of executive functioning. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The SCL-90 is a self-report questionnaire aimed at measuring psychiatric symptom intensity on nine different subscales. The 90 items are scored on a five-point Likert scale (ranging from 0 to 4), indicating the rate of occurrence of the symptoms during the last 7 days. In this study the questionnaire is administered to parents to assess parental psychological distress, by considering the Global Severity Index (GSI). Raw scores of the GSI, which are calculated as the average score of the 90 items of the questionnaire, range from 0 to 360. The final score is reported as T score (M = 50 SD = 10). Higher scores indicate higher distress. Consistent with the recommendations of Derogatis (1994), a T score at or above 63 on the GSI indicates the clinical range.</description>
