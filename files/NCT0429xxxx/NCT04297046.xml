  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective analgesia after total abdominal hysterectomy is important for faster recovery and&#xD;
      preventing complications which depend to pain. A multimodal and preventive approach is&#xD;
      preferred to ensure adequate analgesia and to avoid side effects due to high doses of&#xD;
      analgesics. The hypothesis was that the Quadratus Lumborum block (application of local&#xD;
      anesthetics to the side of the abdomen) would be superior to Transversus Abdominis Plane&#xD;
      block (application of local anesthetics in front of the abdomen) for analgesia before&#xD;
      abdominal incision in total abdominal hysterectomy. The primary goal of the study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis Plane block and Quadratus&#xD;
      Lumborum block. The secondary goal was to evaluate postoperative adverse effects and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;

      The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from each patient. The study was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics&#xD;
      of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was conducted between April 2017 - July 2017 with a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blind design on 62 patients who had undergone total abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy with Pfannenstiel incision. American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) II-III,&#xD;
      patients between the ages of 18-75 were included in the study. The participants with bleeding&#xD;
      diathesis, those who could not communicate (mental disorder, language problem, etc.), those&#xD;
      with allergies to the drugs used, those who did not wish to participate in the study, and&#xD;
      those who had an infection in the block area were excluded from the study. The participants&#xD;
      were divided into 2 groups with the sealed envelope technique preoperatively Transversus&#xD;
      Abdominis Plane Block Procedure Before the surgical procedure, the muscles were screened at&#xD;
      the umbilicus plain/mid-axillary line with the ultrasound using a linear probe while the&#xD;
      participants in the supine position. The skin, subcutaneous adipose tissue, external oblique&#xD;
      muscle, internal oblique muscle, transversus abdominis muscle, and peritoneum were&#xD;
      visualized. The block needle was advanced in the posterolateral direction with the in-plain&#xD;
      approach. 0.3 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine was administered bilaterally into the space between&#xD;
      the internal oblique muscle and the transversus abdominis muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum Block Procedure Quadratus lumborum muscle could be&#xD;
      recognized with ultrasound via the convex probe was transversally attached above iliac crest&#xD;
      at the midaxillary line while the patients were in the lateral decubitus position. The point&#xD;
      of injection with a block needle in transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum Block is between the&#xD;
      anterior border of Quadratus lumborum muscle and psoas major muscles. A transmuscular&#xD;
      Quadratus Lumborum Block was performed bilaterally with 0,3 ml/kg 0.25% bupivacaine solution&#xD;
      injection on each side.&#xD;
