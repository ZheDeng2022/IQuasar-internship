      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), also known as androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness, is&#xD;
      the most common type of progressive hair loss. It is a polygenetic condition with variable&#xD;
      degree of severity, age of onset, and location of hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male AGA (MAGA) is clearly an androgen-dependent condition and, although the mode of&#xD;
      inheritance is uncertain, a genetic predisposition is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding treatment of AGA; in most cases it's challenging and unsatisfactory. Finasteride&#xD;
      and Minoxidil 2-5 % solution are the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved&#xD;
      treatment options for MAGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of hypertrichosis observed in patients treated with analogues of prostaglandin&#xD;
      PGF2a (i.e. latanoprost used for glaucoma), it was supposed that prostaglandins would have an&#xD;
      important role in the hair growth (Nieves et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies had claimed that prostaglandins are deregulated in both alopecia areata (AA)&#xD;
      and AGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetirizine, is a safe and selective second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist widely&#xD;
      used. It has anti-inflammatory properties. Studies have shown cetirizine causes a significant&#xD;
      reduction in both the inflammatory cell infiltrate and PGD2 production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral administration of cetirizine is commonly leads to different systemic side effects.&#xD;
      Thus the topical formulation is expected to be an effective tool for avoiding the oral side&#xD;
      effects as well as better targeting, but unfortunately, no topical formulation of cetirizine&#xD;
      is available in the market till date.&#xD;

      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), also known as androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness, is&#xD;
      the most common type of progressive hair loss. It is a polygenetic condition with variable&#xD;
      degree of severity, age of onset, and location of hair loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair loss typically begins with bi-temporal recession of the frontal hairline, followed by&#xD;
      diffuse hair thinning at the vertex, and eventual complete loss of hair at the center of the&#xD;
      vertex. The bald patch at the vertex subsequently joins the frontal receding hairline,&#xD;
      leaving an island of hair on the frontal scalp, which finally disappears leaving hair only in&#xD;
      the parietal and occipital zones producing the characteristic &quot;horseshoe&quot; pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgenetic alopecia is classified according to the Hamilton-Norwood scale into grades (from&#xD;
      I to VII).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGA features a progressive miniaturization of the hair follicle leading to vellus&#xD;
      transformation of terminal hair which results from an alteration in hair cycle dynamics:&#xD;
      anagen phase duration gradually decreases and that of the telogen phase increases. As the&#xD;
      anagen phase duration determines hair length, the new anagen hair becomes shorter, eventually&#xD;
      leading to bald appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of AGA is multifactorial and polygenetic. Male AGA (MAGA) is clearly an&#xD;
      androgen-dependent condition and, although the mode of inheritance is uncertain, a genetic&#xD;
      predisposition is observed, while in female AGA (FAGA) the role of androgens is still&#xD;
      uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding treatment of AGA; in most cases it's challenging and unsatisfactory. Finasteride&#xD;
      and Minoxidil 2-5 % solution are the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved&#xD;
      treatment options for MAGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finasteride is a type 2 5α-reductase inhibitor that decreases the conversion of testosterone&#xD;
      to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is responsible for the miniaturization of the hair&#xD;
      follicle seen in MAGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minoxidil is a direct arteriolar vasodilator acts by opening potassium channels. Unwanted&#xD;
      hair growth was observed as an adverse effect in 24-100 % of patients treated by Minoxidil&#xD;
      for hypertension. Minoxidil 2 % solution was approved in 1988, while the 5 % solution was&#xD;
      approved in 1991, and the 5 % foam in 2016 for MAGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of hypertrichosis observed in patients treated with analogues of prostaglandin&#xD;
      PGF2a (i.e. latanoprost used for glaucoma), it was supposed that prostaglandins would have an&#xD;
      important role in the hair growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their action is variable depending on the class they belong to: PGE and PGF2a play a&#xD;
      generally positive role on the hair growth, while PGD2 an inhibitory role on the hair growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies had claimed that prostaglandins are deregulated in both alopecia areata (AA)&#xD;
      and AGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Garza in 2012 found elevated levels of prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) at the mRNA and&#xD;
      protein levels in bald scalp versus haired scalp of men with AGA. Also found that the&#xD;
      enzymatic product of PTGDS and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) are raised in bald human scalp tissue.&#xD;
      These results implicate that PGD2 might has a role in pathogenesis of AGA, thus suggest new&#xD;
      receptor targets for its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetirizine, the active carboxylic acid metabolite of hydroxyzine, is a safe and selective&#xD;
      second-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist widely used in daily practice. It has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties and high specific affinity for histamine H1 receptors. Studies&#xD;
      have shown cetirizine causes a significant reduction in both the inflammatory cell infiltrate&#xD;
      and PGD2 production, and these effects are not related to its anti-H1 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral administration of cetirizine is commonly leads to different systemic side effects as&#xD;
      sedation, ocular dryness, tiredness and dry mouth. Thus, the topical formulation for&#xD;
      cetirizine is expected to be a rational and effective tool for avoiding the oral side effects&#xD;
      as well as better targeting, but unfortunately, no topical formulation of cetirizine is&#xD;
      available in the market till date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the stratum corneum is the main barrier for the effective topical drug application,&#xD;
      numerous attempts have been made to enhance topical drug delivery such as lipid nanocarriers&#xD;
      (nano-transferosomes (NTF), follicular penetration, microbubbles and microneedles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rossi in 2018 evaluated for the first time in literature the tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      topical cetirizine 1% lotion inpatients with AGA and claimed that topical cetirizine causes a&#xD;
      significant improvement of the initial framework of AGA in both males and females and&#xD;
      recommended further studies to allow better investigation for the role of cetirizine in AGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigators knowledge the use of topical cetirizine 1% gel has not yet&#xD;
      been tried in the therapeutic management of Egyptian males with AGA.&#xD;
