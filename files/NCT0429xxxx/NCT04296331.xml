      &quot;Enhancing a universal testing and treatment strategy in jail to promote viral load&#xD;
      suppression among justice-involved people living with HIV&quot; is an observational research study&#xD;
      led by Dr. Anne Spaulding, MPH of Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health and Dr.&#xD;
      Matthew Akiyama, MSc of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center.&#xD;
      Due to the high rates of undiagnosed Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the correctional&#xD;
      setting and the short length of stay in jails, this study aims to evaluate whether care&#xD;
      coordination within the D.C. Central Detention Facility (DC DOC) and upon release, including&#xD;
      testing procedures and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, can improve the connection of&#xD;
      adults (age 18 and over) living with HIV to care in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will retrospectively look at the aggregate-level de-identified data of&#xD;
      roughly 3,000 individuals admitted to the DC DOC over a 6-month period to determine the most&#xD;
      effective HIV diagnostic test for routine opt-out testing in the correctional setting. Over&#xD;
      the course of these 6 months, the correctional facility will transition from using POC only&#xD;
      to POC + antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab), to solely using Ag/Ab, each for a 2-month duration.&#xD;
      Individuals from this time period who are identified by corrections staff as HIV-positive&#xD;
      either through testing upon admission, their electronic medical record (EMR) or self-report,&#xD;
      and have a known release date will be considered eligible for the follow-up study to assess&#xD;
      if care coordination is effective in linking others with HIV leaving the DC DOC to care. This&#xD;
      follow-up will enroll 100 of these individuals who have consented to participate following&#xD;
      their release from the DC DOC, and will consist of a chart review of their DC DOC EMRs and&#xD;
      those from their community healthcare provider for up to two years after their release.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This innovative study will be the first to assess the feasibility, process measures, and&#xD;
      estimate cost-effectiveness of a rapid Universal Testing and Treatment (rUTT) intervention in&#xD;
      a large urban jail located in Washington, DC - 1 of the 50 communities targeted for End the&#xD;
      HIV Epidemic (EtHE) efforts (&quot;What is&quot;, 2019). The aim is to determine the most effective HIV&#xD;
      diagnostic test to use for routine opt-out testing in the correctional setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of opt-out POC and Ag/Ab tests offered at&#xD;
      intake will maximize the yield of PLWH detected, provision of test results, ART initiation,&#xD;
      viral suppression, and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine administrative, de-identified, aggregate data for&#xD;
      approximately 3000 individuals (based on 500 individuals currently accepting HIV testing per&#xD;
      month) over 6 months. For individuals who provide consent to release their jail medical&#xD;
      records after incarceration, the investigators will retrieve the mean time from: 1) positive&#xD;
      test to receipt of test results, 2) receipt of test results to first dose of ART in jail, 3)&#xD;
      receipt of post-test counseling to meeting the discharge planner, and 4) ART initiation to&#xD;
      viral suppression defined as a viral load &lt;200 copies/mL. The investigators will calculate&#xD;
      the implementation costs of each strategy using observation of staff time, market values for&#xD;
      items used in the intervention, and process measure data collected through chart review (for&#xD;
      individuals who consent to release their jail medical records after incarceration). Units of&#xD;
      resource items, such as staff time and diagnostic tests, will be multiplied by their unit&#xD;
      costs to calculate total costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note: This protocol does not constitute research involving prisoners (as outlined by&#xD;
      the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services Office for Human Research Protections -&#xD;
      https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/prisoner-research/index.html)&#xD;
      since the investigators will not be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtaining identifiable private data or information about prisoner subjects through&#xD;
           intervention or interaction with them while incarcerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Seeking the informed consent of prisoners to be subjects in research;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Using, studying or analyzing, for research purposes, identifiable private information&#xD;
           about prisoners, or identifiable specimens obtained from prisoners; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Surveying prisoners for this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this pilot study is to assess 3 HIV testing strategies as the entry&#xD;
      point into a rUTT jail-based intervention to promote HIV viral suppression among individuals&#xD;
      with undiagnosed and diagnosed HIV infections. Among individuals within the DC Department of&#xD;
      Corrections (DC DOC) the investigators will examine whether opt-out Point-of-Care (POC) rapid&#xD;
      testing, 4th generation laboratory-based antigen/antibody testing (Ag/Ab), or POC and Ag/Ab&#xD;
      testing are most effective in identifying HIV infection upon entry into the jails, linking&#xD;
      persons to care and obtaining viral load suppression. During the medical intake, jail nurses&#xD;
      will sequentially use, for 2 month each: 1. POC only; 2. POC + Ag/Ab; 3. Ag/Ab only as part&#xD;
      of standard clinical care (POC: INSTI® rapid test; Ag/Ab: ARCHITECT® laboratory-based test).&#xD;
      Upon anticipation of release, those who are on ART will be invited to participate in a&#xD;
      follow-up study regarding their coordination of care while in the DC DOC system and&#xD;
      post-release, as well as their current viral load status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are: (1) Compare the feasibility of 3 testing strategies using&#xD;
      administrative, de-identified, aggregate data to measure the number/percentage of entrants&#xD;
      who do not opt out of testing and receive their test results in jail. (2) Compare 3 testing&#xD;
      strategies for time to return of preliminary and confirmed test results, jail-based ART&#xD;
      initiation (or reinitiation in known PLWH), and referral to discharge planners among&#xD;
      justice-involved PLWH who consent to release their jail medical records after incarceration.&#xD;
      (3) Assess the cost of implementing each testing strategy and relative cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      the 3 testing strategies in terms of process measures, time to ART initiation, and viral&#xD;
      suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study is being conducted by Dr. Anne Spaulding, MD MPH of Emory&#xD;
      University's Rollins School of Public Health and Dr. Matthew Akiyama, MD MSc of Albert&#xD;
      Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center through the support of the&#xD;
      National Institute of Health (NIH) via New York City (NYC) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and location The DC DOC is a large urban jail with nearly 8000 intakes per year and&#xD;
      an average daily population of approximately 2000 individuals. It is estimated that the HIV&#xD;
      prevalence in this system is approximately 4% with a mean of 60 known PLWH in the population&#xD;
      at any given time. About 1-3 new HIV diagnoses are made each month with the current POC HIV&#xD;
      testing program in place. The patient population is predominantly racial/ethnic minorities&#xD;
      (97% overall; 88% Black, 20% Hispanic - not mutually exclusive due to more than 1&#xD;
      race/ethnicity), and 91% are at or below the 200% poverty level (HRSA, 2017). As part of the&#xD;
      Unity Health Care (UHC) clinical program, individuals with newly diagnosed HIV will be&#xD;
      offered rapid ART initiation, ideally within 24-72 hours of diagnosis with an integrase&#xD;
      inhibitor-based regimen as per Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS) guidelines&#xD;
      (&quot;Guidelines&quot;,2019). Individuals who are known to be HIV-positive through the electronic&#xD;
      medical record (EMR) or self-report do not undergo HIV testing. For those who are&#xD;
      ART-experienced, the individual's existing ART regimen is restarted. If ART-naïve, an&#xD;
      integrase inhibitor-based regimen will be started within 24-72 hours. Community follow-up is&#xD;
      offered within 1-2 weeks of reentry and supported by jail discharge planners and community&#xD;
      health workers (CHWs). UHC recently began a new 5-year contract to provide jail health&#xD;
      services, ensuring a consistent healthcare provider for the duration of this study. DC has&#xD;
      expanded Medicaid, which is an essential to developing an rUTT model since it is imperative&#xD;
      to ensure no break in ART coverage. Potential participants for this study will be recruited&#xD;
      from the DC DOC system&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that aggregate-level data will be collected for 3,000 individuals who are&#xD;
      admitted to the DC DOC system over the 6-month study period and accept HIV testing upon&#xD;
      entry. Of those tested, preliminary eligibility will be based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Admitted to DC DOC between October 14th, 2019 and October 31st, 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Has initiated ART by time of release&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Being HIV-positive: confirmed either through HIV testing upon entry, was known to be&#xD;
           HIV-positive through the EMR, or self-reported being HIV-positive&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the past 12 years DC DOC has offered opt-out POC testing with the INSTI® finger stick&#xD;
      test at entry. During booking (in the intake medical evaluation unit, prior to processing&#xD;
      individuals into jail) jail nurses will sequentially use, for 2 month each: 1. POC only; 2.&#xD;
      POC + Ag/Ab; 3. Ag/Ab only as part of standard clinical care (POC: INSTI® rapid test; Ag/Ab:&#xD;
      ARCHITECT® laboratory-based test). To assist UHC with this transition, the investigators have&#xD;
      secured in-kind donation of INSTI® rapid test kits (see letter of support). Over 6 months of&#xD;
      testing the investigators anticipate approximately 3000 individuals will be tested (based on&#xD;
      500 individuals currently accepting HIV testing per month). The number of new HIV diagnoses&#xD;
      that will be made is not known; however, the investigators anticipate the number will be&#xD;
      higher using Ag/Ab testing than the 1-3 new diagnoses that are made each month using the&#xD;
      current POC rapid testing strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each of the 3 testing phases the project team will request, from DC DOC, data from&#xD;
      their EMR. Specifically, they will request administrative, de-identified, aggregate data that&#xD;
      does not contain any of the 18 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
      identifiers for: 1) the total number of entrants, 2) the number of entrants with HIV test&#xD;
      results (indicating they have not opted out of testing), 3) the number of post-test&#xD;
      counseling visits (indicating receipt of test results), 4) the number of positive HIV tests,&#xD;
      and 5) the median and mean length of stay for the entire population. The individuals for whom&#xD;
      these data are available and are on ART at time of jail release are considered &quot;EMR-eligible&#xD;
      participants.&quot; Aggregate-level data will be collected on all individuals admitted to DC DOC&#xD;
      beginning January 15th, 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for the post-release portion of the study will be recruited at exit from the DC&#xD;
      DOC system. Currently the DC DOC provides all patients who are on ART with a 30-day supply&#xD;
      upon release. Inmates who are released and have entered the jail during the study period will&#xD;
      receive an invitation letter to participate in the study that will be attached to their&#xD;
      30-day supply of ART, which they will pick up at release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Invitation to Participate Letters' from UHC will inform EMR-eligible participants that they&#xD;
      may be eligible to participate in a paid observational research study about the effectiveness&#xD;
      of opt-out rUTT strategies for HIV (see attached letter). Potentially eligible participants&#xD;
      are instructed to contact the UHC research coordinator (RC) if they are interested in being a&#xD;
      part of the study, or to find out more information. The letter will state that for this&#xD;
      observational study participants will only have to continue their standard HIV care with&#xD;
      their provider. They will only have to meet with the study team once in order to conduct the&#xD;
      eligibility screening and sign the informed consent authorizing the study team to receive the&#xD;
      participants EMR from DC DOC and their community provider for two years following their&#xD;
      release.&#xD;
