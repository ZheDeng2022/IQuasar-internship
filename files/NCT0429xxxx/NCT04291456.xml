    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm clinical trial. Trial participants will include men and&#xD;
      women, aged 18-60 years who have had a first demyelinating event within the previous 180 days&#xD;
      and who have brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with at least two brain T2 lesions which&#xD;
      are at least 3 mm in diameter, and at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or&#xD;
      infra-tentorial. Treatment with minocycline until the endpoint is reached or to a maximum of&#xD;
      24 months or until the last-enrolled participant reaches their 12 month visit.&#xD;

      Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) characterized by the presence of multifocal lesions with inflammation,&#xD;
      demyelination and axonal injury. Most people with MS present with a first clinical&#xD;
      demyelinating event. This trial will determine the effects of minocycline treatment after a&#xD;
      first clinical demyelinating event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently showed that minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline&#xD;
      antibiotic with immune modulating properties, delays conversion from a first clinical&#xD;
      demyelinating event to MS within 6 months. While benefit remained significant at 12 months,&#xD;
      the investigators were unable to confirm benefit at 24 months. Another trial is needed to&#xD;
      confirm the benefit at 6 and 12 months and to determine if the benefit lasts to 24 months.&#xD;
      Since this earlier trial the diagnostic criteria for MS have changed and most people with&#xD;
      first clinical demyelinating events, previously called a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS),&#xD;
      who meet the trial inclusion criteria can now be diagnosed with MS. The outcome of this trial&#xD;
      remains clinically important however because it represents the time until new disease&#xD;
      activity occurs. It is new activity (brain inflammation or brain damage) which the&#xD;
      investigators are trying to prevent with treatment. In Alberta, other proven therapies for&#xD;
      CIS, even when MS can now be diagnosed at onset, are not reimbursed by Alberta Blue Cross.&#xD;
      Therefore, most people still do not have access to treatment, other than minocycline.&#xD;
      Minocycline is therefore a reasonable treatment at this stage of the disease. While the&#xD;
      investigators have been lobbying for these reimbursement criteria to be changed there will&#xD;
      still be delays in access to other therapies. This will make minocycline valuable, at least&#xD;
      as a bridge therapy, while waiting for the option of starting other therapies. Therefore,&#xD;
      confirming its' efficacy remains clinically important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This proposal will allow the investigators to confirm that minocycline treatment&#xD;
      reduces the risk in individuals with a first clinical demyelinating event (CIS or CIS/MS) to&#xD;
      have further inflammatory disease activity that is equivalent to the endpoint indicating they&#xD;
      converted to MS (by 2005 McDonald MS Criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Participants must meet the same inclusion and exclusion criteria that&#xD;
      were used in the investigators previous phase III minocycline trial. These criteria are&#xD;
      identical to those of the investigators earlier CIS trial and very similar to other CIS&#xD;
      trials. In addition, to assure the cohort remains consistent with participants in previous&#xD;
      CIS trials, the investigators will monitor the characteristics of the participating&#xD;
      population to assure they reflect the majority of previous CIS trials. The investigators&#xD;
      expect the time since onset of CIS may need to be reduced during the trial to ensure the&#xD;
      investigators limit the number of participants with longer time from onset to match the&#xD;
      investigators earlier trial. This will be monitored closely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients referred to the Calgary MS Clinic with new onset of suspected MS are&#xD;
      generally seen within 4 weeks of referral. An MRI scan of their brain will have been&#xD;
      completed prior to referral or will be arranged on an urgent basis. This will be the&#xD;
      screening/baseline MRI. Patients are routinely assessed for conditions that mimic MS as&#xD;
      standard practice in the MS Clinic. If a diagnosis of CIS or CIS/MS is made they are educated&#xD;
      about their diagnosis, informed of the risk of MS and of further CNS inflammation (clinical,&#xD;
      or subclinical if detected by MRI), and they are offered treatments that may reduce these&#xD;
      risks. Clinical and MRI follow-up are arranged and they are advised to contact a clinic nurse&#xD;
      if they have new or worsening neurologic symptoms. Current approved therapies for MS are not&#xD;
      reimbursed through the Alberta Blue Cross special authorization program until a diagnosis of&#xD;
      MS is confirmed and a second inflammatory event has occurred. Therefore, few patients&#xD;
      initiate the currently approved MS therapies which cost $13,154 to $34,780 per year. Even a&#xD;
      co-pay of 20% is very expensive. However, most patients can afford minocycline 100 mg twice&#xD;
      daily (less than $500 per year) and therefore many now choose to start it. Most others choose&#xD;
      no treatment. Patients diagnosed with CIS or CIS/MS will be invited to be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in this open-label trial. All consenting patients who meet the&#xD;
      study criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 48 months, 148 patients will be enrolled. Up to 200 patients may be screened because&#xD;
      some screened patients will not meet the MRI criteria for inclusion and some may choose to&#xD;
      take another treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Study participants will be included in this study if they decide to start&#xD;
      treatment with minocycline. Participants who enroll and take at least one dose of minocycline&#xD;
      will be evaluated in the intention to treat population. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      continue minocycline and trial participation for up to 24 months but will be discontinued&#xD;
      earlier if they reach the study endpoint (MS according to the 2005 McDonald criteria).&#xD;
      Continuation of minocycline after this period will be decided by the participant and their&#xD;
      neurologist as this period will not be part of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be included in a per-protocol analysis group if they take 80% of the&#xD;
      prescribed minocycline and have all on study clinical and imaging evaluations prior to&#xD;
      reaching the study endpoint. Adherence will be determined based on drug dispensed and pill&#xD;
      counts. Participants will be asked to bring in their empty and partially used pill bottles&#xD;
      for a pill count. Other MS disease modifying therapies, chronic systemic steroids, and&#xD;
      investigational therapies are prohibited. Use of contraception during treatment with&#xD;
      minocycline will be required for sexually active participants. Use of other concurrent&#xD;
      medications will not be influenced by study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: Clinic visits will occur at screening, baseline, and months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18&#xD;
      and 24, and telephone visits will occur at months 9, 15 and 21. The screening and baseline&#xD;
      visit may be on the same day. MRI scans will be done at baseline (or within the previous 2&#xD;
      weeks), and at months 3, 6, 12 and 24 (+/- 14 days). The timing of clinical assessments and&#xD;
      MRI scans in the minocycline group will mirror the investigators previous trial which&#xD;
      reflected previous CIS trials. Participants will continue in the study until month 24 or&#xD;
      until they reach the primary endpoint. They will be considered early drop-outs if they&#xD;
      discontinue participation before reaching the primary endpoint. Standard clinical follow-up&#xD;
      of CIS and CIS/MS patients generally mirrors this pattern of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits are routine at months 6, 12 and 24. Study visits at months 1, 3 and 18 are&#xD;
      required only for the trial. Telephone visits are only for the trial. Brain MRI is routine at&#xD;
      months 6, 12 and 24 and clinic patients who have enhancing lesions on their baseline MRI&#xD;
      typically also have a scan at 3 months because they are at very high risk of early new&#xD;
      disease activity. Study participants without enhancing lesions on their baseline MRI will&#xD;
      therefore have an MRI at 3 months only because they are study participants. These are the&#xD;
      only MRI scans being done outside of standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking: Clinical assessments and MRI interpretations will be completed by masked assessors.&#xD;
      A masked clinician will complete the neurologic exam and EDSS. While this is a single arm&#xD;
      study several trials are ongoing at the investigators centre and the assessor will be masked&#xD;
      as to which trial the patient is participating in. The radiologist interpreting the MRI will&#xD;
      be masked because they will not know that this is a study MRI.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All of the following criteria have to be met for inclusion of a patient into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 18 and 60 years inclusive. The lower age limit has been set because the&#xD;
             McDonald criteria may not be valid in children and adolescents.15 The upper limit is&#xD;
             set because the specificity of the diagnostic criteria is likely reduced in older&#xD;
             individuals. Individuals between ages 51-60 must have CSF oligoclonal bands or spinal&#xD;
             MRI changes typical of demyelination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First focal clinical episode suggestive of demyelinating disease within the previous&#xD;
             180 days (measured from onset of the first symptom to treatment start), based on the&#xD;
             appearance of a neurological abnormality, present for at least 24 hours. Objective&#xD;
             clinical evidence must be present or documented. Patients will be included&#xD;
             irrespective of whether the first clinical demyelinating episode was monosymptomatic&#xD;
             (i.e. clinical evidence of a single lesion) or polysymptomatic (i.e. clinical evidence&#xD;
             of more than one lesion). The period of 90 days is sufficiently long for case finding&#xD;
             and screening procedures and for the patient's decision to participate in the study.&#xD;
             In our previous trial the protocol was amended to allow inclusion as late as 180 days&#xD;
             after onset, but few participants had onset greater than 90 days before randomization&#xD;
             and most CIS trials limited enrolment to within 90 days of onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least two lesions on the T2-weighted brain* MRI scan with a size of at least 3 mm,&#xD;
             at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial. This criterion is&#xD;
             required because the presence of MRI abnormalities at the time of the first clinical&#xD;
             event affect the probability of developing MS. MRI also increases diagnostic certainty&#xD;
             by helping to exclude patients with another etiology (e.g. ischemic or neoplastic&#xD;
             causes). MRI eligibility will be determined based on the neuroradiologists clinical&#xD;
             report. *One lesion on spinal MRI may substitute for one brain lesion as per the 2005&#xD;
             McDonald Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be a registered Calgary MS Clinic patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, participants may be enrolled if, as part of their standard care, they&#xD;
             initiated and continued treatment with minocycline 100 mg bid and if, in addition to&#xD;
             meeting all the previous inclusion criteria, they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        completed all baseline activities within 30 days of minocycline initiation, if their&#xD;
        baseline MRI was completed within 14 days of minocycline initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are to be excluded from enrolment if they display any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disease other than MS that could better explain the patient's signs and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous clinical event reasonably attributable to acute demyelination, regardless&#xD;
             of whether medical attention was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have had two or more MRI scans at least 30 days apart to evaluate the CIS event&#xD;
             prior to screening. This will reduce the risk of enrolling participants already&#xD;
             monitored for active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete transverse myelitis or bilateral optic neuritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient who reaches the 2005 McDMS endpoint by the time of the baseline&#xD;
             assessment. This may be based on the occurrence of a new relapse (onset at least 30&#xD;
             days after onset of CIS) or evidence of dissemination in time on the baseline MRI if a&#xD;
             previous brain MRI had already been undertaken at least 30 days after onset of CIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant liver, renal, or bone marrow dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that could interfere with MRI or any other evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or contraindication to gadolinium-DTPA or tetracyclines including&#xD;
             estimated GFR (eGFR) less than 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent participation in any clinical therapeutic trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-treatment with the following substances prior to study enrolment: IFNß, glatiramer&#xD;
             acetate (GA), total lymphoid irradiation, anti-lymphocyte monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             treatment [e.g. anti-CD4, anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab), anti-CD20 or B-cell depleting&#xD;
             agents (rituximab, ocrelizumab) and anti-VLA4 (natalizumab)], teriflunomide, dimethyl&#xD;
             fumarate, fingolimod, cladribine, ocrelizumab, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
             azathioprine, cyclosporine A, methotrexate, or any other immunomodulating or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drug including other recombinant or non-recombinant cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use, within the previous 3 months, of any treatment known to be used for experimental&#xD;
             MS treatment except minocycline in the case where minocycline was initiated to treat&#xD;
             CIS or early MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition or situation that in the opinion of the investigator would either&#xD;
             put the patient at risk of worsening health if enrolled in the trial or&#xD;
