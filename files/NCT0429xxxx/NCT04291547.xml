  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this non-randomised feasibility study is to 1) examine the acceptability&#xD;
      of a newly developed computerised Behavioural Activation programme (BALM) in treating young&#xD;
      people experiencing low mood/depression and 2) assess the feasibility of undertaking a pilot&#xD;
      Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% of adolescents will have had at least one depressive episode by the age of&#xD;
      18 making depression one of the leading causes of illness and disability in young people.&#xD;
      Although receiving effective treatment is important, as few as 35% of young people seek help,&#xD;
      with treatment-related issues (e.g. stigma, negative attitudes about help-seeking,&#xD;
      accessibility, reluctance to engage one-to-one with a therapist, etc) outlined as reasons for&#xD;
      this. Computerised therapies, which have increased availability and accessibility, reduced&#xD;
      stigma and can be delivered in a format attractive to many young people may avoid some of&#xD;
      these barriers and provide a more effective treatment option for young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioural Activation (BA) - a type of talking therapy focused on increasing liked&#xD;
      activities has demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression in adults and, owing to&#xD;
      this, is an evidence-based treatment for depression within NICE (2009) guidelines. Despite&#xD;
      this, less research has examined its use with young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed BALM (Behavioural Activation for Low Mood), an online BA programme designed&#xD;
      for use with young people experiencing mild to moderate low mood or depression. The&#xD;
      development of BALM was based upon the findings of a systematic review and a series of&#xD;
      qualitative interviews and focus groups with young people and healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible young people will be referred to the programme via healthcare professionals working&#xD;
      in local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and mental health practitioners based in&#xD;
      local secondary schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this research will allow us to refine the intervention and the research&#xD;
      methods we employ in preparation for a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
