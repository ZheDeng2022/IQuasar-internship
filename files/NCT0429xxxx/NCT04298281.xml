      Multidisciplinary experts from two Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs), used an iterative&#xD;
      modified Delphi process to develop and refine criteria for determining PICU patients for whom&#xD;

      use of those criteria as a trigger to offer parents of PICU patients a family care&#xD;
      conference.&#xD;

      Multidisciplinary experts from two Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) used an iterative&#xD;
      modified Delphi process to develop and refine criteria for determining PICU patients for whom&#xD;
      a family care conference would be beneficial. A preliminary set of criteria were developed&#xD;
      with expert input and review of the literature. The investigators then assessed the&#xD;
      preliminary criteria by retrospectively reviewing PICU patient's medical records at the two&#xD;
      participating sites. Making revisions as needed the investigators then assessed the&#xD;
      reliability of the family care conference criteria by prospectively reviewing the medical&#xD;
      records of two months of PICU patient admissions at both participating sites. Based on these&#xD;
      efforts, the investigators have described a set of family care conference criteria that will&#xD;
      be studied in this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: Assess the inclusivity of the developed Family care conference criteria (FCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: Describe parents' views of PICU family care conferences (FCC) and factors&#xD;
      associated with having PICU family care conferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Taking an implementation science approach, the investigators will use&#xD;
      plan-do-study-act cycles to optimize the goal of offering an FCC to all parent(s) of patients&#xD;
      with any FCC criteria. The implementation aim statement is, within 6 months, healthcare team&#xD;
      members will offer an FCC to the parent(s) of &gt;95% of patients who have at least one FCC&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planning (Plan). Development teams at participating institutions have determined how to&#xD;
           inform PICU healthcare team members (HTMs) when a patient has an FCC criterion. A&#xD;
           one-page information sheet (written at a 6th-grade level) describing FCCs, their&#xD;
           potential role and value will be used when offering families a FCC. The development&#xD;
           teams have also created an electronic health record (EHR) note template to document&#xD;
           offering and conducting FCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation (Do). Each weekday, a study team member at each site will review the EHR&#xD;
           to identify patients who have one FCC criteria. A study team member will inform the PICU&#xD;
           team when a patient has at least one FCC criteria and request that an HTM give the&#xD;
           parent(s) the FCC information sheet, offer the parent(s) an FCC, and document the&#xD;
           conversation with the parent(s) in the EHR. The processes for organizing and conducting&#xD;
           FCCs will occur according to the PICU teams' discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection (Study). The investigators will track the occurrence of FCCs by&#xD;
           reviewing the EHR and obtaining input from PICU HTMs. For patients meeting at least one&#xD;
           FCC criteria, but for whom an FCC was not documented, a study team member will ask the&#xD;
           patient's PICU team (either resident, fellow, APRN, or attending) if an FCC occurred&#xD;
           while the patient was admitted. For patients meeting FCC criteria, but for whom an FCC&#xD;
           did not occur, study team members will also document if an FCC was offered by reviewing&#xD;
           the EHR. If there is no EHR documentation about offering parent(s) an FCC, a study team&#xD;
           member will ask the patient's PICU team (within a week of informing them that a patient&#xD;
           met an FCC criteria) if the parent(s) were offered an FCC and if not why the parent(s)&#xD;
           were not offered and FCC. Using input from HTMs, the investigators will record reasons&#xD;
           for not offering an FCC and ascertain why parents opted out of an FCC. In addition to&#xD;
           data about the FCC criteria, the investigators will extract the follow patient data from&#xD;
           the EHR: age; sex; Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 (PIM3) score (measures of PICU&#xD;
           admission illness severity) indication for PICU admission; need for intubation; need for&#xD;
           pressors/vasoactive medications; number of subspecialty teams consulted; and use of&#xD;
           ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Revise implementation plan (Act). The development teams will meet every other week x 4,&#xD;
           then monthly x 4, then every two months to review the data, assess implementation, and&#xD;
           modify the process as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe parents' views of PICU FCCs and factors associated with having PICU FCCs, the&#xD;
      investigators will enroll English- and Spanish-speaking (materials will be available in&#xD;
      Spanish) parents (one or both) of PICU patients &lt;18 years old for whom an FCC occurred or&#xD;
      whose child had at least one FCC criteria. English- and Spanish-speaking parents (one or&#xD;
      both) of PICU patients &lt; 18 years old whose child did not have an FCC criteria and who did&#xD;
      not have an FCC will also be eligible until the investigators have enrolled 100 parents. the&#xD;
      investigators will invite eligible parents to complete a post-FCC Survey within three days of&#xD;
      an FCC (for those that have an FCC). The investigators will invite all eligible parents to&#xD;
      complete a post-PICU Survey and participate in a one-on-one interview within three days of&#xD;
      PICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Post-FCC Survey will ask for information about parent characteristics and feedback on the&#xD;
      FCC. The variables related to parent characteristics will include demographics, family&#xD;
      relationship style (using the Family Apgar), informational support (using the Informational&#xD;
      Support SF4a), and mental health (using the two-item PROMIS® mental health scale) and global&#xD;
      physical health (using the two-item PROMIS® global physical health scale). Items asking for&#xD;
      feedback about the FCC (adapted from previous work) will assess: overall FCC utility; the&#xD;
      topics discussed and their importance to the parents; what was useful and what could be&#xD;
      improved; and whether the parent would like to have another FCC in the future. The post-PICU&#xD;
      Survey will include the same items asking about family characteristics as in the Post-FCC&#xD;
      Survey (not included for parents who completed a post-FCC Survey). The post-PICU Survey will&#xD;
      also include items asking about the utility of other modes of PICU communication (daily&#xD;
      rounds, electronic patient portals, written information, bedside and phone interactions with&#xD;
      physicians/APRNs and bedside nurses, and communication with social workers, chaplains, and&#xD;
      case managers). Finally, the post-PICU Survey will ask if an FCC was offered, request&#xD;
      feedback on FCCs (see above) that occurred (not included if a post-FCC Survey was completed),&#xD;
      and ask why offered FCCs did not occur. All non-validated survey items were reviewed by the&#xD;
      study team, for face validity. Parents of patients who die in the PICU will receive the&#xD;
      post-PICU Survey by mail or email 3-5 weeks after their child's death, as the investigators&#xD;
      and others have done previously. Parents will complete surveys electronically on a tablet&#xD;
      using REDCap. Audio-recorded one-on-one interviews will be conducted by a study team member&#xD;
      using an interview guide that focuses on the following content areas: perceptions of PICU&#xD;
      communications overall; specific modes of communication; why an FCC occurred or did not&#xD;
      occur; and perceptions of FCC utility.&#xD;
