  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to understand the palliative care needs of patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, to investigate whether early palliative care can improve patient outcomes&#xD;
      and reduce use of health care services, and to understand the psychological health of carers&#xD;
      and their satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental design is used, introducing palliative care for patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer within three weeks from diagnosis. The patients are recruited in Dept. of Surgery,&#xD;
      Hospital of North Zealand, which covers the northern catchment area of the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Copenhagen, Denmark. Patients are seen by the palliative care team on home-visits every four&#xD;
      weeks throughout their trajectory, and quality of life is evaluated using the following&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires (QLQs): European Organisation for Research and Treatment of&#xD;
      Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer Patients receiving palliative care (EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-C15-PAL), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire for Pancreatic Cancer Patients (EORTC QLQ-PAN26), and Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS). For carers, mental health is evaluated using HADS and satisfaction&#xD;
      with care is evaluated using the Family Caregivers' Satisfaction With Palliative Care in&#xD;
      Advanced Cancer Questionnaire (FAMCARE-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is health care service use (acute hospital admissions, days in hospital).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are survival and place of death. Data are compared with historical control&#xD;
      patients treated in the same hospital before introduction of early palliative care. These&#xD;
      outcomes are readily available from patient records and are expected to carry a very low risk&#xD;
      of bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative care needs at referral in the study group will be compared with palliative care&#xD;
      needs in the subgroup of historical control patients referred to palliative care on-demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For outcomes where unbiased historical control data are not available a prospective&#xD;
      observational approach is used. These include symptom burden, weight, psychological health&#xD;
      and satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size needed to show a clinically significant decrease in acute hospital&#xD;
      admissions is 70, 35 participating in the prospective study and 35 historical control&#xD;
      patients. The study will include 40-50 patients and their carers from September 2019 to&#xD;
      September 2020.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with symptoms compatible with pancreatic cancer living in the northern catchment&#xD;
      area of the Capital Region of Copenhagen, Denmark, are referred to Dept. of Surgery, Hospital&#xD;
      of North Zealand for further investigations. Cases diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are&#xD;
      discussed at a regional Multi-Disciplinary-Team (MDT) conference and either referred for&#xD;
      surgery or chemotherapy or receive best supportive care in Dept. of Surgery. The Palliative&#xD;
      Care Unit at Hospital of North Zealand covers the same geographical area with 310,000&#xD;
      inhabitants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to Dept. of Surgery and diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are offered&#xD;
      participation in this study. All participants will receive home-visits from the palliative&#xD;
      care team every four weeks, starting within three weeks from diagnosis and until end-of-life&#xD;
      or cure without residual palliative needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design chosen is a quasi-experimental design using historical control patients for&#xD;
      the primary outcome: use of health care services (acute hospital admissions, days in&#xD;
      hospital) and the secondary outcomes: survival and place of death. The historical control&#xD;
      patients were diagnosed before the introduction of early palliative care. The outcomes are&#xD;
      readily available from patient records and are expected to carry a very low risk of&#xD;
      registration bias. Palliative care needs at referral in the study group will be compared with&#xD;
      palliative care needs in the subgroup of historical control patients referred to palliative&#xD;
      care on-demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be collected for participants and historical controls to evaluate if&#xD;
      any selection bias or other systematic differences exist between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For outcomes where unbiased historical control data are not available a prospective&#xD;
      observational approach is used. These include symptom burden, psychological health and&#xD;
      satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 40-50 patients and their carers from September 2019 to September 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment to this project will take place in Dept. of Surgery, Hospital of North Zealand to&#xD;
      which all patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer and living in the northern catchment&#xD;
      area of the Capital Region of Copenhagen will be referred for further investigations. The&#xD;
      patients will be informed about their diagnosis by the responsible surgeon in the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic in an undisturbed environment. The patients will then be informed about the&#xD;
      possibility of participation in the present study. They will receive both oral and written&#xD;
      information about the project and will be allowed enough time to consider participation&#xD;
      before deciding, as long as it allows contact to the palliative care team within three weeks&#xD;
      from diagnosis. It is expected that most patients will come to Dept. of Surgery with a family&#xD;
      member or friend, as they are aware that they will receive the results from the&#xD;
      investigations performed. However, patients will be informed that they have a right to come&#xD;
      back for further information about the protocol accompanied by a family member or any other&#xD;
      person they want to bring. They will meet either a surgeon or a palliative care physician who&#xD;
      can give further information and answer any possible questions at this meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained before any protocol related procedures are&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carers will receive separate oral and written information either on the same day as the&#xD;
      patient or when meeting the palliative care team on the first visit. Carers will sign a&#xD;
      separate consent form if they want to participate in the study. Carers have the same rights&#xD;
      as the patients regarding time for consideration and further information before signing the&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative Care Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and carers will be seen on home-visits. The first time they will meet a doctor and&#xD;
      usually also a nurse, while follow-up home-visits can be undertaken by either a doctor or a&#xD;
      nurse. Home-visits are scheduled every four weeks. Patients can contact a doctor or a&#xD;
      specialised nurse on weekdays for consultation. The palliative care nurse will contact a&#xD;
      palliative care physician if needed for change of treatment or other reasons. Palliative care&#xD;
      is offered in parallel with any specific cancer treatment given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive standard palliative care including treatment of symptoms (e.g.&#xD;
      pain, nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite, diarrhoea or fatigue), psychosocial support,&#xD;
      physiotherapy, nutritional counselling and advance care planning, depending on their needs.&#xD;
      The palliative care team comprises physicians, nurses, a physiotherapist and a chaplain.&#xD;
      Patients and/or carers scoring 8 or more on HADS for anxiety and/or depression will be&#xD;
      advised to be referred to a psychologist via their general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pancreatic cancer are normally referred to palliative care when the surgeon,&#xD;
      oncologist or general practitioner taking care of them find that they are not able to meet&#xD;
      their palliative care needs, or if the patients and their families request a referral. Most&#xD;
      patients are referred late in their trajectory and only half of the patients are referred. We&#xD;
      do not know whether patients not referred to palliative care in the routine setting have&#xD;
      palliative care needs, whether they are met by other physicians or whether they have unsolved&#xD;
      palliative care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients accepting inclusion in the project will get specialised palliative care throughout&#xD;
      their trajectory, within three weeks after diagnosis until end-of-life or cure without&#xD;
      residual palliative care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both patients participating in the project and patients referred on-demand will receive&#xD;
      four-weekly visits in their homes. Patients participating in the project are guaranteed that&#xD;
      the first visit will take place within three weeks after diagnosis, whereas patients referred&#xD;
      on-demand might have to wait longer before they meet the palliative care team.&#xD;
