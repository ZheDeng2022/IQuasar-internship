  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactate is formed naturally in the body in example during physical activity. However, lactate&#xD;
      is also formed during food fermentation where certain bacterial strains form lactate. Lactate&#xD;
      can also be produced chemically. An example of this is Ringer-lactate which is used for&#xD;
      volume replacement when treating dehydrated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a source of carbon-molecules, lactate is believed to be an important oxidative fuel source&#xD;
      in all major organs and yields adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production through Krebs cycle,&#xD;
      the Electron Transport Chain in the mitochondria as well as by being a key precursor for&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is the first drug of choice for type 2 diabetes treatment. Use of metformin often&#xD;
      results in a small but significant weight loss in overweight users. It is known that&#xD;
      metformin increases the lactate concentration in the gut. It is also known also know that&#xD;
      metformin use is associated with an increase in blood concentrations of growth&#xD;
      differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15). Receptors for GDF-15 can be found in parts of the brain&#xD;
      associated with control of appetite. In rats increases in [GDF-15] results in a decrease in&#xD;
      appetite and thus weight loss. GDF-15 is thought to be involved in the normal energy&#xD;
      homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study the investigators want to examine the hormonal, metabolic and mechanical&#xD;
      effects of lactate in the gut in healthy volunteers. Our hypothesis is that lactate has&#xD;
      beneficial effects which may be though an increase in GDF-15 in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo two study days separated by at least 7 days and a maximum of 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day one volunteers will drink a sodium-lactate solution (intervention). The&#xD;
           investigators will also administrate 1500mg paracetamol to assess gastric emptying and&#xD;
           do blood samples over 4 hours. The investigators measure [lactate] every 15 min. Every&#xD;
           hour the investigators will ask volunteers questions regarding hunger and thoughts of&#xD;
           future food intake (questionnaire). After 4 hours of blood sampling the investigators&#xD;
           will serve volunteers an all-you-can-eat meal of sandwich and measure how must they ate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day two volunteers will drink a sodium chloride solution. Furthermore, the&#xD;
           investigators administrate intravenous D/L sodium lactate in order to reach the same&#xD;
           plasma [lactate] on day 2 as was done on day 1. The rest of day two is identical to day&#xD;
           1.&#xD;
