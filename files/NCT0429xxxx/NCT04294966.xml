  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased accessibility to cannabis and its primary psychoactive constituent THC has raised&#xD;
      public health concerns. One major concern surrounds the potential risks associated with acute&#xD;
      THC intoxication and who might be most at risk. A second major concern is the need to develop&#xD;
      sensitive measures that can detect THC intoxication after recent use and enable robust&#xD;
      comparisons of intoxication to determine sources of risk. One potential source of risk is&#xD;
      age, specifically during the period of adolescence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited knowledge on the effects of THC in adolescents vs adults. One recent report&#xD;
      compared responses to vaporized cannabis in heavy adolescent vs adult cannabis users and&#xD;
      found that the adolescents were less sensitive to the drug on most measures. However, their&#xD;
      findings were complicated by several factors: i) the study used vaporized cannabis, which may&#xD;
      have other constituents and does not offer full control of the dose, ii) the participants&#xD;
      were heavy users, making it difficult to determine the influence of prior drug exposure, and&#xD;
      iii) the participants were not drug-free at the time of testing. Prior exposure to THC can&#xD;
      lead to tolerance, and adolescents and adults may differ in the rate at which they develop&#xD;
      tolerance, consistent with changes in CB1R receptor function. Our study will compare&#xD;
      adolescent (here, aged 18 to 20) and adult (here, aged 30 to 40) responses to THC in&#xD;
      relatively light cannabis users who are drug-free at the time of testing.&#xD;

    <description>The POMS measures individuals' mood states. This is a validated scale to measure positive and negative mood states. The POMS contains 30 items and assess six identified mood factors: Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Ejection, Anger - Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment. Scoring of this instrument provides a global score of 0 to 120 or individual domain scores. Lower scores indicate better mood state. The POMS brief form is a simple self-rating instrument</description>

    <description>THC (Marinol® [dronabinol]; Solvay Pharmaceuticals) will be orally administered in doses of 7.5 mg and 15 mg, in opaque capsules with dextrose filler. Placebo capsules contain only dextrose. These doses of THC are known to produce performance impairments as well as subjective intoxication with little to no adverse reactions in experienced occasional, but non-daily cannabis users (Ménétrey et al., 2005; Issa et al. 2016).</description>
