  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will implement and evaluate an integrated, evidence-based bundle of&#xD;
      family-centred, emergency mental health and addictions care. This care bundle will provide&#xD;
      high value to families, matching resources and services to need while eliminating healthcare&#xD;
      inefficiencies and closing care gaps. The bundle will introduce two well-established tools&#xD;
      for healthcare providers to use in EDs, walk-in clinics, and urgent mental health care&#xD;
      appointments. These tools are the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) and HEADS-ED, an&#xD;
      assessment mnemonic (Home; Education &amp; Employment; Activities &amp; Peers; Drugs &amp; Alcohol;&#xD;
      Suicidality; Emotions &amp; Behaviours; Discharge or Current Resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bundle will also introduce new processes to improve healthcare system efficiencies,&#xD;
      navigation and transitions between healthcare sectors. For families who receive care in the&#xD;
      ED, the investigators will remove the physician gatekeeper role so that children/youth who&#xD;
      are screened as low-risk will be offered a follow-up appointment in an urgent mental health&#xD;
      care clinic within 24-48 hours. Those who screen as high-risk will see a mental health&#xD;
      specialist and undergo a HEADS-ED assessment. Families who follow up in the clinic will&#xD;
      receive care that applies a Choice And Partnership Approach (CAPA). CAPA is a collaborative&#xD;
      approach to healthcare, where healthcare providers work in partnership with children/youth&#xD;
      and their parents to identify choices for care that best match individual needs and&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Goal: The investigators' goal is the right care, with the right people, at the right&#xD;
      place and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: To measure the bundle's impact, the investigators will use an interrupted time&#xD;
      series (ITS) design.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient wellbeing at 30 days</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after the index emergency department (ED) visit</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in survey completed by the participant using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) for patients ≥14 years of age, and the Stirling Children's Wellbeing Scale (SCWBS) for patients &lt;14 years of age.&#xD;
For the WEMWBS, each item is scored on a range from 1 to 5. The resulting total score will be between 14 and 70, with lower scores indicating poor wellbeing, and higher scores indicating greater wellbeing. Very low wellbeing is defined as a score of ≤ 45. A substantial decrease in wellbeing is defined as a decrease by 5 or more points.&#xD;
For the SCWBS, each item is scored on a range from 1 to 5. The resulting total score will be between 12 and 60, with lower scores indicating poor wellbeing, and higher scores indicating greater wellbeing. Very low wellbeing is defined as a score of ≤ 30. A substantial decrease in wellbeing is defined as a decrease by 5 or more points.</description>

    <measure>Family functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after the index ED visit</time_frame>

    <measure>Satisfaction with acute mental health and addictions ED care</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after the index ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in survey completed by the participant using the Service Satisfaction Scale 10 (SSS-10). The scale consists of 12 items (parent version) or 10 items (youth version). Items are scored on a 5-point response scale with a total possible score of 60 (parent) or 50 (youth). Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.</description>
