    <textblock>
      ORLAU is a clinical department of the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital. We&#xD;
      treat patients with a wide range of movement disorders affecting their walking or arm&#xD;
      function. One of the most common gait issues we see is toe-walking, this is most prevalent in&#xD;
      those patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Toe-walking in CP children arises mostly from&#xD;
      problems in the calf muscle, we currently use gait analysis to help guide treatment&#xD;
      management plans. Two standard interventions for such cases are serial casting and Botulinum&#xD;
      Toxin-A injections. Using gait analysis we will be able to see changes to the gait pattern&#xD;
      before and after the interventions, however, we want to obtain a whole clinical picture,&#xD;
      using B-mode ultrasound, elastography and electromyography (EMG) we will be able to achieve&#xD;
      this. These measurements will provide us with information about the muscle architecture and&#xD;
      properties including activation. This will help us to determine the effects of the&#xD;
      interventions. Elastography is a fairly new clinical technique that uses shear waves&#xD;
      generated by the ultrasound probe to map the stiffness of a muscle. Stiffness of muscle is a&#xD;
      good indication of myopathies. The additional examinations we want to carry out are all&#xD;
      non-invasive, they will be carried out in two sessions, one before the intervention and one&#xD;
      after. We will compare the data we collect from the children with CP to our normal database&#xD;
      with ORLAU has ethical approval for. The final stage of this study will be to use the muscle&#xD;
      parameters obtained by ultrasound to set parameters in a computer musculoskeletal model.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact on gait and morphology of the calf muscle&#xD;
      in children with Cerebral Palsy with equinus gait pattern following serial casting and&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin (Btx) interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toe walking is a common feature of a number of orthopaedic and neurological problems (e.g.&#xD;
      cerebral palsy, idiopathic toe walking and stroke). Patients who toe walk often develop&#xD;
      contractures in their calf muscles and in the longer term may suffer from foot or calf pain&#xD;
      and foot deformities. Toe walking also causes difficulties with balance and leads to&#xD;
      secondary compensations and deformities. The causes of toe walking are not always clear for&#xD;
      individual patients. Current interventions target the perceived causes (e.g. surgery,&#xD;
      stretching or orthotics for contracture or botulinum toxin injections for excessive activity)&#xD;
      but the relationship between toe walking and the impairment in muscle morphology and control&#xD;
      is not fully understood. Clinical movement analysis is used to quantify joint motion and&#xD;
      loading during gait. This is done according to established local departmental protocol and is&#xD;
      part of routine clinical practice. This is done using the Video Based Motion Analysis System&#xD;
      Ltd (VICON), which is a 3D movement analysis modality which makes use of small, spherical&#xD;
      reflective markers, between 5mm and 25mm in diameter that are attached to the skin over key&#xD;
      anatomical landmarks (located during the clinical examination). Special infrared cameras are&#xD;
      used to track the movements of reflective markers in three dimensions. This is combined with&#xD;
      AMTI force plates; which together give the kinematics and kinetics of the subject.&#xD;
      Electromyography (EMG) of the Triceps Surae and Tibialis Anterior enables observation of&#xD;
      muscle activity in conjunction with the gait cycle during different movements. After&#xD;
      obtaining participant consent and ensuring that the participant fully understands the scope&#xD;
      of the tasks, the session is undertaken. In brief, using local ORLAU department protocol, a&#xD;
      clinician places reflective markers on the subject and anthropometric measurements are taken.&#xD;
      After the subject is prepared, they are asked to walk along a 10-metre walkway at a self&#xD;
      selected speed and a minimum of 6 trials are collected with adequate strikes with each foot&#xD;
      landing on the force plate to obtain desired kinematic and kinetic data. EMG recordings are&#xD;
      performed simultaneously on the Medial &amp; Lateral Gastrocnemius, Soleus, and Tibialis Anterior&#xD;
      to record muscle activity during the movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain information about the morphology, the modality of B-mode ultrasound evaluated the&#xD;
      muscle morphology and obtains key information such as muscle fibre length, fibre orientation,&#xD;
      pennation angle, cross sectional area, and muscle thickness. After obtaining consent and&#xD;
      ensuring that the participant understands fully the scope of the session, they are asked to&#xD;
      lie prone on the plinth with lower legs exposed so that the assessor has access to the calf&#xD;
      muscles. The assessor then uses the b-mode ultrasound protocol to obtain the key parameters&#xD;
      of the calf muscle. Muscle lengths are measured using a Vernier caliper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the imaging modality elastography is used. This uses mechanical force, from&#xD;
      manual pressure or through a shear wave impulse generated within the ultrasound probe, to&#xD;
      detect the change in deformation of the examined tissue and therefore to determine the&#xD;
      stiffness. The stiffness of soft tissues can be an indication of pathology. Elastography uses&#xD;
      harmless ultrasound waves and allows for the visualisation of strain across a tissue, by&#xD;
      superimposing the colour coded elasticity map onto a conventional B-mode image. The colours&#xD;
      represent the stiffness of the tissue ranging from red to green to blue, with the exact scale&#xD;
      varying between vendors. Shear wave elastography has the added advantage of being able to&#xD;
      provide velocity measurements within a defined region of interest, thus quantifying tissue&#xD;
      stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to beginning the session, consent from the subject is obtained and the scope of the&#xD;
      session is explained. After consent from the participant, the subject is asked to lie prone&#xD;
      on the plinth with their lower legs exposed. The consultant radiologist undertakes&#xD;
      elastography measures on the calf muscles (medial, lateral gastrocnemius, soleus) in&#xD;
      longitudinal and transverse planes according to the protocol. These are then saved after the&#xD;
      key information is obtained and analysed after the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer modelling can estimate muscle forces during gait, and it is used to study a wide&#xD;
      range of conditions such as spastic paresis and crouch gait. Ultrasound can provide&#xD;
      information about muscle parameters such as volume, length, anatomical cross-sectional area&#xD;
      and pennation angle. This information can be used to adjust the parameters of the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal model to fit the characteristics of each patient. The musculoskeletal model&#xD;
      can then estimate personalised muscle forces and help understand the individual impairments&#xD;
      which lead to toe walking. Future prospects Clinical- The computer models will assist with&#xD;
      the precise identification of impairments (eg muscle atrophy, contracture and spasticity) and&#xD;
      hence allow more objective specification and targeting of interventions. Combining the data&#xD;
      collected from B mode ultrasound, elastography and gait analysis, the effects of clinical&#xD;
      interventions in muscle properties can be observed. This can be applied to other&#xD;
      interventions, including orthopaedic surgery and orthotic devices. Elastography can also be a&#xD;
      vital tool in understanding the elastic muscle properties associated with myopathies and can&#xD;
      help optimise and personalise care by selecting the most effective intervention based on an&#xD;
      individual's baseline features.&#xD;
