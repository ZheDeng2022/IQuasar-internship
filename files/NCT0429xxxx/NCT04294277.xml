  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the benefit of Pemigatinib, a drug that&#xD;
      has indicated promising effects for relapse free survival in molecularly-selected, high-risk&#xD;
      patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have received radical surgery. Patients will&#xD;
      receive Pemigatinib at a once-daily dose on a continuous schedule, continued until 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, Phase II study, evaluating safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      INCB054828 (Pemigatinib) as adjuvant therapy for molecularly-selected, high-risk patients&#xD;
      with urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have received radical surgery. Patients will receive&#xD;
      Pemigatinib at a once-daily (QD) dose of 13.5 mg on a continuous schedule. Treatment will be&#xD;
      continued until 12 months, or until the evidence of disease relapse or onset of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperphosphatemia can be managed with diet modification, phosphate binders, or dose&#xD;
      modification. Since mineralization of the cornea and retinal changes consisting of serous&#xD;
      retinal detachment have been reported in humans, ophthalmic exams are done at baseline and&#xD;
      once every 12 weeks during treatment and should include a visual acuity test, slit-lamp&#xD;
      examination and fundoscopy. Additional assessments (e.g. Orbital computerized tomography (CT)&#xD;
      should be done if clinically relevant retinal findings are observed on ophthalmologic exams&#xD;
      and in participants with reported visual adverse events (AEs) or change in visual acuity, if&#xD;
      the events or changes are suspected to be of retinal origin.&#xD;

    <description>At Day 1, prior to the start of treatment, results from screening visit evaluations are reviewed to determine eligibility requirements. Subsequent visits during treatment phase will take place at Day 8, Day 15 and Day 21 and subsequently at 3 week intervals. Timing of subsequent visits can be prolonged to max. 9 week intervals if no problems exist during the first 12 weeks of therapy. Subjects will self-administer study drug using an oral QD regimen in a continuous dosing schedule. Each dose of Pemigatinib should be taken first thing in the morning upon waking or after a 2-hour fast; subjects should then fast for an additional 1 hour after taking study drug. The starting dose is 13.5 mg Pemigatinib. Study treatment will continue until 12 months, or until the evidence of disease relapse or onset of unacceptable toxicity.</description>
