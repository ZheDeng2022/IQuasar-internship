      The aim of the study is to identify the role of preoperative chlorepheniramine maleate on&#xD;
      alleviating or reducing the severity of postoperative agitation following FESS procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 90 adult patients undergoing FESS procedure for sinusitis with postoperative nasal&#xD;
      packing. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before randomization.&#xD;
      Patients will be divided equally into two groups the first 45 patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      chlorepheniramine maleate group (A) and the other group to placebo group (B). Group&#xD;
      assignment, preparation and administration of drugs will be performed by a junior anesthetist&#xD;
      who is neither involved nor interested by any means in the study. Blind grouping will be kept&#xD;
      to all including the patients themselves, until the completion of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The inclusion criteria of these patients include adult&#xD;
      patients (age 18- 60 years), class I-II according to American society of anaesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) physical status subjected to FESS without septoplasty. Exclusion criteria include;&#xD;
      patients below 18 years old or over 60 years old, patients with ASA physical status class&#xD;
      III-IV, morbid obesity with BMI &gt; 30 kgm-2 at initial hospital visit, history of&#xD;
      neuro-psychatric ailment or chronic use of antipsychotic drugs, severe cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, any coagulopathies, pregnancy, history of relevant drug allergy, any possibility of&#xD;
      anticipated difficult intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Anesthetic Assessment All patients will be subjected to a thorough medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, laboratory investigations (fasting blood sugar, kidney, liver&#xD;
      function tests, serum electrolytes, coagulation profile, and electrocardiogram)&#xD;
      preoperatively. They will be also counseled about the anesthetic management and potential&#xD;
      complications of both surgery and anesthesia, and the explanations of numerical pain analogue&#xD;
      scale (NAS) from 0-10. All these data will be documented. A thorough airway assessment by&#xD;
      Mallampati classification, mouth opening, neck movement, thyromental distance will be done to&#xD;
      find out any possibility of difficult intubation. If there is a chance of significant&#xD;
      difficult intubation, the patient will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Protocol All patients admitted to OR induction area where patient identification&#xD;
      is confirmed and an 18-gauge intravenous cannula will be inserted to all Participants.&#xD;
      Participants of group A will receive only one ampoule of 45.5 mg/ 2mL chlorepheniramine&#xD;
      maleate diluted in 8 ml isotonic saline intravenous (I.V) prior to induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia by 30 minutes while participants in group (B) will receive 10 ml isotonic saline&#xD;
      (placebo) by the same route as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be started for all patients with intravenous lignocaine 1.0 mg/kg,&#xD;
      propofol 2.0 mg/kg, then atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, fentanyl 1 µg/kg then they will be intubated&#xD;
      orally which is fixed after confirmation of its place by auscultation then oral packing with&#xD;
      wet gauze under vision using laryngoscope. Anesthesia will be maintained by mixture of O2 and&#xD;
      air along with 2% sevoflurane then atracurium 0.1 mg/kg will be given for maintenance of&#xD;
      muscle relaxation.. All patients will be monitored by standard monitors including, the pulse&#xD;
      oximeter, non-invasive blood pressure, end-tidal C02, and electrocardiogram. Moreover,&#xD;
      bispectral index monitor is used to assess depth of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliberate hypotension will be done using intravenous infusion of nitroglycerine at a rate of&#xD;
      5 to 20 µg/ kg /minute titrated to target mean arterial blood pressure (Mbp) of 55±5 mmHg.&#xD;
      Hypotensive anesthesia will be maintained throughout the surgical procedure. At the end of&#xD;
      surgery, mean arterial blood pressure (Mbp) will be elevated by stoppage of nitroglycerine&#xD;
      infusion and infusing crystalloids (500-1000ml) together with administration of ephedrine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 10 mg IV to restore the mean arterial blood pressure back to the preoperative&#xD;
      value. Upon attaining spontaneous breathing muscle relaxant will be antagonized by 50 µg/kg&#xD;
      neostigmine and 10 µg/kg glycopyrolate, then oral pack will be removed under vision with&#xD;
      thorough oral suctioning then awake extubation will be done and the patients will be&#xD;
      transferred to the recovery unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Analgesic Regimen It will start immediately on arrival to the recovery unit&#xD;
      where patients received 16 mg lornoxicam slowly IV over 5 minutes. After that all patients&#xD;
      will receive acetaminophen 1 gm/6 h IV and 5 mg Nalbuphine IV if breakthrough pain develops&#xD;
      for the first day postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Assessment Patients will be transferred to Post-anesthesia care unit PACU for&#xD;
      observation and assessment for agitation and pain. Upon arrival to PACU, a pulse oximeter and&#xD;
      Non invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitors will be attached to the patient. Discharge&#xD;
      criteria from PACU will be stable vital signs, pain score less than or equal to 2, no nausea&#xD;
      or vomiting, calm and alert patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of agitation Postoperative agitation will be assessed in the PACU by a blinded&#xD;
      observer using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) as follows: 0= Alert and calm +1=&#xD;
      Restless; Anxious and /or apprehensive but movements not aggressive. +2= agitated; Frequent&#xD;
      non-purposeful movement. +3= very agitated; Pulls on or removes the tubes or catheters or has&#xD;
      aggressive behavior toward staff. +4= combative; overly combative or violent. Total agitation&#xD;
      will be defined as the algebraic sum of agitation values will be observed at the measured&#xD;
      time points (0, 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes after recovery), and this will be used to correlate&#xD;
      agitation with other variables. The agitations score range will be from 0= no agitation to&#xD;
      20= severe persistent agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of severe persistent agitation with RASS &gt; 12 in the first 15 minutes postoperatively&#xD;
      patients will be reassured and midazolam 2 mg IV will be given to reduce agitation with&#xD;
      thorough follow up of patient's breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pain Pain intensity will be assessed as a secondary outcome to the&#xD;
      investigator's study using visual analogue scale where 0= no pain and 10 is the worst&#xD;
      imaginable pain as rated by the patient. A blinded team member assessed pain after evaluation&#xD;
      of last agitation point (30 minutes of recovery). Patient that exhibited no agitation will be&#xD;
      also evaluated for pain after 30 minutes of recovery. Nalbuphine will be used as rescue&#xD;
      analgesic to ameliorate pain. The use of nalbuphine after evaluation of agitation and&#xD;
      assessment of pain to avoid perplex to the outcome measurement. If pain is more than +6 on&#xD;
      VAS Nalbuphine will be given in 5 mg until pain score &lt; 4. Pain assessment is done after 2, 6&#xD;
      , 12 and 24 hours postoperatively with calculating the frequency of rescue analgesia given&#xD;
      and the total dose of nalbuphine consumed during that time taking care not to exceed 5 Mg at&#xD;
      a time with drug lag of at least 2 hours between 2 successive doses of rescue agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point to this study is the occurance of severe agitation endangering the&#xD;
      patient, or the occurance hypoxemia, bleeding nasal or oral, or the occurance of&#xD;
      postoperative atypical hypotension.&#xD;
