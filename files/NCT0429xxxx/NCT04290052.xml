    <textblock>
      An increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) after patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure was&#xD;
      observed in randomized trials but systematic screening of AF was not performed in these&#xD;
      studies. Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate incidence of AF in patients who&#xD;
      underwent percutaneous PFO closure with serial 24-hours ambulatory ECG (AECG) monitoring&#xD;
      during 6 months follow-up. Primary endpoint was incidence of AF on ECG monitoring. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints were clinical outcomes (symptoms, hospitalization from cardiovascular causes,&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, or bleeding) up to 6 month follow-up.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, bicentric, observational cohort study which will be performed in&#xD;
      University hospital center of Montpellier and NÃ®mes The study will include all consecutive&#xD;
      patients, admitted for a percutaneous PFO closure after an ischemic stroke (IS) or a&#xD;
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) of cryptogenic origin, or after the occurrence of a&#xD;
      decompression illness during scuba diving. Patients eligible for the closure of a FOP in&#xD;
      prevention of the recurrence of stroke or TIA of cryptogenic origin, was systematically&#xD;
      evaluated for exclusion of supraventricular arrhythmia in accordance with international&#xD;
      recommendations. This evaluation included a 12-lead ECG as well as an extended&#xD;
      electrocardiographic monitoring lasting more than or equal to 24 hours (most frequently,&#xD;
      performing a 72-hour ECG Holter). All patients previously has a transesophageal ultrasound&#xD;
      (TEE) allowing to retain the diagnosis of PFO, to assess the presence or not of an atrial&#xD;
      septum aneurysm (ASA) associated with PFO and to quantify the right to left shunt thanks to a&#xD;
      contrast test potentiated by a Valsalva maneuver. Exclusion criteria included interatrial&#xD;
      defect with left to right and others indications for PFO closure that cryptogenic stroke or&#xD;
      decompression illness. Indication of PFO closure is always validated by a cardio neurological&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study was incidence of AF defined as an irregular rhythm without&#xD;
      discernible P waves lasting at least 30 seconds on ECG monitoring during the 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the characteristics of the&#xD;
      supra-ventricular arrhythmias (delay in onset, duration, recurrent nature), incidence of&#xD;
      others arrhythmia, symptoms, and prognostic implications of AF (hospitalization , need of&#xD;
      curative anticoagulation, need for cardioversion and occurrence of neurological accident&#xD;
      documented by imagery (ischemic stroke or TIA). The investigators also evaluated risk factors&#xD;
      for occurrence of arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 patients included during 1 year is expected&#xD;
