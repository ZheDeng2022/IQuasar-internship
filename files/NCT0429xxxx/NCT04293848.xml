    <textblock>
      The goal of the planned Randomized Control Trial is to explore the effect of vibroacoustic&#xD;
      therapy on acute stress of university students. The theoretical framework of the study is&#xD;
      based on biopsychosocial model of stress and multimodal approach to measurement. The trial is&#xD;
      designed as single-blinded, placebo-controlled, with participants individually randomized&#xD;
      into two parallel-groups, including equal randomization and blocked allocation of&#xD;
      participants. 420 participants are all full-time university students (18-30 years) and will&#xD;
      be divided into two groups: an experimental group (receiving low vibrations combined with&#xD;
      music) and a control group (only music without low-frequency sounds). For both groups acute&#xD;
      stress response will be measured by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV SA),&#xD;
      galvanic skin response (GSR), salivary cortisol, standardized psychological questionnaires -&#xD;
      visual analogue scales for stress (VAS-stress) and Perceived Stress Scales-10, Czech version&#xD;
      (PSS-10). It is expected that the experimental group will demonstrate a lower level of stress&#xD;
      response that will be measured by higher activity of parasympathetic activity, lower level of&#xD;
      skin resistance, lower level of salivary cortisol and lower subjective perception of stress.&#xD;
      If vibroacoustic therapy turns out to be effective, it can be viewed as safe,&#xD;
      student-friendly and inexpensive prevention of stress-related health problems and promote the&#xD;
      health of students in the course of university education.&#xD;

      Primary objective: to explore whether application of vibroacoustic therapy has more&#xD;
      significant effect on eliminating acute stress response in university students than music&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: &quot;Does the application of vibroacoustic therapy (low frequency vibration&#xD;
      with music) show a more significant effect on decreasing an acute stress response (measured&#xD;
      by HRV SA, GSR, salivary cortisol) and perception of stress (measured on VAS) in university&#xD;
      students compared to listening to music without technologically modified low-vibrations?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The recruitment of suitable research participants will be carried out among&#xD;
      students studying at Faculty of Education at Palacky University in Olomouc, Czech Republic,&#xD;
      provided that all inclusive criteria are met. Participants will be recruited by three&#xD;
      researchers via mail and personal contact with students at the start of each of two semesters&#xD;
      of one academic year. Only students with medium or high levels of acute stress will&#xD;
      participate on the research experiment (level of stress measured by PSS-10, min. 20 points&#xD;
      are required from participants). Recruiting process will be coordinated and overseen by a&#xD;
      recruitment coordinator. Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes will be used as a&#xD;
      mechanism for allocation concealment. The allocation sequence will be generated at a remote&#xD;
      workplace by a specialist not participating in enrollment and assignment of participants for&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a parallel group, two arms, superiority trial with 1.1. allocation ratio. Equal blocked&#xD;
      randomization (with block size 8) with stratification according to the gender will be used&#xD;
      here. The randomization scheme will determine which persons will be placed in the&#xD;
      intervention group and the control group (placebo) The randomization will be implemented by a&#xD;
      computerized random number generator (program Sealed Envelope).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is triple-blinded (blinded will be participants, statisticians as well as&#xD;
      outcome measurements). Considering one-shot character of research experiment in every&#xD;
      participant possibility of emergency unblinding has not been considered, nor systematic plans&#xD;
      to promote participantsÂ´ retention and complete follow-up have not been created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research experiment: After recruitment students will be divided into the experimental or&#xD;
      control groups by means of randomization. Experimental group will get full intervention&#xD;
      including music with low-frequency sound. Control group will listen to the same music as&#xD;
      planned for experimental group without the low-frequency sound in the frequency range 20-100&#xD;
      Hz (no vibrations). Measurements in two parallel groups will be carried out by two trained&#xD;
      persons under supervision by a psychologist, physiological measurement experts and a research&#xD;
      coordinator overseeing adherence to experimental protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: The measurement methods consist of (1) heart rate variability spectral&#xD;
      analysis, (2) galvanic skin response, (3) salivary cortisol, (4) Perceived Stress Scale&#xD;
      questionnaire, (5) visual analogue scales for stress and (6) a questionnaire of own&#xD;
      construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data analysis methods will be based on statistical processing in the&#xD;
      form of the one-way (factor Vibroacoustic/Placebo) repeated measures (factor Before/After)&#xD;
      ANOVA. The intervention arm will be compared against the control for all primary analyses and&#xD;
      significant differences in the responses of autonomous nervous system, salivary cortisol and&#xD;
      the stress perception will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Listening to vibroacoustic therapy recording (music with low-frequency vibrations) will&#xD;
      stimulate higher levels of parasympathetic nervous activity compared to listening to music&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Listening to vibroacoustic therapy recording (music with low-frequency vibrations) will&#xD;
      stimulate lower levels of salivary cortisol compared to listening to music alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Listening to vibroacoustic therapy recording (music with low-frequency vibrations) will&#xD;
      stimulate lower levels of subjective perception of stress compared to listening to music&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
