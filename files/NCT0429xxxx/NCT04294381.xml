      Health care decisions should include patients' health outcome goals and care preferences so&#xD;
      as to enable a unified set of individualized patient outcome goals, rather than disparate&#xD;
      disease-specific goals that do not reflect patient choice and commitment. This study utilizes&#xD;
      a skilled professional interview and a simple tablet-based tool to enable patient choice of&#xD;
      health behavior goals. The tool guides the patient to choose a specific, measurable,&#xD;
      attainable, realistic and time-based (SMART) goal. The hypothesis of this study is that the&#xD;
      implementation this patient choice tool will increase the likelihood of patient adherence to&#xD;
      the goal and increase patient self efficacy.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients who participate in the Women's Heart Clinic at Hadassah will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Patients are to be included in this study if they have undergone&#xD;
      cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or stroke,)&#xD;
      had an active cardiac symptom (e.g. chest pain or arrhythmia) or had three or more active&#xD;
      risk factors (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral artery disease, current&#xD;
      smoker, family history of premature coronary disease, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced&#xD;
      hypertension/pre-eclampsia, or obesity). Patients are excluded if they arere pregnant, have&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes, a psychiatric diagnosis that precluded participation, dementia, or if they&#xD;
      were under the care of another multi-disciplinary clinic. The Hadassah Heart Center for Women&#xD;
      follows a team-based approach, consisting of a cardiologist, nurse/coordinator, nutritionist,&#xD;
      physical therapist/exercise expert and psychologist. At the first visit, patients met with&#xD;
      all five professionals. The nurse/coordinator interviews the patient and assists in baseline&#xD;
      data collection. The physician obtains the history, conducted physical examinations and&#xD;
      determined cardiac care plans. The nutritionist assesses the patient's diet and assists the&#xD;
      patient with determining SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound)&#xD;
      goals using the table tool. The physical therapist/exercise expret performs an assessment of&#xD;
      physical activity capacity and behaviors,a 6 minute walk test, and assists the patient in&#xD;
      determining SMART goals for increased physical activity. The psychologist assessed patient&#xD;
      for active mental health concerns that would interfere with self-care, assisted her in&#xD;
      developing a plan to maximize self-care and developed a referral plan for patients who&#xD;
      required mental health intervention. Patient cases are reviewed in a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      meeting after the visit and a comprehensive letter including specific recommendations from&#xD;
      each member of the team was sent to the patient (In Israel, letters are given to the patient&#xD;
      rather than directly to the referring physician.) Follow up appointments are scheduled&#xD;
      according to clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection included age, medical history, country of birth, education, and&#xD;
      monthly income. Cardiac risk factors included the inclusion criteria as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health behaviors including nutrition behaviors, physical activity behaviors, smoking and&#xD;
      alcohol consumption are measured using a culturally-adapted translation of the Healthy Heart&#xD;
      Score and Mediterranean Diet Score. The patients fill out the Depression, Anxiety, Stress&#xD;
      Score and the Brief Experiential Avoidance Score, health self efficacy and overall quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed by telephone/video conference at 1 and 2 months, return for follow&#xD;
      up visit at month 3, telephone/video conferecnce follow up will be done at months 4 and 5,&#xD;
      and the patient will return at month 6 for outcomes evaluation, which will include nutrition&#xD;
      and physical activity assessment, and health self efficacy, Health Heart Score, Brief&#xD;
      Experiential Avoidance Score, and Health self efficacy. In case of corona restrictions,&#xD;
      visits 3 and 6 may be done remotely as well&#xD;
