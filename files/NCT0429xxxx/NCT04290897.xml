    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well oxaloacetate works in reducing cognitive complaints in&#xD;
      stage 0-IIIA breast cancer survivors. Oxaloacetate is a natural substance found in the body&#xD;
      and is available as a nutritional supplement. Giving oxaloacetate may reduce inflammation in&#xD;
      the brain that could be contributing to cognitive complaints seen after cancer treatments.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the effectiveness of anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate (oxaloacetate) in reducing&#xD;
      cognitive complaints in breast cancer patients over the course of 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the tolerability of oxaloacetate. II. To examine whether oxaloacetate has an&#xD;
      effect on the neurocognitive domain of executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine whether oxaloacetate has an effect on patient reported fatigue, insomnia, and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To collect blood for assessment of inflammatory markers and glutamate levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of worsening symptoms or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test-2nd edition, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised, Golden Stroop, Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency, Connor's Continuous Performance Test-II. All scales listed will have the individual scores transformed by using published normative data, therefore the unit of measure will be the same for the listed tests; higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with a diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (stage 0, I, II, IIIa) who are at&#xD;
             least 12 months after surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, but may be on endocrine&#xD;
             therapy or HER-2 targeted therapy, and not more than 5 years after their breast cancer&#xD;
             diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of active/recurrent breast cancer or other serious chronic illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has significant cognitive complaints, defined as a score of &lt; 12 on the&#xD;
             Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Adult version (v)&#xD;
             2.0 - Cognitive Function 4a&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is geographically accessible, and able to participate in a study of 8-10 weeks&#xD;
             duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to complete evaluation surveys in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of oxaloacetate on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; intrauterine&#xD;
             device [IUD]; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Women of any age who have had their ovaries and/or uterus removed will&#xD;
             not be at risk for pregnancy and will not require contraception. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her study physician immediately. Menopausal status will be established as&#xD;
             follows: Women who are 55 years or older and who are not menstruating will be&#xD;
             considered postmenopausal and not at risk for pregnancy. Women who are less than 55&#xD;
             years old who are menstruating will be considered premenopausal and will require&#xD;
             contraception. Women who are less than 55 years with an intact uterus and ovaries who&#xD;
             are not menstruating and have not had a menstrual period within the past 2 years will&#xD;
             have an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol measured. If the values are&#xD;
             in postmenopausal range the woman will be considered postmenopausal and she will not&#xD;
             be considered at risk for pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has another serious or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that contributes to&#xD;
             substantial physical or emotional disability that would detract from participating in&#xD;
             the planned study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking chronic medications that would interfere with cognitive functioning such as&#xD;
             medications for sleep, anxiety, narcotics for pain, use of illicit drugs or cannabis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to oxaloacetate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because the safety of&#xD;
             oxaloacetate in this setting is unknown. A pregnancy test will be performed on all&#xD;
             women with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not determined to be postmenopausal&#xD;
