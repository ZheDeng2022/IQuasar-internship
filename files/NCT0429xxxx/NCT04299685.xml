    <textblock>
      Healthy eating is a key preventive approach to combat the rising prevalence of&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases (NCD) worldwide. The dietary habit established during adolescence&#xD;
      has high tendency to continue to adulthood, and is affected by family factors in multiple&#xD;
      dimensions. Kerry Group Kuok Foundation (Hong Kong) Limited (KGKF) initiated the Trekkers&#xD;
      Family Enhancement Scheme (TFES) in 2012 to empower low-income families in Tung Chung to&#xD;
      self-care and development. In response to the persistent unhealthy eating habits among these&#xD;
      families despite a series of nutrition workshops incorporating short talks and sharing of&#xD;
      healthy recipes, this study aims to investigate the barriers, facilitators and strategies&#xD;
      that enable adolescents from low income families to develop a healthy eating habit.&#xD;
      Qualitative family interviews of 20 family units, or more until data saturation, of at least&#xD;
      one parent and one adolescent (aged 10-19 year old) will be conducted based on deductive&#xD;
      thematic approach. Each interview will last for about an hour, be conducted in Cantonese, and&#xD;
      audio-taped for transcription in verbatim in Chinese. The data will be coded independently&#xD;
      into broad themes in English by two members of the research team. This research can provide&#xD;
      an insight into personal and familial factors and potential strategies influencing eating&#xD;
      habits of adolescents, which can guide the development of effective interventions to promote&#xD;
      healthy eating in low-income families.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy lifestyle is a key preventive approach to combat the rising prevalence of&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases (NCD) worldwide], among which diet is highlighted as a modifiable&#xD;
      risk factor of the most common NCD, namely hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. Adolescence is a transitioning stage from parent-dependence to increasing autonomy&#xD;
      in behavior including healthy or risky behavior. The dietary habit established in this period&#xD;
      has high tendency to continue to adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many national dietary recommendations were established to promote quality diet in order to&#xD;
      prevent NCD in the population. They commonly cover starchy foods, vegetables and fruits,&#xD;
      protein food, dairy, fats/oils and sugars/sweets. Some guidelines are more generic on certain&#xD;
      food groups or overall diet, such as &quot;Eat plenty of cereals, preferably wholegrain, and&#xD;
      potatoes&quot; and &quot;Eat foods from each food group every day to have a complete diet&quot;. Others&#xD;
      provide quantified suggestion, for example, &quot;Consume three or more servings of vegetables and&#xD;
      at least two servings of fruit per day&quot; and &quot;Less than 5 g of salt per day and use iodized&#xD;
      salt&quot;. However, the adherence rate to these recommendations remains low in most other&#xD;
      populations, with at least 60% of general population having insufficient intake of fruit and&#xD;
      vegetables and overconsumption of added sugar and sodium. The Hong Kong Population Health&#xD;
      Survey 2014/15 found that 94.4% of local residents aged 15 or above consumed less than the&#xD;
      recommended 5 servings of fruit and vegetables each day, and 21.5% had eaten snacks with high&#xD;
      salt content at least once a week in the past one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have explored the contributing factors of eating habits among adolescents. Based&#xD;
      on Health Belief Model, they can be categorized into A) socio-psychological variables&#xD;
      including familial factors and peer influence; B) cue to action by media, home and school&#xD;
      environment; C) perceived benefits on personal health; and D) perceived barriers on personal&#xD;
      preference towards food, logistic and lack of motivation. Family factors affect adolescents'&#xD;
      eating pattern in multiple dimensions, including parental modeling, home food environment,&#xD;
      education on healthy eating and mealtime structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Innocenti Framework on Food System for Children and Adolescents explains the family role&#xD;
      in adolescents' diet. The framework was developed by UNICEF in 2018 to address the direct and&#xD;
      underlying factors, drivers, and dynamics between food, people, and the planet. It comprises&#xD;
      four determinants, namely Food Supply Chain, External Food Environments, Personal Food&#xD;
      Environments, and Behaviors of Caregivers, Children and Adolescents. The former two&#xD;
      determinants outline the structural factors of the system, such as taxation, advertisement on&#xD;
      media, and food availability in the market. The latter two look into the social and personal&#xD;
      variables, which comprise individual and household factors. Family factors including&#xD;
      accessibility, affordability and convenience of healthy food are personal environment&#xD;
      determinants; intra-household dynamics (e.g. care practices, control on household expenses),&#xD;
      food preparation, socioeconomic characteristics and eating patterns are behavioral&#xD;
      determinants in the family. The framework emphasizes the dynamics between the determinants&#xD;
      and diets of children and adolescents. For instance, food price and availability in the&#xD;
      market contribute to personal food environments, which is also influenced by personal&#xD;
      desirability and food preparation skill. Parental behaviors become a buffer between food&#xD;
      environments and children's diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socioeconomic status (SES) has proven positive association with diet quality. Reviews showed&#xD;
      that low SES individuals preferred energy-dense, nutrient-poor diets with insufficient whole&#xD;
      grains, low-fat foods and fresh produce but high in added sugars or fats. Similar&#xD;
      socioeconomic association with dietary pattern was found in adolescents and in Hong Kong.&#xD;
      This can be explained by the special challenges that low-income families face: 1) Economic&#xD;
      constraint poses food-cost concern where nutritious foods generally cost more and parents&#xD;
      prioritize children's preference to avoid food waste. 2) Employed parents usually have long&#xD;
      working hours and fail to develop healthy eating behavior with their children. Time pressure&#xD;
      also promotes dining-out at fast food shop as alternative to home meal preparation. 3) Low&#xD;
      education level may lead to the lack of dietary knowledge for food choice and preparation. 4)&#xD;
      The access to the healthy foods is limited by the availability in the community as the&#xD;
      families seldom do grocery shopping in distant places.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trekkers Family Enhancement Scheme (TFES) was initiated by a philanthropic group, Kerry&#xD;
      Group Kuok Foundation (Hong Kong) Limited (KGKF) since 2012. It aims to empower low-income&#xD;
      families in Tung Chung to self-care and development. In response to the poor eating habits&#xD;
      identified among the Trekkers families, a series of nutrition workshops incorporating short&#xD;
      talks and sharing of healthy recipes was delivered as part of a health empowerment programme.&#xD;
      The parents acquired knowledge and skills in healthy eating and cooking in the workshops, and&#xD;
      were encouraged to prepare balanced meals and make food choices with nutritional quality for&#xD;
      their families. Although there was improvement in dietary knowledge, little change in eating&#xD;
      habits was noted in the families after the workshops. There is a need for an in-depth&#xD;
      exploration on the barriers and facilitators that low-income families encounter in helping&#xD;
      their adolescent children adopt and sustain a healthy eating habit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although personal factors of dietary habit among children have been well investigated,&#xD;
      whether the parents and adolescents from low income families know, believe or act to tackle&#xD;
      the barriers is unknown. Most observational and qualitative studies only identified family&#xD;
      correlates of children's eating habit, but did not elaborate on how the families address&#xD;
      these factors. A few studies have explored the parent-reported strategies on children's&#xD;
      eating habit in western countries, but it is not known whether they are applicable to Hong&#xD;
      Kong families whose dietary culture, social environment and family structure are different.&#xD;
      Besides, perception difference of family determinants between adolescents and parents is also&#xD;
      highlighted in family research. Adolescents tend to focus on personal and social factors such&#xD;
      as food preference and personal health benefits, while parents provide additional insight in&#xD;
      family food preparation and dietary pattern. Therefore, understanding the barriers,&#xD;
      facilitators and strategies to adopt healthy eating habit from both parents and adolescents&#xD;
      is crucial for intervention planning in local context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) explanatory model&#xD;
      to explore whether an individual knows, believes, and practices healthy eating. This study&#xD;
      will identify the &quot;knowledge of dietary recommendation and health benefits/harms of selected&#xD;
      food groups; attitudes in believing, accepting and complying to dietary recommendations for&#xD;
      health benefits; and practices of healthy eating&quot; among the families. With the enablers and&#xD;
      barriers addressed by KAP model, respective approaches to enhance the adoption of healthy&#xD;
      eating behaviors will be explored. These will formulate a framework of the family factors&#xD;
      with strategies corresponding to the KAP among the parents and adolescents from low-income&#xD;
      families. The investigators will collect data from parent-adolescent pairs to complement&#xD;
      information from previous research that collected data from a single source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the barriers, facilitators and strategies that enable adolescents from low&#xD;
      income families to develop a healthy eating habit. The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify the knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthy eating among adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify individual and family barriers and facilitators of healthy eating in&#xD;
           adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore potential strategies for overcoming corresponding barriers and enforcing&#xD;
           facilitators of healthy eating in adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The attitude of parents from low-income families is the main problem resulted in lack of&#xD;
           motivation to encourage healthy dietary behaviors for their adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Food availability at home, food cost and time constraint are the main barriers that&#xD;
           hinder healthy eating of adolescents, while perceived health benefit, family meal and&#xD;
           parental guidance can enable the healthy eating habit of adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Strategies adopted by low-income family focus on resolving economic and time concern&#xD;
           i.e. affordable and time-saving food-related behaviors.&#xD;
