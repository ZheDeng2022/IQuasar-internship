      The main goal of the study is to abandon breast surgery in patients with breast cancer with a&#xD;
      clinical complete response (cCR) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy and confirmed pCR using&#xD;
      Vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of the high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of vacuum aspiration&#xD;
      biopsy in determining pCR in patients with clinical complete response after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      systemic therapy will allow abandoning breast surgery in favor of radiation therapy alone,&#xD;
      improving the quality of life of these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vacuum-assisted removal and biopsy of the tumor bed after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST)&#xD;
      in patients with clinical complete clinical response with a biopsy of sientinel lymph nodes&#xD;
      is in the future a modern alternative to the standard, often crippling and traumatic surgical&#xD;
      procedures and does not require additional financial costs for the reconstruction of the&#xD;
      breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are only two trial visits that are specific to the trial. All other visits will be&#xD;
      routine visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first trial visit before NST will take place in order to provide the patient with&#xD;
      detailed information on the study, its' aims, the VAB procedure, and its risks. The patient&#xD;
      will be asked to sign a form of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second visit after the NST, VAB planning will be carried out. This visit may vary&#xD;
      depending on the patient, the tumor, and the characteristics of the study site. We will&#xD;
      provide each test participant with the opportunity to choose the appropriate conditions for&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAB procedure with a sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed in the operating room&#xD;
      Research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the frequency of coincidence of the clinical complete or partial response&#xD;
           (cCR and PR) with pathological complete response (pCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the frequency of detecting a residual tumor in the mammary gland using a&#xD;
           Vacuum-assisted biopsy or another type of core biopsy and / or detection of metastases&#xD;
           in regional lymph nodes (sentinel lymph node biopsy) in comparison with a standard&#xD;
           pathological study of the surgical material and regional (including sentinel ) lymph&#xD;
           nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the frequency of false-positive conclusions of a vacuum aspiration biopsy of&#xD;
           the tumor bed about the achievement of pathological complete response (pCR) in&#xD;
           comparison with a standard pathological study of a surgical material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the long-term results (local-regional relapse, survival) of surgical treatment&#xD;
           of patients with clinical complete response (cCR) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy,&#xD;
           including residual disease compared with patients who achieved pathological complete&#xD;
           response (pCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To develop an algorithm for treating patients with clinical complete response, with a&#xD;
           confirmed pathological complete response using a tumor bed biopsy and targeted biopsy of&#xD;
           sentinel lymph nodes (taking into account the initial characteristics: age, stage with&#xD;
           TNM, disease subtypes, the presence of a genetic mutation BRCA1 / 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guided VAB will be performed on breast cancer patients with clinical complete&#xD;
      response (cCR) after NST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathological results of the VAB specimen will be generally categorized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Residual tumor cells in VAB specimen (=non-pCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No residual tumor cells in the VAB specimen and VAB representative of former tumor&#xD;
           region (=&quot;pCR in VAB&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No residual tumor cells in the VAB specimen but VAB unclear or not representative of&#xD;
           former tumor region (=possible sampling error). These VABs are categorized as&#xD;
           uninformative for the primary endpoint of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be compared with the results of a pathological examination of a surgical&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
