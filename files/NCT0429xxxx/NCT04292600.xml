  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the first cause of physical disability and&#xD;
      dementia worldwide. Ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion (LVO) is responsible for&#xD;
      the vast majority of deaths and disabilities. A very effective and safe treatment, called&#xD;
      mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is available for LVO patients. Nevertheless, no blood biomarkers&#xD;
      able to identify LVO patients rapidly and to direct them to CT angiography and thrombectomy&#xD;
      currently exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TIME study is an observational prospective cohort study. All Patients referred to the&#xD;
      emergency department or stroke unit with a suspected stroke as identified by paramedics,&#xD;
      nurses or clinicians will be enrolled in the study. A panel of blood biomarkers will be&#xD;
      analysed retrospectively via standard laboratory assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of the TIME study will be the evaluation of the clinical diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of a panel of blood biomarkers, in conjunction with clinical data, for the&#xD;
      identification of large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke subtype. This study will allow the&#xD;
      identification and evaluation of a final panel of biomarkers and will prompt the development&#xD;
      of a test for LVO stroke diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects 16M people in the world every year and 100K in the UK only. More than 30% of&#xD;
      these patients die and 90% of survivors develop permanent disabilities as a consequence of&#xD;
      stroke. There are two main types of stroke, ischemic and haemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is&#xD;
      caused by the formation of a clot in a blood vessel in the brain and represents ~85% of&#xD;
      stroke patients. Haemorrhagic stroke is due to the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain,&#xD;
      with consequent bleeding, and it represents ~15% of stroke patients. Both stroke subtypes&#xD;
      cause brain damage and their symptoms are very similar. In addition to these two types of&#xD;
      stroke, among the population of suspected stroke patients, there are the so-called stroke&#xD;
      &quot;mimics&quot;. These are conditions that appear with stroke-like symptoms (e.g. migraine,&#xD;
      epilepsy, encephalitis, etc) but that are not stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deadliest stroke subtype is the one caused by occlusion of large vessels (LVO) in the&#xD;
      brain. For these patients, a new treatment is available, called thrombectomy, which is a&#xD;
      surgical procedure that mechanically removes the clot via a probe inserted at the level of&#xD;
      the groin. Treatment of LVO patients with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) significantly&#xD;
      increases the chances of survival, as well as decreases the extent of disability1. MT is only&#xD;
      available in comprehensive stroke centres (CSC), and LVO patients have to be transported&#xD;
      specifically to CSC in order to be treated and increase their chances of survival. MT has&#xD;
      been proven a safe and effective treatment for LVO stroke until 24 hours from stroke onset2,&#xD;
      indicating that detection of LVO strokes several hours after onset can significantly aid the&#xD;
      stroke care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment of stroke patients is dependent on diagnosis via computerised tomography&#xD;
      (CT) scan to the head. CT is highly accurate for detection of brain haemorrhages, but is very&#xD;
      inaccurate for detection of ischemic stroke or LVOs3. In case of a negative result from CT,&#xD;
      neurologists can order a further MRI scan to confirm ischemic stroke. If LVO is suspected,&#xD;
      patients are transported to the nearest CSC where a further procedure, called CT angiography,&#xD;
      is performed. The identification of LVO patients can be a very lengthy process that wastes&#xD;
      precious time and makes stroke patients worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fast diagnosis of stroke patients at their first point of admission (i.e. ambulance or&#xD;
      emergency department) able to identify LVO patients could quickly direct patients to CSC and&#xD;
      significantly improve treatment of the most dangerous stroke subtype. Several studies have&#xD;
      investigated the ability of pre-hospital assessment scores based on patient symptoms to be&#xD;
      performed in the ambulance4-7. Despite this, these scoring scales lack the accuracy required&#xD;
      for triaging LVO patients with confidence. A more accurate diagnostic test able to complement&#xD;
      these assessment scores and direct LVO patients to CSC and CT angiography is much needed8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POCKiT DX are developing a novel device for stroke diagnosis that combines accurate blood&#xD;
      biomarkers with ultra-rapid (&lt;20 minutes) biomarker detection within a point-of-care device.&#xD;
      The panel of blood biomarkers identified by POCKiT DX was tested in 80 patients with&#xD;
      suspected stroke and accuracy of 83% (CI 95%: 74-92%), sensitivity of 86% (CI 95%: 74-98%),&#xD;
      and specificity of 82% (CI 95%: 68-95%) was observed for LVO identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the TIME study is to evaluate the clinical diagnostic performance of a panel of&#xD;
      blood biomarkers identified by POCKiT diagnostics in the identification of LVO stroke&#xD;
      patients among the population of suspected stroke. Diagnostic performance of blood biomarkers&#xD;
      alone, and in conjunction with clinical data, including pre-hospital stroke assessment scores&#xD;
      (e.g. EMSA), will be evaluated. Results of this study will direct the development of a&#xD;
      diagnostic test for directing stroke patients to the right treatment, more rapidly, improving&#xD;
      patient outcomes.&#xD;
