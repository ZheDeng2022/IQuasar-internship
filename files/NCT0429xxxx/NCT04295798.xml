  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the acute effects of single sessions of&#xD;
      personalized tDCS, traditional tDCS, and sham stimulation on dual task standing and walking&#xD;
      in older adults who are free of overt disease yet who present with poor baseline dual task&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standing and walking are almost always completed in unison with other cognitive tasks such as&#xD;
      talking, reading or making decisions. The ability to perform this important type of &quot;dual&#xD;
      tasking&quot; is critical to daily activities and dependent upon one's capacity to effectively&#xD;
      activate appropriate brain networks that include the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (dlPFC). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, noninvasive technology&#xD;
      that can selectively modulate brain excitability (i.e., the likelihood of activation) by&#xD;
      passing low-level currents between electrodes placed upon the scalp. The investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated through a series of studies that a single, 20-minute exposure of tDCS targeting&#xD;
      the left dlPFC-administered via two large sponge electrodes-reduces dual task costs to&#xD;
      metrics of standing postural control and gait, when tested immediately following stimulation.&#xD;
      Still, the investigators and others have also observed relatively high between-subject&#xD;
      variability in the effects of this 'traditional' bipolar form of tDCS. The investigators&#xD;
      contend that this variability in effectiveness arises in part from relatively diffuse and&#xD;
      unspecific current flow when using large sponge electrodes, in combination with individual&#xD;
      variability in head and brain anatomy that significantly alters current flow and the&#xD;
      generated electric field in the target brain region. In this project, the investigators will&#xD;
      apply recent advances in tDCS modeling and administration to 1) model the electric fields&#xD;
      generated by traditional tDCS in older adults using their individual structural brain MRIs,&#xD;
      and 2) develop personalized tDCS-delivered via an array of eight small gel electrodes-by&#xD;
      using optimization algorithms to determine electrode placement and current parameters needed&#xD;
      to generate desired electrical field with the brain region of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aim is to examine the immediate after-effects of personalized tDCS, traditional&#xD;
      tDCS, and sham stimulation on dual task standing and walking in older adults. The study&#xD;
      population will be older men and women without overt disease or illness, yet with poor&#xD;
      baseline dual task performance defined as a dual task cost (i.e., reduction) to gait speed of&#xD;
      at least 20% induced by simultaneously performing a serial subtraction task when walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that across participants, the effect of traditional tDCS on&#xD;
      dual task standing and walking performance will correlate with a specific component of the&#xD;
      electric field generated over the left dlPFC target. The investigators also hypothesize that&#xD;
      personalized tDCS will induce A) greater effects on dual task standing and walking&#xD;
      performance as compared to traditional tDCS and sham stimulation, and B) these effects will&#xD;
      be more consistent across individuals as compared to traditional tDCS. This project will&#xD;
      provide important insights into tDCS &quot;dosage&quot; that will enable the investigators and many&#xD;
      other researchers to better understand, control, and optimize this form of noninvasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation to individual head and brain anatomy. It is also expected to demonstrate that&#xD;
      personalized tDCS, as compared to the traditional approach, significantly improves the size&#xD;
      and consistency of observed benefits to dual task standing and walking in vulnerable older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

    <description>At the beginning of stimulation, the current will be increased manually from 0.1 mA, in 0.1 mA increments over 60 seconds, up to a maximum of 1.8 mA. Participants will be instructed to notify study personnel if and when they feel any uncomfortable sensation. The ramp-up will be stopped at this point and for the remainder of the session tDCS will be delivered at an intensity of 0.1 mA below the highest level reached. At the end of each session, current will be automatically ramped down to 0.0 mA over a 60 second period.</description>

    <description>Baseline MRI's will enable personalization of tDCS via current flow modeling and optimized to each participant with the goal of generating an average nE over the dlPFC of the same size as the one delivered by a traditional montage using sponges in an average subject at 1.5 mA of current. The direct current delivered by any one electrode will however never exceed 2.0 mA; the total amount of current from all electrodes will not exceed 4 mA. Each 20- minute session will begin and end with a 60-second ramp up/down of current amplitude to maximize comfort.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Personalized Sham</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>An active sham will be used in which very low-level currents (0.5mA max) are transferred between the same electrodes used in the active condition throughout the entire 20-minute session. This intervention will be optimized to each participant to deliver currents designed to not significantly influence their cortical tissue, but still mimic the cutaneous sensations induced by tDCS.</description>
