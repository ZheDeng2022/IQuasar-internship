  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Down syndrome is the most common genetic disorder in the society that causes mental&#xD;
      retardation. Today, screening tests (combined test, triple screening, ultrasonography and&#xD;
      age) are performed for the diagnosis of down syndrome for all pregnant women. As a result of&#xD;
      screening tests, amniocentesis is performed as a diagnostic test for the group at risk.&#xD;
      Chromosome analysis from amniotic fluid requires a 3-week period for chromosome cultures to&#xD;
      yield results. Several levels of biochemical markers, such as organic acids and pyridoxine&#xD;
      metabolites, have been found to be elevated in the amniotic fluid. The investigators also&#xD;
      plan to investigate ischemia-modified albumin, hepatocyte growth factor level in amniotic&#xD;
      fluid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The alpha feto protein level showing liver function is lower in babies with Down syndrome and&#xD;
      this biochemical marker is one of the basic parameters of triple screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these babies have insufficient liver function, then it is likely that there is a decrease&#xD;
      in hepatocyte growth factor in these babies. Free E3 is higher in Down syndrome than normal&#xD;
      pregnant women. Placental hyperfunction, fetal hypofunction (especially based on fetal liver)&#xD;
      is accepted as the hypothetical cause of these two conditions in Down syndrome. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators think that the real cause of this condition is secondary to fetal&#xD;
      partial hypoxia. For this purpose, the investigators plan to look at the level of IMA in&#xD;
      amniotic fluid. However, Güven et al. In his study, an increased rate of ischemia-modified&#xD;
      albumin was found in the amnion levels of mothers who had high triple screening tests but had&#xD;
      no down syndrome in their babies. In this study, it is aimed to find a change in amniotic&#xD;
      fluid that can help in the diagnosis of down syndrome. In our opinion, in cases of down&#xD;
      syndrome, there will be an increase in IMA in the amniotic fluid secondary to ischemia, which&#xD;
      is more severe than the false triple test positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our university, chromosome analyzes are made from amnion fluids sent to the Duzen&#xD;
      laboratory. This laboratory hides amniotic fluid of patients with down syndrome (in the&#xD;
      context of an agreement between our university and the laboratory). Within the scope of the&#xD;
      research, amniotic fluids of 20 cases diagnosed with down syndrome in the Department of&#xD;
      Obstetrics and Gynecology of KTU Faculty of Medicine will be obtained from the regulation&#xD;
      laboratory and necessary biochemical evaluations will be performed. As the control group,&#xD;
      amniotic fluids will be provided by 60 patients with normal amniocentesis results. The&#xD;
      demographic factor, obstetric history and gynecological history information of all cases will&#xD;
      be recorded in the questionnaire prepared by one of the researchers. 2 cc amnion sample of&#xD;
      the patients with Down syndrome diagnosis and control group will be taken into the&#xD;
      biochemistry tube and serum IMA and HGF values will be measured in KTU Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      Department of Biochemistry. As a result, amnion IMA, HGF values of 20 cases diagnosed with&#xD;
      down syndrome and amnion IMA, HGF values of 60 cases with down syndrome will be entered into&#xD;
      SPSS 10.5 for Windows environment and their mean values will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the results, amniotic fluid IMA values of the study group and control group will&#xD;
      be compared. Thus, it is aimed to eliminate the burden that the chromosome culture will bring&#xD;
      to the national economy with an evaluation made in a routine laboratory in cases diagnosed&#xD;
      with down syndrome.&#xD;
