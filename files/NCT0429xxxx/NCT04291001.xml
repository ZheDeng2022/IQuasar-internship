  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Same day initiation of the etonogestrel (ENG) implant and oral ulipristal acetate (UPA) would&#xD;
      overcome contraceptive access barriers to women with recent unprotected intercourse to&#xD;
      ongoing contraception. Current clinical guidelines recommend delaying implant initiation for&#xD;
      at least 1 week following UPA, as well as waiting 7 days before relying on the implant for&#xD;
      contraception after initiation alone. This pilot will assess the effects of the implant alone&#xD;
      and the implant inserted with same-day as UPA usage on ovarian activity. A total of 40 women&#xD;
      desiring the implant, who are not at risk for pregnancy during the study timeline, will be&#xD;
      recruited. Participants will be randomized to implant alone or same-day implant + oral UPA.&#xD;
      Participants will have daily ultrasounds and blood draws to assess timing of ovulation for 1&#xD;
      week and then an exit visit at 14 days after randomization. The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      incidence of ovulation in the 2 randomized treatment groups. Participants may continue the&#xD;
      implant after the study per FDA guidelines and rely on it for contraception after the study&#xD;
      is completed.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine point estimates for the incidence of ovulation within five days of oral&#xD;
           ulipristal acetate (UPA) administration with same day etonogestrel (ENG) implant&#xD;
           insertion in the presence of a dominant follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine point estimates for the incidence of ovulation within five days of&#xD;
           etonogestrel (ENG) implant insertion alone in the presence of a dominant follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the timing of ovulation in the 1st seven days following UPA with same day ENG&#xD;
           implant insertion in the presence of a dominant follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the timing of ovulation in the 1st seven days following ENG implant insertion in&#xD;
           the presence of a dominant follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess ovarian quiescence by ultrasound, Luteinizing hormone (LH) and progesterone&#xD;
           measurements 14 days (+/- 2 days) after implant initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined oral UPA administration with same day ENG implant insertion will interfere with&#xD;
           UPA's effect in delaying ovulation as occurs with oral progestogens given within 1-2&#xD;
           days of UPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ENG implant alone delays ovulation beyond 5 days when initiated at the time of a&#xD;
           dominant follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Pilot randomized, single site clinical trial with blinded analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment and study site: The investigators will recruit participants&#xD;
      interested in using the ENG contraceptive implant but not currently at risk for pregnancy&#xD;
      from Planned Parenthood Association of Utah clinics, University of Utah Hospital and&#xD;
      Community clinics, and through targeted social media ads. All study procedures will occur at&#xD;
      the University of Utah Hospital Outpatient OBGYN Clinic or at the University Center for&#xD;
      Reproductive Medicine clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: This is a pilot proposal to recruit a total of 40 participants across 2 study&#xD;
      arms: (1) ENG implant only (n=20) and (2) UPA + same day ENG implant insertion (n=20). The&#xD;
      investigators null hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ENG implant along with UPA administration in the presence of a dominant ovarian follicle&#xD;
           will not change the expected 97% ovulation suppression within 5 days of UPA use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ENG implant insertion alone in the presence of a dominant ovarian follicle will not&#xD;
           sufficiently interrupt ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization scheme: block randomization with block size of 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding protocol: This study will not be blinded as a pilot. The feasibility of the study,&#xD;
      including clinic space limitations and provider time, relies on the same healthcare provider&#xD;
      for implant insertion and ultrasound in many patients. All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      blinded to the statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit (Screening Visit 1): Subjects will be screened for eligibility and interest&#xD;
      in the study. Each subject will have the study explained and, if participation is desired,&#xD;
      informed consent documents will be signed prior to any study procedures. The screening visit&#xD;
      will include: review of medical, surgical and social history, medications, menstrual dating,&#xD;
      sexual history and contraceptive use, physical exam, including breast and pelvic, pregnancy&#xD;
      test and a transvaginal ultrasound to ensure ability to document ovarian follicular activity&#xD;
      in the treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progesterone Visit (Screening Visit 2): This brief visit will occur on days 20-24 of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle and may be combined with the screening visit (Visit 1) if the time-frame is&#xD;
      met. This visit will include a review of any interim changes (if completed separate from the&#xD;
      screening visit) in history, medications, pregnancy risk/contraception, and a serum&#xD;
      progesterone level will be drawn. The participants will notify the study coordinator of the&#xD;
      1st day of their next menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian monitoring (Screening Visits 3-7 +/- 2 visits): Participants will undergo&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound evaluation of their ovaries three times a week starting on cycle day&#xD;
      #7 (+/- 2 days). If/ When investigators identify a lead follicle with a mean diameter of&#xD;
      &gt;13mm in at least 2 dimensions, study follow-up will switch to daily monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Day #1 (Treatment Visit #1): Once a lead follicle (&gt;14mm) is identified then&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ENG implant insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. UPA 30mg PO tablet and same-day ENG implant insertion Assigned treatment will be&#xD;
           administered (UPA and/or ENG implant insertion). Study team will obtain serum&#xD;
           progesterone, LH levels, and estradiol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Days #2-8 (Treatment Visits #2-8): Participants will follow up daily for Days 2-8.&#xD;
      Each day investigators will obtain transvaginal ultrasound measurement of ovarian follicle&#xD;
      size, serum progesterone, LH levels, and estradiol levels. Daily transvaginal ultrasounds&#xD;
      will continue until either follicle rupture is documented, the follicle is &lt;12 mm on two&#xD;
      consecutive visits, or Day 8 ultrasound occurs (7 days after implant insertion), whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Day #14 (Exit Visit): Repeat ultrasound will occur on Day 14 following ENG implant&#xD;
      insertion, and this will be the exit visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Source documents for each participant and visit number will be completed by&#xD;
      the study personnel at the time of the visit. Form development, data collection, and data&#xD;
      management will occur in RedCAP, secure web platform for building and managing online&#xD;
      databases and surveys. Source documents maintained in individual participant binders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing and reporting adverse events: The reporting period for AEs is the period&#xD;
      immediately following the subject signing the informed consent through the 30 days following&#xD;
      the final study visit. Each visit will include assessment of how the participant felt since&#xD;
      the last visit, review of adverse event reports, implant insertion site reactions, lab&#xD;
      results, and vital signs and physical exam findings. AEs will not be reported for screen&#xD;
      failures unless a SAE is experienced during screening. For all AEs, the investigator will&#xD;
      pursue and obtain information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess&#xD;
      whether it met criteria for a SAE. Participants who have ongoing AEs or SAEs will be followed&#xD;
      until resolution or stabilization or referred for additional care. AEs will be documented&#xD;
      both on source documents and in the clinical database with SAEs reported per IRB guidelines.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided instructions for contacting the study site to report any&#xD;
      untoward medical occurrences. With permission from the participant, whenever possible records&#xD;
      from all non-study medical providers related to medical occurrences will be obtained for&#xD;
      review. AEs and SAEs will be reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and study team will be responsible for analyzing the study data. The&#xD;
      official clinical database in RedCAP will not be analyzed until medical/scientific review has&#xD;
      been completed, protocol violators have been identified (if appropriate), and data has been&#xD;
      declared complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables/Time Points of Interest The primary outcome is delay in rupture of the dominant&#xD;
      follicle by 5 days (yes/no) between group 1 (ENG implant alone) and group 2 (UPA with same&#xD;
      day ENG implant). If the date of follicle rupture was unclear by ultrasound&#xD;
      alone,investigators will utilize serum hormone levels to adjudicate day of rupture. These&#xD;
      measures include day of follicle collapse, day and value of highest LH, day and value of&#xD;
      highest progesterone level. Investigators will use an estradiol level of &gt;100pg/ml to confirm&#xD;
      the enlarged follicle is the dominant follicle on the treatment day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods The primary and secondary dichotomous outcome measures of ovulation by 5&#xD;
      days will be assessed by Wilcoxon sign rank test and demographic will be analyzed using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power/Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and study team will be responsible for analyzing the study data. The&#xD;
      official clinical database in RedCAP will not be analyzed until medical/scientific review has&#xD;
      been completed, protocol violators have been identified (if appropriate), and data has been&#xD;
      declared complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables/Time Points of Interest The primary outcome is delay in rupture of the dominant&#xD;
      follicle by 5 days (yes/no) between group 1 (ENG implant alone) and group 2 (UPA with same&#xD;
      day ENG implant). If the date of follicle rupture was unclear by ultrasound alone,&#xD;
      investigators will utilize serum hormone levels to adjudicate day of rupture. These measures&#xD;
      include day of follicle collapse, day and value of highest LH, day and value of highest&#xD;
      progesterone level. Investigators will use an estradiol level of &gt;100pg/ml to confirm the&#xD;
      enlarged follicle is the dominant follicle on the treatment day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to obtain point estimates for future study proposals. Current data on&#xD;
      ovulatory function with mid-cycle implant insertion or the pharmacodynamics interactions&#xD;
      between same day UPA and ENG are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should data show that ovulation occurs &lt;15% within 5 days of combined UPA use and ENG implant&#xD;
      initiation, investigators will pursue an adequately powered study assessing ovulation delay&#xD;
      with UPA only vs. UPA with ENG implant initiation. This finding would show that UPA's&#xD;
      relationship with the ENG implant may be different than what has been found with oral&#xD;
      progestogens. If ovulation occurs 15% in the first 5 days with combined use of these&#xD;
      medications, this would support the current practice of delaying implant insertion after UPA&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should data show that the ENG implant insertion alone in the presence of a dominant follicle&#xD;
      delays or stops ovulation &gt;85%, investigators will pursue an adequately powered study&#xD;
      assessing the ENG implant alone for EC. If ovulation occurs &gt;15%, this would support&#xD;
      continuation of the practice of using a backup method when an implant is inserted after the&#xD;
      first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These pre-specified criteria to judge if and how to proceed are consistent with CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines for randomized pilot and feasibility trials.[11]&#xD;
