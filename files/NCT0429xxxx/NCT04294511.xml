    <textblock>
      This study is a open-lable, , single center, phase II clinical study. Target population is&#xD;
      patients with locally resectable osteosarcoma. Study objective is to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of camrelizumab in combination with adriamycin, cisplatin, ifosfamide and methotrexate&#xD;
      in study population in China. Camrelizumab is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.&#xD;

      In this study, eligible subject will be enrolled into study arm to accept study treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment cycles of chemotherapy will be at most 9 cycles which will be decided by&#xD;
      investigators. The percentage of the patient with tumor cell necrosis rate &gt;90% determined by&#xD;
      the Independent Review Committee (IRC) will be the primary outcome measures.&#xD;
