  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, phase II, umbrella study enrolling advanced biliary tract cancer&#xD;
      patients who have failed to 1st-line chemotherapy. Patients will be enrolled to AZD6738 and&#xD;
      Durvalumab combination or AZD6738 and Olaparib combination cohorts. Based on the new emerging&#xD;
      therapies, cohorts can be added into existing protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AZD6738 + Durvalumab cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Durvalumab 1500 mg iv on D1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AZD6738 240 mg bid on D15-D28 Every 4 weeks C1D1 dose of durvalumab will be&#xD;
                delivered, and AZD6738 of 240 mg bid will be dosed at D15-D28. Every cycle consists&#xD;
                of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AZD6738 + Olaparib cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AZD6738 160 mg qd on D1-D7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Olaparib 300 mg bid on D1-D28 Every 4 weeks Every cycle consists of 4 weeks.&#xD;
                AZD6738 of 160 mg qd will be administered on D1-D7. Olaparib will be delivered as&#xD;
                300 mg bid dose on D1-D28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cycle consists of 4weeks. Response evaluation will be done every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles)&#xD;
      of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. tumor biopsy is mandatory : screening, after 8weeks (1st-response evaluation), at&#xD;
           disease progression (PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. blood sampling for biomarker study is mandatory: every cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the metabolic changes, 18 F-FDG PET is mandatory at screening and after 8&#xD;
           weeks (1st-response evaluation).&#xD;

             sperm donation for male patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Past medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis which required&#xD;
             steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia or with features&#xD;
             suggestive of MDS/AML for olaparib cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. For olaparib cohort, concomitant use of known potent (eg. phenobarbital, enzalutamide,&#xD;
             phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's&#xD;
             Wort) CYP3A inducers (eg. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout period&#xD;
             prior to starting study treatment is five half-lives, except for St-Johns' wort, which&#xD;
             is 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. For olaparib cohort, previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical&#xD;

&#xD;
         30. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or previous&#xD;
             significant bowel resection, with clinically significant sequelae that would preclude&#xD;
             adequate absorption of AZD6738.&#xD;
&#xD;
         31. For AZD6738 cohort, haematuria: +++ on microscopy or dipstick.&#xD;
&#xD;
         32. For AZD6738 cohort, Patients with relative hypotension (&lt;100/60 mmHg) or clinically&#xD;

&#xD;
         33. Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         34. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
