  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The indication of antibiotic prophylaxis in burn patients remains highly controversial and&#xD;
      hasn't reached a consensus. The objective of antibiotic prophylaxis would be to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of post-operative local and systemic infections. Burn surgery is associated with a high&#xD;
      risk of bacteremia and postoperative infections and sepsis. However, antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      exposes to the risk of selecting drug-resistant pathogens as well as adverse effects of&#xD;
      antibiotics (i.e Clostridium difficile colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations regarding perioperative prophylaxis using systemic antibiotics vary across&#xD;
      sources. The lack of data precludes any international strong recommendations regarding the&#xD;
      best strategy regarding antibiotic prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is therefore to determine whether peri-operative systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics prophylaxis could reduce the incidence of post-operative infections in burn&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      The intensive care unit investigator will verify the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be collected at ICU/burn centers: Hemodynamic parameters;&#xD;
      sepsis organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, Glasgow Coma scale; Medical history /&#xD;
      comorbidities; Concomitant treatment; Burn wound bacterial colonization; Biological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion and randomization will be performed as late as possible before the first&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Burn patients with deep burn between 5 to 40% TBSA requiring at least one&#xD;
      excision surgery graft will be randomized to receive antibioprophylaxis (or placebo) 30&#xD;
      minutes before the incision with either first generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) (if&#xD;
      absence of colonization to Pseudomonas aeruginosa); or piperacillin-tazobactam (if the burned&#xD;
      area is colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We chose to target specifically Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa because it has been associated with significant morbidity and risk of graft lysis&#xD;
      in burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific exams are required during the 7 days, 28 days and 90 days follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of research visit is the 90-day follow-up visit. If the patient has been discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital, the 90-day visit will consist of a telephone contact with the patient if&#xD;
      he or she has been discharged home or with the medical team of the healthcare structure if&#xD;
      the patient has been discharged to another structure.&#xD;
