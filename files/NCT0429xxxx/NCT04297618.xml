             of the wear day AND according to the classification by Young et al7;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Can achieve acceptable lens fit as well as visual acuity (VA) correctable to logMAR&#xD;
             +0.20 or better in each eye with their habitual contact lens type;&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is wearing soft CLs on an extended wear basis (i.e. overnight) or is a rigid gas&#xD;

             fluorescein) to be used in the study;&#xD;

          5. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study&#xD;
             outcome variable (examples may include active or uncontrolled systemic conditions such&#xD;
             as allergies, autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency disease);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;

             previous 6 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Is an employee of the Centre for Ocular Research &amp; Education; * For the purposes of&#xD;
             this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which&#xD;
             requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid&#xD;
             abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and&#xD;
             conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered active ocular disease.&#xD;
             Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or&#xD;
             inflammation and are therefore not active.&#xD;
