  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the impact of land based or aquatic based group exercise on the&#xD;
      balance, walking, balance confidence, and quality of life of people with idiopathic Parkinson&#xD;
      disease. Participants will be randomized to participate in a land based or aquatic based&#xD;
      group exercise program 2 times per week for 12 weeks. Prior to and after participation,&#xD;
      balance, walking, quality of life, and balance confidence will be measured by a blinded&#xD;
      examiner.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to intervention, after 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson disease questionnaire-39 measures quality of life for people with Parkinson disease. A higher score means more quality of life limitations related to Parkinson disease.</description>
