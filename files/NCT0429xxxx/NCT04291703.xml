    <textblock>
      A multi-center, placebo-controlled, double blind, 2:1 randomized control clinical trial&#xD;
      testing low-dose ATG vs. placebo in subjects with a 2 year 50% risk of progression to stage 3&#xD;
      T1D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has an enrollment period of three years and once the enrollment phase has&#xD;
      concluded, an additional two years of follow-up visits will be conducted for all&#xD;
      participants. Participants enrolled in the first year of the study can expect to complete&#xD;
      follow-up visits for approximately four additional years if progression to stage 3 (Type 1&#xD;
      Diabetes Onset) does not occur. Participant follow-up visits after the treatment phase of the&#xD;
      study includes general assessments (medical history, physical exam, medications and adverse&#xD;
      events) and laboratory assessments to determine current health status and glucose tolerance.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible study participants will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to either ATG vs. placebo treatment arms by the TrialNet Coordinating Center at the baseline visit once eligibility has been confirmed. Randomization will be conducted using block randomization with variable block sizes with stratification on TrialNet study site and age group (&lt; 12 years old vs. 12 years old or older). Subjects will be assigned a study randomization number corresponding to the treatment group assignment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The randomization method will be stratified by TrialNet study site. The participants will not be informed regarding the intervention assignment until the end of the study. The investigator and clinic personnel will also be masked as to study assignment. Laboratories performing assays for this protocol will be masked as to the identity of biological material to be studied.</masking_description>

    <description>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) will be intravenously administered over two days, with a total of 2 infusion periods. The first infusion is given at baseline visit (day 1), the second is given the next day at baseline visit (day 2). Body weight at baseline (Day 0- admission for the ATG/placebo infusion) will be used in calculating the doses for all infusions. The first dose (0.5mg/kg) will be infused over a minimum of 4 hours, and the second dose (2mg/kg) over a minimum of 4 hours with a maximum infusion time for each infusion of 10 hours. The second dose should be given no less than 12 and no more than 24 hours after completion of the previous dose. The final prepared product is to be labeled to protect the blind. Infusions may be administered either in a hospital or outpatient setting at the investigator's or institutions discretion.</description>

    <description>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (&quot;Normal&quot; saline) is to be dispensed as the placebo for this study. The placebo is to be prepared dispensing an infusion bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP (&quot;Normal&quot; saline) with no additives (no ATG, no premedications) and label the product to protect the blind. The placebo will also be administered over a minimum of 4 hours for the first and second doses with a maximum infusion time of 10 hours. The second dose of the placebo arm should be given no less than 12 and no more than 24 hours after completion of the previous dose. Infusions may be administered either in a hospital or outpatient setting at the investigator's or institutions discretion.</description>
