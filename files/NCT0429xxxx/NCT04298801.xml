    <textblock>
      In France, 40% of newly diagnosed HIV infections are concentrated in the Paris metropolitan&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two key populations are mainly concerned: persons born in a foreign country and men who have&#xD;
      sex with men. The randomized trial ANRS DICI-VIH (2014-2015) showed that nurse-driven HIV&#xD;
      screening for key populations, supported by research staff, in 8 emergency departments (EDs)&#xD;
      of the region, was effective in addition to diagnostic testing. The strategy advocated by the&#xD;
      WHO and the recent French recommendations support the proposal of screening for key&#xD;
      populations in the EDs. Thus, it is important to evaluate the impact and the feasibility of&#xD;
      the implementation of this strategy on a large scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to evaluate the impact of a wide implementation of nurse-driven HIV screening by&#xD;
      rapid test in key populations combined with usual physician-directed diagnostic testing&#xD;
      (intervention strategy) compared to diagnostic testing alone (control strategy) in the usual&#xD;
      practice of the EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategies will be compared during two periods in 18 EDs of Paris metropolitan area&#xD;
      following a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During intervention period, nurses will suggest performing an HIV rapid test to patients&#xD;
      belonging to key populations according to the answers to a self-administered questionnaire.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, 40% of newly diagnosed HIV infections are concentrated in the Paris metropolitan&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two key populations are mainly concerned: persons born in a foreign country and men who have&#xD;
      sex with men. The randomized trial ANRS DICI-VIH (2014-2015) showed that nurse-driven HIV&#xD;
      screening for key populations, supported by research staff, in 8 emergency departments (EDs)&#xD;
      of the region, was effective in addition to diagnostic testing. The strategy advocated by the&#xD;
      WHO and the recent French recommendations of the National Health Authority (HAS) and expert&#xD;
      group support the proposal of screening for key populations in the EDs. Thus, it is important&#xD;
      to evaluate the impact and the feasibility of the implementation of this strategy on a large&#xD;
      scale in a context where local institutions are taking initiatives to curb the epidemic&#xD;
      (&quot;Pour une Ile-de-France sans sida&quot;, &quot;Vers Paris sans sida&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that nurse-driven HIV screening for key populations can be integrated to&#xD;
      the consultants' care pathway as usual practice of the ED and assured over the long term in&#xD;
      the Paris metropolitan area; this strategy combined with physician-directed diagnostic&#xD;
      testing could reduce undiagnosed infections and help control the epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of a wide implementation of nurse-driven HIV&#xD;
      screening by rapid test in key populations combined with usual physician-directed diagnostic&#xD;
      testing (intervention strategy) compared to diagnostic testing alone (control strategy) in&#xD;
      the usual practice of the EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 18 to 64 years and visiting a participating ED for reasons other than a&#xD;
      potential exposure to HIV within less than 48 hours will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the proportion of new HIV diagnoses among included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the feasibility of nurse-driven screening and its long-term implementation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the effectiveness of the screening process used by the caregivers, particularly&#xD;
           the use of an electronic questionnaire, and by the patients as well as the&#xD;
           acceptability,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare newly diagnosed HIV+ patients in the two groups in terms of :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. linkage to follow up care,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. proportions of patients who had a CD4 cell count greater or equal to 500 or 350&#xD;
                cells/µL and no HIV-related symptoms and proportions of patients with acute HIV&#xD;
                infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  estimate through modelling the number of new HIV diagnoses for different levels of&#xD;
           coverage of the screening strategy in the Paris metropolitan area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The strategies will be compared in 18 EDs of Paris metropolitan area during two&#xD;
      periods. The start of the intervention strategy will be randomly allocated for each ED&#xD;
      following a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EDs are selected according to the proportion of patients belonging to key populations in the&#xD;
      patients they receive (data from two previous studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During intervention period, nurses will suggest performing an HIV rapid test to patients&#xD;
      belonging to key populations according to the answers to a self-administered questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period will last 3 to 11 months and the control period 0 to 8 months.&#xD;
      Patients will participate up to 1 month if a follow-up is needed.&#xD;

    <description>A self-administered questionnaire on HIV exposure factors will be offered to all patients of ages 18-64 able to complete it. This questionnaire will be available in a paper-based format, electronic format on the patient phone or can be conducted verbally by the nurse. According to the answers, the nurses will suggest performing a rapid test to patients belonging to key populations. A finger-stick rapid HIV test will be performed and results will be disclosed by the nurse assisted by a physician if necessary.&#xD;
If needed, a follow-up visit with an infectious disease specialist will be scheduled within 72 hours.</description>
