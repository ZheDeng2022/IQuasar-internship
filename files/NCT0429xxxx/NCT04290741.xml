  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness&#xD;
      of acupuncture in the Emergency Department (ED) for treating acute musculoskeletal pain. The&#xD;
      overall goal is to reduce acute and subacute opioid use by improving acute pain, anxiety and&#xD;
      disability with non-pharmacologic treatment options at a critical entry point for patients&#xD;
      into the healthcare system. This full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been&#xD;
      statistically powered to test the effectiveness of ED-based acupuncture for both one-hour&#xD;
      (Stage 1) and one-month (Stage 2) pain reduction outcomes. The feasibility will be assessed&#xD;
      based on patient recruitment and retention rates, while the acceptability will be assessed&#xD;
      using patient reported outcomes and qualitative semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 is a 2-phase study design. Phase (1): Enrolled subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      auricular (ear) acupuncture, peripheral acupuncture, or the control group receiving no&#xD;
      acupuncture. Subjects assigned to an acupuncture arm will receive information and access to&#xD;
      acupuncture in an outpatient clinic for the 4 weeks following ED visit. Subjects may also&#xD;
      have a blood draw for biomarker analysis during their ED visit. A planned interim analysis of&#xD;
      the first 60 patients (2/3 of the Phase 1 arm completed) will be completed to select the more&#xD;
      effective and/or acceptable arm for Phase 2. At interim analysis, it was determined by the&#xD;
      DSMB that neither arm was superior, so the recommendation was to continue Stage 1 Phase 2&#xD;
      unchanged with 3 arms. Stage 1 is complete, and we will proceed with Stage 2 powered to the&#xD;
      4-week pain score outcome. Stage 2 will proceed with the same procedures as stage 1, only&#xD;
      powered to a different outcome.&#xD;
