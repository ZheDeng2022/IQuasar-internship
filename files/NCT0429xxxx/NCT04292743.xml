  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-arm, multi-center, open-label phase 1 study. The standard 3+3 design&#xD;
      will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from 4 possible dose levels of&#xD;
      Eryaspase in combination with mFOLFIRINOX. We hypothesize that the addition of Eryaspase to&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) will be safe and&#xD;
      demonstrate preliminary signs of efficacy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Safety&#xD;
      assessments include adverse events, physical examination abnormalities, vital signs, and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests (including blood chemistry, hematology, and coagulation panel).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of Eryaspase combination with FOLFIRINOX in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      screening in order to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a standard 3+3 method of dose escalation. Patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      cohorts of 3. Four dose levels are planned and include 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg of Eryaspase&#xD;
      with reduced dose irinotecan. Subjects will be assigned to a dose level in the order of study&#xD;
      entry with at least a 3-day stagger in enrollment between individual subjects. With the 3+3&#xD;
      design to be employed, doses are not escalated unless all patients receiving the current dose&#xD;
      have been observed for at least 6 weeks and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been&#xD;
      reported. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level where at most 1 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Three patients will be treated at dose level 0. If&#xD;
      0/3 experience a DLT, 3 new patients will be enrolled at the next higher dose level. If 1/3&#xD;
      experience a DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. If 1/6&#xD;
      patients experience a DLT at any dose level except the highest dose level, 3 new patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled at the next higher dose level; if 1/6 patients at the highest dose level&#xD;
      experience a DLT, it will be deemed the MTD and the trial will stop. As soon as 2 patients&#xD;
      experience a DLT at a given dose level, that dose will be concluded to be above the MTD, dose&#xD;
      escalation will cease and 3 new patients will be enrolled at the next lower dose level. If 6&#xD;
      patients were previously treated at that lower dose, the study will halt and that lower dose&#xD;
      will be declared the MTD. A subject who withdraws from the escalation phase of the study for&#xD;
      reasons other than a DLT will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX treatment will be given on Day 1 and 15 of the 4 weeks cycle and continued until&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, for a maximum of 12 cycles. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single intravenous administration of Eryaspase on Day 1 and 15 of 4-weeks cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study visits are day 1, 8, 15, 22, during cycle 1 and day 1 and 15 during subsequent&#xD;
      cycles with a 4-week follow-up period after the end of treatment. Subjects who show at least&#xD;
      stable disease based on RECIST 1.1 at the end of the 12-week period (Day 85) are eligible for&#xD;
      the continuation of FOLFIRINOX plus eryaspase treatment until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
