      The purpose of this study is to collect data on the performance of the Biodesign® Hernia&#xD;
      Graft when used to reinforce soft tissues during ventral hernia repair.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, prospective clinical study will evaluate the performance of the&#xD;
      Biodesign Hernia Graft to reinforce soft tissues during ventral hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This post-market study will enroll up to 95 patients at up to 10 clinical sites. Each&#xD;
      clinical site will be limited to a maximum of 50 patients to ensure a variety of patients and&#xD;
      surgical techniques are represented. There is no minimum enrollment number per site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed as a multicenter, open-label, prospective study to collect data&#xD;
      on the performance of the Biodesign Hernia Graft. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for&#xD;
      this study have been selected based on the instructions outlined in the IFU so that the&#xD;
      results from this study can provide data on the real-world use of the device.&#xD;

    <description>The Biodesign Hernia Graft is comprised of 8 layers of decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) that has been pressed-lyophilized (i.e., freeze-dried under vacuum pressure) to laminate the component sheets (i.e., layers) together. In addition, it is perforated and sewn with 4-0 Trisorb suture (polyglycolic acid (PGA); Samyang Corporation, Seoul, South Korea). The suture is distributed in a diamond pattern across the graft and along the periphery and is intended to mitigate delamination of the layers upon rehydration and/or manipulation during implantation. Being a completely biologic device, the Biodesign Hernia Graft is considered MR safe.</description>
