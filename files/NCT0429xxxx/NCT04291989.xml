      The study was to compare blood Lactate levels between ear lobe and finger against venous&#xD;
      forearm blood sample using the electronic hand held lactate device in hip fracture patients&#xD;
      with good cognitive function (AMT &gt;/= 7)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a hip fracture, surgical treatment is advocated to improve pain and mobility. Most&#xD;
      patients are elderly and a majority of them are frail. Current best practice tariff and&#xD;
      National Institute for health and care excellence guidelines recommends that all those&#xD;
      patients who undergo an operation should be performed within 36 hours from the time of injury&#xD;
      to optimise recovery and function. The patients need to be medically optimised to undergo a&#xD;
      major operation to have their hip fracture fixed. The adequacy of resuscitation is monitored&#xD;
      by several clinical and biochemical markers. One of the important markers of resuscitation is&#xD;
      serum lactate levels. This is used routinely in polytrauma patients. (Moran and Forward,&#xD;
      2012) The initial interest in lactate in hip fracture patients was based on the philosophy&#xD;
      that a hip fracture in a frail elderly patient may be equivalent to a polytrauma in a young&#xD;
      fit patient. Subsequently, high serum lactate levels on admission in hip fracture patients&#xD;
      have been shown to be associated with higher mortality1. However, at present, this is not&#xD;
      routinely monitored in hip fracture patients. Measurement of serum lactate levels presents&#xD;
      logistics difficulties, as the blood sample has to be taken to an analyser and analysed&#xD;
      within 20 minutes. Hence the investigators want to use a point of care electronic hand held&#xD;
      device - the Lactate Pro 2. The investigators have already tested this device against the&#xD;
      laboratory analysers and it has been proven to be accurate. However in preliminary testing&#xD;
      the investigators found a significant difference between fingertip and earlobe samples in&#xD;
      volunteers. The volunteers do not represent our population of interest, which are hip&#xD;
      fracture patients. The investigators aim is to determine which sample site; earlobe or&#xD;
      fingertip, for Lactate Pro 2 testing best matches venous forearm samples upon which the&#xD;
      association of higher mortality with high lactate was based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any risk to the patients participating in this study would be very small. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria to participate in this research study is a patient who has had a recent hip fracture&#xD;
      awaiting surgery with a Mental Test score of 7/10 or above and is able to consent.&#xD;
