    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of mocetinostat when given together&#xD;
      with vinorelbine to see how well it works in treating children, adolescents, and young adults&#xD;
      with rhabdomyosarcoma that has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes and cannot be removed&#xD;
      by surgery (locally advanced unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic), and does not respond to treatment (refractory) or has come back (relapsed).&#xD;
      Mocetinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving mocetinostat and vinorelbine may work better in treating&#xD;
      children, adolescents, and young adults with rhabdomyosarcoma compared to vinorelbine alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the first cycle dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD), and a biologically effective and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of mocetinostat&#xD;
      administered orally three times per week for a total of 9 doses per 21 day cycle given in&#xD;
      combination with vinorelbine on days 1, 8, 15 of 21 day cycles in subjects with refractory or&#xD;
      recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). (Phase 1 Dose Escalation) II. To determine the&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from first dose of vinorelbine to tumor&#xD;
      progression or death due to any cause, at the RP2D of mocetinostat administered orally three&#xD;
      times per week starting on day 3 for a total of 9 doses per 21 day cycle given in combination&#xD;
      with vinorelbine on days 1, 8, 15 of a 21 day cycle in subjects with refractory or recurrent&#xD;
      RMS. (Expansion Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety profile of mocetinostat in combination with vinorelbine as characterized by adverse&#xD;
      event (AE) type, severity, timing and relationship to study drugs, as well as laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities in the first and subsequent treatment cycles. (Phase 1 Dose Escalation) II.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of mocetinostat in plasma. (Phase 1 Dose Escalation) III. Clinical&#xD;
      benefit rate (CBR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] and stable disease [SD])&#xD;
      of mocetinostat + vinorelbine in metastatic/refractory/unresectable RMS. (Phase 1 Dose&#xD;
      Escalation) IV. Antitumor activity of mocetinostat + vinorelbine in refractory/recurrent RMS&#xD;
      as measured by overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease control (DC),&#xD;
      duration of disease control, as well as progression-free survival (PFS). (Phase 1 Dose&#xD;
      Escalation) V. Pharmacodynamics of mocetinostat on molecular targets in surrogate tissue.&#xD;
      (Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Expansion Cohort) VI. Exploratory biomarker development to&#xD;
      enable prediction of drug toxicity, tumor response and the mechanism(s) of acquired study&#xD;
      drug resistance. (Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Expansion Cohort) VII. Obtain RMS tissue&#xD;
      biological samples pre-treatment and at progression to assess for differences in gene&#xD;
      expression by next gen (generation) sequencing and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (seq).&#xD;
      (Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Expansion Cohort) VIII. Antitumor activity of mocetinostat +&#xD;
      vinorelbine in metastatic/refractory RMS as measured by overall response rate (ORR) and&#xD;
      duration of response (DOR), disease control (DC), duration of disease control, as well as&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1. (Expansion Cohort) IX. Safety and tolerability of mocetinostat and&#xD;
      vinorelbine as characterized by adverse event type, severity, timing and relationship to&#xD;
      study drug, as well as laboratory abnormalities. (Expansion Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
