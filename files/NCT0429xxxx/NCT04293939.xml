  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm (PT) infants spend their first weeks of life in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)&#xD;
      where receive little affective physical contact, which plays a crucial role in brain&#xD;
      development. Evidence indicates that skin-to-skin contact (SSC) has a positive effect on&#xD;
      infants' neurophysiological and behavioral adjustment to postnatal life. Moreover, caregiving&#xD;
      touch during early interactions is related to sensitive caregiving behavior, which in turn is&#xD;
      associated with brain connectivity in full-term (FT) infants. Despite the importance of both&#xD;
      SSC and caregiving touch for infant development little is known about the neural correlates&#xD;
      of early physical contact in PT infants. Using MRI the project aims to investigate the&#xD;
      association between brain responses to gentle skin stroking at 2 months examining the effects&#xD;
      of: (1) the birth status (PT vs. FT); (2) the duration of SSC in NICU; (3) the caregiving&#xD;
      touch in the home environment and during mother-infant interaction. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized: (1) differences in the brain responses in the above mentioned ROIs to gentle&#xD;
      skin stroking, a type of tactile stimulus associated with affectionate touch and social&#xD;
      interaction26, between FT infants and PT infants: (2) that above mentioned putative&#xD;
      differences would be mitigate by duration of SSC during the NICU in PT infants; (3) an&#xD;
      association between CT/sensitive caregiving behaviors both in the home environment and during&#xD;
      face-to-face interaction and brain response in the above mentioned ROIs to gentle skin&#xD;
      stroking in PT and FT infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale One way of operationalizing social touch has been provided by the&#xD;
      correspondence between properties of much naturalistic affiliative interpersonal touch and&#xD;
      the unique tuning characteristics of low-threshold unmyelinated peripheral afferent fibers.&#xD;
      The mechanosensitive C-tactile fibers are activated by gentle skin stroking of the hairy&#xD;
      (1-10 cm/s), but not glabrous, skin in adults. In adult, C-tactile fibers activation is&#xD;
      correlated with perceived pleasantness. C-tactile fibers are known to mature early and it has&#xD;
      been hypothesized that they play a role in encoding socio-affective dimensions of touch. The&#xD;
      primary cortical target for C-tactile afferents is thought to be the posterior insular&#xD;
      cortex. Importantly, sense of touch develops prior to the 8th week of gestation and insula&#xD;
      cortex matures at 27th week of gestation. There is reason to believe that affective touch is&#xD;
      already processed during the early stage of development. Recent research on full-term (FT)&#xD;
      infants highlighted that the neural correlates of affective touch processing, activated by&#xD;
      gentle tactile stimulation are the somatosensory cortex and the insular cortex. However, to&#xD;
      our knowledge, no study has examined whether these two regions-of-interest (ROIs), known to&#xD;
      process gentle skin stroking, responds to gentle skin stroking in preterm infants (PT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, despite, several change were done in the NICU to provide more natural conditions&#xD;
      for the PT, these infants often receive very little in terms of early physical contact.&#xD;
      Importantly, maternal skin-to-skin contact, has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse&#xD;
      consequences of prematurity. A recent Cochrane review reported an average 60% reduction in&#xD;
      mortality with this intervention compared to usual care in hospitalized low birth weight&#xD;
      infants. The review further showed a 35% relative reduction in nosocomial infections or&#xD;
      sepsis, a shorter hospital stay and lower incidence of respiratory infections. Prolonged SSC&#xD;
      also provides more effective thermal control, promotes breast feeding, weight gain, shorter&#xD;
      hospital stays and stronger neural responses. However, despite the importance of SSC for&#xD;
      optimal child development, little is known whether the duration of SSC is associated with the&#xD;
      above mentioned ROIs in PT infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, In humans, 65% of face-to-face interactions between mothers and infants involve&#xD;
      touch communication. Also the quality of the touch matters: gentle stroking touch generates&#xD;
      more smiling in infants than static touch. During mother-infant face-to face interactions&#xD;
      mothers use touch to engage with their infants, to demonstrate affection. Caregiving touch&#xD;
      (CT) reduces infant stress by increasing positive affect19, calms infants in pain and&#xD;
      discomfort. Also, CT is associated with sensitive caregiving behavior21, which in turn is&#xD;
      associated with better cognitive and behavioral outcomes both in FT and PT children.&#xD;
      Importantly, maternal sensitivity predicts infant brain volumes and functional connectivity&#xD;
      in 3-6 month-old FT infants. Although CT/sensitive caregiving behavior might contribute to&#xD;
      the brain responses in early infancy, the potential link between CT/sensitive caregiving&#xD;
      behavior and the above mentioned ROIs response to gentle skin stroking remains to be tested&#xD;
      both in PT and FT infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To examine differences between PT and FT infants in brain response in somatosensory&#xD;
      cortex and the insular cortex (regions-of-interest: ROIs) to skin stroking by gentle brush&#xD;
      applied by a trained experimenter during an MRI acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: FT and PT infants will be scanned around of 2 months of age, corrected&#xD;
      age (CA) for prematurity. All infants will undergo an MRI exam with a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva&#xD;
      scanner and a 32-channel head coil at the Neuroimaging Lab, Scientific Institute, IRCCS&#xD;
      Eugenio Medea. In agreement with Tuulari procedure (Tuulari et al., 2019), during MRI&#xD;
      acquisition, a trained experimenter manually will apply gentle brush strokes to infants'&#xD;
      right anterior shin region in a proximal to distal direction. The length of the stimulated&#xD;
      area will be measured to cover 15 cm, and brush strokes will be applied at a velocity of 5&#xD;
      cm/s for 15s, with randomized inter-stimulus intervals of 10-15 s. The experimenter will be&#xD;
      guided by auditory cues delivered through the scanner head phones. At the scanning site, the&#xD;
      families will receive by a trained and experienced radiographer and the researchers. Before&#xD;
      the scan, the scanning protocol will be revised with the parents and the absence of safety&#xD;
      risks will be confirmed by the personnel. All MRI will be performed during natural sleep. All&#xD;
      infants will be provided with customized hearing protection. Standard ear muffs will be given&#xD;
      to parents, as they will stay in the scanning room throughout the whole scanning session. The&#xD;
      scanning will be observed by the personnel from the control room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To investigate the association between the duration of SSC during the NICU stay and&#xD;
      the selected ROIs, activated by gentle skin stroking in PT infants at 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: the SSC is a standardized care option in NICU and it is not considered&#xD;
      an experimental technique. Thus, the possibility to compare infants whose mothers will chose&#xD;
      SSC and those who will not, is precluded. An alternative solution will be to recruit dyads&#xD;
      via convenience sampling, in according to inclusion criteria. The effects of SSC will be&#xD;
      analyzed based on the duration of SSC during the infant hospitalization at the NICU. The&#xD;
      amount of SSC will be obtained through parent-report diaries. Infants (and their mothers)&#xD;
      will be enrolled when their medical situation will be stabilized and if the mothers will&#xD;
      agree to perform SSC. Infants will take out of the incubator, undressed (wearing only a&#xD;
      diaper and some-times a cap), and placed between the mother's breasts. The procedure to the&#xD;
      MRI exam has already been reported in the aim1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To assess the association between both CT/sensitive caregiving behaviors in the home&#xD;
      environment and during mothers' displays of touching behaviors and maternal sensitivity&#xD;
      during face-to-face interaction and brain responses in the selected ROIs to gentle skin&#xD;
      stroking in PT and FT infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design: when infants reached 2, before the MRI acquisition, mother-infant&#xD;
      interaction will be videotaped. The infant will be placed in a supportive seat when alert and&#xD;
      contented; the mother will ask to sit opposite her infant, and play with him/her for 5 min.&#xD;
      Two digital cameras, one focused on the infant and the other on the caregiver, will used to&#xD;
      produce a single image with simultaneous frontal view of the face, hands and torso of infant&#xD;
      and mother. Infant and maternal behavior and their interactions will be coded using the&#xD;
      coding system Global Rating Scales of mother-infant interaction (GRS), which have been&#xD;
      extensively validated in normative and clinical populations. Maternal touch during&#xD;
      interaction will be coded using The Caregiver-Infant Touch Scale (CITS), a reliable and&#xD;
      systematic coding system. The CITS is a measure of the qualitative (and quantitative) changes&#xD;
      in tactile stimulation produced by caregivers during face-to-face interaction with their&#xD;
      infants. Maternal sensitivity and maternal touch will be coded by two trained researchers who&#xD;
      will be blind to PT or FT conditions. Moreover, in order to assess the duration and the&#xD;
      quality of mother's tactile stimulation in the infant's home environment two self-report&#xD;
      measure will be used: the Baby Care Questionnaire and the Parent-Infant Caregiving Touch&#xD;
      Scale. Both measure have been used in normative and clinical populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodologies and statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General methodology The present study has a short-term longitudinal and prospective study&#xD;
      design and involves two groups of infants (PT and FT). The study is made up of three phases,&#xD;
      corresponding to the three study aims and experimental designs reported above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 (study aim 2; experimental design aim 2): time-frame from birth to NICU&#xD;
           discharge in PT infants only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 (study aim 3; experimental design aim 3): time-frame from NICU discharge to 2&#xD;
           months CA for PT and from birth to 2 months for FT, including the videotaping of the&#xD;
           face-to-face interaction at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3 (study aim 1; experimental design aim 1): experimental MRI scanning visit&#xD;
           occurring around 2 months CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation To estimate sample size for minimum sample to detect a clinically&#xD;
      significant difference we referenced Thirion et al. (2007) that indicated that N=20 is a&#xD;
      minimum if one wants to have acceptable reliability in a MRI study. Starting from this, a&#xD;
      final sample size N=20 per group was estimated (N=40 subjects); in agreement with the&#xD;
      exclusion rate found in Tuulari et al. (2019) due to the excessive motion of the infants&#xD;
      during the MRI scan visit, the investigators assumed a more conservative 10% rate, estimating&#xD;
      a final sample size N=25 per group was estimated (N=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI data processing and analysis Preprocessing and statistical analyses will be conducted&#xD;
      using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12). Functional data preprocessing will include&#xD;
      slice time correction, realignment to the first volume of the first run, and normalized.&#xD;
      Motion artifacts correction will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well-established procedures for co-registration and normalization will be computed using&#xD;
      Advanced Normalization Tools. Individual percent signal change in response to skin stroking&#xD;
      will be then extracted from each ROI. In order to examine brain responses outside the a&#xD;
      priori defined ROIs, an exploratory whole-brain analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of analyses Primary hypotheses will be tested using regression models, including group,&#xD;
      stratification variables and any identified baseline confounders. The alpha for primary&#xD;
      outcomes will be set at p&lt;.05. Hypothesis testing will be supplemented with effect size&#xD;
      estimates and confidence intervals. Analyses will be conducted on an intent-to-treat basis.&#xD;
      Multiple imputation methods will be used to adjust effect estimates for missing data on the&#xD;
      assumption that data is missing at random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the robustness of findings to differing&#xD;
      assumptions about missing data. Longitudinal analyses will be conducted using linear mixed&#xD;
      modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and Innovation Till now few studies evaluated how affective touch may be&#xD;
      associated to brain responses in neonates, and, to our knowledge, no study has included PT&#xD;
      infants. Thus, to investigate the associations between SSC and later neural correlates of&#xD;
      early tactile experience may potentially have relevant implications for early life&#xD;
      interventions in NICU. For example, a recent study documented that unlike SSC, a mattress&#xD;
      that attempts to mimic breathing motion and heartbeat sounds does not affect physiological&#xD;
      responses of PT infants. This suggests that parental early physical contact have a unique and&#xD;
      specific impact on the infant. Moreover, the study will integrate this finding with&#xD;
      observational data from mother-infant ace to face interaction to better clarify the role of&#xD;
      caregiving touch and how it could be related to the brain responses.&#xD;
