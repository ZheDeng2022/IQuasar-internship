  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      McArdle's disease or Glycogen storage disease type 5 (GSD5), the most common muscle&#xD;
      glycogenosis, is a rare disabling condition with no effective treatment. There are&#xD;
      indications that a special dietary regimen could positively influence the disease&#xD;
      manifestations. After contradictory indications for protein rich vs carbohydrate rich diets,&#xD;
      several preliminary studies and more and more patients own experiences are now pointing to a&#xD;
      low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) as possibly effective in improving exercise tolerance&#xD;
      and reducing muscle damage. The investigators propose a multicentre randomized single blind&#xD;
      controlled trial testing efficacy of an individualized LCKD in GSD5. The investigators will&#xD;
      test the ability of a 6 months dietary regimen with a 3:1 LCKD inducing a BOHB blood&#xD;
      concentration of 1.5-4 mmol/l to improve the aerobic capacity as measured by peak VO2 at&#xD;
      exercise testing in GSD5 patients. Thirty molecularly defined MCA adults will be enrolled: to&#xD;
      half of them randomly selected the dietary regimen will be prescribed, while subjects in the&#xD;
      control group will follow their usual balanced diet. The evaluators will be blinded to the&#xD;
      diet followed by the examined patient&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      McArdle disease (myophosphorylase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 5, GSD5, OMIM #&#xD;
      232600) is an inherited metabolic disorder of skeletal muscle. Affected patients suffer from&#xD;
      genetically determined lack of the enzyme muscle glycogen phosphorylase, which is essential&#xD;
      for glycogen metabolism. The condition is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous&#xD;
      mutations in the muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene (PYGM) located at chromosome 11q13. Many&#xD;
      pathogenic mutations have been identified in the gene, which spans 20 exons, and many are&#xD;
      population specific. The most common mutation in Northern Europe and North America is a&#xD;
      nonsense mutation at Arg50stop (R50X) in exon 1 (previously referred to as R49X). A second&#xD;
      frequent mutation in this population, and in Spanish patients, is Gly205Ser (G205S). McArdle&#xD;
      disease is a rare disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:100,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete absence of muscle phosphorylase results in the inability to mobilize muscle glycogen&#xD;
      stores, which are normally required as substrate for energy generation during anaerobic&#xD;
      metabolism, which occurs during start of exercise and high-intensity efforts. In affected&#xD;
      people, symptoms of fatigue and discomfort therefore occur within minutes of initiating any&#xD;
      activity and during strenuous activity such as lifting heavy weights or walking uphill. If&#xD;
      the activity is continued despite symptoms, a severe cramp (which is called a contracture in&#xD;
      GSD5, because the muscle contraction is not caused by neural stimulation) occurs, which leads&#xD;
      to muscle damage. If the damage is substantial, acute rhabdomyolysis may occur, which in turn&#xD;
      can result in dark brown/black discoloration of urine (myoglobinuria). When rhabdomyolysis is&#xD;
      severe, myoglobinuria can lead to acute renal failure, requiring treatment with dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with GSD5, aerobic metabolism is limited and varies as a function of the&#xD;
      availability of alternative fuels as a function of exercise and diet. The second wind&#xD;
      phenomenon is illustrative. The phenomenon is characterized by the ability to increase work&#xD;
      output after about 7-8 minutes of exercise. The second wind occurs as a consequence of&#xD;
      increased availability and metabolism of alternative fuel substrates, preferentially glucose&#xD;
      supplied from the liver, but also free fatty acids metabolized through oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation and ketones produced by the liver. Despite these compensatory fuels, which&#xD;
      can substitute for the absent glycogen breakdown in muscle, the capacity for oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation is impaired in GSD5, because of an almost complete absence of pyruvate, a&#xD;
      by-product of glycolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced oxidative phosphorylation in untrained patients with GSD5 in turn reduces oxygen&#xD;
      consumption to approximately 35% of normal and there is a disproportionate increase in heart&#xD;
      rate during exercise in patients with GSD5 compared with healthy controls. Thus,&#xD;
      unconditioned people with GSD5 have very limited exercise capacity, which affects quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients present in the second or third decade, although symptoms are often reported&#xD;
      retrospectively from childhood. With advancing age a 20-25% proportion of patients develop&#xD;
      fixed muscle weakness predominantly affecting the shoulder girdle. No clear cut&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlation has been found to explain the clinical variation in severity&#xD;
      observed even within families, but the influence of polymorphisms in other genes has been&#xD;
      hypothesized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no treatment for the condition. There have been a small number of&#xD;
      randomized controlled treatment trials, however the largest number of participants in any&#xD;
      previous study was 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking glucose prior to exercise alleviates muscle symptoms by inducing a 'second wind' at&#xD;
      the onset of exercise, but has detrimental effects on weight if used too frequently. A&#xD;
      Cochrane systematic review of training in GSD5 identified a few non-randomized trials of&#xD;
      aerobic training or dietary manipulation either with supplements such as creatine or with&#xD;
      shift towards lipid sources, which showed no harmful effect and suggest benefit over a number&#xD;
      of months however long-tern results and confirmation on larger cohorts are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of these indications, controlled training and dietary habits are seldom followed by&#xD;
      patients, who experience significant limitations in activity of daily living and restriction&#xD;
      in their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key limitation to exercise in GSD5 is the bottleneck in fuel flow through the Tri&#xD;
      Carboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle, which is imposed by the minimal supply of glucosyl units from&#xD;
      muscle glycogen and thus glycolytic flux to feed the TCA cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary manipulation has been identified since the eighties as a potential strategy to&#xD;
      improve functioning in GSD5. In spite of initial indications for high protein regimens, later&#xD;
      experimental comparison of high protein vs high carbohydrate diets indicated a superiority&#xD;
      for the latter. Particular interest was also focussed on diets with predominant lipid energy&#xD;
      source (ketogenic or low carbohydrate ketogenic LCKD) with the assumption that ketones are&#xD;
      easily taken up by mitochondria and can substitute for the missing acyl-CoA moieties not&#xD;
      provided by the staggering glycolysis blocked upstream for the inaccessibility of muscle&#xD;
      glycogen. LCKD has a long history as a therapeutic strategy for several conditions (epilepsy,&#xD;
      PDH defect, GLUT1 defect) with a good record of safety and efficacy and a poorer record of&#xD;
      tolerability. Isolated experiences of LCKD have been carried out in GSD5 patients (maximum 4&#xD;
      patients) with promising results.&#xD;
