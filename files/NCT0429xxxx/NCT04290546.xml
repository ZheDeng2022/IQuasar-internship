    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of a combination drug and biologic&#xD;
      therapy in patients with advanced head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following drugs and biologics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CIML NK donor cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-15 superagonist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, non randomized, open label, single site Phase 1 study. The purpose of&#xD;
      this research study is to obtain information on the safety and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      combination of study drugs to treat advanced head and neck. The experimental combination&#xD;
      therapy in this study involves CIML NK cells from a haploidentical donor (meaning cells from&#xD;
      another person with similar immune proteins), IL-15, and participants in cohort 2 will also&#xD;
      receive ipilimumab. CIML NK cells are an allogeneic cell product derived from qualified donor&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cells that have been bathed in special proteins to help to identify and&#xD;
      treat certain advanced cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Participants who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial CTLA-4&#xD;
      Inhibition in Combination with Memory-like Natural Killer (NK) Cell Immune Cell Therapy in&#xD;
      Advanced Head &amp; Neck Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 CIML NK cells without ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators are looking the highest dose of the study intervention that can be&#xD;
           administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that&#xD;
           have advanced head and neck cancer, not everyone who participates in this research study&#xD;
           will receive the same dose of the study intervention. The dose given will depend on the&#xD;
           number of participants who have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 participants will be treated at the respective dose (at or below the Maximum&#xD;
           Tolerated Dose), as determined during Cohort plus a lead-in dose of ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 12 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of investigational&#xD;
      drugs and tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for&#xD;
      further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) has not approved CIML NK cells as treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved IL-15 as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipilimumab for your specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;

        products (up to 16 weeks after the last N-803 dose), in such a manner that the risk of&#xD;
        pregnancy is minimized. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she&#xD;
        or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
        immediately.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had anti-tumor chemotherapy or other investigational agents&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to cell infusion (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), or&#xD;
             immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior, or those who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to N-803 or other agents used in study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autoimmune disease: patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients&#xD;
             with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic&#xD;
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune&#xD;
             vasculitis [Wegener's granulomatosis]) and motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune&#xD;
             origin (e.g. Guillain- Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis). Patients with Hashimoto&#xD;
             thyroiditis are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the unknown teratogenic risk of&#xD;
             CIML NK cells and N-803 and with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects by fludarabine/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy regimen. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with CIML NK cells and N-803, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with anti-retroviral agents used in this study. In addition, these&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with active uncontrolled hepatitis B or C are ineligible as they are at&#xD;
             high-risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity in the setting of marrow&#xD;
             suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known non-infectious pneumonitis or any history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of start of study treatment.&#xD;
