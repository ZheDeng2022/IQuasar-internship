  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) also known as shin splints or tibial periostitis is a&#xD;
      common injury in athletes and soldiers/cadets with incidences ranging between 4% and 35% in&#xD;
      these populations . It is characterized by pain in the middle and lower end of tibia; the&#xD;
      pain is usually elicited by practicing sports or other physical activities. The criteria for&#xD;
      diagnosis for MTSS were established by Yates and White. Although the prognosis of MTSS is&#xD;
      usually benign, it can evolve to chronicity and be disabling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated the effects of different medical treatment in athletes and&#xD;
      cadets with MTSS. Study will correspond to the demonstration of treatment options for medial&#xD;
      tibial stress syndrome that lie in the domain of Physical Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic Ultrasound and Shortwave Diathermy.&#xD;

      Primary objective of the study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of Shortwave Diathermy on Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome among&#xD;
           military cadets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of Therapeutic Ultrasound on Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome among&#xD;
           military cadets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effects of Shortwave Diathermy and Therapeutic Ultrasound on Medial&#xD;
           Tibial Stress Syndrome among military cadets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      study hypothesis is &quot;Shortwave diathermy and Therapeutic Ultrasound are equally effective in&#xD;
      Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome among military cadets.&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design : Randomized Control trial Study Settings is Pakistan Military Academy&#xD;
      Abbottabad. Sample Size: The sample size calculation is done through epitool to obtain a&#xD;
      sample size ratio 1:1 for both treatment groups with Power of 0.8, Confidence interval of&#xD;
      0.95 and Variance = 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean of experimental group was 2.17 and mean of control group was 4.26 taken from the parent&#xD;
      article.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results obtained from epitool:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample size: 36 Sample size per group: 18(each group) Sampling Technique:&#xD;
      Non-probability Purposive Sampling- subjects will be recurited into the groups through sealed&#xD;
      enveloped method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Plan/Timeline for Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline for the participants will be one month after the approval of IRB form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow ups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 follow ups per week for a period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed on Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative data will be interpreted in terms of means and standard deviation whereas&#xD;
           qualitative data will be presented in the form of frequencies and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative data will be represented in form of histogram whereas qualitative data is&#xD;
           shown in the form of bar charts and graphs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferential Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be assessed for its normality by applying Shapiro-Wilk test and its value of&#xD;
           0.05 or lesser than that shows that the data is normally distributed at baseline and at&#xD;
           the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parametric test will be used for normally distributed data whereas non parametric test&#xD;
           would be applied for skewed sample or away from normality data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For comparison between two groups, Independent T Test (parametric) or Mann-Whitney&#xD;
           Test(non-parametric) will be used both a baseline and at the end of sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For within the group comparison at intervals (baseline and post treatment), Pared T test&#xD;
           (parametric) or Wilcoxon Rank Test (non-parametric) will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE/SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS / POTENTIAL HAZARDS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No adverse effects are present in this study. Onsite clinical arrangements will be made&#xD;
      available for subjective and objective assessment and for the treatment protocol as well. For&#xD;
      this purpose portable modalities will be used which will be easy to transfer and operate. The&#xD;
      total expenses required will be provided by the students themselves&#xD;
&#xD;
      No potential risk present to the participants or community as a whole&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL BENEFIT TO THE PARTICIPANTS OR COMMUNITY AS WHOLE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Awareness will be provided regarding MTSS among community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Long term complications leading to physical limitations and disability will be&#xD;
           prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Awareness regarding Physical Therapy treatment for MTSS will be provided&#xD;
