    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers and angiogenic growth factors and SNP polymorphisms of the promoter regions of&#xD;
      their genes as well as to determine their role in the development of adverse cardiac&#xD;
      remodeling in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The widespread introduction of modern methods of treatments of myocardial infarction in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice has lead not only to a decrease in mortality, but also to an&#xD;
      increase in the number of patients with chronic heart failure. It is known that inflammation&#xD;
      develops in myocardial infarction in response to cell damage, which is accompanied by&#xD;
      activation of the cells of the immune system and eventually with scarring. Chronic aseptic&#xD;
      inflammation is not only a universal biological reaction in response to necrosis of&#xD;
      cardiomyocytes, but the cellular molecular basis of post-infarction cardiac remodeling. At&#xD;
      the same time, the imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators can have some negative&#xD;
      effects on the healing processes of the damaged myocardium and subsequent remodeling of the&#xD;
      heart. In adverse heart remodeling, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,&#xD;
      IL-6, TNF-α, etc.) and reduced secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, etc.)&#xD;
      persist for a long time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the endotoxin hypothesis of cytokine production has been of great interest among&#xD;
      scientists. Endotoxin is a molecule of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the outer cell wall of&#xD;
      gram-negative bacteria. LPS is a powerful inducer of cytokine release, and chronic endotoxin&#xD;
      load is at least one of the reasons for the activation of the innate immune system. One of&#xD;
      the most important and unresolved problems in pathophysiology is the study of the nature of&#xD;
      the inflammatory response, or rather the cytokine response cascade, reparation and&#xD;
      neoangiogenesis developing in the myocardium in response to ischemic damage, as well as&#xD;
      genetically determined regulation of these processes. Factors determining the dual role of&#xD;
      cytokines in the development of adverse cardiac remodeling can be polymorphisms of their&#xD;
      genes, in particular, single nucleotide polymorphism of genes - SNP (single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphism) with replacement of one nucleotide by another. SNP in promoter regions regulate&#xD;
      the intensity of gene expression, different levels of secretion and function of interleukins,&#xD;
      growth factors, and, accordingly, their biological effects. Uncovering the mechanisms that&#xD;
      regulate the secretion of angiogenic growths factors, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in&#xD;
      patients with AMI could potentially become the basis for developing new treatment tactics&#xD;
      based on modulating the immune response and neoangiogenesis in AMI by introducing into&#xD;
      ischemic tissues of cytokines or angiogenic growth factors in the form recombinant proteins&#xD;
      or as a part of genetic constructs to stimulate regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 200 patients with acute primary myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation&#xD;
      will be recruited. Upon admission, all patients receive standard therapy, as recommended for&#xD;
      the treatment of myocardial infarction. Within 24 hours of admission, coronary angiography&#xD;
      and revascularization of the infarct-related artery are performed. On the days 1 and 7 of&#xD;
      hospitalization and on the day of discharge, blood will be taken to determine the dynamics of&#xD;
      serum concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers, markers of myocardial&#xD;
      necrosis; gene polymorphisms will be studied; echocardiography will be performed to assess&#xD;
      the structural and functional characteristics of the heart after AMI. After 3 and 12 months,&#xD;
      patients undergo studies to dynamically assess the structural and functional state of the&#xD;
      heart.&#xD;
