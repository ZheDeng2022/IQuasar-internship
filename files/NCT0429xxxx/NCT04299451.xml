  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase III parallel-group randomized controlled trial is to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of open dialogue about complementary alternative medicine integrated in conventional&#xD;
      oncology care (ODC-COC). The investigators hypothesize that patients in the intervention&#xD;
      group participating in an ODC-COC with a nurse specialist report better quality of life&#xD;
      compared to patients in the control group receiving standard care alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to the intervention group will participate in a scheduled ODC-COC with a&#xD;
      specialist nurse, who has completed the Fellowship in Integrative Medicine at the University&#xD;
      of Arizona. This is a training program for health professionals in empowering individuals and&#xD;
      communities to optimize health and well-being through evidence-based, sustainable and&#xD;
      integrative approaches. The ODC-COC will be based on the fundamentals of person-centered care&#xD;
      according to this program and include patient preferences and wishes, reliable information&#xD;
      and counselling and advice about the potential risks and benefits of using complementary&#xD;
      alternative medicine as an adjunct to conventional oncology care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dialogue lasts approximately 60 minutes and will take place as soon as possible and no&#xD;
      later than two weeks after enrolment. The same nurse will conduct all dialogues. According to&#xD;
      patient needs and wishes there may be a follow-up dialogue over the telephone or in the&#xD;
      Oncology Outpatient Clinic. The potential second dialogue is estimated to last approximately&#xD;
      30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will receive standard information including reference to&#xD;
      www.KABcancer.dk, which is a website presenting research on CAM, including information about&#xD;
      its potential effects and outcomes.&#xD;
