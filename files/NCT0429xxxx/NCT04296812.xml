      This study will explore the effects of the Injeti Self-Love Model intervention on adolescents&#xD;
      challenged with low-self-esteem leading to self-harming, suicidal thoughts and suicidal&#xD;
      attempts. This study will examine the promotion of self-esteem through the Injeti Self-Love&#xD;
      Model as a safety measure against &quot;poor behavioral habits&quot; such as intentional self-harming,&#xD;
      substance abuse, suicidal thinking and suicide attempt as means to cope. Study participation&#xD;
      will include initial screening, self-assessment, occupational therapy self-esteem&#xD;
      intervention of one session, with an individual follow-up, along with an interview, and&#xD;
      finishing up with a one-month follow-up interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative research is a methodology for investigating and considering the meaning&#xD;
      individuals attribute to a significant human experience. The qualitative approach will be&#xD;
      structured around a semi-structured interview initiated at the end of the second follow-up&#xD;
      session and after 1-month follow-up.&#xD;

The items are answered on a four-point scale fluctuating from strongly agree to strongly disagree. A score between 15 and 25 is considered normal, while a score less than 15 indicates potential low self-esteem.</description>
