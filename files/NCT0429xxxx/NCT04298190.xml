  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of dialectical behavior&#xD;
      therapy (DBT) in treatment of adolescents with deliberate self harm compared to enhanced&#xD;
      usual care (EUC). This study follows-up 77 patients in the ages of 12-18 yrs who have been&#xD;
      included in an RCT of DBT-A vs EUC. The main inclusion criterion for this study was&#xD;
      repetitive self-harm behaviour. The patients were randomly allocated to receive 16 weeks of&#xD;
      outpatient DBT or EUC in child and adolescent psychiatric clinics in Oslo. Participants have&#xD;
      been assessed so far on six different time-points: baseline (before starting treatment), 9&#xD;
      weeks, 15 weeks, 19 weeks, 71 weeks and 3 years after start of the treatment. In the current&#xD;
      project patients will be assessed a 7th time 10 years after treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that compared with participants who had received EUC in the original trial&#xD;
      during their adolescence participants who had received DBT-A will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) report a significantly lower frequency of episodes of self-harm, both last year and over&#xD;
      the extended 10-year follow-up interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) be significantly less impaired with respect to social, family and occupational functioning&#xD;
      and report a higher quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) have retained significantly fewer diagnostic criteria of BPD and have less severe&#xD;
      borderline features according to dimensional measures and have significantly fewer signs of&#xD;
      emotion dysregulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm, highly prevalent in adolescents, are behaviours&#xD;
      strongly associated with severe emotion dysregulation, mental health problems and increased&#xD;
      suicide risk. The original study, on which the present study is building, used a randomized&#xD;
      controlled design, with a stratified block randomization procedure, and blinded&#xD;
      pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-up evaluations comparing 19weeks of DBT-A with EUC&#xD;
      of equal length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of special interest to this follow-up study is to gain more knowledge on their capacity to&#xD;
      regulate emotions, since failures in emotion regulation is an underlying mechanism of&#xD;
      repetitive self-harm behaviours and several other difficulties, and since a main aim of DBT-A&#xD;
      is to enhance adolescents capacity to use healthy emotion regulation strategies. The study is&#xD;
      designed to carefully include user and family perspectives on the definition of specific&#xD;
      outcomes and how to measure them, we will collect detailed data on important outcomes&#xD;
      employing a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, innovative approaches such&#xD;
      as ecological momentary assessment and register data. Adding new data to the existing rich&#xD;
      data will give us a basis to study the dynamic interplay between symptoms, emotions, and&#xD;
      functional and dysfunctional behaviours and make new discoveries of mechanisms of therapeutic&#xD;
      change, knowledge to further increase treatment response rates and individualize treatments&#xD;
      and to inform further development of this treatment and its implementation in Norway and&#xD;
      other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the 10-year post-randomization treatment outcomes of DBT-A compared with EUC with&#xD;
           respect to: a) frequency of subsequent episodes of self-harm, b) severity of suicidal&#xD;
           ideation, c) level of depressive symptoms and d) frequency of subsequent emergency room&#xD;
           visits, hospitalizations and use of additional treatments due to risk of self-harm&#xD;
           behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the 10-year post-randomization clinical course and stability of a diagnosis of BPD, its&#xD;
           diagnostic criteria and borderline symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. participants' adult mental health, social, family and occupational functioning and&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. participants' adult strategies for and capacity to cope with stressful life-events and&#xD;
           situations in their daily lives and effectively regulate emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the association between participants' adult life use of skills and functional coping&#xD;
           strategies and self-harm behaviour and other problem behaviours, and whether any&#xD;
           substitution from onedysfunctional coping behaviour to another has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. participants' evaluation of what components of the treatment was most helpful and led to&#xD;
           the strongest and most persistent change in important functions and aspects of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. the economic cost of treatments consumed and functional impairment and occupational&#xD;
           disability over the 10-year post-randomization period and the long-term&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness of DBT-A.&#xD;
