  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I multi-center, open-label, study of DST-2970 to determine the MTD, overall&#xD;
      safety/tolerability, PK/pharmacodynamic parameters, and efficacy in prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients.The study will include a dose escalation phase followed by a dose expansion phase.&#xD;
      Each cohort will consist of a &quot;run-in&quot; period to assess pharmacokinetic trough, as well as&#xD;
      C1hour, C2hour, and C3hour levels of standard of care abiraterone acetate, followed by a&#xD;
      minimum of an 80-hour washout (treatment delay), then initiation of treatment with DST-2970.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population that will be evaluated in this study include patients with castration&#xD;
      sensitive or castration resistant prostate cancer who experience a rising PSA, with or&#xD;
      without radiographic progression, while taking abiraterone acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, &quot;initial PSA response to abiraterone&quot; is defined as having a â‰¥ 30% drop in&#xD;
      PSA levels (confirmed by a second PSA level one month later) during the first 6 months of&#xD;
      treatment with abiraterone. These patients who subsequently experience a rise in PSA while on&#xD;
      abiraterone are considered as having &quot;acquired resistance&quot; to abiraterone in the context of&#xD;
      this protocol. Patients not meeting the definition of having an &quot;initial PSA response to&#xD;
      abiraterone&quot; are considered as having &quot;primary resistance&quot; to abiraterone in the context of&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation phase, all patients with a rising PSA can be enrolled, whether they&#xD;
      had an &quot;initial PSA response to abiraterone&quot; or never responded to abiraterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two expansion cohorts will be opened. One expansion cohort will evaluate patients who did&#xD;
      achieve an &quot;initial PSA response to abiraterone&quot; within the first 6 months of treatment as&#xD;
      defined above, but subsequently progressed by PSA with or without radiographic progression. A&#xD;
      second expansion cohort will evaluate patients who did not achieve an &quot;initial PSA response&#xD;
      to abiraterone&quot; as defined above but have PSA progression with or without radiographic&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the study is to determine if the better bioavailability of DST-2970 will&#xD;
      overcome resistance to abiraterone acetate experienced in these two clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cohorts, treatment will continue until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      investigator and/or sponsor decision, intercurrent illness or patient withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored regularly with physical examination and laboratory tests.&#xD;
