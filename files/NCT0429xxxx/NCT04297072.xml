  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By evaluating routine clinical practice data from the UK primary care database, researchers&#xD;
      in this study want to gather information on the kidney function of patients with non-valvular&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF, irregularly heart beats which is not caused by a heart valve&#xD;
      problem) who are treated with Rivaroxaban (non-vitamin K antagonist, brand name Xarelto) or&#xD;
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The study planned to enroll about 25,000 male or female&#xD;
      patients who were at least 18 years old and were new users of Rivaroxaban or VKAs between 01&#xD;
      January 2014 and 30 September 2019. Researchers are especially interested in whether patients&#xD;
      experienced under treatment any worsening in kidney function, the onset of acute kidney&#xD;
      diseases or injuries. In addition, risk of worsening in kidney function in patients with or&#xD;
      without diabetes or heart failures are of interest to the researchers.&#xD;

        Patients aged ≥18 years with NVAF and no record of ESRD, with a first prescription for&#xD;
        rivaroxaban or a VKA and no previous OAC use between 01 January 2014 and 30 September 2019&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  aged ≥18 years in the IMRD-UK database&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a first prescription for either rivaroxaban or a VKA between 01 January 2014 and 31&#xD;
             March 2019. The date of the first rivaroxaban/VKA prescription will be set as the&#xD;
             start date (start of follow-up for that patient). The follow-up will be extended until&#xD;
             30 September 2019 to ensure that each patient has at least 6 months of potential&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a diagnosis of AF recorded any time before start date or within 2 weeks after start&#xD;
             date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  registered with their general practice at least 1 year before the start date and have&#xD;
             a recorded prescription of any drug at least 1 year before the start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  registered with a general practice with data considered to be up-to-standard quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a prescription for any OAC before the start date - all first-time rivaroxaban/VKA&#xD;
             users will therefore be OAC naïve&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a record of heart valve replacement or mitral stenosis any time before the start date&#xD;
             or in the 2 weeks after the start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a record of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or hip/knee surgery in the 3&#xD;
             months before the start date (because these are all alternative reasons for NOAC&#xD;
             initiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a record of ESRD (including renal transplant patients) on/before the start date&#xD;
