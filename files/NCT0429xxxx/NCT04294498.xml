  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PD1 blockade has been approved as salvage therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC). Although there is not solid evidence that PD1 blockade would induce hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV) reactivation, previous clinical trials of PD1 blockade required enrolled patients to&#xD;
      receive anti-HBV medications and control the viral load to be under 100-2000 IU/mL before&#xD;
      initiation of PD1 blockade therapy. Such a requirement may not be necessary and could delay&#xD;
      the treatment. Guidelines for prevention of chemotherapy induced HBV reactivation only&#xD;
      suggest combining anti-HBV medications during the chemotherapy course without such a&#xD;
      requirement of very load HBV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that under anti-HBV medications, patients with advanced HCC&#xD;
      and active chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can receive durvalumab treatment without&#xD;
      increased risks of HBV reactivation and related complications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although durvalumab has not been approved as treatment for HCC, similar PD1 blockade agents&#xD;
      such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have gain approval as salvage therapy for advanced HCC.&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 43 patients with active (defined as serum viral load &gt; 2000&#xD;
      IU/mL) chronic HBV infection (defined as positive serum HBV surface antigen). All patients&#xD;
      would receive entecavir within 7 days of initiation of durvalumab treatment. Durvalumab 1500&#xD;
      mg would be given intravenously every 4 weeks until confirmed disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, or completion of 24 treatment. Tumor assessment will be performed&#xD;
      every 8-12 weeks. HBV viral load will be monitored at least once per month. Entecavir&#xD;
      treatment will be continued at least 6 months after discontinuation of durvalumab treatment.&#xD;
