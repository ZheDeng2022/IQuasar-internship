      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients with advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma as first line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used for the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Early randomized trials suggested that TACE can be accepted as the&#xD;
      standard treatment for advanced stage disease. However, outcome of patients treated with TACE&#xD;
      in real-life cohorts is still very poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have also supported a safe combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with&#xD;
      TACE. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE&#xD;
      combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
