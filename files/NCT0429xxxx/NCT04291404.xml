  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Needle procedures, such as intravenous (IV) insertions, are among the most commonly performed&#xD;
      procedures for children needing medical care. IV insertions are often a painful and stressful&#xD;
      experience for both children and their parents/ caregivers. Pediatric pain and distress that&#xD;
      is not adequately treated may lead to a frightened and uncooperative child, repeated IV&#xD;
      attempts and overall frustration with care for the family and clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distraction therapy is a common psychological strategy which involves engaging children in a&#xD;
      cognitive task or activity in order to divert attention away from painful stimuli. Given&#xD;
      children's growing enthusiasm for novel technology, the investigators propose that an&#xD;
      immersive virtual reality (VR) experience may provide an effective means of distraction for&#xD;
      children undergoing IV insertions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The investigators' primary objective is to compare the reduction of distress with&#xD;
      the use of distraction (via the VR intervention) versus current standard of care in children&#xD;
      aged 6 to 17 years who are undergoing IV placement. The secondary objectives are to compare&#xD;
      (a) the reduction of pain; (b) the reduction of fear; (c) the reduction of parental/caregiver&#xD;
      anxiety; and (d) parental/caregiver and nurse satisfaction with the procedure in the&#xD;
      intervention versus control arms; and (e) to assess the safety of using VR intervention in&#xD;
      children aged 6 to17 years who are undergoing IV placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial consisting of a&#xD;
      control arm receiving departmental standard of care and an intervention arm which will&#xD;
      include the addition of an immersive VR experience to current standard of care. Children 6 to&#xD;
      17 years of age who are undergoing IV insertions in the Stollery Children's Hospital&#xD;
      emergency department will be considered for enrollment into the study. Approximately 80&#xD;
      families will be recruited over a one-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention and Comparison: The VR intervention will aim to provide distraction by&#xD;
      immersing the child in an artificial 3-dimensional environment that will engage them for the&#xD;
      duration of the IV procedure. The child will wear a head-mounted display (&quot;VR goggles&quot;) that&#xD;
      will allow them to explore the virtual world through their own visual perspective in&#xD;
      360-degrees. A small handheld controller (optional) can be used to interact with the virtual&#xD;
      environment and change settings. The VR goggles will occlude the patient's view of the&#xD;
      treatment room, and a pair of noise-cancelling headphones (optional) can be used to further&#xD;
      block out ambient hospital sounds. Together, this will provide the child with a unique vivid&#xD;
      experience of being fully immersed or &quot;present&quot; inside the 3D virtual world. The control&#xD;
      group will receive departmental standard of care which will include topical anesthetic cream&#xD;
      (mandatory) and may include parent/caregiver support, child life services, nursing support,&#xD;
      etc (at the discretion of the ED clinical care team and the family). At present, there is no&#xD;
      single established distraction therapy or routine that is consistently employed for IV&#xD;
      procedures within the study site ED. Thus, for pragmatic and ethical considerations, it is&#xD;
      felt that the new study VR intervention should be compared to what is currently already in&#xD;
      practice (ie. standard of care). Of note, other forms of technology (e.g. smart phones,&#xD;
      tablets) will not be prohibited in the control group, if the family chooses to offer them.&#xD;
      Due to ethical and pragmatic considerations, children in both groups must receive topical&#xD;
      anesthetic cream for IV placement, as it is known to be effective and considered standard of&#xD;
      care within the study hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Impact: The use of immersive VR technology has previously shown promise in numerous&#xD;
      healthcare settings. However, there is still a need for robust evidence regarding its&#xD;
      effectiveness in treating pediatric distress associated with IV procedures, particularly in&#xD;
      the emergency department. Results of this randomized controlled trial could inform an&#xD;
      evidence-based strategy for the management of pediatric distress, which could be used in&#xD;
      settings with and without child life specialists.&#xD;
