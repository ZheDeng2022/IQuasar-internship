      Estimates of the UK's military veteran population, defined by the British Government as those&#xD;
      who have served in the military for at least one day, is approximately 2.5 million,&#xD;
      equivalent to around 5% of household residents aged 16 years or over in the UK. UK military&#xD;
      veterans receive healthcare provision from the National Health Service (NHS), with care&#xD;
      recorded in local, regional and national EHRs. EHRs - structured and unstructured (i.e. free&#xD;
      text) - can be used to evaluate disease prevalence, surveillance, to perform epidemiological&#xD;
      analyses and investigate quality of care and to improve clinical decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no national marker in UK EHRs to identify veterans, nor is there a requirement for&#xD;
      healthcare professionals to record it, making it difficult to evaluate the unique healthcare&#xD;
      needs of those who have served in the UK Armed Forces. This study, funded by Forces in Mind&#xD;
      Trust, seeks to validate the Military Service Identification Tool, an open-source computer&#xD;
      program that searches through free-text clinical notes to make a prediction on a person's&#xD;
      military status. It is in the public interest to know the health of our Armed Forces. The&#xD;
      Tool has been validated using manually annotated datasets, but we now need to valid an&#xD;
      individual's military status by contacting them via post or telephone and asking, &quot;Have you&#xD;
      ever served in the Armed Forces&quot;. The research team will work closely with the CRIS Patient&#xD;
      Advisory Group and local healthcare professionals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no military service marker in electronic healthcare records to identify&#xD;
      who is a veteran in England and Wales [3]. This makes it difficult to evaluate the unique&#xD;
      healthcare needs of those who have served in the UK military. In a previous study, the&#xD;
      investigators set out to investigate whether it was feasible to identify veterans who&#xD;
      accessed secondary mental healthcare services via their anonymized electronic healthcare&#xD;
      records using a manual, text search based, method. To do this, the investigators used the&#xD;
      South London and Maudsley (SLaM) Biomedical Research Centre Case Register. This is a novel&#xD;
      data resource, derived directly from the routine electronic healthcare records of the SLaM&#xD;
      NHS Foundation Trust. SLaM is one of Europe's largest mental health providers, serving over&#xD;
      1.2 million residents in four South London boroughs. This Case Register holds patient's&#xD;
      electronic healthcare records for all secondary mental healthcare provisions within SLaM. All&#xD;
      these electronic healthcare records have been anonymized and a system has been developed to&#xD;
      enable researchers to access and search through these records called the clinical record&#xD;
      interactive system (CRIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the first study the investigators developed a manual, text search based, method&#xD;
      using commonly used terms and phrases found in the free text clinical notes to identify&#xD;
      veterans. Running this manual method resulted in the identification of n = 6,039 potential&#xD;
      veteran records, of which n = 1,600 were selected to scrutinize in more detail, whilst&#xD;
      considering time and manpower restrictions. This resulted in n = 693 veteran records,&#xD;
      suggesting an identification rate of 43% when using the manual method. Therefore, it was&#xD;
      concluded that it was feasible to identify veterans in electronic healthcare records, but&#xD;
      time consuming. Each potential veteran record was manually verified by the research team by&#xD;
      reading through each patient's notes. This took on average 11 minutes per record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the time it took to identify veterans and improve sensitivity and reach, he&#xD;
      investigators developed the Military Service Identification Tool (MSIT), and it proved to be&#xD;
      quicker, more accurate and cheaper than the manual method. The Tool was designed to detect&#xD;
      military service, not just veteran status. 1the investigators took a systematic approach to&#xD;
      developing and testing the MSIT. Then a different subsets of all the electronic healthcare&#xD;
      records available to us, to ensure the MSIT was developed and trained on a different set of&#xD;
      electronic healthcare records (named the training dataset). Subsequently the MSIT was&#xD;
      verified on another subset of the data (named the gold standard dataset) to ensure it would&#xD;
      still be able to identify veterans if a different set of electronic healthcare records would&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators managed to identify 2,922 veterans in the electronic healthcare records&#xD;
      when applying MSIT to inspect 150,000 individual records. The MSIT took only 20 minutes to go&#xD;
      through all these records and had an identification rate of 88% when compared to the manual&#xD;
      approach. The investigators also matched these veterans to 2,922 non-veterans based on age&#xD;
      and gender to compare their mental health treatment pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the success of our initial developments, the investigators have faced a significant&#xD;
      barrier that may prevent the widespread, dissemination, roll-out and implementation of the&#xD;
      MSIT. Various academics and stakeholders (e.g. NHS England, Cobseo) are interested in the&#xD;
      MSIT. However, it has been highlighted an important limitation, namely it is still unclear&#xD;
      whether the veterans identified by the MSIT are 'actual' veterans. MSIT identifies veterans&#xD;
      based on the notes provided by the clinician in the electronic healthcare record. It is also&#xD;
      important to understand if higher rates of physical and mental health are represented in a&#xD;
      veteran population compared to civilians. By including both samples - civilian and veteran -&#xD;
      this ensures that fair comparisons are able to be made. This There is currently no&#xD;
      opportunity to verify their veteran status. For example, no service number is provided in&#xD;
      their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, to overcome these limitations and to demonstrate that the MSIT is correctly&#xD;
      identifying military service (serving personnel, veterans or civilian) it is important to&#xD;
      reach out to those who have been identified to ask about their previous Service.&#xD;

        Participants have already been identified using the Military Service Identification Tool.&#xD;
        In a previous research project, the Tool was run on the records of 150,000 patients&#xD;
        extracted from the Clinical Record Interactive Search, which is managed by NIHR Maudsley&#xD;
        Biomedical Research Centre (BRC). A copy of the article describing the methodology has&#xD;
        recently been accepted for publication in JMIR Medical Informatics (DOI: 10.2196/15852). In&#xD;
        total 2,922 probable veterans were identified and matched to 2,922 civilians on age and&#xD;
        gender. The dataset has a total sample size of 5,844 individuals. Once approvals are in&#xD;
        place, we will identify those who have given consent to be contacted and meet our&#xD;
        eligibility criteria (described in other parts of our application).&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Only those participants who formed part of our original study will be screened for&#xD;
        eligibility. This corresponds to 2,922 probable veterans and 2,922 civilians. The following&#xD;
        inclusion criteria will apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants are listed as 'Alive' in the SLaM BRC Clinical Record Interactive Search&#xD;
             database;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants will be aged 18 years and old;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant has given Consent for Contact;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has a valid postal or email address or telephone number;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants have capacity to consent and deemed fit to participate in research by a&#xD;
             clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants will be able to speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be excluded if a clinician is required to be notified of the research&#xD;
        prior to contact, as this may indicate at risk participants. Further participants who are&#xD;
        not fluent in spoken English will be unable to take part in the study due to inability to&#xD;
        understand the participant information and consent form. Therefore, non-English speaking&#xD;
        participants will not be included in this study.&#xD;
