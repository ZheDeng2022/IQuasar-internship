  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this placebo-controlled, double-blind study is to determine the effects of a&#xD;
      commercially available (i.e. dietary supplement) Hemp Oil Extract product on various markers&#xD;
      of physical and mental stress resilience, and perceived recovery from normal daily physical &amp;&#xD;
      mental stress. Secondary purposes are to collect information on perceived appetite, mood,&#xD;
      feelings of wellbeing, sleep quality, body composition and safety information via standard&#xD;
      clinical chemistry panels of sera and plasma.&#xD;
