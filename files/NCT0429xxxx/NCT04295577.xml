      This is a multi-centre, observational (non-interventional) study, designed to follow patients&#xD;
      with advanced ovarian fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer, who are receiving&#xD;
      Niraparib as maintenance treatment, according to the Niraparib access criteria (via TESARO&#xD;
      patient access programme, EMA licence and NHS pending NICE assessment due 2018) including&#xD;
      assessment of tolerability to Niraparib therapy.&#xD;

      This is a multi-centre, observational (non-interventional) study, designed to follow patients&#xD;
      with advanced ovarian fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer, who are receiving&#xD;
      Niraparib as maintenance treatment, according to the Niraparib access criteria (via TESARO&#xD;
      patient access programme, EMA licence and NHS pending NICE assessment due 2018) including&#xD;
      assessment of tolerability to Niraparib therapy. These pathways will include patients who&#xD;
      have been registered and not prescribed drug. In these cases, the reason for patients not&#xD;
      receiving Niraparib will be recorded. Up to 15 centres will be involved in the study. Centres&#xD;
      will be selected based on interest in or experience of prescribing Niraparib and geographical&#xD;
      location in order to give a representative picture of the management of Niraparib in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Retrospective Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have previously commenced maintenance Niraparib prior to the MONITOR study&#xD;
           opening at the site and are still receiving Niraparib but in whom quality of life data&#xD;
           are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have previously commenced Niraparib prior to the MONITOR Study opening at&#xD;
           the site but are now deceased but will be eligible for retrospective data collection&#xD;
           without the need for informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have previously commenced maintenance Niraparib prior to the MONITOR study&#xD;
           opening at the site but have discontinued treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data in respect of AEs, SAEs, ADRs and AESIs will be recorded in Case Report Forms and&#xD;
           be identified via the patient's medical records. There is no requirement to complete&#xD;
           trial specific SAE reporting forms in this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Prospective Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have previously commenced maintenance Niraparib prior to the MONITOR study&#xD;
           opening at the site and are still receiving Niraparib and in whom quality of life data&#xD;
           is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are due to commence maintenance Niraparib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of QoL data, using EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QoL-OV28, FACT-O questionnaires will be&#xD;
      mandatory. For patients continuing on Niraparib, data will be collected retrospectively to&#xD;
      the point they sign the consent form, and prospectively. Going forward QoL data will not be&#xD;
      collected for these patients unless available as part of routine clinical care and baseline&#xD;
      QoL is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of data relating to adverse events will be mandatory. The scope of adverse&#xD;
      events to be recorded includes AEs, SAEs, ADRs and AESIs - see section 5.3.1 for definitions&#xD;
      of these events. Details in respect of AEs and SAEs, ADRs and AESIs will be recorded during&#xD;
      routine clinic visits or via standard of care contact with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional visits will be required, no study medication will be administrated, and no&#xD;
      additional procedures will be performed outside the local routine practice as part of the&#xD;
      trial. Patients will be managed and followed up according to routine practice. Only data&#xD;
      available in the patient's medical record will be collected. Patients consented to cohort 2&#xD;
      will be asked to complete validated QoL tools; EQ-5D-5L, FACT-O and EORTC QOL-OV28.&#xD;
      Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled with an estimated 50 in the retrospective cohort&#xD;
      and 150 in the prospective cohort.&#xD;
