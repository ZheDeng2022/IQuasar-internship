  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase 1 trial of INCB7839 for children with recurrent or progressive&#xD;
      high-grade gliomas, including, but not limited to, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)&#xD;
      and other diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), after upfront therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INCB7839 is an inhibitor of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) 10 and 17 proteases.&#xD;
      Neuronal activity regulates glioma growth through neuroligin-3 (NLGN3). ADAM 10 is the&#xD;
      protease responsible for NLGN3 release into the tumor microenvironment and represents a&#xD;
      promising therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies of INCB7839 in patient-derived pediatric high-grade gliomas (GBM and&#xD;
      DIPG) revealed that INCB7839 inhibits pediatric high- grade glioma growth and improves&#xD;
      overall survival. In vivo testing also demonstrated that INCB7839 penetrates brain tissue&#xD;
      sufficient to achieve its pharmacodynamic effect of ADAM10 inhibition. Further pre-clinical&#xD;
      studies in other animals revealed minimal toxicity, including non-adverse to mild increases&#xD;
      in serum hepatobiliary enzymes, protein, calcium, cholesterol values, along with minimal&#xD;
      decreases in RBC mass parameters; all parameters recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCB7839 has been evaluated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for previously treated&#xD;
      solid tumors and breast cancer. Of the adverse events (AEs) noted, the majority were&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate in severity, the most frequent being fatigue, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea,&#xD;
      emesis, abdominal pain, anemia and constipation. The dose-limiting toxicity for monotherapy&#xD;
      with INCB7839 in Phase I clinical trials was declared to be deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Out&#xD;
      of 41 patients, there was a total of 9 thrombotic events including mild superficial&#xD;
      thrombophlebitis (n=1), DVT (n=4), vena cava thrombosis with renal insufficiency in a patient&#xD;
      with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (n=1), atrial thrombosis in patient with&#xD;
      breast cancer (n=1), and pulmonary embolism in patients with hormone-refractory prostate&#xD;
      cancer (n=2). Overall, INCB7839 does exhibit a pro-coagulant effect in some adult patients,&#xD;
      resulting in an increased incidence of DVT, whether used alone or in combination. The&#xD;
      mechanism of this effect is unknown, and there is no clear relationship between the frequency&#xD;
      of thrombosis and the dose administered.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase I study and we will use a design similar to the Rolling-6 design and open 6 slots initially on Dose level 1. If we observe no-more than 1 DLT in these 6 subjects then we would expand this cohort to at least 12 patients for PK and additional safety information. If more than 1 DLT is observed on dose level 1 in 2-6 subjects, then further enrollment to dose level 1 will stop, the dose will be de-escalated to dose level 0 and the same approach will be repeated. Based on the above-outlined de-escalation rules, if dose level 0 is found to be too toxic, then the trial will be closed to accrual and the merits of amending or closing the trial permanently will be reconsidered.</intervention_model_description>
