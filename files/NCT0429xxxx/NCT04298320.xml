    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/IIa, Open-label, Investigator-initiated Trail of SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1&#xD;
      Inhibitor) in combination with AIN457 for patients with late stage MSS CRC who failed&#xD;
      second-line and above treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and RD of SHR-1210&#xD;
      combination with AIN457 as a treatment of MSS CRC.&#xD;
