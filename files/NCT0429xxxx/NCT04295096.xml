      Title: Collection of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) From Healthy Subjects for the&#xD;
      Development of Cellular Immunotherapy Product&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR-T therapies are being developed that utilize modified immune cells to fight tumors.&#xD;
      'Off-the-shelf' allogeneic CAR-T technology has better efficacy and more promising clinical&#xD;
      applications. Investigators want to use the cells of healthy subjects to perform the studies.&#xD;
      To accomplish this, they are collecting PBMCs through apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect PBMCs from healthy subjects for product development for cell Immunotherapies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have changed the therapeutic landscape in&#xD;
      haematological malignancies. Nevertheless, the use of allogeneic CAR T cells from donors has&#xD;
      many potential advantages over autologous approaches, such as the immediate availability of&#xD;
      cryopreserved batches for patient treatment, possible standardization of the CAR-T cell&#xD;
      product, time for multiple cell modifications, redosing or combination of CAR T cells&#xD;
      directed against different targets, and decreased cost using an industrialized process. The T&#xD;
      cells currently used for CAR-T cell manufacturing are mainly derived from peripheral blood&#xD;
      mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) .The manufacture of allogeneic CAR T cells from PBMCs collected&#xD;
      from healthy donors is associated with the ability to make multiple vials from a single&#xD;
      apheresis product. Allogeneic CAR T cells are created from healthy donors, they are generated&#xD;
      from immune cells that have not been impacted by the immune effects of cancer or by exposure&#xD;
      to chemotherapeutic agents, in contrast to autologous T cells from patients. The selection of&#xD;
      donors on the basis of their immune characteristics is likely to be a key factor in&#xD;
      decreasing the heterogeneity of the final cell product&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To produce allogeneic CAR T cells with different targets and other cell products by&#xD;
           using PBMCs from healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop and optimize the methodology for the response or quality determination of&#xD;
           cell Immunotherapy products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are required to sign a written informed consent form for the study. After the&#xD;
      signing of informed consent form, participants will be screened with a series of vital signs,&#xD;
      physical examinations and laboratory tests. Demographic data and medical history of the&#xD;
      subjects will also be documented. In addition, 30 mL peripheral venous blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected to evaluate the biological characteristics of each subject. Participants will&#xD;
      undergo a routine blood test within 24 hours before the apheresis to reconfirm their&#xD;
      eligibility and 3-5 mL blood samples are to be drawn for the development of detection methods&#xD;
      of cell-based immunotherapy. Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and do not meet any&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are qualified to donate peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) by&#xD;
      means of apheresis. 6×10[9] of cells for each healthy person are preferred. 172 healthy&#xD;
      subjects are to be enrolled through the whole study.&#xD;
