  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research is to develop strategies and interventions to mitigate&#xD;
      the impact of conscientious objection on women's access to safe abortion care in Mexico and&#xD;
      South Africa using a user-centered design approach and test the feasibility and effectiveness&#xD;
      of these interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conscientious objection (CO) is emerging as a growing barrier to abortion care, and evidence&#xD;
      suggests that it is being incorrectly used as a justification for public sector medical&#xD;
      providers and institutions to exempt themselves from their duties to provide essential&#xD;
      reproductive health services for women. Given this, it is essential to better understand and&#xD;
      address this misuse of CO and find ways to improve women's access to safe abortion services&#xD;
      to prevent them from using unsafe methods which risk their health and lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will conduct formative research to more fully understand the problem of CO in&#xD;
      Mexico and South Africa and use these findings to develop interventions and strategies to&#xD;
      mitigate the impact of CO on women's access to safe abortion care using a user-centered&#xD;
      design approach. Rapid randomized controlled trials will then be used to assess effectiveness&#xD;
      of the interventions. The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve our understanding of CO and its impact on access and quality of abortion care&#xD;
           from providers' and facility mangers' perspectives in Mexico, and South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop strategies and interventions to mitigate the impact of CO on women's access to&#xD;
           safe abortion care. Using the data collected, a multi-disciplinary Innovation Team will&#xD;
           develop strategies and interventions to respond to the challenges posed by CO using a&#xD;
           user-centered design approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rapid-test intervention prototypes. We will test selected strategies (prototypes) in&#xD;
           Mexico, and South Africa with assessments to determine successes, and the feasibility of&#xD;
           scaling up these approaches.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of health facility staff exhibiting at least one behavior to make it easier for women to access abortion care (e.g. helped a woman find the abortion care unit, provided positive support to a woman seeking abortion care, gave accurate information to a woman seeking abortion care, etc.).</description>

    <measure>Behavior making it more difficult for women to access abortion care</measure>
    <time_frame>Past 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of health facility staff exhibiting at least one behavior to make it more difficult for women to access abortion care (e.g. gave incorrect directions to a woman seeking abortion care, told a woman abortion services were not available at the facility, tried to convince a woman that she should not have an abortion, etc.).</description>

    <measure>Intention to provide abortion service, referral, or information</measure>

    <description>Proportion of health facility staff reporting they would provide abortion service, referral or information to women seeking abortion care in their health unit in the next few days if needed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interest in attending an abortion care training</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and at 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of providers (doctors, nurses, or midwives) reporting being interested in attending an abortion care training.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stigmatizing Attitudes Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and at 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Average Stigmatizing Attitudes Beliefs and Actions Scale (SABAS) score. The SABAS is a tool designed to measure abortion stigma at the individual and community level, ranging from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 90. A higher score represents more stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs about women who have an abortion (worse outcome).</description>
