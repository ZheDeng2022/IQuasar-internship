  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represent a rapidly growing, high-priority&#xD;
      clinical population highlighted by the NIMH and Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee&#xD;
      due, in part, because they have multiple service needs including access to effective mental&#xD;
      health treatment given high rates of psychiatric comorbidities. Pediatric primary care is a&#xD;
      critical and ongoing point of health care access for children with ASD and thus represents an&#xD;
      ideal setting for identification of mental health service needs and appropriate linkage to&#xD;
      care. The proposed study will use implementation science theory and methods and a&#xD;
      research-community partnership approach to: 1) identify targets to improve mental health&#xD;
      screening and linkage to mental health services in primary care for children with ASD, 2)&#xD;
      adapt integrated care procedures into &quot;Access To Tailored Autism INtegrated Care,&quot; ATTAIN, to&#xD;
      facilitate identification of mental health problems and linkage to evidence-based care for&#xD;
      youth with ASD, and 3) conduct an open trial feasibility pilot test of ATTAIN in pediatric&#xD;
      primary care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This description is focused solely on the feasibility pilot test of ATTAIN in pediatric&#xD;
      primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3. Conduct an open trial feasibility pilot test of ATTAIN (directly informed by&#xD;
      adaptations identified earlier in the larger study) in pediatric primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providers: A total of 45 pediatric care providers and staff will be recruited for enrollment&#xD;
      from primary care practices in the region. This targeted sample size was chosen based on&#xD;
      sample sizes used within completed pilot studies focused on service interventions in&#xD;
      pediatric care. Each provider and healthcare staff member will be asked to use or support use&#xD;
      of ATTAIN with up to 5 eligible patients over four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families: Eligible pediatric patients must be: 1) English and/or Spanish-speaking, 2) between&#xD;
      4-16 years of age and 3) have a documented ASD diagnosis in the electronic health record.&#xD;
      After four months of ATTAIN use by their child's primary care provider, caregivers will be&#xD;
      contacted by the research team to be invited to complete an online survey about their child's&#xD;
      healthcare experiences over the past four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Leadership at each primary care organization will be approached about their primary&#xD;
      care practices participating in the pilot study. Primary care practices within each&#xD;
      organization will be purposively selected for targeted recruitment of providers for ATTAIN&#xD;
      implementation based on volume of patients with ASD. Members of the research team will&#xD;
      request an invitation to present at regularly scheduled staff meetings to recruit primary&#xD;
      care providers. Interested providers will be asked to complete a study interest form and&#xD;
      indicate preferred times to attend a group meeting to review study participation details, the&#xD;
      Study Information Sheet, and receive training in using the ATTAIN model. For some clinics,&#xD;
      leadership may prefer that the recruitment and training be conducted during the same meeting&#xD;
      for the purpose of reducing staff burden. At these meetings, the research team will provide a&#xD;
      meal and refreshments. Subsequently, trained providers will be asked to use ATTAIN with up to&#xD;
      5 eligible patients during any outpatient appointment (e.g., annual check-ups, drop-in&#xD;
      appointments) to maximize early detection of mental health problems and opportunity to link&#xD;
      to mental health services. Throughout the 4 months, we may ask providers and supporting staff&#xD;
      to elaborate on their experiences using ATTAIN via e-mail or phone-call to understand&#xD;
      challenges to implementation, recommendations for improving implementation or adaptations in&#xD;
      implementing the ATTAIN model in their clinic. Time to complete these brief reflections will&#xD;
      take no more than 5-10 minutes each. Quantitative data of ATTAIN use will be extracted from&#xD;
      patient charts and de-identified data will be sent to the research team during the four month&#xD;
      study period and at the end of 4 months. After 4 months of ATTAIN delivery, participating&#xD;
      providers and caregivers of youth with ASD with whom providers used ATTAIN will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a brief online survey regarding their experiences using ATTAIN. Providers and staff&#xD;
      will be asked to attend a meeting, where food and light refreshments will be provided, to&#xD;
      complete the survey. In addition, providers and staff will be invited to participate in a&#xD;
      post-study interview that will be offered to be completed by phone or in-person. Caregivers&#xD;
      will receive $20 for survey completion. The ATTAIN model was developed to be embedded within&#xD;
      routine primary care settings and workflow so there are minimal risks to primary care&#xD;
      providers, caregivers or children associated with participation.&#xD;

    <description>The Perceived Characteristics of Intervention Scale (PCIS) will be used to examine providers' and staff's perspectives regarding feasibility and acceptability of ATTAIN. The PCIS is a 20-item scale that assesses attitudes towards a specific intervention including relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they agree with each item on a 5-point Likert scale. Example items include, &quot;The ATTAIN model is clear and understandable&quot; and &quot;Using the ATTAIN model fits well with the way I like to work.&quot;</description>
