  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Persons living with chronic conditions often have decreased ability to perform&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living (ADL) tasks, stressing a need to develop and evaluate intervention&#xD;
      programs addressing decreased ADL ability. Guided by the British Medical Research Council's&#xD;
      guidance (MRC) on how to develop and evaluate complex interventions, the program &quot;A Better&#xD;
      everyday LifE&quot; (ABLE), a home-based intervention program, was developed and feasibility&#xD;
      tested. The current phase concerns a full-scale evaluation of the ABLE program including&#xD;
      evaluation of effectiveness, processes and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: The design involves a randomized controlled trial, initiated with an&#xD;
      internal pilot. The study will include eighty (n=80) home dwelling persons living with&#xD;
      chronic conditions, experiencing problems performing ADL. Participants are randomized to&#xD;
      either intervention (ABLE) or control (usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary outcomes are self-reported ADL ability measured using ADL-Questionnaire (ADL-Q)&#xD;
      and observed ADL motor ability measured using Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are perceived satisfaction with ADL task performance measured using ADL-Q;&#xD;
      observed ADL process ability measured using AMPS; and Goal Attainment measured using&#xD;
      Goal-Attainment-Scaling (GAS). Data is collected at baseline, post intervention and six&#xD;
      months after baseline. Process evaluation data are collected using registration forms and&#xD;
      semi-structured qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The economic evaluation will be performed from a health care sector perspective with 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up. Costs will be estimated based on micro costing and national registries. Effects&#xD;
      will be Quality Adjusted Life Years and changes in AMPS ADL ability.&#xD;

      Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the study was truncated on March 11th 2020. Data collected at&#xD;
      this time was assessed to be sufficient to answer most pilot study questions, and it was&#xD;
      decided to turn the internal pilot into an external pilot. Based on the results of the&#xD;
      external pilot, a few adjustments on outcome measurements, inclusion criteria and extraction&#xD;
      of information on usual care were applied, before initiation of the full scale trial. Hence&#xD;
      ADL-I replaced ADL-Q as primary outcome measurement. Data collection for full scale trial was&#xD;
      initiated August 1st 2020.&#xD;
