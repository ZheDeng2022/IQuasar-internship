  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiogenic shock (CS) is the most severe form of acute heart failure. Data on epidemiology&#xD;
      of CS have been drawn from previously published registries focussing on acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome (ACS) and myocardial infarction (AMI). Indeed, CS occurs in 5-7% of patients&#xD;
      presenting with ACS and ACS has been reported as the most prevalent cause of CS, accounting&#xD;
      for about 80% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, recent evidences in a contemporary cohort in North America have shown that more than&#xD;
      two-thirds of all cardiogenic shock cases were related to causes other than AMI and that&#xD;
      these patients had outcomes at least as poor as patients with AMI-CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high short-term mortality of these patients and the need for developing dedicated&#xD;
      cardiac shock centres and systems of care to time our interventions, it is of utmost&#xD;
      importance to achieve a better clinical phenotyping of the heterogeneous causes and&#xD;
      presentations of CS patients and carefully perform research outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the Altshock-2 registry will represent a unique opportunity to evaluate the full&#xD;
      spectrum of CS admitted in Intensive Coronary Care Units and to collect a selected number of&#xD;
      variables related to aetiology, clinical presentation, ongoing pharmacological treatments,&#xD;
      use of mechanical support devices and outcome.&#xD;

        All consecutive CS patients hospitalized in the above reported centres between January 2020&#xD;
        and December 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiogenic shock is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt;60 mmHg, after&#xD;
             an appropriate fluid challenge if there is no sign of overt fluid overload, OR need of&#xD;
             vasoactive agents to maintain SBP &gt; 90 mmHg or MAP &gt; 60 mmHg, OR need of MCS;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least one of the following criteria/signs of overt hypoperfusion: mixed venous&#xD;
             oxygen saturation &lt;60%; arterial lactates &gt; 2 mmol/L; oliguria &lt; 0.5 ml/Kg/h for at&#xD;
             least 6 hours.&#xD;
