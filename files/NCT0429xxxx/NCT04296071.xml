  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a serious complication,&#xD;
      often prolonging the length of stay in ICU and potentially dealing to mortality. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the mechanism of CPB-mediated acute lung injury in&#xD;
      pediatric patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) is frequently associated with the use of extracorporeal circulation&#xD;
      during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and develops postoperatively in 2-3% of cardiac&#xD;
      surgical patients. Histological evidence shows that CPB increases pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      permeability and extravascular lung water content while diminishing pulmonary compliance.&#xD;
      Furthermore, some patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, which has a&#xD;
      mortality rate of 50-70%. Recruitment of intrapulmonary neutrophils is a characteristic of&#xD;
      ALI following CPB. Blood contact with non-physiological surfaces, cooling and rewarming and&#xD;
      mechanical shear stress activate neutrophils. The recruitment of activated neutrophils from&#xD;
      blood vessels to local tissue involves a chain of well-coordinated events, including&#xD;
      adhesion, tethering, rolling and crawling, followed by trans-endothelial and trans-epithelial&#xD;
      migration. Activation of sequestered neutrophils causes the release of specific proteolytic&#xD;
      enzymes and oxygen free radicals, which leads to increased alveolar-endothelial permeability&#xD;
      and parenchymal damage. During CPB, the lungs are almost completely excluded from the&#xD;
      systemic circulation, which causes the blood within them to be almost 'static'. Pulmonary&#xD;
      tissue hypoxia and re-oxygenation combined with vascular ischemia and reperfusion induce the&#xD;
      generation of chemokines, which contributes to subsequent injury by accumulating and&#xD;
      entrapping activated neutrophils. The accumuled and entrapped activated neutrophils in the&#xD;
      lungs and the subsequent release of toxic substances render the lungs highly susceptible to&#xD;
      this damage. However, the mechanism that drives neutrophil migration to the lungs after CPB&#xD;
      is not well studied. This study will delineate the mechanisms of neutrophil migration to the&#xD;
      lung and subsequent lung injury after CPB.&#xD;

        We will enroll patients &lt; 12 months of age who undergo CPB surgery. This patient population&#xD;
        is associated with the highest incidence of morbidity and mortality following cardiac&#xD;
        surgery, due to often prolonged period of CPB. Patients will be categorized into two&#xD;
        groups: Group 1: patients who tend to have longer CPB (&gt; 3 h), (ASO, Stage 1, IAA repair,&#xD;
        Truncus repair, TAPVR) and Group 2: Patients who have shorter CPB (&lt; 3hrs VSD, TOF, ASD).&#xD;
