    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is recognized as a major problem for patients with psychosis and is seen in&#xD;
      nearly all patients admitted in acute crisis to a psychiatric hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral treatment is recommended as first-line treatment for insomnia in&#xD;
      national and international guidelines. This study explores effect of adapting the milieu&#xD;
      therapy to comply with the principles of CBT for insomnia. Our aim is to rethink our day to&#xD;
      day psychological interventions and our around the clock milieu therapy for patients with&#xD;
      acute and severe mental illness in light of established knowledge on how sleep is obtained&#xD;
      and maintained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent among patients admitted to any hospital ward, but in&#xD;
      particular in psychiatric patients where insomnia and poor sleep quality is a major clinical&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 950 patients are admitted to The Acute Psychiatric Department at Oslo&#xD;
      University each year. The majority of the patients (approximately 450) admitted for more than&#xD;
      48 hours have a severe psychotic disorder and after being evaluated by a psychiatrist upon&#xD;
      admittance, they are allocated to one of three similar wards specialized in the treatment of&#xD;
      psychosis. A majority of the patients experience sleep difficulties both in terms of insomnia&#xD;
      and problems regulating circadian rhythm. Psychiatric wards in general offer several&#xD;
      challenges to sleep, including limited access to natural daylight, noisy environment and&#xD;
      frequent observations by staff during night for risk management purposes. A part from&#xD;
      offering medication which the patient often declines, staff members possess little means as&#xD;
      to how to cope with noise and agitation at night time due to frustrated patients unable to&#xD;
      find rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In September 2019 our department started organizing the treatment for psychotic patients in&#xD;
      three similar wards (&quot;psychosis wards&quot;) and patients were allocated to a ward according to&#xD;
      their date of birth. Nurses are stationed permanently at each ward, while psychiatrist and&#xD;
      psychologists make up a &quot;specialist pool&quot; serving all three psychosis wards. One of the main&#xD;
      intentions for organizing the department and treatment this way is to ensure that all&#xD;
      patients with psychotic disorders receive the same treatment according to recommended&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to rethink our day to day psychological interventions and our around&#xD;
      the clock milieu therapy for our patients with acute and severe mental illness in light of&#xD;
      established knowledge on how sleep is obtained and maintained. After making physical&#xD;
      adjustments to the ward environment and training allocated nurses in modified CBT techniques,&#xD;
      the AkuSleep intervention will start up in March 2020 and will be carried out for up to six&#xD;
      months. All patients admitted one of the psychosis wards will be offered the same customized&#xD;
      treatment focusing on sleep, whereas all the patients admitted to the other two psychosis&#xD;
      wards will receive treatment as usual (TAU). Upon discharge, all patients admitted to the&#xD;
      Department of Acute Psychiatry who are able to give informed consent are asked to give a&#xD;
      broad consent allowing us to systemize clinical information from hospital records for&#xD;
      research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AkuSleep protocol is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify the nature of the patient's sleeping problems and discuss suitable adjustments&#xD;
           with the patient. These adjustments would typically be to focus on circadian rhythm,&#xD;
           such as getting up in the morning at set times, avoiding coffee and strenuous physical&#xD;
           and emotional activities at night time, avoiding staying in bed when sleep is not&#xD;
           achieved and optimizing light/dark exposure. An acute ward setting such as ours is often&#xD;
           noisy and many of our patients have restrictions due to security reasons which limit the&#xD;
           access to natural day light. Simple physical measures will be implemented such as&#xD;
           providing ear plugs, providing night lamps so that staff don't need to turn on lights on&#xD;
           rounds, secure speakers so that the patients may listen to soothing music, easy blinds&#xD;
           to secure a dark room at night and bean bags (or chairs) in every room so that the&#xD;
           patient can get out of bed when sleep is not achieved. The use of daylight lamps will be&#xD;
           offered for patients who due to security reasons or otherwise are denied access to&#xD;
           natural daylight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trained nurses will perform a short 20 minute daily session with the patient addressing&#xD;
           tailored measures in accordance with the modified CBT for insomnia. Assessment of the&#xD;
           individual patient's specific sleeping problems is vital for an effective treatment.&#xD;
           Sleeping problems/disorders typically falls in to three categories; disturbance in the&#xD;
           sleep/wake homeostasis, disturbance in the circadian rhythm and/or hyperarousal.&#xD;
           Detecting the nature of the sleeping disorder, maintenance factors and individual goals&#xD;
           for treatment will give way to a sleep-focused case formulation that will guide further&#xD;
           strategies. The use of sleep and activity monitoring devices will be offered for those&#xD;
           who find it useful. Information from monitoring devices will be used for the purpose&#xD;
           psychoeducation and as basis for the sleep diary and relevant information will be&#xD;
           registered in the clinical records. Data from monitoring devices will not be stored&#xD;
           electronically. Intentions available for the patient and therapist are gathered from CBT&#xD;
           for insomnia and will involve establishing a firm associations between bed and sleep&#xD;
           through the use of stimulus control and the setting of a consistent sleep window (time&#xD;
           spent in bed); activity scheduling to promote good wake-up routines and help build up&#xD;
           necessary sleep pressure; targeting hyperarousal through systematic wind-down&#xD;
           strategies, relaxation training etc. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and&#xD;
           delusions are also prone to give disturbance in the ability to either getting to or&#xD;
           staying asleep. These symptoms will be incorporated in the specific formulation for&#xD;
           treatment and management of the symptoms will be a part of later strategies promoting&#xD;
           good sleep hygiene. The implemented measures will be monitored and evaluated throughout&#xD;
           the whole period so that adjustments can be made on a daily basis and in accordance with&#xD;
           the formulation and the patient's goals. The details of the individual treatment&#xD;
           progress will be written in a patient owned workbook, giving all trained staff members&#xD;
           an opportunity to step in at any time to continue the therapeutic work. The workbook&#xD;
           will be given to the patient at their time of discharge with instructions of further&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teaching of the nursing staff will cover topics to enable them to give psychoeducation&#xD;
      about the function and the architecture of sleep, to assess sleep quality and disturbance and&#xD;
      to create a case formulation. Nursing staff will be trained in specific cognitive techniques&#xD;
      that target night time worries and the handling of hallucinations/voices. The interventions&#xD;
      will be manualized, securing equality in treatment for all patients. A clinical psychologist&#xD;
      with CBT training, stationed at the ward, will take part in the initial assessment and will&#xD;
      offer support in the creating the case formulation. The standardized evaluation using symptom&#xD;
      checklists and sleep checklists will also be conducted by the psychologist or doctor in&#xD;
      charge. Supervision will be given in groups led by a clinical psychologist on a weekly basis&#xD;
      as well as ad hoc troubleshooting and problem solving on a daily basis. The individual&#xD;
      treatment will include an activity plan for each patient prepared in close collaboration with&#xD;
      our wards occupational therapist concerning. This will involve good wake up routines and&#xD;
      winding down-routines, light exposure to reestablish circadian rhythm and activating&#xD;
      activities to counteract the need for daytime naps that disturbs the build-up of sleep&#xD;
      pressure. Much of the described measures are already part our established inpatient nursing&#xD;
      services or &quot;treatment as usual&quot;. The focus of our project, however, will be to systemize&#xD;
      these interventions in light of a 24 hour cycle aimed specifically to target the promotion of&#xD;
      good sleep. Before discharge, the psychologist or doctor in charge will conduct a&#xD;
      reevaluation using symptom checklist as well as an interview focusing on lessons learned and&#xD;
      tool acquired by our patients struggling with chronic sleep disturbances in how to cope with&#xD;
      these challenges after their discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients on all three psychosis wards will receive standard evidence based treatment for&#xD;
      psychosis and affective disorders as per today. All patients on the two wards not receiving&#xD;
      the treatment protocol will also be offered to wear a monitoring device on order to register&#xD;
      potential sleep disturbances. All patients who choose to wear a monitoring device, will be&#xD;
      offered a psychoeducative session with a psychologist trained in CBT upon discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be the quantity and quality of sleep as measured by clinical records on&#xD;
      sleep duration, sleep onset, number of awakenings, bed time, rise time and medication used.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be symptom load as measured by clinical records of nursing category&#xD;
      (PK) and Brøset Violence Checklist (BVC), symptom measurements for psychosis (PANSS), for&#xD;
      mania (YMRS) and global assessment of function (GAF). In addition daily dosage of medication&#xD;
      such as antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines and sleep inducing medication, as&#xD;
      well as registered aggressive events will be measured. In most cases the patient is admitted&#xD;
      involuntary and time until their legal status is changed from involuntary to voluntary will&#xD;
      be calculated as a measurement of insight and health improvement. Finally, average number of&#xD;
      bed days, ward level of violence and wards cost of medication for the three wards will be&#xD;
      calculated and compared for all patients admitted during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to an acute psychiatric ward are very often not able to give informed&#xD;
      consent upon admittance due to psychotic symptoms. Those who are able to give informed&#xD;
      consent upon discharge will be asked to sign a broad consent. For those patients who consent&#xD;
      upon discharge, data will be gathered for all patients on all three psychosis wards and&#xD;
      compared against each other. Aggregated and anonymized data will be gathered and compared&#xD;
      across the three wards. We have estimated that 90 (45+45) participants are required in order&#xD;
      to meet our aims. In order to provide an answer as to whether this treatment is cost&#xD;
      effective for the department by comparing total number of bed days, ward level of violence&#xD;
      and wards cost of medication, we have calculated that we need a larger sample size of&#xD;
      approximately 200 (100+100). We have implemented the broad consent at the Department of Acute&#xD;
      Psychiatry and based on our experience, only 30-40 % of the patients choose to or are able to&#xD;
      consent to research even when they are stable. We therefore expect that the intervention&#xD;
      period will go on for approximately 6 months in order to achieve the number needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the corona outbreak, the inclusion of patients for the AkuSleep study has been&#xD;
      postponed indefinitely. The ward that was dedicated to the intervention has been transformed&#xD;
      to a specialized unit treating psychiatric patients with either known COVID-19 or having&#xD;
      symptoms of COVID-19. The study will start including patients when the Norwegian Health&#xD;
      authorities have declared the outbreak to be under control and the ward is again offering&#xD;
      standard treatment to patients with psychotic disorders.&#xD;

Global assessment of function scores (GAF) are typically in the above 45 range.Categories 3 and 4 describe patients with a clear need of nursing assistance. GAF scores are above 35. There is a need for consecutive risk assessments. The patients in these categories have a limited understanding of their condition and their need for treatment and limited ability to take part in planning of treatment. Patients in categories 3 and 4 are typically in need of hospital treatment.
