  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      60% of hypopharyngeal cancers were locally advanced at the time of diagnosis. The standard&#xD;
      treatment was surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Compared with traditional surgery and&#xD;
      postoperative radiotherapy, induction chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy has a better&#xD;
      laryngeal retention rate without reducing the curative effect, and established an organ&#xD;
      function preservation treatment strategy. Induction chemotherapy can reduce tumor burden and&#xD;
      reduce distant metastases. At present, induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment for the laryngeal preservation in locally&#xD;
      advanced hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of a PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab combined with chemotherapy as induction therapy in&#xD;
      hypopharyngeal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study, planned to enroll 100 patients&#xD;
      with localized hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who are newly treated and could accept&#xD;
      radical treatment. Patients would be treated with toripalimab combined with docetaxel and&#xD;
      cisplatin for two cycles. After the induction chemotherapy is completed, the investigator&#xD;
      choose appropriate radical treatment (surgery or chemoradiotherapy) based on tumor&#xD;
      evaluation. The primary endpoint is overall objective rate (ORR), the second endpoint include&#xD;
      major pathologic response (MPR), 2-year DFS for surgery patients, 2-year PFS for radiotherapy&#xD;
      patients, OS and QOL.&#xD;
