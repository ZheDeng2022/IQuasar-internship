  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined&#xD;
      with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after progression&#xD;
      on first line systemic therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation induced&#xD;
      activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation&#xD;
      of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell&#xD;
      regulatory signaling. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of cryoablation combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients in advanced intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
