  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if treatment with one chemotherapy medication&#xD;
      combined with immune therapy (pembrolizumab) is tolerable and effective for patients with&#xD;
      lung cancer and performance status of 2 (PS2), which means you have limitations in carrying&#xD;
      out certain activities or spend up to half of your day resting.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must be &gt;18 years old at time of diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG PS 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinical staging of IIIc or IV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4A. For patients with stage IIIc disease, patients are ineligible for or refuse standard&#xD;
        treatment with platinum-double chemotherapy and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4B. For patients with stage IV disease, platinum doublet chemotherapy is not appropriate,&#xD;
        deemed unsafe by the treating physician, or declined by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        4C. Screening lab work must meet the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4Ca. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
        4Cb. Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
        4Cc. CrCl&gt;50 (if pemetrexed is to be offered)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4Cd. AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        4D. Patients with small, asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        4E. Women of childbearing potential must be negative for pregnancy testing (urine or blood)&#xD;
        and agree to use effective contraception. Viable contraception should be used after trial&#xD;
        screening, before initiation of chemotherapy, and throughout the duration of active&#xD;
        treatment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than medical reasons): -Amenorrheic &gt;2&#xD;
        years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amenorrheic for &lt;2 years and a follicle-stimulating hormone value in the&#xD;
             postmenopausal range upon pre-study (screening) evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Otherwise the patient must be&#xD;
             willing to use 2 adequate barrier methods throughout the study, starting with the&#xD;
             screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
             4F.Participants must read or be read and explained the purposes of the study and sign&#xD;
             a statement of informed consent prior to participation. Those who do not read or&#xD;
             understand English are eligible and may be consented according to institutional&#xD;
             regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with history of autoimmune conditions with the following exceptions, which&#xD;
             are allowed: alopecia, vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis,&#xD;
             Hashimoto's thyroiditis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients on immunosuppressive medication, including steroids (if doses exceed&#xD;
             equivalent of prednisone 10 mg daily). Short courses of steroids which are&#xD;
             discontinued prior to start of treatment are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal systemic diseases that would preclude&#xD;
             use of chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy per the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient must not be on any clinical trials involving other experimental therapies&#xD;
             during study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women who are currently pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with any other concurrent medical or psychiatric condition that were deemed&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into the study per the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Symptomatic, untreated brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases may be&#xD;
             considered eligible after completion of radiation if steroids have been tapered to&#xD;
             less than equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active infection requiring IV antibiotics&#xD;
