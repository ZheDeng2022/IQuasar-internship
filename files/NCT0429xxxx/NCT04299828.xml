  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to prospectively collect data from a series of 100 patients (all&#xD;
      ages) undergoing complex cardiac surgical procedures involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure the number of blood activated circulating monocytes before, during and after&#xD;
           cardiac surgery and serum GABA and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understand the correlation between GABA and inflammatory cytokines (and/or activated&#xD;
           monocytes) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the correlation between thrombosis and monocyte activation in patients undergoing&#xD;
           cardiac surgery under CPB and at risk of thrombosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Often when people undergo heart surgery, they are placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).&#xD;
      Sometimes clotting of the blood occurs during and after heart surgery with CPB, which can&#xD;
      lead to multiple complications. In order to try to avoid abnormal/excessive clotting that may&#xD;
      lead to complications, it is important to understand the specific causes of why the blood&#xD;
      sometimes clots abnormally during and after heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, tests looking at how the blood clots (coagulation assessment) are usually&#xD;
      performed as standard laboratory testing during and after surgery. However, these tests are&#xD;
      not able to predict the future development of abnormal clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be looking at the role that immune cells (monocytes) have in the formation of&#xD;
      abnormal clots after heart surgery. It is possible that these immune cells produce signals&#xD;
      that can contribute to the formation of clots. Using experimental tests (monocyte analysis&#xD;
      and mediator analysis), the hope is to understand if these cells participate in forming&#xD;
      abnormal clots in any meaningful way. Although these tests are not yet approved for use in&#xD;
      children, this study plans to use these new methods to understand this phenomenon by&#xD;
      analyzing the blood at different times during the surgery and recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the purpose of this study is to look at these tests in people undergoing heart&#xD;
      surgery to help the investigators understand why the blood sometimes forms clots abnormally.&#xD;
      Results from this study may help treat future patients who experience abnormal clotting&#xD;
      during and after surgery.&#xD;
