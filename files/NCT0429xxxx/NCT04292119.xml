      This research study is evaluating Lorlatinib in combination with Crizotinib, Binimetinib, or&#xD;
      TNO155 as a possible treatment for either anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lung&#xD;
      cancer or ROS1-positive lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves four study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lorlatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binimetinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crizotinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TNO155&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial of three investigational combinations for treatment of&#xD;
      either anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive or ROS1-positive lung cancer. The three drug&#xD;
      combinations being tested are (1) Lorlatinib combined with Crizotinib and (2) Lorlatinib&#xD;
      combined with Binimetinib and (3) Lorlatinib combined with TNO155.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lorlatinib is an oral ALK and ROS1 inhibitor. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
           has approved Lorlatinib for treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. The FDA has not&#xD;
           approved Lorlatinib for treatment of ROS1-positive lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crizotinib is an oral ALK and MET inhibitor. The FDA has approved Crizotinib for&#xD;
           treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. Crizotinib is not approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
           treatment of MET-positive lung cancer. This study will test crizotinib's ability to&#xD;
           block MET signaling. Crizotinib is not approved by the FDA for treatment of&#xD;
           ROS1-positive lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binimetinib is an oral MEK inhibitor. The FDA has not approved binimetinib for treatment&#xD;
           of ALK-positive or ROS1-positive lung cancer but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TNO155 is an oral SHP2 inhibitor. The FDA has not approved TNO155 for the treatment of&#xD;
           any disease, including ALK-positive or ROS1-positive lung cancer. It is an&#xD;
           investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA has not approved the combination of Lorlatinib with Binimetinib, Crizotinib, or&#xD;
           TNO155 as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment which&#xD;
      will include evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo screening and those who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
           assigned to receive either the combination of Lorlatinib and Crizotinib, the combination&#xD;
           of Lorlatinib and Binimetinib, or the combination of Lorlatinib and TNO155. Patients&#xD;
           with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive lung cancer who have extra copies of the MET growth&#xD;
           signal (MET amplification) will be assigned to receive the Lorlatinib and Crizotinib&#xD;
           combination. All other patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the&#xD;
           combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study consists of 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The investigators are looking to determine whether combining Lorlatinib with&#xD;
                     either Binimetinib, Crizotinib, or TNO155 is well tolerated and to understand&#xD;
                     how treatment with the two drugs affects cancer cells and impacts growth&#xD;
                     signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same&#xD;
                     dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of&#xD;
                     participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose&#xD;
                     was tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The Phase II study will test the safest doses of the combinations (as&#xD;
                     established in the Phase I study) in a larger group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  It is expected that about 96 people will take part in this research study&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic non-small cell lung&#xD;
             cancer (Stage IV, AJCC v7.0) that carries an ALK or ROS1 rearrangement (ROS1-positive&#xD;
             patients will only be allowed in dose escalation) as determined using a local&#xD;
             diagnostic test or a commercial test or by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
             (FDA)-approved FISH test, using Vysis® ALK Break apart FISH Probe, or the Ventana®&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease progression or intolerance to at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Previously irradiated&#xD;
             lesions are not measurable unless the lesion has demonstrated clear progression after&#xD;
             radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to undergo serial biopsies and have disease accessible to&#xD;
             pretreatment biopsy. A cell block from a pleural effusion or ascites may be&#xD;
             substituted for a core biopsy. In select cases, patients may be allowed to enroll&#xD;
             without a pre-treatment biopsy and/or continue treatment without an on-treatment&#xD;
             biopsy after speaking with the Overall Principal Investigator if performing the biopsy&#xD;
             is technically challenging, poses significant risk to the patient, or may result in&#xD;
             significant discomfort. If a pre-treatment biopsy is not performed, archival tissue&#xD;
             will be used for correlative studies, specifically plasma-tissue comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication. Does not have any&#xD;
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as malabsorption syndrome&#xD;
             or major resection of the stomach or small bowel that may alter absorption of the&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum washout period of 5 days or 5 half-lives between the last dose of tyrosine&#xD;
             kinase inhibitor therapy and the first dose of study treatment is required (whichever&#xD;
             is shorter). A shorter washout period may be considered in the event of disease flare,&#xD;
             after discussion with the Overall Principal Investigator. No washout is required if&#xD;
             the most recent anti-neoplastic therapy is lorlatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from treatment toxicities to ≤ Grade 1 or to their&#xD;
             pretreatment levels except for adverse events that in the investigator's judgment do&#xD;
             not constitute a safety risk for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can either be chemotherapy-naive or have received chemotherapy for&#xD;
             locally-advanced or metastatic disease. Acute effects of therapy must have resolved to&#xD;
             baseline severity or to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for adverse events that in the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment do not constitute a safety risk for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovery from effects of any major surgery or significant traumatic injury at least 28&#xD;
             days before the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For all women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be obtained at&#xD;
             the baseline visit before starting study treatment. For women who are not&#xD;
             postmenopausal (≥ 12 months of non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile&#xD;
             (absence of ovaries and/or uterus): agreement to remain abstinent or use two adequate&#xD;
             methods of contraception, including at least one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%&#xD;
             per year, during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                  methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of&#xD;
                  combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine&#xD;
                  devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom&#xD;
                  and a cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt;1% per year.&#xD;
                  Barrier methods must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent or use a barrier method of contraception (e.g.,&#xD;
             condom) during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this same period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men with a pregnant partner must agree to remain abstinent or use a condom for the&#xD;
             duration of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated, controlled asymptomatic CNS lesions are permitted to enroll&#xD;
             aslong as the CNS was not a site of progressive disease on lorlatinib monotherapy. If&#xD;
             the CNS was a site of progressive disease on lorlatinib monotherapy, treatment of CNS&#xD;
             lesions is required for enrollment. If CNS lesions are resected, a washout period of&#xD;
             at least 28 days is required. This period may be shortened to 14 days with Overall PI&#xD;
             approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of seizure prophylaxis is allowed as long as patients are taking non-enzyme&#xD;
             inducing anti-epileptic drugs (non-EIAED). If patients were previously on EIAEDs and&#xD;
             these have been discontinued, they must have been discontinued for at least 7 days&#xD;
             prior to treatment start. If patients require an anti-epileptic medication, then a&#xD;
             CYP3A4 non-EIAED can be used such as levetiracetam, valproic acid, gabapentin,&#xD;
             topiramate or lacosamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring steroids for control of CNS metastases must be at a stable or&#xD;
             decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with asymptomatic leptomeningeal disease are eligible for participation in&#xD;
             this trial. However, patients who had progression of leptomeningeal disease on&#xD;
             lorlatinib will be required to undergo CNS radiation to meet eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 3 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 1 week prior&#xD;
             to study entry and/or during study participation. If the half-life of the&#xD;
             investigational drug is known, then a period of 5 half-lives is required (or 1 week&#xD;
             whichever is shorter) is required between discontinuing the investigational drug and&#xD;
             starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy (except palliative to relieve bone pain) within 7 days of study&#xD;
             entry. Palliative radiation (≤ 10 fractions) must have been completed at least 48&#xD;
             hours prior to study entry. Stereotactic or small field brain irradiation must have&#xD;
             been completed at least 48 hours prior to study entry. Whole brain radiation and&#xD;
             radiation for leptomeningeal metastasis must have been completed at least 7 days prior&#xD;
             to study entry. Acute effects of radiation must have resolved to baseline severity or&#xD;
             to CTCAE grade ≤1 except for adverse events that in the investigator's judgment do not&#xD;
             constitute a safety risk for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with predisposing characteristics for acute pancreatitis per the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment (e.g. uncontrolled hyperglycemia, current symptomatic&#xD;
             gallstone disease) in the 2 weeks prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to lorlatinib or any of its excipients. In addition,&#xD;
             subjects who are unable to tolerate the 50 mg dose of lorlatinib will not be permitted&#xD;
             to enroll unless doses of lorlatinib below the entry level are being investigated&#xD;
             (e.g. dose level -1) and they have previously tolerated lorlatinib monotherapy at the&#xD;
             dose being investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of extensive, disseminated, bilateral or presence of Grade 3 or 4 interstitial&#xD;
