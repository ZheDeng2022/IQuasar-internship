      The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability and evidence of&#xD;
      activity of 12 months oral treatment with TEFIDERA® in subjects with Geographic Atrophy&#xD;
      associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the&#xD;
      industrialized world. Approximately 80% of patients with AMD suffer from the dry form of the&#xD;
      disease also called geographic atrophy (GA) which is characterized by the progressive loss of&#xD;
      photoreceptors and RPE that are essential to the visual cycle. There is currently no therapy&#xD;
      to cure GA. This represent a major health problem with millions patients worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GA is a complex multifactorial disease influenced by: aging, environmental factors, genetic&#xD;
      predispositions, oxidative stress and inflammation. Oxidative stress is the major&#xD;
      environmental risk factor of developing AMD. Whereas inflammation, is now, recognized as one&#xD;
      of the main player in AMD pathophysiology. Therefore, antioxidant and immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapies are susceptible to be beneficial in humans for patients with GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dimethyl Fumarate activates the NRF2 pathway, which is the major transcription factor&#xD;
      regulating anti-oxidative enzymes production. Dimethyl Fumarate commercialized under the name&#xD;
      TECFIDERA® by BIOGEN is an effective antioxidant and immunosuppressive drug, used to treat&#xD;
      patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the Central Nervous System&#xD;
      leading to progressive disability. This new therapeutic agent may be easily repurposed to&#xD;
      treat GA patients and could reduce or slow photoreceptors and RPE degeneration and the&#xD;
      associated vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, open labelled trial we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      TECFIDERA®, in two groups of patients (treated vs. untreated) with GA. This is the first time&#xD;
      this strategy, based on evidences that oxidative stress and inflammation are central in GA&#xD;
      physiopathology, will be tested in patients with dry AMD.&#xD;
