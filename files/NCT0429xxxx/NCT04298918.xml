  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-part study is composed of two stages: a Phase Ib stage consisting of a&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase and an expansion phase; and a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, multicenter stage. The Phase Ib stage will assess the safety and tolerability,&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), and&#xD;
      evaluate the preliminary efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with venetoclax in&#xD;
      participants with previously treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive&#xD;
      unresectable locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC).&#xD;
      Additional patients may be enrolled in an expansion phase to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with venetoclax at RP2D in&#xD;
      patients with previously treated HER2-positive LABC or MBC who have previously received&#xD;
      either trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a). The Phase II randomized&#xD;
      stage will evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab&#xD;
      emtansine in combination with venetoclax at RP2D compared with trastuzumab emtansine plus&#xD;
      placebo in participants with previously treated HER2-positive LABC or MBC who have not&#xD;
      received prior trastuzumab emtansine therapy, either alone or in combination with other&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapies.&#xD;
