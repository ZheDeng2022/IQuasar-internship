      The need for antibiotics to reduce surgical site infection after cholecystectomy for acute&#xD;
      calculous cholecystitis is still controversial. The researchers aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of antibiotics prescribed on surgical site infection when discharged to patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute calculous cholecystitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment for acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC). In the&#xD;
      past, the timing of cholecystectomy has been the subject of debate. Early cholecystectomy&#xD;
      performed within 72 hours at the beginning of the disease is preferred to first medical&#xD;
      treatment and delayed cholecystectomy 6 to 10 weeks after recovery. In many studies, it&#xD;
      suggests early cholecystectomy because it provides a definitive solution, faster recovery&#xD;
      times, and more rapid return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity after&#xD;
      surgery. In the United States alone, more than 300,000 surgical field infections are seen&#xD;
      annually. Again, in the United States alone, the budget spent on surgical site infection&#xD;
      reaches $ 10 billion. Antibiotic treatment in ACC patients to prevent surgical site infection&#xD;
      is a standard practice in the hospital before and after surgery. However, there is&#xD;
      controversy over the use of antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection after discharge.&#xD;
      The researchers aimed to investigate the effect of antibiotics prescribed on surgical site&#xD;
      infection when discharged to patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acute&#xD;
      calculous cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Method Patients who were admitted to the General Surgery Clinic with the&#xD;
      diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis and who underwent early Laparoscopic&#xD;
      Cholecystectomy will be included in the study. Patients will be told in detail about the&#xD;
      study protocol, and those who accept it will be included in the study. A study consent form,&#xD;
      which is written and signed by patients in their handwriting, will be taken. The patients&#xD;
      will be staged as Stage 1,2,3 according to the TG13 criteria accepted at the Tokyo 2013&#xD;
      consensus. The anesthesiologist will make ASA classification. Oral intake of the patients&#xD;
      will be stopped, and parenteral fluid and anti biotherapy will be applied. The demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, comorbidities of the patients, will be recorded in their files, whether they&#xD;
      had previous ACC attacks. Patients will be operated within 12-72 hours after hospitalization.&#xD;
      Amoxycillin / sulbactam 1 g will be administered parenterally three times a day to patients&#xD;
      before and after surgery. Patients included in the post-operative study will be discharged&#xD;
      within three days at the latest if the complication has not developed. Just before discharge,&#xD;
      the clinical secretary will give a code to each patient with the help of a computer program,&#xD;
      and block randomization will be made and divided into two groups. Those who received oral&#xD;
      antibiotics (AB group) and those who did not receive antibiotics (HA group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of antibiotic therapy in ACC is to limit both systemic septic response&#xD;
      and local inflammation to prevent SSI in the superficial wound, fascia, and organ cavity. In&#xD;
      this study, ampicillin/sulbactam will be used according to the TG18 guidelines (according to&#xD;
      recommendation). If the patient is in the AB group, 1 g of ampicillin/sulbactam will be&#xD;
      prescribed two times a day and will use for a total of 5-7 days. All demographic features and&#xD;
      medical processes of the patients will be recorded electronically with the hospital medical&#xD;
      computer program (Deva Data Â®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If SSI is detected by clinical examination and other diagnostic methods (laboratory,&#xD;
      ultrasound, and tomography), the antibiotic regimen will be changed in the AB group, and&#xD;
      ampicillin/sulbactam will be started in the NA group. Also, superficial and deep SSI will&#xD;
      locally be drained, organ SSI will be drained by ultrasonography or tomography-guided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: As the reported rate of postoperative SSIs associated with ACC&#xD;
      varies between 1% and 15%, it was estimated that 102 patients per group would allow detecting&#xD;
      a 10% difference in the rate of complications with 80% power with a confidence interval of&#xD;
      5%. The estimated price of loss to follow-up was 10%; therefore, at least 112 patients were&#xD;
      needed to be enrolled for each group.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients discharged after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute Calculous Cholecystitis constitutes the study population. The patients discharged are randomized into two groups by the clinical secretary with the help of a computer program.&#xD;
Antibiotics are included in the prescription given to group 1 on the way home. The patient receives 1 gram of Ampicillin/sulbactam twice daily for 5-7 days at home.&#xD;
The patient, who was randomized to the second group, does not have antibiotics on his prescription.&#xD;
After the patients are discharged, they are called for weekly control for a month, and they are examined in terms of surgical site infection.&#xD;
The study reaches the result by making statistical analysis in terms of the rate of surgical site infection between both groups.</intervention_model_description>
