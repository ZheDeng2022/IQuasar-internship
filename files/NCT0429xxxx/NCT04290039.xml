      This randomized, three-sequence, three-period, phase 1 study is designed to assess the&#xD;
      bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of sublingually administered atropine sulfate&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, three-sequence, three-period crossover study to assess the&#xD;
      bioavailability and PK of a single dose of atropine administered sublingually in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers. At least 15 healthy male and female volunteers will be enrolled to obtain&#xD;
      approximately 12 evaluable subjects in the per protocol population. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of three treatment dosing sequences (A, B, or C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to treatment dosing sequence A will receive a low dose sublingually at&#xD;
      Visit 1; Day 1 (Period 1), a high dose sublingually at Visit 2; Day 8 (Period 2) and an IV&#xD;
      dose at Visit 3; Day 15 (Period 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to treatment dosing sequence B will receive a high dose sublingually at&#xD;
      Visit 1; Day 1 (Period 1), an IV dose at Visit 2; Day 8 (Period 2) and a low dose&#xD;
      sublingually at Visit 3; Day 15 (Period 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to treatment dosing sequence C will receive an IV dose at Visit 1; Day 1&#xD;
      (Period 1), a low dose sublingually at Visit 2; Day 8 (Period 2), and a high dose&#xD;
      sublingually at Visit 3; Day 15 (Period 3).&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Subjects with a known sensitivity or prior adverse reaction to atropine&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects cannot be rescreened for exclusionary laboratory test results. Potentially&#xD;
        exclusionary vital sign results may be repeated once. If a subject's repeat vitals remain&#xD;
        exclusionary or the investigator determines that the repeat vital signs could pose a risk&#xD;
        to the subject participating in the study, then the subject will be excluded.&#xD;

        <description>Blood samples to measure atropine plasma concentrations were collected during each dosing visit at the following time points: time 0 (predose), and postdose at 2, 4, 6, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, and 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours. PK parameters were estimated for each subject and period using the noncompartmental method for extravascular (for sublingual doses) or IV infusion routes of administration.&#xD;
AUC_∞ is summarized by study dosage as the geometric mean and coefficient of variation of the geometric mean for all evaluable participants and expressed as min*ng/mL. Geometric ratios of least-square means and associated 90% confidence intervals are reported from a linear mixed model.</description>

        <title>Xerostomia Assessment - Dryness of Tongue</title>
        <description>Subject reported xerostomia scores were collected during each dosing visit at the following time points: time 0 (predose), and postdose at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes. Scores were assessed by questionnaire (0-10 point scale, with 0 being not dry at all and 10 being very dry) previously validated for measurement of salivary gland dysfunction.&#xD;
The maximum xerostomia score representing dryness of tongue was calculated for each subject and dose. Maximum xerostomia scores were summarized by study dosage as the mean and standard deviation.</description>
