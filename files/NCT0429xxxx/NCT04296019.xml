    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, controled, multicenter, phase II clinical study evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of fruquintinib as a maintenance therapy following first-line treatment&#xD;
      for metastatic colorectal cancer. This study will include the patients with confirmed&#xD;
      unresectable metastatic left-sided colon cancer with RAS mutation or right-sided colon cancer&#xD;
      who achieved stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) via&#xD;
      palliative first-line treatment. It's expected to include 110 patients and they will be&#xD;
      randomly stratified at 2:1 into fruquintinib group and observation group based on whether&#xD;
      bevacizumab is used and the primary tumor site, using the Interactive Network Response System&#xD;
      (IWRS). The random No. corresponds to the respective patient. The enrollment time is expected&#xD;
      to be 18 months, followed up for 24 months.&#xD;
