    <textblock>
      My Baby, My Move+ (2019-2021) is a peer-led wellness intervention which aims to reduce&#xD;
      excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG) by targeting prenatal physical activity, mood, and&#xD;
      sleep quality. Up to 50% of pregnant women in the U.S. gain weight in excess of the Institute&#xD;
      of Medicine guidelines. EGWG leads to poor maternal and child outcomes. It also sets the&#xD;
      stage for long-term overweight/obesity for both mother and child. The MBMM+ intervention is&#xD;
      an example of a theoretically-based prenatal physical activity intervention that targets&#xD;
      these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 pregnant women (50 intervention arm, 50 control arm) will be recruited from the&#xD;
      University of Colorado Clinics. Women in the intervention arm will participate in the 12-week&#xD;
      MBMM+ intervention. Leiferman and her team propose to develop and test the feasibility and&#xD;
      sustainability of the MBMM+ intervention to instill good healthy habits (e.g., prenatal&#xD;
      physical activity, good sleep hygiene, stress management) during and beyond pregnancy.&#xD;
      Findings from this study will be used to inform a future, large randomized trial.&#xD;

      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MBMM+ intervention is designed to promote the engagement in physical activity and takes&#xD;
      into account barriers among pregnant women cited in our formative work such as lack of&#xD;
      knowledge and skills, body changes and discomfort, feeling limited, and lack of social&#xD;
      support. Uniquely, the MBMM+ program also targets sleep hygiene and mood to further support&#xD;
      regular physical activity engagement. Over the years of working with pregnant women, we have&#xD;
      observed that once women notice how their regular physical activity helps their mood and&#xD;
      sleep patterns they are often more likely to continue engaging in regular physical activity.&#xD;
      During the first four weeks of the MBMM+ program, participants will receive electronic&#xD;
      informational handouts covering topics on weight management (content will be based in part on&#xD;
      Co-I Downs' Healthy Mom Zone intervention such as informing on benefits and guidelines of&#xD;
      healthy GWG, tips on healthy eating, energy balance, and sleep quality) as well as the&#xD;
      benefits and safety concerns related to prenatal physical activity. Starting week 5 of the&#xD;
      12-week intervention, participants will attend two in-person, group physical activity&#xD;
      sessions per week with each session lasting approximately 60 minutes and will be held at a&#xD;
      local community center located close to the recruitment clinics. Sessions will be held on&#xD;
      weekday evenings and weekend mornings as these times were preferred by pregnant women. Given&#xD;
      that pregnant women often express a lack of knowledge about safe physical activities during&#xD;
      pregnancy, preventing them from engaging in physical activity, each session will include both&#xD;
      didactic and experiential components to increase knowledge and skill building. Sessions will&#xD;
      begin with a didactic component covering overcoming barriers to physical activity, goal&#xD;
      setting, self-monitoring, problem solving, topics related to mood (stress management,&#xD;
      family/work balance, wellness wheel), sleep hygiene (setting routines, avoiding stimulants,&#xD;
      environmental supports), and additional physical activity topics (e.g., managing physical&#xD;
      activity in postpartum, overcoming relapses). Participants will be given educational&#xD;
      materials in print and electronic form based on their preferences. The experiential component&#xD;
      (i.e., physical activity) will be 30 minutes in duration and involve primarily walking, at a&#xD;
      moderate intensity, based on national recommendations coupled with yoga. Our formative work&#xD;
      suggests that mothers prefer walking and find it more enjoyable in the form of groups. We&#xD;
      have chosen to also include yoga to provide options for ways to be active that also&#xD;
      positively impact sleep and mood and pregnant women report desiring prenatal yoga. All&#xD;
      walking sessions will be facilitated by the peer leaders. The yoga sessions will be taught by&#xD;
      an experienced prenatal yoga instructor residing in Denver, CO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will have 3-4 peer leaders to help facilitate and model the physical activity&#xD;
      component (i.e., will accompany women during their walking and yoga sessions to provide&#xD;
      support and ensure safety (e.g., correct postures during yoga, monitoring exercise intensity&#xD;
      and symptoms during walking sessions). Our MBMM formative work and expertise in&#xD;
      community-based physical activity interventions suggests participants prefer peer group&#xD;
      leaders because they foster a sense of community and social support within the group setting.&#xD;
      Peer leaders will be compensated for their time working with the MBMM+ program and will be&#xD;
      peer mothers from the community who are recent mothers (&lt; two years postpartum) who&#xD;
      successfully engaged in regular physical activity during a previous pregnancy. Peer leaders&#xD;
      will be identified by our research team, recreation center directors, and health care&#xD;
      provider partners. At the end of every session, participants will check in with an assigned&#xD;
      peer leader to discuss in small groups their weekly logs. Peer leaders will note the&#xD;
      discussions that occurred amongst the participants in their group, describe barriers that&#xD;
      were identified, problem-solving strategies that were suggested and used, and future&#xD;
      goals/recommended action steps. This group work will help participants to learn ways to fit&#xD;
      physical activity into their lifestyle and overcome barriers by receiving feedback from their&#xD;
      peer leader and other group members. It will also ensure that the intervention is conducted&#xD;
      and received in the way intended as the peer leaders and program manager/PI will review these&#xD;
      small group progress notes each week and monitor intervention delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer leader training and fidelity: Weekly, the research team (PI/program manager) will have&#xD;
      phone calls and/or in-person meetings with the group peer leaders to debrief and address any&#xD;
      issues that may arise. The program manager and/or PI will be on-site for all sessions to&#xD;
      ensure quality control of intervention delivery and data collection efforts by peer leaders.&#xD;
      The PI will conduct a training session before the onset of the intervention with the peer&#xD;
      group leaders to cover topics including how to engage in safe and effective physical activity&#xD;
      during pregnancy, an overview of behavioral change theory and the behavioral skills that the&#xD;
      intervention is targeting, ways to garner social support and leadership skills. The PI has&#xD;
      been extensively trained by the Cooper Institute in Prenatal-Postnatal Physical Activity. The&#xD;
      yoga instructor will have been extensively trained in prenatal yoga.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women randomized to the control group will complete a similarly structured 12-week program;&#xD;
      electronic materials related to various prenatal topics including preparation for birth,&#xD;
      birthing options, and responsive parenting will be distributed twice a week for the first&#xD;
      4-weeks of the program. Starting week 5 of the 12-week intervention, participants will attend&#xD;
      two in-person, group sessions per week with each session lasting approximately 60 minutes and&#xD;
      will be held at a local community center located close to the recruitment clinics. Sessions&#xD;
      will be held on weekday evenings and weekend mornings as these times were preferred by&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
