      This is a single arm, phase II study. Advanced BTC patients who have been previously treated&#xD;
      with immunotherapy in either the 2nd or 3rd line will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with AZD6738 and Durvalumab combination.&#xD;

      One cycle consists of 4weeks. Response evaluation will be done every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles)&#xD;
      of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tumor biopsy is mandatory: screening, after 8weeks (1st-response evaluation), at disease&#xD;
           progression (PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. blood sampling for biomarker study is mandatory: every cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the metabolic changes by AZD6738 and Durvalumab combination : 18 F-FDG PET&#xD;
