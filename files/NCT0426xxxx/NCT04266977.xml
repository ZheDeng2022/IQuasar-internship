      The administration of steroids, most commonly dexamethasone (DEX), has established as&#xD;
      standard of care during treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) and is widely used during the entire&#xD;
      course of the disease including pre- and postoperative management, chemo- and radiotherapy.&#xD;
      The primary purpose is to reduce tumor-associated vasogenic edema and to prevent or treat&#xD;
      increased intracranial pressure. However, steroids are also linked to a multitude of adverse&#xD;
      side effects that may affect survival of GBM patients such as major immunosuppression. The&#xD;
      use of steroids during radiotherapy is associated with reduced overall- and progression-free&#xD;
      survival and has been identified as an independent poor prognostic factor. Despite these&#xD;
      findings, the suspicion of GBM often triggers the administration of DEX in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice, regardless of neurological symptoms, tumor size, or extension of cerebral edema.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether selected GBM patients can be treated safely&#xD;
      with a restrictive DEX regimen from referral to the neurosurgical center until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the failure rate of a restrictive DEX regimen defined&#xD;
      as edema or mass effect leading to any of the following: GCS deterioration ≥ 2 points, NIHSS&#xD;
      increase ≥ 3 points, increase of midline Shift ≥ 2mm, or any surgical rescue procedure for&#xD;
      increasing mass effect.&#xD;

      Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating malignant brain tumor in&#xD;
      adults. Patients with glioblastoma face a poor prognosis. Despite maximal treatment, most&#xD;
      patients suffer tumor progression after 6-7 months and die within 1-2 years. Standard&#xD;
      treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma contains maximal safe surgery and adjuvant&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. Additional administration of steroids has established as&#xD;
      standard of care during treatment of GBM. It is widely used during the entire course of the&#xD;
      disease including pre- and postoperative management, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone (DEX) is the most frequently used steroid. The main purpose is to reduce the&#xD;
      tumor associated vasogenic cerebral edema, to prevent or treat increased intracranial&#xD;
      pressure. In addition, DEX helps to cope with adverse effects of GBM-treatment like nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting and fatigue. However, steroids are also linked to a multitude of adverse side&#xD;
      effects that may affect the survival of GBM patients such as major immunosuppression, and&#xD;
      metabolic changes like hyperglycemia. The use of steroids during radiotherapy is associated&#xD;
      with reduced overall- and progression-free survival and has been identified as an independent&#xD;
      poor prognostic factor. DEX was also related to a poor prognosis in recurrent GBM. Despite&#xD;
      these findings, in routine clinical practice, the suspicion of glioblastoma often triggers&#xD;
      the administration of DEX, regardless of neurologic symptoms or the extension of cerebral&#xD;
      edema. Many patients are treated with larger doses of DEX per day before being referred to a&#xD;
      neurosurgical center and are kept on steroids during the entire treatment. On the other hand,&#xD;
      the clinical experience shows that GBM-patients with no, or only mild neurologic symptoms,&#xD;
      normal intracranial pressure and relatively small cerebral edema can be managed without&#xD;
      administration of DEX. The rationale for this study is to objectify the criteria and safety&#xD;
      of a restrictive DEX regimen (based on standardized clinical and radiological criteria). A&#xD;
      restrictive DEX regimen may help to reduce over-use, limit the number of patients exposed to&#xD;
      the adverse effects of DEX, and potentially improve survival in GBM-patients. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to assess whether selected GBM patients can be treated safely with a&#xD;
      restrictive DEX regimen from referral to the neurosurgical center until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The primary objective is to determine the failure rate of a restrictive DEX regimen&#xD;
      defined as edema or mass effect leading to any of the following: GCS deterioration ≥ 2&#xD;
      points, NIHSS increase ≥ 3 points, increase of midline Shift ≥ 2mm, or any surgical rescue&#xD;
      procedure for increasing mass effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods All patients referred to the neurosurgical center with suspicion of glioblastoma are&#xD;
      screened for inclusion- and exclusion criteria. If eligible and consenting of the patient to&#xD;
      the study protocol, no steroids will be administered until discharge (except optional&#xD;
      intraoperative single shot dexamethasone of max. 4mg if necessary). If steroids have been&#xD;
      administered for a maximum of one day before referral, they will be stopped immediately.&#xD;
      Patients are followed clinically. If one of the above-described failure criteria occurs, the&#xD;
      primary endpoint is reached and DEX will be administered.&#xD;
