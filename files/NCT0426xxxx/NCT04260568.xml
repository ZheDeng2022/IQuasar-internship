  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No studies have explored how patients with chronic dizziness react to a diagnosis of&#xD;
      Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness (3PD) and their beliefs and representations of the&#xD;
      diagnostic label. Investigating the experience of diagnostic labelling from the perspective&#xD;
      of patients will allow clinicians to recognise whether this is a helpful term to adopt and&#xD;
      ways to improve the clinical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a qualitative study that will consist of semi-structured interviews with people with&#xD;
      a new diagnosis of 3PD. The main objective of the study is to explore how patients react to&#xD;
      this diagnostic label, what they understand about their diagnosis and how their own meanings&#xD;
      affect their expectations and illness perceptions. Between 12-15 patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from the balance clinic at Guy's Hospital, London, UK. The qualitative data will be analysed&#xD;
      using thematic analysis which will draw on pragmatic interpretive descriptive methodology.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients, following a topic guide, which&#xD;
      may be updated iteratively during the data collection period in response to ideas that may be&#xD;
      generated. The topic guide explores key topics: (1) the patient's narrative; (2) the illness&#xD;
      experience; (3) receiving the diagnosis; (4) their understanding of the 3PD label and&#xD;
      beliefs; (5) expectations of recovery and treatment; (6) psychological and emotional factors;&#xD;
      and (7) free comments. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      concurrently with data collection, allowing themes to be explored inductively as they emerge.&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed by a multidisciplinary group consisting of a medical student,&#xD;
      audio-vestibular physician and physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be conducted with the aid of the latest version of computer software NVIVO for&#xD;
      Windows. The medical student will lead the analysis, generating the initial codes which will&#xD;
      then be discussed in data analysis meetings held regularly over the data collection and&#xD;
      analysis period until the group are happy with the coding and themes generated. Data&#xD;
      collection and analysis will be approached with critical reflexivity in order to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of bias. The team will ensure the analysis is grounded in the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included if they meet the diagnostic criteria for Persistent Postural&#xD;
      Perceptual Dizziness (3PD). Patients will be excluded if they;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not speak English or have special communication needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have acute severe psychiatric disorder (e.g. psychosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to interview a minimum of 12 participants and review the need for&#xD;
      further interviews up to 15 participants if there are new themes developing (i.e. if the&#xD;
      investigators have not reached data 'saturation').&#xD;
