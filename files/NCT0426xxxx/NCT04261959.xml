  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marginalized populations are at increased risk of chronic pain, trauma and use of street&#xD;
      drugs to manage this suffering, with the associated risk of overdoses. Non-pharmacological&#xD;
      options to manage chronic pain are difficult for this population to access. myoActivation® is&#xD;
      an innovative structured assessment and therapeutic approach. This study will be conducted in&#xD;
      the Vancouver Community Primary Care Chronic Pain Service and will include myoActivation and&#xD;
      physiotherapy. The study will include sixty patients who seek care on a Tuesday, the only day&#xD;
      that myoActivation is offered, and will examine the impact of these treatments on pain&#xD;
      outcomes, function and quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This study will evaluate the inclusion of myoActivation in primary care for&#xD;
      marginalized persons with concurrent opioid use disorder (OUD), chronic pain and trauma&#xD;
      history. The research aims to investigate whether myoActivation improves pain intensity,&#xD;
      quality of life, physical function, and reduces the need for prescribed analgesics (including&#xD;
      opioids) and reported illicit drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that patients with chronic pain who are treated&#xD;
      with myoActivation will experience a reduction in pain and improvement in function and&#xD;
      quality of life as shown by a 30% reduction on the PEG score (Pain intensity, interference&#xD;
      with Enjoyment of life, interference with General activity) at 4, 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Chronic pain is typically treated by prescription of analgesic medications,&#xD;
      including opioids. However, many patients who have overdoses are using opioids and other&#xD;
      substances (including street drugs, alcohol, and marijuana) to manage chronic pain. There are&#xD;
      an inadequate number of effective non-pharmacological options to manage chronic pain and wait&#xD;
      lists for local Vancouver chronic pain clinics are as long as a year. Other treatment&#xD;
      modalities offered by the Vancouver Community pain service include physiotherapy, counselling&#xD;
      and group therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The investigators aim to demonstrate an improvement in pain intensity, quality of&#xD;
      life, and physical function as the primary outcomes. Secondary objectives include reduced&#xD;
      need for analgesic medications (including opioids) and illicit drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: This study is a prospective, mixed method design, including 1:1&#xD;
      semi-structured patient interviews. It is an observational study: patients will NOT be&#xD;
      allocated to treatment on the basis of randomization or their enrollment in the study, i.e.&#xD;
      participants will receive routine clinical care, based on the services offered by the&#xD;
      clinical team at the pain clinic, and this will not change with their participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve recruitment of sixty patients who attend the pain service on Tuesdays,&#xD;
      when myoActivation and physiotherapy are offered, and who consent to being contacted for&#xD;
      follow up data collection and interviews. The aim is to recruit 20 patients receiving&#xD;
      myoActivation, 20 patients receiving physiotherapy and 20 patients receiving both&#xD;
      treatments.At the time of recruitment, the subset of patients who have concurrent opioid use&#xD;
      disorder, other addictions and / or trauma will not be known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a baseline score of the patients' pain experience using the validated questionnaires&#xD;
           PEG, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  information on baseline mental health conditions - OUD, Trauma, Anxiety, Depression,&#xD;
           Axis 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEG, PCS, PSEQ scores as well as the patient reported use of street drugs and pain&#xD;
           medications will be collected at 4, 12, 24 weeks using a study designed questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a semi-structured 1:1 patient interview at 12-24 weeks will assess opioid/drug use, as&#xD;
           well as questions related to changes to housing, finances and overall health; this will&#xD;
           be conducted with 10 randomly selected participants who have received myoActivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: To allow for correlation of repeated data points on the same patient as&#xD;
      well as the anticipated variability in the number of data points for each patient, a linear&#xD;
      mixed-effects model will be used to analyze the quantitative data, including PEG score and&#xD;
      self-reported opioid use. A PEG score decrease of 30% will be taken to indicate an improved&#xD;
      pain experience. The PCS and PSEQ scores will be used to interpret the severity and change of&#xD;
      an individual's pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient interview responses will be collated for common themes and used to augment the&#xD;
      quantitative data outcomes. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis&#xD;
      will be used to identify key words and phrases, list noted benefits of the service, potential&#xD;
      problems raised and any preferences expressed by participants with respect to the way the&#xD;
      treatment is administered.&#xD;

    <description>myoActivation is a novel, structured assessment and non-pharmacological therapeutic approach to both diagnosis and treatment of chronic myofascial pain. A detailed history of the timeline of lifetime trauma combined with a quick, structured and reproducible set of posture and movement tests help to easily identify myofascial components of chronic pain. The therapeutic component is delivered utilizing a needling technique, or myofascial release, focused to active myofascial trigger points, fascia in tension and tethered scars.</description>
