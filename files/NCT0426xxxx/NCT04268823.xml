  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether potentiating the cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) with QBW251 in subjects with COPD will be&#xD;
      efficacious with regards to reducing lung and systemic inflammation and bacterial&#xD;
      colonization as potential drivers of airway obstruction, airway destruction, remodeling and&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study will provide supportive data to investigate the relationship of COPD&#xD;
      phenotype and the response in small airway structure, function, mucus load and spirometry&#xD;
      indices as well as in improvement of overall COPD symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, subject and investigator blinded, parallel-group, placebo controlled study investigating the mode of action (MoA) and preliminary efficacy and safety of QBW251 administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.) for 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe COPD (GOLD 2-3).&#xD;
Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either QBW251 or placebo treatment. Based on the assumption of a 15% drop-out rate (% drop out based on completed proof-of-concept COPD study CQBW251X2201), it is expected to have approximately 84 subjects to complete the study. A blinded interim analysis to re-assess the sample size is planned for when approximately 36 subjects have completed their Day 84 visit.&#xD;
The study consists of the following periods: Screening, Baseline / Day 1, Treatment, and End of the Study followed by an additional post-treatment safety phone call. The total duration for each subject in the study is up to approximately 18 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
