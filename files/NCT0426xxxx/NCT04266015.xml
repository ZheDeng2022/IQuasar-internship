  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative fasting remains a common clinical practice in surgical patients to prevent the&#xD;
      development of postoperative anesthesia- and surgical-related complications. Clinical&#xD;
      observational studies indicated that the combination catabolic effects resulted from&#xD;
      prolonged perioperative fasting and profound surgical stress are likely to induce extensive&#xD;
      protein catabolism, muscle breakdown and impaired glycemic control during postoperative&#xD;
      phase, leading to the development of severe complications. Furthermore, prolonged&#xD;
      gastrointestinal fasting is associated with microbial translocation that deteriorates the&#xD;
      early recovery after surgery. This clinical trial anticipates in determining the beneficial&#xD;
      effect of intraoperative feeding to improve intraoperative hemodynamics and enhance&#xD;
      postoperative recovery due to attenuation of systemic catabolism and improvement of insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity to glycemic control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative fasting remains a common clinical practice in surgical patients, aiming to&#xD;
      prevent pulmonary aspiration during anesthesia induction, improve bowel preparation, and&#xD;
      ameliorate the development of postoperative nausea/vomiting or other surgical-related&#xD;
      complications. Major head-and-neck tumor excision and reconstruction surgery is one of the&#xD;
      most time-consuming surgeries that usually takes more than 12 h to complete. In addition to&#xD;
      the preoperative fasting and postoperative recovery time periods, most of these patients will&#xD;
      be fasted for more than 24-36 h before they are fed via nasogastric tubes in the&#xD;
      postoperative care units. The combination catabolic effects resulted from prolonged&#xD;
      perioperative fasting and profound surgical stress are likely to induce extensive protein&#xD;
      catabolism, muscle breakdown and impaired glycemic control during postoperative phase. These&#xD;
      catabolic responses may lead to the development of post-operative surgical site infection,&#xD;
      delayed wound healing, re-intervention, cardiac arrest, and death in diabetic and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients. Furthermore, prolonged gastrointestinal fasting is associated with&#xD;
      dehydration, perturbed gut integrity/permeability (leaky gut) and microbial (bacterial)&#xD;
      translocation that deteriorates the early recovery after reconstruction surgery. The aim of&#xD;
      this clinical trial is to test the effect of intraoperative feeding in patients receiving&#xD;
      head-and-neck tumor excision and reconstruction surgery, and anticipate that reduction of&#xD;
      perioperative fasting time may improve intraoperative hemodynamics and enhance postoperative&#xD;
      recovery due to attenuation of systemic catabolism and improvement of insulin sensitivity to&#xD;
      glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center clinical trial will be undertaken in a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled fashion, in which patients with advanced head-and-neck tumor who are&#xD;
      scheduled for extended tumor resection and free-flap reconstruction will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive control (no intraoperative feeding) or intraoperative feeding group. Feeding via&#xD;
      the nasogastric (NG) tube will start after the establishment of tracheostomy and completion&#xD;
      of tumor resection at fusion rate of 10-30 ml/h (feeding diet 1 Kcal/ml and 0.04 g&#xD;
      protein/ml). This trial anticipates in detecting differences in intraoperative hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability and development of major postoperative complications, including delayed wound&#xD;
      healing, surgical site infections and insulin-resistant hyperglycemia between controls and&#xD;
      intraoperative feeding group. The outcomes of this clinical trial may provide fundamental&#xD;
      evidence for vigorous enteric nutrition and energy support during prolonged high surgical&#xD;
      stress operation.&#xD;
