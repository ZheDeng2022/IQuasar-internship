      10.17 GoTHAM is intended as a signal-seeking, biomarker, phase Ib/II study that will evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and anti-tumour activities of the novel combination of avelumab with&#xD;
      177-Lu-DOTATATE (a type of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; PRRT) or external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as avelumab which has changed&#xD;
      the treatment landscape for metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma (mMCC), many mMCC patients who&#xD;
      attained an initial response exhibit acquired resistance within 1 year. Therefore, novel&#xD;
      treatment combinations are needed to improve patient outcome. MCC is an exquisitely&#xD;
      radiosensitive tumour and there is emerging data supporting the role of radiation in inducing&#xD;
      immunogenic cell death and therefore potentially improving the anti-tumour efficacy when&#xD;
      combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is&#xD;
      used in first-line treatment for neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), by delivering radiation to&#xD;
      somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expressing tumour cells. Most NETs, including MCC, express SSTR.&#xD;
      Therefore, MCC tumours are ideal candidates for PRRT, and immune checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      combination approaches with PRRT are highly attractive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GoTHAM trial is intended as a signal-seeking and biomarker study. It is designed as a&#xD;
      prospective, open-labelled, multi-institutional, three-arm, phase Ib/II trial that will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and anti-tumour activity of 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate (LuTate) or external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in combination with avelumab in patients with mMCC. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the anti-tumour activity as reflected by PFS rate at 12 months.&#xD;
