  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed as part of the development process of the Liver EpiCheck test&#xD;
      which includes the identification of different methylation profiles in HCC (hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma) patients compare to cancer free control in blood samples&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study aimed to collect blood samples and&#xD;
      de-identified clinical data from subjects diagnosed with HCC (cases arm) and subjects with&#xD;
      high risk for HCC which are undergoing routine surveillance for HCC.&#xD;
