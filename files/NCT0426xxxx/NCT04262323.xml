      Evaluation of a novel mobile application designed to estimate blood pressure&#xD;
      (systolic-diastolic and mean arterial pressure) based on collected optical signals on&#xD;
      patient's finger treated in surgical patients in the post-anesthesia care unit&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the blood pressure values measured by a novel mobile&#xD;
      phone application ( camera of the smartphone will be obstructed by the patient's right index)&#xD;
      and the values measured by reference method used (the oscillometric brachial cuff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients scheduled for noncardiac surgery at Erasme Hospital Brussels, Belgium will be&#xD;
      recruited and their pressure will be measured with both mesurement methods. (novel smartphone&#xD;
      application versus upper arm cuff oscillometry) at 5 time points (each 20-30 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OptiBP Application is a mobile application installed on a mobile phone which is a&#xD;
      non-invasive data-logger intended to acquire physiological data from patients. By applying&#xD;
      the patient's finger on a smartphone's camera, a movie is generated and transformed into&#xD;
      values of diastolic, mean and systolic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three measures will be taken (spaced by one minute) with both methods after a period of 3&#xD;
      minutes of rest at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's blood pressure will be measured in parallel with the mobile application and&#xD;
      with the reference equipment (the oscillometric brachial cuff).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm the reliability of&#xD;
      the data obtained with the novel mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is therefore to compare blood pressure values as obtained by the analysis of the&#xD;
      data recorded by the OptiBP Mobile Application, against simultaneous measurements provided by&#xD;
      the oscillometric brachial cuff&#xD;
