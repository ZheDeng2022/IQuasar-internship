  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open, post-market study that will enroll male and female subjects diagnosed&#xD;
      with foot fungus and at least one of the following conditions: heel cracks, calluses and/or&#xD;
      dry feet. The investigation will consist of approximately 48 subjects (considering a 10%&#xD;
      drop-out/screening failure rate) fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the study. Each&#xD;
      subject will be treated with the study product, BioCool Footcare (footbath), for 3 weeks. The&#xD;
      study duration is estimated to 5 months including recruiting, treatment and follow-up period.&#xD;
