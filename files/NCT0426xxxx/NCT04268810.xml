  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC)is a disease of unknown origin with a&#xD;
      significant impact on the quality of life. Next to oral treatment with tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants or pentosan polysulphate, intravesical treatment can be used as well. The&#xD;
      purpose of this treatment is to restore the protective lining of the bladder that consists of&#xD;
      glycan structures (GAG). Currently only dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is FDA approved for this.&#xD;
      Several other compounds have been introduced. We want to compare a solution of chondroitin&#xD;
      sulphate 2% with the standard DMSO solution. We will compare the patient perception of&#xD;
      benefit,but also pain scores, quality of life and micturition diaries.&#xD;

      A. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Painful bladder syndrome(PBS) is a syndrome which is poorly understood. Patients usually&#xD;
      report suprapubic pain related to bladder filling and also report urinary urgency and&#xD;
      frequency. In a subgroup of patients, typical cystoscopic findings can be noted and this&#xD;
      defines this subgroup as interstitial cystitis. (Abrams et al. 116-26) The treatment of&#xD;
      PBS/IC is empirical. Bladder hydrodistension under anesthesia, tricyclic antidepressants,&#xD;
      antihistaminics and intravesical DMSO instillations are the only treatment for which some&#xD;
      evidence exists in the literature. More than 150 other treatment modalities have been&#xD;
      described . Most of them were poorly studied. (Fall et al. 1-99) Intravesical treatment with&#xD;
      DMSO has stood the test of time and is the only FDA approved intravesical treatment of&#xD;
      PBS/IC. DMSO however is also used as a solvent in the chemical industry and is in fact used '&#xD;
      off label' in this indication. (Erickson 333-43;Emerson and Perezmarrero A136;Perez-Marrero,&#xD;
      Emerson, and Feltis 36-39) One of the theories on which intravesical treatment is based,&#xD;
      claims that the glycosaminoglycan layer, which protects the urothelial cells is damaged.&#xD;
      DMSO, Chondroitin sulphate, hyaluronic acid and heparin have been used to repair the GAG&#xD;
      layer with variable clinical success. (Daha et al. 369-72;Daha et al. 987-90;Riedl et al.&#xD;
      717-21) Chondroitin sulphate seems to be promising, but comparative data are lacking.&#xD;
      (Gauruder-Burmester and Popken 355-59;Nickel et al. 56-60;Hauser et al. 2477-82;Nordling and&#xD;
      van Ophoven 328-35) Assessing the outcome of such treatments is difficult. Objective&#xD;
      parameters such as daytime and nighttime frequency may not always reflect the impact of the&#xD;
      condition on the life of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcome parameters are more frequently used to assess treatments in&#xD;
      overactive bladder disease and in painful bladder research. Several validated questionnaires&#xD;
      can be used to assess patients with PBS/IC. One of the most frequently used is the&#xD;
      O'Leary-Sant questionnaire ( see annex 1). Next to this questionnaire the Global Response&#xD;
      Assessment will be used. This is a validated 7 point Likert scale comparing the current&#xD;
      status of the patient to the pre-intervention status. This scale has been used in several&#xD;
      other studies on PBS/IC. (Nickel et al. 910-18;Baranowski et al. 33-36) Aim To compare the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of intravesical chondroitin sulphate 2% ( Uracyst ™) and DMSO 50% in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with painful bladder syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Randomization A central randomization will be used. Participating centers will have to&#xD;
      contact the trial office of the dept. of urology of the University Hospitals Leuven to&#xD;
      randomize the patient to one or the other treatment, either by telephone 016/346692 or&#xD;
      016/348345 or by mail elza.goossens@uzleuven.be or evelien.vankriekingen@uzleuven.be . A&#xD;
      block randomization per center will be done. The randomization list was generated on a web&#xD;
      application ( www.randomizer.org) to ensure an unbiased randomization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Protocol of administration Patients that are enrolled in the study will receive one&#xD;
      intravesical instillation of Uracyst or DMSO a week during 6 weeks. DMSO is prepared as a 50%&#xD;
      solution in 50cc physiologic serum. Uracyst will be prepared by the nurse or urologist&#xD;
      administering the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uracyst is delivered as a 2% sterile solution in 20cc vials. The instillation is done by a&#xD;
      urethral catheterization. The catheter is withdrawn once the fluid has been instilled. The&#xD;
      solution is kept in the bladder for at least 30 minutes. A simple instillation protocol is&#xD;
      followed, meaning that the patient can move immediately after the instillation of the&#xD;
      product. The product is eliminated by spontaneous voiding after 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Safety Safety is assessed by monitoring adverse events at every visit. Anticipated adverse&#xD;
      events are hematuria, algiuria, urinary tract infection and garlic odor ( for DMSO)…&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Statistics Comparison of the mean GRA by T-test will be used for the primary endpoint.&#xD;
      Appropriate statistical tests will be used for the secondary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect a 0.75 difference on the 7 point Likert scale, with 80% power at 0.05% significance&#xD;
      45 patients will be needed in each group.&#xD;
