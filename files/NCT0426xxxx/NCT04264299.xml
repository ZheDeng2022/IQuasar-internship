    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of three different methods of CBD repair after&#xD;
      common bile duct exploration and provides more evidence for selecting the optimal duct&#xD;
      closure after choledocholithotomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the commonest available options for CBD closure include repair over T-tube drain,&#xD;
      primary closure, and repair after antegrade biliary stenting. All three methods present&#xD;
      speciﬁc technical performance features, require different postoperative management protocols,&#xD;
      and are charged with speciﬁc morbidity related to the procedure and therefore should not be&#xD;
      considered the same procedure in the context of CBDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repair over T-tube is the traditional surgical technique. It has many advantages as&#xD;
      post-operative distal CBD decompression, trans-tubal cholangiography, and availability of&#xD;
      retained CBD stones extraction. However, it has several potential complications up to 10% of&#xD;
      patients. The most frequent complications are bile leakage, tract infection, T-tube&#xD;
      dislodgement, electrolyte and nutritional disturbances, cholangitis, or acute renal failure&#xD;
      from dehydration due to inadequate water ingestion. It also causes discomfort and persistent&#xD;
      pain to the patient along with increased hospital admission and thus the economic burden to&#xD;
      the country. Primary closure of CBD has been described in the literature to overcome these&#xD;
      adverse consequences of the T-tube. However, it has many potential complications as a&#xD;
      potential bile leak and CBD stricture, which may occur due to papillary edema and&#xD;
      insufficient bile duct expansion. There are conflicting results regarding significant&#xD;
      differences in the morbidity and mortality between primary closure and T-tube drainage. There&#xD;
      is no conclusive evidence displaying whether primary closure is better or worse than T-tube&#xD;
      drainage after CBD exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a biliary stent in primary closure is an effective method to decrease the two&#xD;
      complications, which can reduce biliary pressure without bile loss. Although there are some&#xD;
      available drainage options after CBDE, a consensus on the optimal drainage is yet to be&#xD;
      reached.&#xD;
