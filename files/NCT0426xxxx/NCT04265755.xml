      This is a phase 4 open-label study aiming to explore the relationship between clinical&#xD;
      response to erenumab and genetic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with episodic or chronic migraine will be treated with Erenumab 70mg or 140mg for a&#xD;
      4-week baseline/screening period, followed by a 24-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will collect migraine-related parameters daily using an eDiary and blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected for biomarker research. All analysis will be descriptive in nature.&#xD;
