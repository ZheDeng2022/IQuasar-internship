    <textblock>
      Single-arm, post-market, observational, prospective study to asses the safety and performance&#xD;
      of the Power PICC Power PICC family of devices and its accessories in a real-world setting.&#xD;
      The study will only enroll patients that need a Power PICC catheter as part of their medical&#xD;
      care. Patients will be followed from insertion through removal, or up to 180 days (whichever&#xD;
      comes first). Data collected will be gathered from the patient's medical chart.&#xD;
