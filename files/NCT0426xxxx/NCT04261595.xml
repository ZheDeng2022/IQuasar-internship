  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong developmental disability that includes deficits&#xD;
      in social communication and social interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of&#xD;
      behavior, interests, or activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatment approaches for the management of autism are expensive, showing unwanted&#xD;
      adverse effects; alter the genetic and metabolic pathways. Many studies referred to the&#xD;
      importance of probiotics, minerals and antioxidant supplementation in the treatment of&#xD;
      accompanied eating and feeding problems. Meanwhile, there are still controversial results&#xD;
      about the effectiveness of dietary interventions for ASD like the gluten-free/casein-free&#xD;
      diet and the ketogenic diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dates have been documented in the Holy Quran and proved in modern scientific literature to&#xD;
      act as potent antioxidants and as an anti-inflammatory, provide a suitable alternative&#xD;
      therapy in various diseases cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medicinal therapeutic value of date fruits as nutritional probiotic and its implications&#xD;
      in controlling autism through the anti-oxidant effect will be evaluated. Moreover, at which&#xD;
      dose Dates fruit can exert its effect and whether this effect is sustained or not will be&#xD;
      also evaluated. Besides, Dates' effect on cognitive, neurological parameters, eating&#xD;
      behaviors, and gastrointestinal symptoms and anthropometric measures will be evaluated. A&#xD;
      non-randomized clinical study on 120 diagnosed autistic children aged 3-12 years in Cairo&#xD;
      will be conducted. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (each with&#xD;
      40 children) receiving one of three regimens; the first group will receive 3 Dates per day&#xD;
      for 3 months and the second group will receive 5 Dates per day for 3 months and the third&#xD;
      group will receive nothing. All groups will receive nutrition guidance, behavioral&#xD;
      modification, and stimulation sessions. Stools and blood samples will be collected before the&#xD;
      study, after 12 weeks of the intervention and then 12 weeks after completion of the&#xD;
      intervention. Evaluating Dates' ability to decrease the oxidative stress will be done through&#xD;
      comparing blood levels of three oxidative markers; Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione&#xD;
      peroxidase (GPX1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in children with autism for the three&#xD;
      proposed regimen. The impact of the Dates fruit consumption on the microbiota of the autistic&#xD;
      children both the pathogenic bacteria and probiotics will be done through traditional stool&#xD;
      analysis and Real-time PCR before and after interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASD is progressively increasing; the rate of autism was 3.4 per 1,000 for children aged 3 to&#xD;
      10 years in the 1990s. Meanwhile, in 2006, the prevalence estimates are in the range of 6.5&#xD;
      to 6.6 per 1,000 and recently 1 in 160 children have ASD. Though classified as a&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental condition, ASD is often associated with multiple medical comorbidities and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) problems. GI disorders occurred in around 90 % of ASD children with&#xD;
      suggested possible role of the GI microflora in the severity of symptoms in autistic&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with ASD frequently have food selectivity, which may have an effect on&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms. The gut flora of autistic children is altered compared to healthy&#xD;
      children and they have multiple nutritional deficiencies. The microbiota that resides in the&#xD;
      gut was claimed to be the cause behind the neurodevelopmental disorders occurring among the&#xD;
      autistic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients with ASD, the use&#xD;
      of probiotics may be an indication for adjuvant therapy. Probiotics ''are living&#xD;
      nonpathogenic microorganisms, when administered in adequate amounts exert their beneficial&#xD;
      effects resulting in modulation of the immune and inflammatory response. The supplementation&#xD;
      of probiotic bacteria to autistic children can lead to changes in the microbiota and it&#xD;
      considers a useful new therapeutic tool to normalize gut microbiota, restore the function of&#xD;
      the epithelial barrier resulting in reliving of the gastrointestinal system disorders, reduce&#xD;
      inflammation, and potentially improve the behavioral symptoms in autistic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, children with autism have deficient antioxidant defense Mechanisms. They are&#xD;
      vulnerable to oxidative stress which is detected by elevated lipid peroxidation, especially&#xD;
      at younger children. Oxidative stress may play a role in the development and clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of autism resulting in loss of acquired language skills in autism. Meguid and&#xD;
      coworkers highlighted that autistic children might benefit from antioxidant supplementation&#xD;
      coupled with polyunsaturated fatty acids. Early assessment and intervention of antioxidant&#xD;
      status may decrease the oxidative stress before inducing more irreversible brain damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Islam, herbs and its constituents have important value in diet and treatment of various&#xD;
      types of diseases. The Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him) used various herbs and&#xD;
      recommended various medicinal plants for the cure of various diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dates and their constituents show a role in disease prevention through anti-oxidant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial activity. Dates are considered a staple food item in the&#xD;
      Middle East and North Africa and are also imported in Europe, the UK, and the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dates contain relatively high levels of polyphenols and insoluble fiber. It has shown that&#xD;
      whole date fruit, and polyphenols extracted from them selectively stimulates Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      spp. and Bacteroides, along with the total bacterial counts in fecal batch culture models,&#xD;
      increasing small chain fatty acid (SCFA) production concurrently. In addition, promising&#xD;
      changes in DNA damage were observed through the anti-proliferative actions of both polyphenol&#xD;
      extracts and whole date extracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antioxidant activity of Dates is recognized due to the wide range of phenolic compounds&#xD;
      present in Dates including p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids, flavonoids, and&#xD;
      procyanidins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dates fruit is considered as a rich source of minerals and sugars; its various constituents&#xD;
      like phytochemicals, carotenoids, steroids, and flavonoids are screened for numerous&#xD;
      medicine. Rahmani and his colleagues illustrate all the therapeutic functions of the Dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping all information in hands about Dates' therapeutic effect in the management of the&#xD;
      disease via its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory effect and for the sake of autistic children,&#xD;
      It is worthy to point and essential to evaluate Dates as a good remedy for autistic children&#xD;
      because it is inexpensive and easy to access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to discover functional food that is effective to control the&#xD;
      comorbidities accompanied by autism development and to limit its progression. This food&#xD;
      should be safe, inexpensive and affordable, easy to access without any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medicinal therapeutic value of Dates fruit as nutritional prebiotic and its implications&#xD;
      in controlling autism through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this interventional study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate Dates' effect on cognitive development&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate Dates' effect on neurological parameters and severity of autism&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate Dates' effect on eating behaviors and diet quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate Dates' effect on gastrointestinal symptoms and the microbiota&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate Dates' ability to decrease the oxidative stress before inducing more&#xD;
           irreversible brain damage (through comparing levels of three oxidative markers;&#xD;
           Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in&#xD;
           children with autism for the three proposed regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate at which dose Dates fruit can exert its effect as a new therapeutic regimen and&#xD;
           its persistence over time&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             3. Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or&#xD;
                twisting or complex whole-body movements)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Persistent pre-co-occupation with parts of objects B. Delays or abnormal&#xD;

Dietary intake is difficult to measure, and any single method cannot assess dietary exposure perfectly. The 24HR, and FFQ are subjective estimates. Recently, it has been suggested that a combination of methods, such as the FFQ with 24HR be used to obtain more accurate estimates of dietary intakes than that of individual methods. They are widely used as the primary dietary assessment tool in epidemiological studies..</description>
