  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is the number one risk factor for the majority of chronic diseases. There are no&#xD;
      pharmaceutical treatments to slow aging and prolong healthspan. The anti-diabetic drug&#xD;
      metformin is considered a likely pharmaceutical candidate to slow aging. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that metformin treatment in subjects free of type 2 diabetes will&#xD;
      improve insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in insulin resistant individuals, but will&#xD;
      decrease insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in insulin sensitive subjects. Further, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that long-term metformin treatment will remodel mitochondria in a&#xD;
      way that decreases mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin sensitive, but&#xD;
      improves mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin resistant. The investigators&#xD;
      will use a dual-site, 12- week drug intervention trial performed in a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled manner on 148 subjects recruited from two separate sites (Oklahoma Medical&#xD;
      Research Foundation (OMRF) and University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM)). After consent and&#xD;
      initial subject screening for chronic disease, subjects will be stratified to insulin&#xD;
      sensitive (IS) or insulin resistant (IR) groups. Over a 12- week intervention, half of each&#xD;
      group will take metformin and half will take a placebo. Pre- and post--intervention, subjects&#xD;
      will complete a series of procedures to assess insulin sensitivity, glucose regulation, and&#xD;
      biomarkers of aging. The same subjects will provide a skeletal muscle biopsy pre-- and&#xD;
      post-intervention to assess the change in mitochondrial function and mitochondrial remodeling&#xD;
      with and without metformin treatment. By completion of this project, the investigators expect&#xD;
      to provide evidence that helps further delineate who may benefit from metformin treatment to&#xD;
      slow aging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there is epidemiological support for health benefits of metformin in patient&#xD;
      populations, it is not clear if these protective effects extend to those free of disease.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to perform human studies determining which subjects free of&#xD;
      chronic disease benefit from metformin treatment. Retrospective analysis of a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded clinical trial in our lab revealed that subjects who were insulin sensitive&#xD;
      had no effect or negative effects on insulin sensitivity when taking metformin during an&#xD;
      exercise training program. These data suggest that in some subjects, metformin has&#xD;
      detrimental metabolic outcomes that could accelerate aging. There are data both in support of&#xD;
      and refuting that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I action and/or mitochondrial&#xD;
      remodeling. The overall objective of this trial is to determine if subjects currently free of&#xD;
      disease benefit from metformin treatment. There are two critical questions that remain&#xD;
      unanswered in human subjects: 1) does antecedent metabolic health influence responses to&#xD;
      metformin, and 2) does long-term treatment with metformin lead to mitochondrial remodeling&#xD;
      and changes in function. To better understand the translational potential of a clinically&#xD;
      relevant dose of metformin for the prevention of chronic conditions, this proposal aims to&#xD;
      determine how antecedent metabolic health affects the response to metformin treatment, and&#xD;
      identify the relationship between skeletal muscle mitochondrial remodeling and mitochondrial&#xD;
      function with metformin treatment. The hypotheses are that: 1) metformin treatment in&#xD;
      subjects free of Type 2 diabetes will improve insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in&#xD;
      insulin resistant individuals, but will decrease insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in&#xD;
      insulin sensitive subjects, and 2) long-term metformin treatment will remodel mitochondria in&#xD;
      a way that decreases mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin sensitive, but&#xD;
      improves mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin resistant. To test these&#xD;
      hypotheses, a 12-week randomized, double-blind clinical trial will be performed in subjects&#xD;
      40-75 yrs of age, free of disease, and stratified by insulin sensitivity (insulin sensitive&#xD;
      and insulin resistant). Pre- and post-training assessments include the hyperinsulinemic-&#xD;
      euglycemic clamp to measure hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring to determine glucoregulation, and proposed blood-based biomarkers of aging.&#xD;
      Further, the use of novel stable isotope labeling with proteomic analysis will determine&#xD;
      individual and complex-specific mitochondrial remodeling. This approach will be combined with&#xD;
      analysis of protein modification and turnover to comprehensively analyze mitochondrial&#xD;
      effects of metformin treatment in skeletal muscle. By completion of this project, it is&#xD;
      expected that there will be evidence that helps further delineate who may benefit from&#xD;
      metformin treatment to slow aging.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial of healthy older male and female subjects 40-75 years of age. Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups (metformin or placebo) for a 12-week intervention. The study is double-blinded on placebo versus metformin. The randomization sequence will be stratified by study center (OUHSC or UWM) and baseline insulin status (HOMA-IR &lt;=2.2 [sensitive] versus &gt;=2.5 [resistant]) and will be created using randomly chosen block sizes of four or six. At each center, there will be four groups: insulin sensitive (IS) placebo, IS metformin, insulin resistant (IR) placebo, and IR metformin.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The investigators use a &quot;ramp up&quot; dosing protocol in which the amount of metformin (Hunter Pharmacy) will begin at 500 mg/day in week 1, increase to 1000 mg/day in week 2, and then to 1500 mg/day in week 3, as tolerated. At week 3 and for the remaining 9 weeks, the dose will remain at 1500 mg/day, which is a standard clinical dose (1500-2000 mg/day). If a subject has gastrointestinal discomfort with 1500 mg/day the dose, the investigators will lower the dose to 1000 mg/day. The investigators will split the dose with 1/2 given in the a.m. and 1/2 in the p.m. and taken with meals to minimize GI discomfort.</description>
