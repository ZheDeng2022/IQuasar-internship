  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic diarrhea is a common condition and a key symptom in many disorders. It is a major&#xD;
      cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and one of the most common reasons for referral to&#xD;
      a gastroenterology clinic.The prevalence varies depending on population and the definition of&#xD;
      diarrhea used. It affects approximately 5% of the population at any given point in time,&#xD;
      although the exact prevalence is unknown. Diarrhea is associated with 4 pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms: osmotic, secretory, exudative and altered motility. It is more useful to classify&#xD;
      patients presenting with symptoms of diarrhea according to ''functional'' or ''organic''&#xD;
      characteristics. It is usually difficult to make a reliable differentiation between organic&#xD;
      and functional causes in patients with chronic diarrhea based only on history and physical&#xD;
      examination .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard evaluation of patients with chronic diarrhea that begins with a detailed&#xD;
      history, a careful physical examination and then basic diagnostic tests is critical for&#xD;
      optimal treatment and prevention. Initially, thought needs to exclude several other&#xD;
      possibilities as (a) fecal incontinence masquerading as diarrhea, (b) iatrogenic diarrhea due&#xD;
      to drugs, surgery, or therapeutic radiation, (c) chronic infections, and (d) irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of a broad array of potentially offending agents has traditionally required a&#xD;
      combination of microbiologic approaches, including bacterial culture, antigen detection,&#xD;
      microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The new multiplex PCR-based panels have&#xD;
      several advantages over conventional methods including (i) reduced sample volume&#xD;
      requirements, (ii) broad coverage without the need to select specific tests, (iii) enhanced&#xD;
      ability to detect coinfections (iv) increased sensitivity and specificity as high as 97-100%&#xD;
      and (v) higher throughput.The food and drug administration (FDA) cleared and recommended the&#xD;
      use of FilmArray GI panel (BioFire Diagnostics), which targets 22 analytes (bacteria with&#xD;
      bacterial toxin, viruses, and parasites)&#xD;

      Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Routine laboratory investigation: Complete blood picture and differential WBCs count,&#xD;
      liver, kidney function tests, RBG, Na, K, CRP, ESR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Microbilogical Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that good specimens are provided for examination, it is important to note the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sterile clean dry container must be used for the collection of fecal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The specimen should be brought to the lab as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The specimen container should be clearly labeled with the patient's name, date, and time&#xD;
           of passage of the specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Conventional methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be cultured on Selenite broth then subcultured on blood agar, chocolate&#xD;
      agar, MacConkeys agar, Sorbitol MacConkys agar: Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate agar (XLD)&#xD;
      ,Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), blood agar with 10um/ml ampicillin , Cambylobacter CVA agar&#xD;
      plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of the bacterial organism:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pure colonies of isolated microorganisms were identified by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Morphology on agar.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gram stain film was made from the growth to identify morphology of the organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biochemical reactions tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detection of antibiotic sensitivity pattern according to CLSI 2019 by disc diffusion&#xD;
           method&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Confirmation of results by automated microbial system VITEK 2Compact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Multiplex PCR: for Identification of different causative organisms by Biofire microarray&#xD;
      (BioMerieux,France)&#xD;
