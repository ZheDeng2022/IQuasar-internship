  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase Ib/II study of safety, tolerability, efficacy and&#xD;
      PK of APG-2575 as a single agent or in combination with other therapeutic agents including&#xD;
      ibrutinib or rituximab. The study consists of the dose escalation and the dose expansion&#xD;
      phases. The clinical trial will have multiple arms with ability to subsequently add more&#xD;
      treatment arms based upon clinical activity of APG2575 in WM. Initially the study will&#xD;
      contain 3 arms noted below, all the arms are independent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: APG-2575 will be administered as a single agent to determine the MTD/RP2D in subjects&#xD;
      who are relapsed/resistant or intolerant to ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dose escalation phase of APG-2575 as monotherapy will use mTPI-2 design. The starting&#xD;
      target dose (using ramp-up if needed) is 400 mg (dose level; DL1) and will be increased to&#xD;
      600 mg (DL2), 800 mg (DL3) accordingly. Doses can be increased to higher level depending on&#xD;
      safety and PK results based on discussions of the Investigators and Sponsor. APG-2575 will be&#xD;
      administered orally once daily until time of progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the&#xD;
      MTD/RP2D is determined, up to 12 additional patients will be enrolled at RP2D in&#xD;
      dose-expansion phase to further evaluate safety and efficacy of APG-2575.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: APG-2575 will be administered in combination with ibrutinib in subjects with&#xD;
      previously untreated WM.&#xD;
