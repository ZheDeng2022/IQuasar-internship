  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the Habit&#xD;
      Design (HD) approach in a corporate health context over the course of one year in subjects&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome. All subjects will be coached to increase physical activity.&#xD;
      Additionally, subjects will choose and be coached to achieve a goal of either increasing&#xD;
      fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive either standard coaching (control condition) or HD-enhanced&#xD;
      coaching (experimental condition).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of the Habit Design approach, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with 424 corporate health program participants over the course of&#xD;
      one year. Study subjects will be employees of TriHealth or their spouses who have completed a&#xD;
      health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and identified as having&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. All subjects will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be&#xD;
      monitored with a Fitbit and Fitabase software. Additionally, prior to randomization, subjects&#xD;
      will choose a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either standard&#xD;
      coaching (control condition) or HD-enhanced coaching (experimental condition). Conditions&#xD;
      will be stratified/balanced by choice of goal and gender using urn randomization. In both&#xD;
      conditions coaching will be manualized, monitored for fidelity, and delivered via telephone&#xD;
      in 12 weekly active coaching sessions followed by 4 monthly maintenance coaching sessions.&#xD;
      Coaching sessions will last 15-30 minutes. The primary outcome will be average daily step&#xD;
      count measured with Fitbit over the course of at least one week at baseline, 16 weeks, 32&#xD;
      weeks, and 48 weeks. The secondary outcomes will be indices of fruit/vegetable intake or&#xD;
      water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, blood pressure, waist&#xD;
      circumference, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, self-reported&#xD;
      physical activity; junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of&#xD;
      exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for&#xD;
      target behaviors; and health-related quality of life will be assessed over time. Ratings of&#xD;
      usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will also be examined. Analyses will be&#xD;
      intent-to-treat and assume 15% loss to follow-up.&#xD;
