  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for inhalation in&#xD;
      conjunction with nCPAP, in comparison to nCPAP alone, in preterm neonates with RDS, as&#xD;
      assessed by the incidence of and time to respiratory failure and/or death due to RDS in the&#xD;
      first 72 hours and 28 days of life. Half of the subjects will receive lucinactant for&#xD;
      inhalation and half will receive standard of care (nCPAP alone).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An unmet medical need exists for a means to deliver SRT to preterm neonates with RDS&#xD;
      supported with nCPAP early in the course of the disease. This strategy has the potential to&#xD;
      improve RDS prior to the development of respiratory failure, thereby avoiding the need for&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation and MV, or reduce the duration of MV, and the resultant potential for&#xD;
      morbidity and complications. The ability to administer SRT via aerosol has the potential to&#xD;
      address this unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lucinactant for inhalation (AEROSURF) is an investigational drug-device combination product,&#xD;
      designed to deliver aerosolized SRT to preterm neonates with RDS who are being supported with&#xD;
      nCPAP. The drug component of lucinactant for inhalation is lyophilized lucinactant, a&#xD;
      lyophilized form of SURFAXINÂ® (lucinactant) Intratracheal Suspension. The device component,&#xD;
      the AEROSURF Delivery System (ADS), the next-generation device following use of the prototype&#xD;
      device in earlier trials, uses novel technology to aerosolize lucinactant for inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for inhalation in conjunction&#xD;
      with nCPAP, in comparison to nCPAP alone, in preterm neonates with RDS, as assessed by&#xD;
      pre-specified outcome measures. In addition, this study will evaluate the device and the&#xD;
      ability to administer up to 3 repeat doses.&#xD;
