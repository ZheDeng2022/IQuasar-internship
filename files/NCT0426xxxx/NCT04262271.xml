    <textblock>
      This study will observe the inhaler technique of people using 13 different inhaler types;&#xD;
      record any technique errors being made against checklists developed for each inhaler device&#xD;
      based on their manufacturer's guidelines, and reeducate any observed inhaler technique errors&#xD;
      as required.&#xD;

      Anyone aged 16 or over who has a lung condition for which they use an inhaler will be invited&#xD;
      to join the study. We will recruit a minimum of 650 study participants, with at least 50&#xD;
      participants using each of the 13 inhaler device types selected. These inhaler device types&#xD;
      include: Accuhaler, Autohaler, Breezhaler, Easi-breathe, Easyhaler, Ellipta, Genuair,&#xD;
      Handihaler, Nexthaler, pMDI, pMDI plus spacer, Respimat and Turbohaler. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from respiratory outpatient clinics, hospital wards and from staff at Queen&#xD;
      Alexandra Hospital (QAH); from integrated outreach lung clinics, GP database searches,&#xD;
      clinics run in primary care settings, respiratory support groups in the Hampshire region, and&#xD;
      from students at the University of Portsmouth (UoP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will have their inhaler technique observed and corrected by a&#xD;
      specialist clinician, such as a nurse, pharmacist, physiotherapist or doctor using a&#xD;
      single-use placebo device. A placebo device is exactly the same as the inhaler that the&#xD;
      participant uses, but there is no active medication in the device. If any errors are made&#xD;
      using the placebo inhaler, these will be recorded using device-specific checklists based on&#xD;
      manufacturers' guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correcting inhaler technique is vitally important in the management of respiratory conditions&#xD;
      . Observing patients using their inhaler, identifying any errors in their technique, teaching&#xD;
      the correct inhaler technique and then observing the patient repeating the procedure&#xD;
      correctly should occur at the time of device prescription; however this often does not happen&#xD;
      and patients are left unsure how to use their inhaler and errors are commonplace. After&#xD;
      inhaler technique has been corrected in this study, a written information sheet with guidance&#xD;
      on how to use the inhaler will be provided to each participant to help reinforce the correct&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside recording any errors that participants using the inhalers have made, we will also&#xD;
      record additional information such as the type of inhaler they are observed using and how&#xD;
      long they have been using that inhaler; their age, gender and how many other inhalers they&#xD;
      are using in total; which lung condition they have and how badly it affects them and if they&#xD;
      have any other medical conditions. We will also record information using a questionnaire&#xD;
      called the SPURTM profiling tool, which assesses patients' beliefs and understanding around&#xD;
      their medication; this will be done using an iPad/tablet and all data that is inputted will&#xD;
      be anonymous and kept securely, as with all other information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected on this study will help HCP better understand which inhaler&#xD;
      technique errors are made most frequently associated with each different inhaler device. We&#xD;
      will also use the information gathered in this study, along with additional information&#xD;
      gathered from inhaler experts, to develop a method of scoring inhaler technique errors, which&#xD;
      will be tested in a future study. Such a scoring system does not currently exist in the UK&#xD;
      and will be a valuable tool in clinical practice to accurately measure how good people are at&#xD;
      using their inhalers.&#xD;
