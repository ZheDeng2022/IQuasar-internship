  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, third-party open (ie, participant-blind,&#xD;
      investigator-blind and sponsor-open), placebo-controlled, dose escalating clinical study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK and PD of PF-06480605 in Japanese&#xD;
      healthy adult participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 16 participants are planned to be enrolled into the study. The study consists&#xD;
      of 2 cohorts, and approximately 6 participants will be randomized to PF-06480605 and&#xD;
      approximately 2 participants will be randomized to placebo in each cohort. Each participant&#xD;
      will receive PF-06480605 or placebo subcutaneously.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. History of tuberculosis or active, latent or inadequately treated tuberculosis&#xD;
             infection as defined by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Have evidence of untreated or inadequately treated active or latent Mycobacterium&#xD;
             tuberculosis (TB) infection as evidenced by the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A positive QuantiFERON TB Gold In Tube (QFT-G) test or positive or borderline&#xD;
                  T-SPOT.TB (T Spot) test performed within the 12 weeks prior to Day 1. If the&#xD;
                  laboratory reports the test as indeterminate, the test should be repeated. If the&#xD;
                  result of the repeat test is indeterminate, a purified protein derivative (PPD)&#xD;
                  test may be substituted for the QFT-G test or T-Spot test only with approval from&#xD;
                  the Pfizer Medical Monitor on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Chest radiograph with changes suggestive of active TB infection within 3 months&#xD;
                  prior to Screening. Chest radiograph should be performed according to local&#xD;
                  standards of care or country specific guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. History of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB&#xD;
                  infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If a participant has previously received an adequate course of therapy for either&#xD;
             latent (9 months of isoniazid in a locale where rates of primary multi drug resistant&#xD;
             TB infection are &lt;5% or an acceptable alternative regimen) or active (acceptable multi&#xD;
             drug regimen) TB infection, neither a QFT-G test, a T-Spot test, nor a PPD test need&#xD;
             be obtained. Details of the previous course of therapy (eg, medication(s) used, dose,&#xD;
             duration of therapy) should be documented in the source documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A chest radiograph should be obtained if not done within the 3 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening. To be considered eligible for the study, the chest radiograph must be&#xD;
             negative for active TB infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A participant who is currently being treated for active TB infection must be excluded&#xD;
             from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A participant who is being treated for latent TB infection can only be enrolled with&#xD;
             confirmation of current incidence rates of multi drug resistant TB infection,&#xD;
             documentation of an adequate treatment regimen, and prior approval of the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within&#xD;
             7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Recent exposure to live vaccines within 28 days of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known exposure to anti-TL1A (PF-06480605) or any type of anti-TL1A therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 4 months (or as determined&#xD;
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational&#xD;
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Screening supine blood pressure (BP) &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic),&#xD;
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90&#xD;
             mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP&#xD;
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Baseline 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results&#xD;
             (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle branch block&#xD;
             [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST T interval&#xD;
             changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third degree atrioventricular&#xD;
             [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline&#xD;
             uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the&#xD;
             Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and&#xD;
             reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be&#xD;
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread&#xD;
             by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5&#xD;
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,&#xD;
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1&#xD;
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations and platelet donations) of approximately&#xD;
             &gt;=400 mL within 3 months or &gt;=200 mL within a month prior to dosing. Additionally,&#xD;
             approximately &gt;=400 mL within 4 months for female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of substance abuse within 12 months of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Pregnant females; breastfeeding females.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Males who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as&#xD;
             outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and until discharge from the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations&#xD;
             section of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and&#xD;
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or&#xD;
             Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
