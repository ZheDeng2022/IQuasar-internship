  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to learn about the safety of drug BAY1817080 at different&#xD;
      doses and the resulting blood levels of the study drug in Japanese healthy adult male&#xD;
      participants. Study drug BAY1817080 is a drug under development with a goal to suppress pain&#xD;
      and chronic cough. It works by binding to and blocking proteins expressed on the sensory&#xD;
      nerves of the womb tissue, bladder or airway which are oversensitive in the patients with&#xD;
      endometriosis (a condition where the tissue that usually grows inside the womb grows outside&#xD;
      of the womb), overactive bladder (a condition that causes a sudden urge to urinate often or&#xD;
      more frequently) and long-standing cough with or without clear causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will receive either the study drug or placebo tablets (a placebo&#xD;
      looks like the test drug but does not have any medicine in it). The dosage will be either one&#xD;
      single dose of study drug/placebo received on only one day or multiple doses of study&#xD;
      drug/placebo received twice daily for 13 days plus one dose in the morning of the 14th day.&#xD;
      The total study duration for each participant will be usually no more than 42 days. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected from the participants to monitor the safety and measure the blood&#xD;
      level of the study drug.&#xD;
