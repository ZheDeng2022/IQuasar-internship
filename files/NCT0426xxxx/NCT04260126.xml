  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VERSATILE-002 is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      PDS0101 administered in combination with pembrolizumab in adults with HPV16 and PD-L1&#xD;
      positive recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PDS0101 is a novel T-cell immunotherapy delivered subcutaneously that has been shown to&#xD;
      stimulate high levels of HPV16-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells within patients by activating&#xD;
      multiple immune pathways. These HPV-specific T cells then target tumors such as head and&#xD;
      neck, anal and cervical cancers that are caused by HPV infection. The number of HNSCC cases&#xD;
      has been increasing steadily over the last 10-15 years and over 90% of HPV-positive head and&#xD;
      neck cancers are HPV16 positive. Pembrolizumab has been shown to have efficacy against both&#xD;
      HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck cancers. However, its effectiveness is more&#xD;
      optimal in tumors that are PD-L1 positive and have evidence of immune cells within the tumor.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that increasing tumor-targeting HPV-specific T-cells with PDS0101 will be&#xD;
      associated with an increased response to pembrolizumab. This study will explore in a&#xD;
      preliminary manner whether combination treatment with PDS0101 plus pembrolizumab will improve&#xD;
      clinical efficacy over that seen with pembrolizumab alone in the KEYNOTE-048 study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled into either the checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) naïve cohort or the CPI&#xD;
      refractory cohort.&#xD;

             pregnancy test (within 72 hours) prior to treatment. If the urine test is positive or&#xD;
             cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD- L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent with an&#xD;
             agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4,&#xD;
             OX40, CD137) and was discontinued from that treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents&#xD;
             within 30 days prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to &lt;Grade 1 or&#xD;
        baseline. Subjects with &lt;Grade 2 neuropathy and &lt;Grade 2 alopecia are an exception to this&#xD;
        criterion and may qualify for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the&#xD;
        toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. Subjects&#xD;
             must have recovered from all-radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids&#xD;
             and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative&#xD;
             radiation (&lt;2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non- CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coordination and timing of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination should be&#xD;
             based on local investigator clinical assessment and judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Whenever possible, it is recommended to avoid COVID vaccination on the day of PDS0101&#xD;
        and/or pembrolizumab dosing because it may be difficult to attribute certain AEs (eg,&#xD;
        fever, infusion reaction) to the study drug(s) or the COVID vaccine if they are both&#xD;
        administered on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g. FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

             necrosis factor, interleukins, immunoglobulins or other biological response modifiers&#xD;
             [GM-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony- stimulating&#xD;
             factor]) within 6 weeks prior to administration of the first study combination&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or has used an investigational device within 30 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Subjects who entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may participate&#xD;
        as long as it has been 30 days after the last dose of the previous investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within the last&#xD;
             5 years. (Subjects eligible as long as there are no symptoms of graft- versus-host&#xD;

             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;

             or recent use of physiologic doses of intra-articular, topical, or inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 3 years. Note: Subjects with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ (eg, breast carcinoma,&#xD;
             cervical cancer in situ) or other malignant tumors that have undergone potentially&#xD;
             curative therapy are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatosis&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks by repeat imaging (note that repeat imaging should be performed during study&#xD;
             screening clinical stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14&#xD;
             days prior to first dose of study treatment).&#xD;

             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin or physiologic&#xD;
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not&#xD;
             consider a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

             known quantitative HCV RNA results greater than the lower limits of detection of the&#xD;
             assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
