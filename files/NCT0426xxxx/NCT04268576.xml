  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an observational study, prospective in order to assess the impact of the implementation&#xD;
      of an early rehabilitation program on post-operative recovery. this is measured by the qOR15&#xD;
      questionnaire in patients operated on for a programmed hysterectomy, it takes place in the&#xD;
      gynecology department of the CHR Metz-Thionville hospital.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This program implemented will comply with HAS recommendations. The only change in management&#xD;
      for patients participating in the study is the completion of the self-questionnaire QOR-15 on&#xD;
      D-1 (the day before surgery), D0 (the day of the surgery) and D1 (the day after the surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to include 74 patients before the implementation of the early rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol and 74 patients after the implementation of the early rehabilitation protocol. The&#xD;
      total duration of inclusion is established at 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measures applied should improve the patient's well-being and accelerate his return to&#xD;
      normal life and therefore reduce the length of his stay.&#xD;

    <description>The QoR score 15 is a self-questionnaire of 15 items, each scored from 0 to 10. These items assess 5 dimensions of post-operative recovery: pain, physical comfort, functional autonomy, emotions and psychological support. These 15 items represent the quality of post-operative rehabilitation in its physical and mental dimensions.&#xD;
A variation of 8 points is considered significant.</description>
