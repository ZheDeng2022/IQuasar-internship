  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MEDRA study is a 12-week randomised controlled trial that aims to assess effects of a&#xD;
      Mediterranean dietary telehealth intervention compared to the Irish Healthy Eating guidelines&#xD;
      on the physical function and quality of life of adults living with Rheumatoid Arthritis in&#xD;
      Ireland. Investigators will be able to determine how closely people living in Ireland can&#xD;
      accept the Mediterranean dietary practices and adhere to them with dietetic input and&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term inflammatory disease which commonly occurs in the&#xD;
      small joints of the hands, wrists and feet leading to swelling, pain and stiffness in the&#xD;
      affected joints. The condition is two to three times more prevalent in women than in men.&#xD;
      Although it might occur at any age, the incidence of the disease is highest between the ages&#xD;
      of 40 and 65 years. Currently, there is no treatment that provides complete remission of the&#xD;
      disease for people living with RA. Treatment of RA aims to reduce the symptoms and improve&#xD;
      the health of the patient. Although diet is not part of the mainstream treatment, many&#xD;
      studies have reported beneficial effects of certain diets on RA symptoms. The MEDRA study&#xD;
      will examine the habitual dietary intakes of people living with RA in Ireland and will&#xD;
      explore whether people with RA will benefit from either a Mediterranean dietary pattern or&#xD;
      the Healthy eating guidelines in Ireland. This small scale study will provide useful&#xD;
      information on whether people with RA in Ireland can adhere to a Mediterranean dietary&#xD;
      pattern and whether the intervention will have beneficial impact on the physical function and&#xD;
      quality of life. This is important work prior to proceeding to larger intervention studies.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is based on components of the traditional Mediterranean diet which is primarily a plant based diet and emphasises intakes of vegetables, whole grains and fruit with the main added fat being extra virgin olive oil.The diet will be modified and tailored to cultured preferences by the registered dietitian. Participants will be informed of their diet allocation group during the baseline teleconsultation and will commence the diet the following day or as soon as is feasible for 12 weeks. Participants will be provided with resources specifically designed to explain the components of the Mediterranean diet and how it will be followed.</description>
