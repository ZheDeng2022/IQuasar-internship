      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is treated with steroids. But some people cannot take steroids,&#xD;
      or steroids don t work. Other patients must get blood transfusions regularly which are time&#xD;
      consuming and can have significant side effects. The drug eltrombopag can increase red blood&#xD;
      cells. Researchers want to see if it can help people with DBA and, if so, for how long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in people with DBA who have not responded to&#xD;
      steroids or could not take them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 2 and older with DBA who did not respond to steroids or could not take them, or&#xD;
      their disease has returned despite taking them&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and medicine history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy: A thin needle will remove a marrow sample from the participant s hip&#xD;
      bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take eltrombopag pills once daily for 24 weeks. They will have blood taken&#xD;
      every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits 6 months. At 6 months, they will repeat all the screening tests&#xD;
      and also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality-of-life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental test (for participants younger than 18 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants blood cell counts improve, they may keep taking eltrombopag for up to 3 more&#xD;
      years. If so, they will have blood taken every 4 weeks. They will visit NIH every 6 months&#xD;
      and repeat the above tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for up to 3 years after they stop taking eltrombopag. They&#xD;
      will visit NIH 6 months after treatment ends. If participants blood counts go down after&#xD;
      treatment ends, they may restart the drug....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a heritable bone marrow failure (BMF) syndrome characterized&#xD;
      by selective erythroid defects typically presenting within the first year of life as a&#xD;
      normochromic, macrocytic anemia with reticulocytopenia. More than half of all DBA cases are&#xD;
      associated with either inherited or spontaneous mutations in ribosomal proteins, making DBA a&#xD;
      prototypic ribosomopathy . Furthermore, although the primary presentation is isolated anemia,&#xD;
      as life expectancy has improved, progressive defects in other lineages have now been&#xD;
      identified, consistent with a long-term stem cell defect. Current standard of care for DBA is&#xD;
      the use of systemic corticosteroids, the mechanism of which is unclear, although only half&#xD;
      show an initial response. Even when a response to steroids is observed, long-term steroid&#xD;
      therapy carries significant morbidity, especially in children or in combination with&#xD;
      transfusion-associated iron overload, and thus most cannot tolerate high-dose steroids&#xD;
      long-term. Responses are rare with second-line immunomodulatory agents. Yet other than&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in those patients with healthy matched&#xD;
      donors, there are no alternative therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one model for DBA pathogenesis, the defects lead to an overabundance of the iron-carrying&#xD;
      moiety heme in primitive erythroid cells, unbound by protein. Free heme is toxic to cells,&#xD;
      likely exacerbated over time by iron overload due to transfusions. Ongoing work with&#xD;
      eltrombopag (EPAG) has shown that it is capable of acting as a potent iron chelator,&#xD;
      including intracellular iron, with evidence that this effect of EPAG can reverse the impact&#xD;
      of excess heme and elevated reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, in a recent trial of EPAG&#xD;
      for moderate aplastic anemia or hypoproliferative unilineage cytopenias, we identified a&#xD;
      robust response to EPAG in the one DBA patient enrolled in this clinical trial. This response&#xD;
      has been durable over more than three years since study entry, but requires continuous EPAG&#xD;
      to maintain transfusion independence. From these data, we hypothesize that EPAG may be able&#xD;
      to improve production of red blood cells in DBA patients via chelation of iron and subsequent&#xD;
      reduction in heme synthesis, resulting in decreased toxicity to bone marrow stem cells and&#xD;
      developing erythroid cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a single-arm, pilot trial in patients with steroid-refractory or&#xD;
      steroid-intolerant DBA, treating with a fixed dose of EPAG for 6 months to assess safety and&#xD;
      efficacy at improving hematological manifestations of DBA. Responders at 6 months will be&#xD;
      able to continue EPAG on the extension part of this protocol for an additional 3 years. We&#xD;
      will examine the hematologic, molecular, cytogenetic and clonal responses to EPAG in&#xD;
      responders and non-responders alike. Translational studies will examine the mechanism of&#xD;
      activity of EPAG in DBA through its effects on iron metabolism, erythroid differentiation,&#xD;
      apoptosis, global transcriptome and TPO signaling pathways in patient s hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      and progenitor cells (HSPCs).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;

                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In&#xD;
                  the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman&#xD;
                  has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment should she be considered&#xD;
