  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RV521 is to being developed to treat RSV infection and disease in susceptible individuals at&#xD;
      high risk for complications. This is an international, multicenter, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects are adults with a documented symptomatic RSV infection who have undergone&#xD;
      HCT transplantation and are moderately to severely immunocompromised. Qualified subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive RV521 or placebo, twice daily for 10 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the viral load, safety, tolerability, and clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of RV521 compared to placebo. This is a Phase 2, international, multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Up to 200 adult subjects with a&#xD;
      documented symptomatic RSV URTI who have undergone HCT within 1 year of randomization and who&#xD;
      are moderately to severely immunocompromised will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive RV521 capsules or matching&#xD;
      placebo twice daily for 10 days. After the completion of the 10-day double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period, subjects will be followed for an additional 28 days. Study drug may be taken on an&#xD;
      outpatient or inpatient basis, depending on clinical status and site practices. Randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by type of HCT graft and ALC count. There are 9 clinic visits planned for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
