      Objective 1: Characterize indices of systemic inflammation and gut microbiota composition and&#xD;
      function after chronic (12 weeks) intake of pulses compared to control diet in human OW/OB-IR&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Characterize dietary- and microbial-derived metabolite pools after regular&#xD;
      intake of pulses (12 weeks) in human participants with OW/OB-IR compared to control diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Characterize cognitive functioning after chronic (12 weeks) intake of pulses&#xD;
      compared to control diet in human OW/OB-IR participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study will be conducted in humans according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      guidelines. All subjects will review and sign an Informed Consent Form approved by the&#xD;
      Illinois Institute of Technology's Institutional Review Boards (IRB) prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a randomized, 3-arm, parallel, placebo-controlled design to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of pulses consumption compared to non-pulse foods on indices of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and gut microbiota composition and function over a 12-week period. Potential&#xD;
      changes in cognition will also be assessed. The study will test 3 treatment conditions in&#xD;
      overweight (OW)/obese (OB) human subjects with insulin resistant (IR). Eighty-three men and&#xD;
      women will be recruited, aiming for a completer set of Sixty-six subjects. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized into one of the three study food intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group, (n=22): This group will receive a cup of white rice 7 days/week over a&#xD;
           12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Black bean group, (n=22): This group will receive a cup of black bean 7 days/week over a&#xD;
           12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chickpea group, (n=22): This group will receive a cup of chickpea 7 days/week over a&#xD;
           12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be asked to come for 1 Screening Visit, 4 biweekly food pick-up/compliance&#xD;
      visits and 3 Test Day Visits (two of which will also include cognitive testing). The initial&#xD;
      screening visit will provide subjects with their site-specific, IRB-approved informed consent&#xD;
      document prior to the start of any study-related procedures. Following 1-week diet&#xD;
      stabilization and wash in from anthocyanins and ellagitannins, eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive 1 of 3 test treatments based on a randomization schedule. The three&#xD;
      main Test Day visits will occur at week 0 (day 1; baseline), end of week 6 (mid-point) and at&#xD;
      the end of week 12 (end-point). Cognitive testing will occur during the baseline Test Day at&#xD;
      week 0, and again at end-point Test Day at week 12. Subjects will be given a breakfast meal&#xD;
      before cognitive testing. Pick-up Visits will occur at week 2, 4, 8, and 10. Subjects will&#xD;
      pick-up study foods receive dietary counseling, confirm diet compliance and have&#xD;
      anthropometrics checked during pick-up visits. Each of the 3 Test Day Visits will last about&#xD;
      2.5-3 h (not including cognitive testing) and involve blood pressure (BP) measurements,&#xD;
      anthropometric (weight, waist circumference; body composition) assessment, and an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed. Urine and fecal samples will be collected to&#xD;
      monitor modifications occurring in the metabolites during the supplementation. The two-Test&#xD;
      Day Visits (baseline and end-point) will also include an additional 1-1.25 h of cognitive&#xD;
      testing, for a total of 3.75-4.5 h of total subject time (as there will be a short break&#xD;
      between OGTT and cognitive testing). Subjects will maintain daily food and GI-tract diary&#xD;
      during the 12-week feeding trial. The diary will include questions about food intake and the&#xD;
      condition of gastrointestinal tolerance and bowel function.&#xD;
