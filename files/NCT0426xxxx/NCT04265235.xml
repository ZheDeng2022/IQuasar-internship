    <textblock>
      A prospective, single centre, single-arm, pilot study investigating the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of a 12-week remotely-monitored home-based exercise program in patients with refractory&#xD;
      fatigue (based on PBC-40 Quality of Life measure) secondary to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis.&#xD;

      Recruitment from the research nurse-led PBC clinic: Eligibility screen followed by&#xD;
      recruitment letters being sent to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outpatient clinic review by the liver specialist physiotherapist (week 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a baseline assessment of quality of life, anthropometry, functional&#xD;
      capacity (with validated tools including the incremental shuttle walk test and short&#xD;
      performance battery test) and exercise tolerance. At the same visit, patients will be&#xD;
      prescribed and trained to perform the individualised Home-based Exercise Program. Patients&#xD;
      will be provided with an accelerometer to assess daily step count and a symptoms/side effects&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six weeks of telephone support (weeks 0-6):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be telephoned weekly over a period of 6 weeks, in order to evaluate compliance&#xD;
      with therapy and any difficulties encountered. At each phone call, the daily step count and&#xD;
      the intensity of the resistance-exercises will be adjusted to the patients ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outpatient clinic review by the liver specialist physiotherapist (week 6 +/- 5 days):&#xD;
      Reassessment of baseline parameters of quality of life, functionality and exercise tolerance;&#xD;
      and modification of step count targets and resistance-exercise intervention as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outpatient clinic review by the liver specialist physiotherapist (week 12 +/- 5 days):&#xD;
      Reassessment of baseline parameters of quality of life, functionality and exercise tolerance;&#xD;
      and modification of step count targets and resistance-exercise intervention as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validate the efficacy of exercise intervention: Given that the goal is to improve&#xD;
      fatigue-related symptoms and thus patient quality of life, the investigators will determine&#xD;
      the interim efficacy and longevity of intervention using a multi-modal patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome approach. This will principally be through changes in validated quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      scoring measures at baseline and during sequential study visits; including the fatigue domain&#xD;
      of the PBC-40 QoL measure (primary outcome measure), in addition to the relevant PBC-40&#xD;
      domains of cognitive, social, emotional and overall symptom burden; the Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale (HADS); Epworth Sleepiness Scale to assess daytime somnolence;&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Health Assessment Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PROMIS-HAQÂ®) to assess functional status, and the Cognitive Failure questionnaire (COGFAIL)&#xD;
      to determine cognitive functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collated onto a standardised clinical case record form. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      audited after 6 months to determine whether the intervention has proven beneficial to&#xD;
      patients, and whether improvements in functional status correlate with changes in fatigue and&#xD;
      QoL scores&#xD;
