      In this study the investigators plan to examine the perioperative use of sufentanil&#xD;
      sublingual (SL) in the analgesic regimen for spine surgery, one of the most common surgeries&#xD;
      performed in the US. Patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery often experience severe pain&#xD;
      during the first three postoperative days. Currently, no data are available for this patient&#xD;
      population which routinely experiences moderate to severe acute pain. The investigators will&#xD;
      analyze whether sufentanil SL is associated with lower opioid consumption, number of fentanyl&#xD;
      boluses given, post-anesthesia care unit and hospital length of stay, side effects of opioid&#xD;
      use (i.e., nausea, vomiting, constipation), and hospitalization costs (i.e.,&#xD;
      pharmacoeconomics).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sufentanil, unlike morphine and hydromorphone, avoids the issue of active metabolites that&#xD;
      can lead to prolonged, untoward effects, which can complicate postoperative care and affect&#xD;
      patient discharge. One study found that sufentanil SL 30 mcg was well tolerated, with no&#xD;
      unexpected adverse events, no clinically meaningful vital sign changes, and a safety profile&#xD;
      that was as expected for this postoperative patient population. In addition, the use of&#xD;
      sufentanil SL in the emergency department indicates that sufentanil SL was a potentially&#xD;
      feasible option for managing moderate-to-severe acute pain in that setting. Another study of&#xD;
      adult patients undergoing major surgery in five hospitals in the Netherlands who received the&#xD;
      sufentanil SL for postoperative pain relief as part of multimodal pain management showed that&#xD;
      sufentanil SL effectively managed postoperative pain in abdominal and orthopedic surgeries.&#xD;
      Finally, a randomized, open-label non-inferiority study that enrolled patients scheduled for&#xD;
      elective major open abdominal or orthopedic surgery assessed the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      responded &quot;good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot; at the 48-hour timepoint on the Patient Global Assessment of&#xD;
      method of pain control. The results showed that 78.5% vs. 65.6% of patients achieved&#xD;
      &quot;success&quot; for sufentanil SL vs. intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (morphine),&#xD;
      respectively, demonstrating non-inferiority as well as statistical superiority for treatment&#xD;
      effect. Patients using sufentanil SL reported more rapid onset of analgesia and patient and&#xD;
      nurse ease of care and satisfaction scores were higher than intravenous patient-controlled&#xD;
      analgesia (morphine). Adverse events were similar between the 2 groups, and sufentanil SL had&#xD;
      fewer patients experiencing oxygen desaturations below 95% compared to intravenous&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia (morphine). Future studies are needed to determine patient&#xD;
      populations that benefit most from the sufentanil SL, assess the added values versus&#xD;
      intravenous patient-controlled analgesia, and determine the pharmacoeconomics of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators plan to examine the perioperative use sufentanil SL in the&#xD;
      analgesic regimen for spine surgery, one of the most common surgeries performed in the United&#xD;
      States. Patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery often experience severe pain during the&#xD;
      first three postoperative days. Currently, no data are available for this patient population&#xD;
      which routinely experiences moderate to severe acute pain. The investigators will analyze&#xD;
      whether sufentanil SL is associated with lower opioid consumption, number of fentanyl boluses&#xD;
      given, post-anesthesia care unit and hospital length of stay, side effects of opioid use&#xD;
      (i.e., nausea, vomiting, constipation), and hospitalization costs (i.e., pharmacoeconomics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The perioperative use of sufentanil SL 30 mcg in a prospective cohort of patients&#xD;
           undergoing spine surgery will be associated with lower postoperative numeric rating&#xD;
           scale pain scores (numerical rating score (NRS); primary outcome) than observed in two&#xD;
           historical control groups that did not receive sufentanil SL: one group that received&#xD;
           intraoperative remifentanil infusion and one that received intraoperative sufentanil&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The perioperative use of sufentanil SL will be associated with lower opioid consumption,&#xD;
           number of fentanyl boluses given, post-anesthesia care unit and hospital length of stay,&#xD;
           side effects of opioid use (i.e., nausea, vomiting, constipation), and hospitalization&#xD;
           costs (i.e., pharmacoeconomics) than observed in two historical control groups of&#xD;
           patients receiving remifentanil or sufentanil infusions without perioperative sufentanil&#xD;
           SL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective cohort study with historical controls. There will be 1&#xD;
      prospectively recruited study arm (20 patients receiving the study drug sufentanil SL) and 2&#xD;
      historical control arms (one that received an intraoperative remifentanil infusion, 80&#xD;
      patients, and the other that received an intraoperative sufentanil infusion, 80 patients,&#xD;
      both without sufentanil SL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria include patients undergoing spine surgery (≥ 2 levels) who are&#xD;
      opioid-naïve, ≥ 18 years old, considered American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1-4 and&#xD;
      also includes patients with impaired renal function. Exclusion criteria include those with&#xD;
      microdiscectomy or single level surgery, have chronic opiate use, liver disease,&#xD;
      allergy/hypersensitivity to sufentanil as well as patients with baseline dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      postoperative pain scores in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) postoperative pain scores&#xD;
      (inpatient)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      opioid consumption (morphine milligram equivalents, PACU and inpatient) Number of fentanyl&#xD;
      boluses given Post-anesthesia care unit length of stay (LOS, days) hospital LOS (min) nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, constipation sedation level (PACU) quality of recovery hospitalization costs&#xD;
      patient satisfaction score utilization of prescription opioids following discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      As shown above, the following secondary outcomes will also be collected in the prospective&#xD;
      cohort to obtain estimates that can be used to power future randomized controlled trials:&#xD;
      sedation level, quality of recovery, patient satisfaction score (satisfaction with the level&#xD;
      of pain control, 6-point scale), and utilization of prescription opioids following discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include adverse events and use of concomitant medications, periodic&#xD;
      monitoring of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate), and continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of oxygen saturation in the post-anesthesia care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study arm will receive general endotracheal anesthesia consisting of total&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia maintained with continued infusions of propofol (80-200 mcg/kg/min)&#xD;
      and sufentanil (0.2-0.3mcg/kg/hr). Anesthesia induction will be achieved with propofol&#xD;
      (1.5-2.5mg/kg), succinylcholine (1mg/kg), and sufentanil (10-20 mcg). The study group will&#xD;
      receive sufentanil SL 30 mcg at surgery end, but prior to emergence from anesthesia, and&#xD;
      after the patient is turned supine. Antiemetic prophylaxis will be administered&#xD;
      (ondansetron).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that sufentanil SL will be ordered as q1hr prn, meaning that repeat doses must be&#xD;
      administered at least 1 hr apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-anesthesia care unit, patients will be ordered to receive sufentanil SL 30 mcg&#xD;
      prn 1 hr for breakthrough pain (for numerical rating scale, NRS &gt; 3) as the 1st line&#xD;
      analgesic, with fentanyl as the rescue analgesic if the patient is still experiencing pain&#xD;
      (NRS &gt;3). The following opioid administration schema will be used for pain management in the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st line: sufentanil SL 30mcg (NRS &gt;3). 2nd line: Fentanyl 25-50mcg (NRS &gt;3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If upon arrival to the PACU the patient is still experiencing pain with NRS &gt;3 but&#xD;
           cannot yet receive a repeat dose of sufentanil SL (because of having received 1st dose&#xD;
           in the operating room less than 1 hour ago), then the patient can receive fentanyl&#xD;
           25-50mcg prn until eligible to receive sufentanil SL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If at any time the patient's NRS &gt;3 after 20 min following an administration of either&#xD;
           sufentanil SL or fentanyl, the patient can receive a repeat dose of fentanyl until again&#xD;
           eligible to receive sufentanil SL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is transferred to the floor, both groups will receive the standard of care&#xD;
      postoperative pain management orders (ie oral and intravenous prn analgesia for NRS &gt; 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size/Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a within-group standard deviation in post-anesthesia care unit NRS pain score of 2.5&#xD;
      points, enrollment of 20 patients in the prospective group and inclusion of at least 80&#xD;
      patients in each retrospective control group will provide at least 80% power at a two sided&#xD;
      alpha level of 0.025 (0.05/2 pair-wise comparisons) to detect a minimal clinically important&#xD;
      difference of 2 points between the prospective group and each of the retrospective groups&#xD;
      using linear regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes will be compared between the prospective group and each of the retrospective&#xD;
      groups using linear regression weighted by inverse probability of treatment weights.&#xD;
      Probability of treatment (i.e., propensity scores) will be calculated using logistic&#xD;
      regression with the following covariates: age, sex, body mass index, American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists class, surgical invasiveness tier, reoperation, history of anxiety,&#xD;
      anxiolytic use, history of depression, and antidepressant use.&#xD;
