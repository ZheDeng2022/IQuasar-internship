      Clinical study to demonstrate an at least equivalent performance of a new PET molecular&#xD;
      Imaging radiopharmaceutical named [18F] LBT-999 in brain imaging compared to the SPECT&#xD;
      reference method named [123I]-FP-CIT to establish the differential diagnosis between&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease and Essential Tremor.&#xD;
