      This phase IV trial compares 3 different dosing schedules to find the optimal number of doses&#xD;
      for HPV vaccination in children and adolescents living with HIV. Comparing 3 different dosing&#xD;
      schedules may help researchers determine whether a single dose of HPV vaccine could be&#xD;
      effective in preventing HPV in children and adolescents living with HIV.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Participants living with HIV are randomized to one of three arms. HIV-negative&#xD;
      participants are assigned to a fourth arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Participants living with HIV receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent&#xD;
      vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at enrollment, and at 2 and 6 months. Participants also receive&#xD;
      recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine booster dose IM at 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Participants living with HIV receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent&#xD;
      vaccine IM at enrollment and at 6 months. Participants also receive recombinant human&#xD;
      papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine booster dose IM at 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 3: Participants living with HIV receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent&#xD;
      vaccine IM at enrollment. Participants also receive recombinant human papillomavirus&#xD;
      nonavalent vaccine booster dose IM at 24 months and recombinant human papillomavirus&#xD;
      nonavalent vaccine completion dose IM at 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 4: Participants without HIV receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine&#xD;
      IM at enrollment. Participants also receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent&#xD;
      vaccine booster dose IM at 24 months and recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine&#xD;
      completion dose IM at 30 months.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARMS 1-3: Children must be living with HIV. HIV infection must be confirmed by local&#xD;
             algorithm (positive nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT] test before 18 months of&#xD;
             age and/or positive serologic test thereafter)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARM 4: Children must be healthy (e.g., without autoimmune disease or cancer) and not&#xD;
             infected with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARMS 1-3: Children must be on a consistent, clinically appropriate combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for &gt; 6 months prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children must be 9-13 years-old (at or after 9th birthday, prior to 14th birthday) at&#xD;
             enrollment. This will allow vaccination of participants within the recommended age&#xD;
             range for receipt of HPV vaccination in Peru and Brazil. Only children ages 9-11 (at&#xD;
             or after 9th birthday, prior to 12th birthday) will be enrolled into arms 3 and 4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARMS 1-3: CD4% &gt; 15% or CD4 counts &gt; 200 cells/mm^3 (within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARMS 1-3: Viral load (VL) &lt; 400 copies/mL (within 6 months prior to study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All female participants must not be pregnant (all females will receive pregnancy tests&#xD;
             at all vaccine visits prior to receipt of study vaccine). The effects of Gardasil 9 on&#xD;
             the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. If&#xD;
             pregnancy is confirmed during the screening process, enrollment will not occur. If&#xD;
             pregnancy occurs after the first vaccine dose, additional vaccine doses will not be&#xD;
             administered, but the child will remain in study follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is anticipated that all children will enter the study prior to sexual debut,&#xD;
             although this will not be investigated clinically. Potential participants who report&#xD;
             sexual activity will not be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children in all arms must have the ability to understand and the willingness to assent&#xD;
             to the study. Parents or guardians must be able to understand and willing to sign a&#xD;
             written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who have a serious illness requiring treatment with systemic medications&#xD;
             other than ART (excluding short course oral steroids or inhaled steroid treatment for&#xD;
             asthma), are currently under immunomodulatory therapy, received immunosuppressive&#xD;
             therapy (&gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for &gt; 1 week) in the 6 months prior&#xD;
             to enrollment date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who received any vaccine within 3 weeks prior to enrollment date (these&#xD;
             children will be encouraged to enroll after 3 weeks have passed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who received blood-derived products within 6 months prior to enrollment or&#xD;
             planned use during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who weigh less than 18 kilograms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with cancer being treated with chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants receiving any other investigational agents may be excluded in&#xD;
             the opinion of the supervising physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children in all arms with contraindications to vaccination, including pregnancy or&#xD;
             breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who are enrolled and later found to be seropositive for HPV at study entry&#xD;
             (by Luminex assay performed by the Central Laboratory Core in Seattle) will be&#xD;
             discontinued from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to HPV vaccination&#xD;
