    <textblock>
      This study tests whether changing the relative order of presentation of post acute care&#xD;
      skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the Repisodic application, i.e., presenting preferred&#xD;
      SNFs (P-SNFs) first, increases selection of, and discharges to, P-SNFs and decreases lengths&#xD;
      of stay (LoS) for Geisinger patients discharged to SNFs. Along with the order of P-SNFs, the&#xD;
      study also assesses whether a short video reviewing the benefits of care coordination in&#xD;
      P-SNFs increases patient election to transfer to one.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in acute-care facilities (hospitals) who are being discharged to post-acute care&#xD;
      skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) currently struggle, in the absence of decision aids, to&#xD;
      obtain practical information about SNFs to which the patients must be discharged. The same&#xD;
      difficulties affect the attending case managers, social workers, and discharge planners.&#xD;
      Moreover, although preferred SNF (P-SNF) networks offer patients the potential for improved&#xD;
      coordination of care over non-preferred SNFs (NP-SNFs)-via shared staff across facilities and&#xD;
      electronic sharing of information-this aspect of SNF selection is not highlighted or shared&#xD;
      with patients according to any established protocol in the post-acute care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Repisodic application is a technology platform, accessed via laptop, smart phone, or&#xD;
      tablet, intended to provide a user-friendly approach to rapid SNF facility identification and&#xD;
      selection, with information provided on facility amenities and details, quality ratings,&#xD;
      distance, and fit for the patient's needs. It functions in a manner analogous to online&#xD;
      consumer search/sort/filter/quality applications, allowing the discharge planner to build a&#xD;
      curated list of discharge options matched to each patient's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to test whether highlighting and changing the&#xD;
      organization of, or information about, P-SNFs in the Repisodic app increases the selection&#xD;
      of, and placements in, P-SNFs, while decreasing length of stay (LoS) at the discharging&#xD;
      Geisinger acute care hospital. Our hypothesis is that presenting the P-SNF options at the top&#xD;
      of the list (for case managers) and as the only options on the first screen or default map&#xD;
      (for patients) will increase selection of and placement in P-SNFs, compared with the default&#xD;
      ranking of SNFs (according to fit) in Repisodic. Note that patients presented P-SNF options&#xD;
      on the first screen will always have the ability to expand the list to see all options they&#xD;
      have been given, thus preserving choice. We also hypothesize that the P-SNF focused&#xD;
      presentations will reduce LoS thanks to easier coordination between Geisinger hospitals and&#xD;
      P-SNFs. An introductory video describing the SNF selection and discharge process to patients,&#xD;
      will be available for optional viewing by patients across conditions. The optional link to&#xD;
      the video will be further highlighted and the video will include sections describing the&#xD;
      advantage of P-SNFs for care coordination, in the P-SNF focused (patient) conditions. The&#xD;
      video, when viewed, may therefore further enhance the appeal of P-SNFs to patients in the&#xD;
      conditions in which P-SNFs are highlighted. Secondarily, we hypothesize an overall reduction&#xD;
      in LoS (at the acute care hospital) due to the quicker decision making, selection, and&#xD;
      transmission processes facilitated by the Repisodic application. In a proportion of cases,&#xD;
      patients and/or their caregivers may only have access to the SNF list via paper printout, in&#xD;
      which case all relevant SNFs and their key characteristics will be included in the printout,&#xD;
      but the map and video will not be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cluster-randomized trial study design will randomize case managers to one of two&#xD;
      conditions (Default List vs. P-SNF Top-Sorted List) and patients to one of two conditions&#xD;
      (Full List/Full Map/Default Video vs. P-SNF List/P-SNF Map/P-SNF Video). Primary outcomes&#xD;
      include P-SNF selection and P-SNF placement (post-introduction of Repisodic) and LoS (i.e.,&#xD;
      the change in LoS from prior to Repisodic to post-Repisodic introduction). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include patient time spent selecting a SNF on Repisodic. Generalized linear mixed models will&#xD;
      be used to examine outcomes as a function of the conditions, accounting for patients nested&#xD;
      within case managers and controlling for potential covariates and moderators at the patient,&#xD;
      case manager, and discharging unit level. The findings will enhance our understanding of how&#xD;
      patients' informed choice, as facilitated by a bedside decision tool, affects SNF choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: random assignment of case managers to conditions will occur upon launch of the&#xD;
      application (anticipated: January, 2021) and any patients will be randomly assigned starting&#xD;
      at that time. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SNFs are experiencing aberrant&#xD;
      operational issues and bed availabilities. Furthermore, many patients who would be discharged&#xD;
      to SNFs under normal circumstances are being sent home instead. In order to improve&#xD;
      generalizability of the present study to post-pandemic circumstances, formal data collection&#xD;
      to assess the impact of the intervention on primary outcomes will begin after a &quot;pandemic&#xD;
      alleviation&quot; benchmark has been met. This benchmark specifies 25 or fewer average cases per&#xD;
      100,000 over a contiguous two-week period in the top 12 volume counties of Geisinger's&#xD;
      catchment area (Centre, Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Cumberland, Union, Snyder, Northumberland,&#xD;
      Montour, Columbia, Luzerne, and Lackawanna).&#xD;
