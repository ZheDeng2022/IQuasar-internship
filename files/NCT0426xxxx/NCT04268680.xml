      Gait analysis is a quick and powerful tool with a wide range of clinical applications in&#xD;
      various fields. However, due to the expensive and highly specialized equipment required, gait&#xD;
      studies are mostly limited to academic research centers and small sample sizes and no&#xD;
      large-scale, randomized controlled trials have been performed. Several authors have proposed&#xD;
      inexpensive accelerometer-based systems to remedy this situation. Through mathematic&#xD;
      transformation they adequately measure step time and length. With these systems however only&#xD;
      temporal spatial gait parameters can be recorded; kinetic gait parameters, such as ground&#xD;
      reaction force, cannot be measured. As these kinetic parameters are important for clinical&#xD;
      studies, especially in fracture and rehabilitation research different methods are needed. Its&#xD;
      availability is mainly limited to research centers, conventional gait analysis is further&#xD;
      hindered by its stationarity and that it only allows momentary views of the patient's gait in&#xD;
      a confined research environment. Even smaller, wearable systems have to be attached to an&#xD;
      external apparatus, or are limited by their battery capacity, data storage and other device&#xD;
      specific factors. Furthermore, the use of these systems is at an early clinical stage and&#xD;
      their full potential not yet developed. As most disease processes are continuous, tools with&#xD;
      long-term, continuous measuring capabilities are needed. For this reason a new&#xD;
      pressure-measuring insole with built in battery and data storage was developed in cooperation&#xD;
      with the AO Foundation(AO Foundation, Davos, Switzerland). The system offers complete&#xD;
      independence from any external measures for up to 4 weeks and monitors a patient step during&#xD;
      this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate which how TKA arthroplasty may impact gait&#xD;
      during early and medium term rehabilitation phase. This will be done through the use of the&#xD;
      OpenGo Sensor Insole (Moticon GmbH).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advanced degenerative arthropathies of the knee ultimately manifest as pain and a loss of&#xD;
      function leading to impaired gait and activity. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a procedure&#xD;
      that aim to eliminate pain, restore the function of the joint and ultimately improve the&#xD;
      ability of the patient to move and live an active life. TotalKneeArthroplasty has a history&#xD;
      of success, but as the orthopedic and healthcare sectors evolve, a greater level of scrutiny&#xD;
      and expectation for success will be applied to surgeons and device makers alike. In response&#xD;
      to these elevated levels of scrutiny and expectation more advanced methods will likely be&#xD;
      required to better capture and understand how a TotalKneeArthroplasty impacts patient&#xD;
      function both on an individual, patient by patient, basis as well as on device design and&#xD;
      surgical technique basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is aimed at performing a preliminary evaluation to provide:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More advanced insight into a patient's functional recovery and rehabilitation with the&#xD;
      potential for phisician's to intervene earlier and with greater specificity to any challenges&#xD;
      encountered by the patient Objective evidence of the quality and value of the intervention on&#xD;
      an individualized basis. Study objectives Any change in gait as a result of arthroplasty and&#xD;
      dynamics of gait recovery during acute recovery and rehabilitation timeframe. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will be gait cycle and ground: foot interaction dynamics which will be observed&#xD;
      longitudinally and compared to the healthy contralateral limb (ground: foot interaction&#xD;
      dynamics) as well literature data (gait cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:Evaluation of gait cycle and ground in primary TotalKneeArthroplasty&#xD;
      patients compared to the healthy contralateral limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:Easy of use. Qualitative user (Phisician and patient) feedback on&#xD;
      experience using and wearing the insoles Study design:This is, single arm, prospective,&#xD;
      single center, pilot study to measure the pre-operative and post-operative gait and ground:&#xD;
      foot interaction dynamics of 6 subjects who are undergoing TotalKneeArthroplasty .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that will be collected at baseline (pre-op) besides the standard clinical data&#xD;
      (VisualAnalogueScale, KneeSocietyScore SatisfactionForm-12, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Outcome Score(KOOS)) include: gait and ground: foot interaction dynamics during a prescribed&#xD;
      in clinic activity as well as during activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that will be collected about the clinical follow-up include: gait and ground: foot&#xD;
      interaction dynamics during a prescribed in clinic activity as well as during activities of&#xD;
      daily living; user feedback regarding their experience using and wearing the insoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration for study participants will be 6 months with follow-up visits planned&#xD;
      at: daily until discharge, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. Full enrollement&#xD;
      is estimated to require 1 months, therefore the total study duration is expected to be 7&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be included in 1 Italian site. Data and user feedback will be analyzed&#xD;
      continuously as they become available throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients selection:Once a subject has completed the informed consent procedure and signed the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form, the PI or delegated study research staff can complete the screening&#xD;
      process with the subject. All potential subjects who undergo the screening process will be&#xD;
      documented on a Screening and Enrollment Log, on which reasons for exclusion from or denial&#xD;
      to participate should be noted.&#xD;
