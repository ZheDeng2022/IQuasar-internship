  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using a consumer-based&#xD;
      mindfulness app, Calm, to reduce stress during pregnancy. Women will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      an intervention group (i.e., Calm) or standard care group and asked to participate in at&#xD;
      least 10 minutes of daily meditation for the duration of their pregnancy (i.e., 12-weeks'&#xD;
      gestation up to date of birth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Determine the feasibility (acceptability and demand) of using the Calm app at least&#xD;
      10-minutes per day for the duration of pregnancy (i.e., 12-weeks' gestation up to date of&#xD;
      birth). Acceptability will be measured with an investigator-developed satisfaction survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demand will be measured using time spent in meditation and meditations used (tracked by&#xD;
      Calm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, the benchmarks will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acceptability (i.e., satisfaction) 70% (n=34) of participants will report a 75%&#xD;
           satisfaction,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demand (i.e., time spent in meditation and meditations used,) 70% (n=34) of participants&#xD;
           will adhere to ≥75% of prescribed meditation using Calm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Determine the preliminary effects of using Calm at least 10-minutes per day for the&#xD;
      duration of pregnancy (i.e., 12-16 weeks' gestation to date of birth) on stress. Stress will&#xD;
      be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) at baseline (i.e., 12-16-weeks' gestation)&#xD;
      and every four weeks for the duration of the intervention using Ecological Momentary&#xD;
      Assessment (i.e., text message). Stress will also be measured using cortisol serum at&#xD;
      baseline (i.e., 12-16-weeks' gestation), and 32 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim #3: The investigators will explore the preliminary effects of using Calm at&#xD;
      least 10-minutes per day for the duration of pregnancy (i.e., 12-16 weeks' gestation to date&#xD;
      of birth) on gestational age of birth, fetal weight, APGAR scores (i.e., health score), and&#xD;
      neonatal complications with time spent in neonatal intensive unit (if applicable).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enrollment: Interested participants at Valley Perinatal Clinics will be asked for their email&#xD;
      and will be sent a link to a brief (5-10 minute) eligibility screener via RedCap (See&#xD;
      Eligibility screener). Eligible participants will be asked to watch a brief intake video&#xD;
      followed by a 3-question quiz and asked to sign an electronic informed consent prior to&#xD;
      completing any further surveys. After informed consents have been completed, participants&#xD;
      (N=97) will be identified. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      (See Surveys and Questionnaires document) and complete a medical history form, which will ask&#xD;
      participants to include a history of medications. They also will be asked to sign a medical&#xD;
      release form for their obstetrician. Ineligible participants will be notified by email&#xD;
      according to the script (See Email Scripts document).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be randomized into either the intervention (Calm App) or&#xD;
      standard prenatal care control and given further instructions to begin participating (See&#xD;
      Welcome Email in Email Scripts document).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are: (1) women 12-16 weeks pregnant, (2) &gt;18 years of age, (3) English&#xD;
      speaking, (3) not currently on steroid therapy, (4) willing to download the Calm app to their&#xD;
      smartphone, and (5) have not practiced meditation or mindful movement more than 60 minutes a&#xD;
      month in the past six months (6) willing to be randomized to one of two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: The control group will be asked to maintain normal activity and refrain from using&#xD;
      Calm meditation app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants (n=49) will be provided free access to and asked to register for&#xD;
      the consumer-based mobile meditation app on their phone. Participants (n=49) will then&#xD;
      receive an email containing 28 weeks of free access to Calm. Participants (n=49) will be&#xD;
      asked to use Calm at least 10 minutes per day and encouraged to use it as much as they would&#xD;
      like during the intervention. This prescription mimics how a new, paying member would use the&#xD;
      app (full exposure with autonomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meditation Tracking: Intervention participants (n=49) usage will be continuously tracked&#xD;
      throughout the intervention by Calm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Intervention group participants will receive self-report questionnaires (via&#xD;
      RedCap) at baseline, and post intervention only after informed consent has been is obtained.&#xD;
      Included within these questionnaires the investigators will measure demographics (baseline&#xD;
      only) and stress (using the Perceived Stress Scale), mindfulness (using the Mindfulness&#xD;
      Attention Awareness Scale), depression (using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale),&#xD;
      anxiety (using the Pregnancy Related Anxiety Questionnaire), self-compassion (using the&#xD;
      Self-Compassion Scale), emotional regulation (using the Difficulties in Emotional Regulations&#xD;
      Scale), gratitude (using the Gratitude During Pregnancy Scale), and childbirth experience&#xD;
      (using the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire). Every four weeks for the duration of the&#xD;
      intervention, the investigators will measure stress and mindfulness using Ecological&#xD;
      Momentary Assessment (i.e., text message). At baseline, mid-intervention (24-26 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation), and baseline (32-34 weeks' gestations) depression, anxiety, self-compassion,&#xD;
      emotional regulation, and gratitude will be measured. After the baby is born, depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, self-compassion, emotional regulation, and childbirth experience will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress will also be measured using cortisol serum at baseline (i.e., 12-16-weeks' gestation)&#xD;
      and 32 weeks. These tests will be performed at no additional cost to the participant. The&#xD;
      blood draws will be completed at Valley Perinatal Clinic by a trained employee of Valley&#xD;
      Perinatal Clinic. No more than one tube (10 mL) of blood will be taken for the cortisol serum&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A weekly log (via RedCap) recording any changes in medications will be sent to participants.&#xD;
      Any changes in medications, specifically ISSRs, will be accounted for in data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability is dually defined as participant satisfaction with content (i.e., Calm) and&#xD;
      perceived appropriateness and usefulness of the behavioral components (i.e., reminders,&#xD;
      self-monitoring) for self-management. Acceptability will be measured with an&#xD;
      investigator-developed satisfaction survey, included within the post intervention&#xD;
      questionnaire. Acceptability will be defined as 70% (n=34) of participants reporting a 75%&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demand will be measured by compliance to the &gt;10 mins/day and sustained use during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Demand (i.e., time spent in meditation and meditations used) will be defined as 70% (n=34) of&#xD;
      participants adhering to ≥75% of prescribed meditation using Calm. Demand will be measured by&#xD;
      Calm (internally) and shared with Arizona State University.&#xD;
