  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the pre-post effects of a single ZILRETTA knee&#xD;
      injection on physiological measures of self-reported pain and disability, physical&#xD;
      performance, and physical activity in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 35 symptomatic knee OA patients for this study. All data will be&#xD;
      collected prior to injection (baseline), as well as at 4 (post 1) and 8-week follow-ups (post&#xD;
      2).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) demonstrate significant physical disability which&#xD;
      leads to diminished physical activity, a lesser quality of life, as well as a higher risk of&#xD;
      inactivity related comorbidities including mortality. This is thought to be caused by an&#xD;
      inability to voluntarily activate your quadriceps muscle due, in part, to knee joint swelling&#xD;
      and joint-related pain. Incomplete muscle activation causes quadriceps weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with quadriceps weakness exhibit changes in their walking biomechanics which is&#xD;
      associated with diminished physical function and lesser physical activity in those with knee&#xD;
      OA. Therefore, it is critical to develop interventions that target mechanisms causing&#xD;
      decreased quadriceps activation in order to restore optimal walking biomechanics and improve&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ZILRETTA knee injection is an FDA approved, extended release corticosteroid for in&#xD;
      patients with knee osteoarthritis and has been shown to reduced knee pain for 3 months in&#xD;
      approximately 70% of patients. Currently, there are no studies that have examined ZILRETTA's&#xD;
      objective effectiveness on physical activity, biomechanics, and performance tests in patients&#xD;
      who have received an injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of the current study is to examine the effect of a ZILRETTA knee&#xD;
      injection on functional and performance tests including quadriceps neuromuscular activation,&#xD;
      quadriceps strength, walking gait biomechanics, and a battery of physical performance&#xD;
      outcomes at 4 and 8-weeks following injection in 35 individuals with knee OA.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Index is reliable and valid measure of self reported disability. The physical function consists of 17 items and asks about the magnitude of difficulty when ascending and descending stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on and taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in and out of the bath, sitting, getting on and off the toilet, completing heavy household duties, and completing light household duties. Each item is presented in a 5 point Likert-type format and uses the following descriptors for possible answer choices none, mild moderate, severe, and extreme. Each descriptor corresponds to an ordinal scale of 0-4. The scores are summed for the items in each subscale, with total possible ranges as 0-68. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate greater amounts of functional limitations.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) consists of five subscales: Pain (9 items), Symptoms (7 items), Function in Activities of Daily Living (17 items), Function in Sport and Recreation (5 items) and Knee Related Quality of Life (4 items). Each item is presented in a 5 point Likert-type format that ranges from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems). Totals from each subscale are transformed to a 0-100 score. Lower scores on the KOOS indicate greater amounts of functional limitations.</description>
