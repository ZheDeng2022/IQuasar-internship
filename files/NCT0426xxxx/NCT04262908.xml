  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of patients (15 to 45%) who have benefited from a total hip or knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery (THKA), are put on sick leave (SL). This SL allows these patients who had&#xD;
      a professional activity at the time of the intervention (age &lt;65 years) to enhance the&#xD;
      healing, improve the quality of life and ensure a functional return to work. The number of&#xD;
      patients returning to work and the time taken to return to work after the intervention are d&#xD;
      depending on the intervention (hip or knee) and are linked to socio-demographic factors, to&#xD;
      the patient's general condition (comorbidity, presence of other arthritis joints…) and the&#xD;
      type of professional activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating the impact of the type of professional activity on the return to work&#xD;
      after THKA are nonexistent in France, rare in the literature, mostly retrospective and&#xD;
      methodologically weak. In addition, the individual and socioeconomic impact of the cessation&#xD;
      of work after an THKA, the absence of national data assessing the predictive nature of&#xD;
      socio-professional categories on the return to work using a multivariate analysis motivated&#xD;
      us to set up this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data usually collected in the medical file will be collected as part of the preoperative&#xD;
      and 3 months postoperative study. As part of this study, a phone call will be made to contact&#xD;
      patients who have had a prolonged SL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During hospitalization Socio-demographic data: sex, age, title of the profession, the joint&#xD;
      concerned, family situation, place of life, postoperative availability of a caregiver or home&#xD;
      help if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data: Comorbidities, weight, height, date of the arthroplasty, per and or&#xD;
      postoperative complications of the arthroplasty, date of prescribed work stoppage&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 months postoperative: medical consultation Date of the 3-month consultation, date and&#xD;
      method of resumption of work, if applicable, otherwise the duration of the extension of the&#xD;
      duration of the SL, the doctor prescribing the extension and the causal link of this&#xD;
      extension to the arthroplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 months postoperative: telephone call This phone call will relate to patients whose work&#xD;
      stoppage has been extended. Will be collected, the date and the mode of resumption of work,&#xD;
      if not the cause of not resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients whose prolongation of SL has been prescribed by the attending physician, the&#xD;
      doctor of the rehabilitation center (knee prostheses) or by the occupational physician, the&#xD;
      latter will be contacted by telephone to collect the reason for prolongation of the TA.&#xD;
