      Objective of SepSIGN project is to validate biomarkers able to predict the clinical worsening&#xD;
      of patients freshly admitted at Emergency Department. Targeted population is adult patients,&#xD;
      freshly admitted at ED, with a suspected or confirmed infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is an important health issue with considerable socio-economic consequences. In 2017,&#xD;
      the World Health Association made sepsis a global health priority, and has adopted a&#xD;
      resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, a decrease in the mortality rate has been observed; in particular&#xD;
      thanks to improved management, more appropriate intervention approaches in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) and better recognition of organ failure. This statement is based on qSOFA and&#xD;
      SOFA scores from the international Sepsis-3 definition. Sepsis-3 can help front-line&#xD;
      clinicians detect severe patients with a higher risk of mortality but does not predict the&#xD;
      clinical deterioration especially in patients without initial organ dysfunction. Furthermore,&#xD;
      studies still demonstrate that 20% of patients with infection or uncomplicated sepsis&#xD;
      experience disease worsening within 72 hours after ED admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms and signs of sepsis are variable and this makes clinical recognition and assessment&#xD;
      very difficult in particular on Emergency Department (ED) patients due to their infectious&#xD;
      illness background and the frequent comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, as of today, no biological marker has yet been validated to appropriately&#xD;
      predict early deterioration in unselected patients admitted to the ED with acute infection,&#xD;
      irrespective of their clinical presentation. Physiology of sepsis is complex and some&#xD;
      underlying dysfunction could already exist in the early phase of sepsis before patients meet&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria. Thus, patients may be clinically asymptomatic at the origin of organ&#xD;
      failure. As a result, doubtful patients are often over-hospitalized while they could be&#xD;
      treated at home, leading to overcrowding and extra costs for hospitals In these conditions,&#xD;
      the main challenge of ED clinicians is differentiating mild infections from life-threatening&#xD;
      ones in the heavy workload of ED environment. Objective of SepSIGN project is to validate&#xD;
      biomarkers able to predict the clinical worsening of patients freshly admitted at Emergency&#xD;
      Department. Targeted population is adult patients freshly admitted at ED, whom blood samples&#xD;
      will serve to validate candidate markers.&#xD;
