      Prematurely born infants in the hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) will be included&#xD;
      in the study. This clinical trial is a randomized crossover study to show that our automated&#xD;
      oxygen control device performance is no worse than a NICU nurse in keeping a premature&#xD;
      neonate's SPO2 within the prescribed range. Since subjects receive the device (automatic&#xD;
      oxygen control) and the standard of care (manual control by a nurse), every subject serves as&#xD;
      their own perfectly matched control. Performance measures include the average time it takes&#xD;
      for the SpO2 to return to the desired range (primary endpoint) and the total amount of time&#xD;
      that the SpO2 is within the desired range (secondary endpoint). The device will be applied to&#xD;
      premature infants on respiratory support humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with&#xD;
      oxygen controlled using a blend valve. Two groups include one that begins the study period&#xD;
      with the device and one that begins the study period without the device. The two groups are&#xD;
      switched between manual and automatic every 6 hours into the trial period and complete a&#xD;
      total of 6 days. The target number of subjects is 60. We will analyze the study as a&#xD;
      superiority trial if there is strong evidence of superiority.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We intend to enroll between 20-30 subjects at each of two separate institutions (University&#xD;
      of Missouri Women's and Children's Hospital and Studer Family Children's Hospital in&#xD;
      Pensacola, FL). The subjects will be premature infants &lt;34 weeks post conceptual age (PCA)&#xD;
      requiring respiratory support. This randomized clinical trial will utilize a 24 period 2&#xD;
      treatment crossover design to show that the device performs no worse than (non-inferiority&#xD;
      trial) an NICU nurse in keeping a premature neonate's SpO2 within the prescribed range while&#xD;
      the infant is on respiratory support. Due to the nature of the study, any masking of the&#xD;
      intervention is not possible. Upon enrollment, the subjects will be randomized into&#xD;
      enrollment in two groups (A and B). The primary endpoint will be the mean time required to&#xD;
      re-establish SpO2 within the prescribed range, as measured from the time an out-of-range&#xD;
      alarm is triggered. A secondary endpoint will be proportion of time SpO2 is within the&#xD;
      prescribed range, using an area-under-the-curve approach (with a discrete state) to account&#xD;
      for varying time-on-test. These outcome measures are complementary because the former doesn't&#xD;
      account for the number of alarms, while the latter does. This is important because the oxygen&#xD;
      control device operates continuously in a proactive manner, rather than only reacting due&#xD;
      alarms, so it is doing more than mimicking the nurse -- the second measure allows us to&#xD;
      capture that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will initially have the automatic device interface with HFNC for 6 hours. The device&#xD;
      will have the target SpO2 parameters ordered by the treating physician input into the device.&#xD;
      A study laptop will interface with the device, cardiopulmonary monitor, and pulse oximeter to&#xD;
      record the data for the study. Sensors will be used to record all adjustments to the&#xD;
      device/respiratory support equipment (i.e. blend valve and flow valve used in HFNC). These&#xD;
      sensors will continuously record the data for later analysis. The device will constantly&#xD;
      evaluate data sent to it from the pulse oximeter and bedside monitor recording all of the&#xD;
      data and alarms. In response to alarms, displayed data, doctor's orders, etc., nurses will&#xD;
      continue to apply manual inputs to make adjustments to flow and provide tactile stimulus to&#xD;
      the subject but not adjust FiO2 unless manual mode is selected. Recorded sensor measurements&#xD;
      and manual inputs by the nurse will be used to refine the existing models as well as new&#xD;
      models of response in HR, RR, and SpO2 to flow adjustments and tactile stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 6 hours, the device will be switched to manual mode for the subject (nurse&#xD;
      makes all adjustments for FiO2), but the laptop and sensor data logging system will continue&#xD;
      to record data from the patient and the respiratory support equipment. This will record the&#xD;
      information for the nurse intervention/baseline care part of the study, which continue for 6&#xD;
      hours. During the entire process, the bedside nurse will keep a diary of any&#xD;
      events/interventions using the time prominently displayed on the monitoring laptop. This&#xD;
      &quot;time-stamped&quot; diary system will allow for easier retrieval of and comparison to the data&#xD;
      from the device and monitoring laptop. Also, the monitoring laptop will have a record of all&#xD;
      the data, including alarms from the pulse oximeter as well as the bedside monitor to allow&#xD;
      for easier retrieval of data related to alarm events and interventions. The laptop will also&#xD;
      record any interventions made by the device to allow for easier retrieval of data related to&#xD;
      device interventions. The treatment will then alternate periods of each treatment for a total&#xD;
      of 6 days (24 6-hour periods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will have the exact opposite order as group A. Group B infants will initially have&#xD;
      the laptop interface with all of the monitors and sensor measurements. However, the nurse&#xD;
      intervention/baseline care stage of the study will take place for the first 6 hours. Next,&#xD;
      group B will have the device interface with their respiratory equipment, and the data will be&#xD;
      recorded as described above for the next 6 hours of the study. The the treatment will&#xD;
      alternate every 6 hours for a total of 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design was chosen because the premature infants should have fewer events as they grow&#xD;
      older each day, and it will help take into account this potential bias. Also, the subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to group A or B in sets of 8 (i.e. in each group of 8 envelopes, 4 will be&#xD;
      group A and 4 will be group B). During the entire study process the infants will receive&#xD;
      normal NICU care and the parameters for the SpO2 range will be set by the physician caring&#xD;
      for the infant. There are also built in manual overrides for the device which allow the NICU&#xD;
      to make changes while the subject is on the device phase of the study. The device will be&#xD;
      able to record these changes and the staff will record their manual interventions in the&#xD;
      study diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have planned our sample size using a non-inferiority test for a cross-over design, based&#xD;
      on our primary endpoint, t_delta. For a given patient, define t_delta = (mean elapsed time&#xD;
      needed for device to re-establish SpO2 after alarm) - (mean elapsed time needed for nurse to&#xD;
      re-establish SpO2 after alarm). The margin of non- inferiority will be chosen as t_delta &gt;&#xD;
      -10 sec, so that a device which is no worse than 10 sec, on average, than a nurse will be&#xD;
      considered non-inferior. Assuming the standard deviation of t_delta =12 and the true mean&#xD;
      difference is zero under the alternate hypothesis, a sample size of 48 achieves 88% with&#xD;
      alpha=0.05. If there is 16% patient drop-out before crossover, so that the final n=40, the&#xD;
      power drops to 82%. In all analysis, a (paired) t-test will be used. Our secondary endpoint&#xD;
      is secondary endpoint is the proportion of time SpO2 is within the prescribed range, using an&#xD;
      area-under-the-curve approach (with a discrete state) to account for varying time-on-test.&#xD;
      Our secondary endpoint will be analyzed in a similar manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will plan for one interim analysis to determine if the trial should be stoopped early due&#xD;
      to futility (strong evidence of inferiority, where a confidence interval for t_delta lies&#xD;
      entirely to the left of -10 and doesn't intersect -10) or for efficacy (strong evidence of&#xD;
      superiority with margin &gt; +20 sec). This will be carried out when n=32 (16 subjects per site)&#xD;
      is attained and stopping decisions will be based on O'Brien-Fleming stopping principles. The&#xD;
      interim analysis will be carried out by an independent statistician on the University of&#xD;
      Missouri's Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, which is also available to monitor the study&#xD;
      for adverse events if requested by the IRB. In the event that the patient drop-out is greater&#xD;
      than 16% before crossover, then a more complicated estimation procedure will be employed&#xD;
      using mixed effects models; otherwise, complete cases will be used.&#xD;
