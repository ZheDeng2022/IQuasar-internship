  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that patients prescribed tofacitinib 11 mg Modified Release (MR)&#xD;
      formulation once daily (QD) will achieve similar benefit to those prescribed tofacitinib 5 mg&#xD;
      twice a day (BID) dosage in real world use. This study will therefore seek to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the MR 11 mg QD regimen to the IR 5 mg BID regimen for the treatment of RA&#xD;
      in a real-world registry of RA patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID) Improvement From Baseline Upto 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Up to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>MCID improvement assessed based on Clinical disease activity index (CDAI). CDAI: numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) based on a 28-joint assessment, patient global assessment (PtGA) and physician global assessment (PGA) assessed on 0-10 centimeter (cm) Visual analogue scale (VAS); CDAI total score = 0-76, higher scores=greater affection due to disease activity (DA). CDAI less than or equal to (&lt;=) 2.8 indicates disease remission, greater than (&gt;) 2.8 to 10 = low DA, &gt;10 to 22 = moderate DA, and &gt;22 = high DA. MCID improvement defined by difference in CDAI from baseline (at time of tofacitinib initiation) to 6 month visit. Participants were considered to show improvement from baseline on 3 cut points (1) greater than or equal (&gt;=) to 2 (for participants in low DA at baseline); (2) &gt;= 6 (moderate DA at baseline, and (3) &gt;= 11 (high DA at baseline).

CDAI: numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) based on a 28-joint assessment, patient global assessment (PtGA) and physician global assessment (PGA) assessed on 0-10 centimeter (cm) Visual analogue scale (VAS); CDAI total score = 0-76, higher scores=greater affection due to disease activity (DA). CDAI less than or equal to (&lt;=) 2.8 indicates disease remission, greater than (&gt;) 2.8 to 10 = low DA, &gt;10 to 22 = moderate DA, and &gt;22 = high DA. MCID improvement defined by difference in CDAI from baseline (at time of tofacitinib initiation) to 6 month visit. Participants were considered to show improvement from baseline on 3 cut points (1) greater than or equal (&gt;=) to 2 (for participants in low DA at baseline); (2) &gt;= 6 (moderate DA at baseline, and (3) &gt;= 11 (high DA at baseline).

        <description>Modified HAQ: participant-reported questionnaire for the assessment of ability to perform tasks due to rheumatoid arthritis. It comprised of 8 questions on 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; grip; walk; hygiene; reach; and common activities over past week before specified time point. Eight items were rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3, where 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty, higher scores indicating worse functioning. Participants who had a baseline mHAQ score of &gt;=0.25 were evaluable for this outcome measure and number of participants who had decrease from baseline in mHAQ score at Month 6 were reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Decrease From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>HAQ: participant-reported questionnaire for the assessment of rheumatoid arthritis. It comprised of 20 questions in 8 categories of activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; grip; walk; hygiene; reach; and activities over past week. Each activity was assessed on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3, where 0 = without difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty, higher scores indicating worse functioning. Participants who had a baseline HAQ score of &gt;=0.22 were evaluable for this outcome measure and number of participants who had decrease from baseline in HAQ score at Month 6 were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-joints Count (DAS28) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) at Month 6</title>
        <description>DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis, derived using differential weighting given to each of the four components. The components of the DAS28 (ESR) assessment included: TJC with 28 joints assessed, SJC with 28 joints assessed, ESR (millimeters per hour) and PtGA recorded on 100mm VAS (scores ranging 0 [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad]). DAS28 (ESR) was calculated as 0.56*sqrt (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt (SJC28) + 0.70*ln(ESR [mm/hour] + 0.014*PtGA [mm]; where, ln = natural logarithm, sqrt = square root of. Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D index: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. It assesses level of current health in 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Each dimension had 3 levels: no problems (1), some problems (2) and severe problems (3). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range 0 to 1, where 0=death and 1=perfect health; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on participants included in the study who were evaluable for EQ-5D score. Hence, &quot;Overall Number of Participants Analyzed&quot; signifies only those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
