      The EASE Clinical Trial is prospective, multi-center, single-arm (open-label),&#xD;
      non-randomized, clinical trial to evaluate the Minitouch Endometrial Ablation System&#xD;
      (&quot;Minitouch System&quot;) in premenopausal women with menorrhagia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The EASE Clinical Trial a prospective, multi-center, single-arm (open-label), non-randomized,&#xD;
      clinical trial of the safety and effectiveness of endometrial ablation with the Minitouch&#xD;
      System versus the FDA identified objective performance criteria (OPC) for global endometrial&#xD;
      ablation (GEA) devices. The goal of the trial is to support reasonable safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the investigational product compared to currently FDA-approved GEA devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only eligible participants will undergo the Minitouch procedure. Post-treatment follow-up&#xD;
      occurs approximately 24-hours post-procedure (via phone call) and in-person office visits&#xD;
      occur 2-weeks, 3, 6 and 12-months post-procedure. Additional longer term follow-ups occur&#xD;
      (via phone call or in-person office visits) 24 and 36-months post-procedure. The expected&#xD;
      length of participation is approximately 37 months (inclusive of one month for screening and&#xD;
      36-months of post-procedure follow-up).&#xD;
