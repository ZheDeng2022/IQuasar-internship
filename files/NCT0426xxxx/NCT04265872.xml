  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this pilot trial is that administration of bortezomib will inhibit NHEJ in&#xD;
      metastatic TNBC leading at the time of disease progression to metastases that are&#xD;
      HR-deficient and sensitive to pembrolizumab and cisplatin therapy. The trial will include in&#xD;
      depth analysis of the patients' TNBC genome and phosphoproteome to evaluate HR-proficiency&#xD;
      and deficiency, and nuclear proteins that drive NHEJ, before and upon progression with&#xD;
      bortezomib therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy to 80% of breast cancers have a basal gene expression profile which is characterized&#xD;
      by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation. HRD leads to&#xD;
      upregulation of the activity of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) error-prone pathway&#xD;
      that repairs DNA double strand breaks, a process required for TNBC survival. The hypothesis&#xD;
      of this pilot trial is that administration of bortezomib will inhibit NHEJ in metastatic TNBC&#xD;
      leading at the time of disease progression to metastases that are HR-deficient and sensitive&#xD;
      to pembrolizumab and cisplatin therapy. A patient with an exceptional complete and durable&#xD;
      response of her primary-refractory metastatic TNBC with PI3K pathway inhibition followed at&#xD;
      disease progression by nab paclitaxel/cisplatin provides the clinical rationale for the&#xD;
      present trial which will utilize bortezomib to inhibit HR proficiency prior to administration&#xD;
      of pembrolizumab and cisplatin in pretreated metastatic TNBC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive bortezomib until PD, followed by pembrolizumab and cisplatin until PD&#xD;
      or a maximum of 6 cycles on study. If patients are responding, they may continue&#xD;
      pembrolizumab at the physician's discretion off study. Metastatic TNBC patients will undergo&#xD;
      core needle biopsies of a metastatic lesion at study entry and at disease progression from&#xD;
      bortezomib for NGS, RPPA, and other molecular analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose disease does not respond to pembrolizumab and cisplatin may be treated with&#xD;
      standard of care breast cancer therapies off study, at the recommendation of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Female patients ≥18 years of age&#xD;

               2. Have a diagnosis of metastatic TNBC previously treated with standard&#xD;
                  anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and taxane chemotherapy, unless there was a&#xD;
                  contraindication to doxorubicin, in which case prior treatment with this agent is&#xD;
                  not required. NOTE: TNBC defined as ER-negative tumors with &lt; or = 10% tumor&#xD;
                  nuclei immunoreactivity, or &quot;ER Low Positive&quot; as defined by the updated ASCO/CAP&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Have not received more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease.&#xD;
