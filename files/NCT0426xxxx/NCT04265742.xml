    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota regulate metabolism of their human host. Some diseases are associated with&#xD;
      variations in gut microbiota diversity and higher fracture risk. Intestinal bacteria&#xD;
      synthesize or influence synthesis of factors modulating bone metabolism. The link between gut&#xD;
      microbiota and bone was assessed mainly in experimental animal studies. Clinical data, e.g.&#xD;
      on the role of gut microbiota in postmenopausal osteoporosis are scarce. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare gut microbiota composition in four groups of women aged ≥60 recruited on the&#xD;
      basis of bone mineral density (BMD) and personal history of fracture. the participants will&#xD;
      have diagnostic exams: clinical tests, bone densitometry (body composition, vertebral&#xD;
      fractures), high resolution peripheral QCT (bone strength estimated by microfinite element&#xD;
      analysis, micro-FEA), biological sample collection. Gut microbiome profiling will be&#xD;
      performed at the INRA MetaGenoPolis laboratory. The investigators will compare gut microbiota&#xD;
      diversity according to BMD level and to the fracture status. The investigators will analyze&#xD;
      interactions of the gut microbiota diversity with bone status (bone turnover rate, BMD, bone&#xD;
      microarchitecture, bone strength estimated by micro-FEA), muscle mass and strength,&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines and micro-RNAs modulating their expression. This study will provide&#xD;
      new data concerning the importance of gut microbiota for the fracture risk in older women. It&#xD;
      will help to identify the main metabolic pathways underlying the observed associations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a major public health problem in developed countries. Despite&#xD;
      the progress, knowledge of its pathophysiological mechanisms and identification of women at&#xD;
      high risk of fracture in the clinical practice are not satisfactory. Gut microbiota consist&#xD;
      of trillions of commensal bacteria playing a major role in the regulation of metabolism of&#xD;
      their human host. Some conditions (diabetes mellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease, end stage renal disease, depression, heavy drinking, heavy smoking) are&#xD;
      associated with variations in gut microbiota diversity and higher risk of fracture.&#xD;
      Intestinal bacteria synthesize or influence the synthesis of factors which modulate bone&#xD;
      metabolism, e.g. lipopolysaccharide (present in the wall of Gram-negative bacteria),&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines (synthesized in the gut associated lymphoid tissue), serotonin&#xD;
      (synthesized in the colon epithelium), short-chain fatty acids, estrogens (deconjugation of&#xD;
      sulphates and glucuronides). Data on the association between gut microbiota and bone&#xD;
      metabolism were obtained mainly in experimental animal studies. Clinical data are limited.&#xD;
      Data on the possible role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of the postmenopausal&#xD;
      osteoporosis are scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will carry out a cross-sectional comparison of gut microbiota composition&#xD;
      in four groups of women aged 60 and over recruited on the basis of their bone mineral density&#xD;
      (BMD) and personal history of fragility fracture. The primary statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      focused on the comparison of gut microbiota diversity according to BMD (in women with the&#xD;
      same fracture status) and according to the fracture status (in women with similar BMD). The&#xD;
      investigators will analyze interactions of the gut microbiota diversity, its metabolic&#xD;
      activity and other metabolic factors on the one hand, with bone status on the other hand. The&#xD;
      investigators will study the association of gut microbiota composition with bone turnover&#xD;
      rate, BMD, bone microarchitecture, bone strength estimated by microfinite element analysis&#xD;
      (micro-FEA) and with physical performance, muscle mass and strength. The investigators will&#xD;
      assess the impact of microRNAs modulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines on the&#xD;
      serum levels of these cytokines according to the pattern of gut microbiota diversity and&#xD;
      their associations with the characteristics of bone status (e.g. bone microarchitecture). The&#xD;
      investigators will analyze the association between serum serotonin, abundance of intestinal&#xD;
      bacteria stimulating serotonin synthesis (some Clostridia species) in the colon and the&#xD;
      characteristics of bone status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide new data concerning the importance of gut microbiota for the fracture&#xD;
      risk in older women. The main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design but this&#xD;
      is the first clinical study exploring this subject. It will help to identify the main&#xD;
      metabolic pathways underlying the observed associations. These data will stimulate&#xD;
      experimental studies to elucidate biological mechanisms underlying these associations. the&#xD;
      results will provide indications for future clinical and experimental studies. In the long&#xD;
      run, the results will lead up to future studies permitting to develop new biological markers&#xD;
      of fracture risk in older women and new anti-osteoporotic medications.&#xD;
