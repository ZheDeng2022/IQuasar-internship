      randomised control clinical trial to evaluate miltefosine, thermotherapy and the combination&#xD;
      miltefosine-thermotherapy are effective, safe and tolerable alternative treatment options to&#xD;
      treat cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. tropica, in Pakistan compared to the standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now, there is no well-established evidence based option to treat CL caused by the&#xD;
      Leishmania tropica, besides antimonial injections. Alternative treatment options are not&#xD;
      available in Pakistan, or there is limited evidence of the effectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of thermotherapy in L. tropica is studied in only three studies in OWCL with a&#xD;
      variable cure rate (54.1% - 98%). But it could be an attractive option, because only one&#xD;
      treatment session is required and studies report less scarring tissue. Another promising&#xD;
      treatment option is oral miltefosine. There is considerable evidence in the literature of the&#xD;
      efficacy of miltefosine in treatment of CL caused by L. major, however no studies have been&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy in CL caused by L. tropica species. This oral treatment&#xD;
      could have major benefits for CL patients as it can be provided in peripheral health&#xD;
      facilities and to patients who have contraindications to antimony treatment (elderly, and&#xD;
      patients with cardiac or renal disease, or diabetes). A combination of thermotherapy and&#xD;
      miltefosine, the advantages offered by this combination are that a) the use of a topical plus&#xD;
      a systemic treatment would hypothetically have an additive effect of two treatments with&#xD;
      different modes of action. For the reason that systemic treatment could eliminate those&#xD;
      circulating or remaining parasites located in the periphery of the lesion that topical&#xD;
      treatment fails to remove, which might be the cause of a relapse, b) it may reduce the&#xD;
      necessary length of treatment with miltefosine. For these above reasons, in a prospective&#xD;
      trial we aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thermotherapy, miltefosine and the&#xD;
      combination of thermotherapy and miltefosine in CL caused by L. tropica, with the objective&#xD;
      to find a treatment with an efficacy which is non-inferior to the standard of care with&#xD;
      antimony injections.&#xD;
