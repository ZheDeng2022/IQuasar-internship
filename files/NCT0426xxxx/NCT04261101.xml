    <textblock>
      The use of test-enhanced learning with causal connection and in preparation for future&#xD;
      learning has been used in health educational setting with positive results. However, most&#xD;
      studies were performed in a controlled lab scenario and not in the &quot;real world&quot; of medicine&#xD;
      classes, decreasing the external applicability of such experiments. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      present study is to evaluate if a session of test-enhanced learning at the beginning of&#xD;
      endocrinology course, using basic-clinical sciences connections of key concepts, would&#xD;
      prepare for future learning of endocrinology on a theory-practical 4-week endocrinology&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design, participants and description of undergraduate endocrinology course This&#xD;
      is a prospective, single center, non-blinded, RCT. Participants are students of medicine from&#xD;
      Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil, in their third year of Medical&#xD;
      School, recruited at the beginning of endocrinology undergraduate clinical placement. This&#xD;
      clinical trial follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement,&#xD;
      which includes the completing the CONSORT checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Based in a previous study, to find a difference in the percentage of correct&#xD;
      answers in a cognitive test to evaluate retention of 12%, considering a SD of 26%, alpha&#xD;
      error of 5%, beta error of 20%, and repeated assessments (baseline, 3 weeks and 6 months), 35&#xD;
      students will be necessary in each group. To account for possible losses of follow-up, 84&#xD;
      students will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention All students will receive, in advance, a text with basic sciences&#xD;
      information relevant to the learning of Endocrinology (supplementary material), with&#xD;
      instructions to study the text before intervention day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students will be randomized to one of the interventions: TEL with questions about diabetes&#xD;
      and adrenal (Block A, 6 questions) or thyroid and hypophysis (Block B, 6 questions).&#xD;
      Important endocrinology concepts, such as fuel metabolism and circadian rhythm will be&#xD;
      included in Block A, and feedback loops and hormone synthesis in Block B. Specific hormone&#xD;
      functions will be part of both TEL Blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments At the same day of intervention, students will answer all questions 12 of the TEL&#xD;
      session (questions from blocks A and B) with best answer multiple choice questions (immediate&#xD;
      retention test). After 3 weeks and 6 months, the transfer of knowledge will be assessed with&#xD;
      a 24 multiple choice questions test, based in clinical cases.&#xD;

      Introduction The ability to connect previous learned basic-sciences concepts to patient's&#xD;
      clinical features can help improve clinical reasoning. While experts use several shortcuts to&#xD;
      reach a correct diagnosis, such as clinical presentation patterns, &quot;stored&quot; due to years of&#xD;
      exposure to real cases, the novice need other strategies to build diagnostic scripts to&#xD;
      achieve expertise. Inexperienced medical students acquire clinical reasoning by exploring why&#xD;
      specific symptoms occur, usually based on basic science mechanisms. Even experienced&#xD;
      physicians apply these connections to solve difficult cases, though sometimes, not in a&#xD;
      conscious way. Benefits of causal connections between basic and clinical sciences for&#xD;
      clinical reasoning is supported by randomized clinical trials (RCTs). When teaching&#xD;
      endocrinology, this strategy acquires additional relevance, as basic concepts regarding&#xD;
      hormone action and regulation (ex: feedback loops) are commonly utilized in day-to-day&#xD;
      patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test-enhanced learning is an effective strategy to optimize knowledge acquisition, through&#xD;
      formative assessment with the sole objective to promote learning. Testing improves learning&#xD;
      through two means: a) an indirect benefit, as it stimulates preparation for the test, and b)&#xD;
      through a direct effect, in which the mental effort to answer a question mobilizes and brain&#xD;
      connections and reinforces learning. This educational tool has been studied in health&#xD;
      professions education, including medical school and clinical training. The utilization of&#xD;
      test-enhanced learning with short answers is more efficacious than only restudy or&#xD;
      self-explanation. Moreover, the effect lasted for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More important than content retention and linkage between biomedical concepts and clinical&#xD;
      features, is the idea that knowledge must be applied in a different context in the future, a&#xD;
      capacity named adaptive expertise. An essential part of training for adaptive expertise is&#xD;
      preparation for future learning. It means that a learning session should prepare the student&#xD;
      for future acquisition of content, competences and abilities. Medicine is certainly an area&#xD;
      where adaptive expertise is crucial, as biological sciences are in continuous progress,&#xD;
      requiring constant and continued education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of test-enhanced learning with causal connection and in preparation for future&#xD;
      learning has been used in health educational setting with positive results. However, most&#xD;
      studies were performed in a controlled lab scenario and not in the &quot;real world&quot; of medicine&#xD;
      classes, decreasing the external applicability of such experiments. Therefore, the aim of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate if a session of test-enhanced learning at the beginning of&#xD;
