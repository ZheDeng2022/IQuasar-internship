  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the skin microbiome profile of breast cancer&#xD;
      patients before and after receiving Radio Therapy treatments, and evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between the microbiome profile and radiation dermatitis severity (grade) that the patient&#xD;
      will develop. Such characterizations can lead to potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic&#xD;
      targets that can be used for the prognosis, prevention and treatment of this condition.&#xD;

The target areas are i) regions surrounding the RT treatment area (if possible, not from the scar area or from skin folds areas), ii) a control site of the normal (healthy) breast , iii) a control area on the forehead.</description>
