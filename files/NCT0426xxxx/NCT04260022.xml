  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, open-label, randomized, phase Ib study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of HQP1351 and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of HQP1351 in subjects with&#xD;
      CML chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) or with Ph+ ALL, who have&#xD;
      experienced resistance or intolerance to at least three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 patients will be randomized at 1:1:1 ratio into one of the three dose cohorts:&#xD;
      30 mg every other day (QOD), 40 mg QOD, and 50 mg QOD, with 10 patients per dose cohort. The&#xD;
      first cycle of 28 days is considered as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period.&#xD;
      If the incidence of DLTs exceeds 20% (2 patients) in 50 mg dose cohort during the first cycle&#xD;
      of therapy, this dose cohort will be stopped. The randomization will be stratified to 4&#xD;
      groups: T315I mutated CML-CP and CML-AP, T315I un-mutated CML-CP, T315I unmutated CML-AP, and&#xD;
      CML-BP and Ph+ ALL to ensure that the subgroups are represented across all dose cohorts.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected from each subject at specified time points to evaluate the PK&#xD;
      of HQP1351. RP2D of HQP1351 will be determined based on the comprehensive analyses of the PK,&#xD;
      safety, and efficacy data of the US patients treated with HQP1351, when compared with that in&#xD;
      the Chinese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have disease resistance to or intolerance to at least three TKIs, for&#xD;
      patients with T315I mutation, resistance or intolerance to ponatinib alone is acceptable.&#xD;
      Patients will be administered HQP1351 orally every other day (QOD) during a period of 28 days&#xD;
      (1 cycle).&#xD;
