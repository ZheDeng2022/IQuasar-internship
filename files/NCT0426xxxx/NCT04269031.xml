  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to assess the the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      AZD2373, following subcutaneous (SC) administration of single ascending doses (SAD) of&#xD;
      AZD2373 in healthy male subjects of African ancestry.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind&#xD;
      study to assess the effect of AZD2373 following ascending dose sequential group design&#xD;
      administrations to healthy male subjects of African ancestry. The study will include 6 single&#xD;
      dose cohorts with the option to include 2 additional cohorts based on emerging data from&#xD;
      preceding cohorts in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 48 male subjects aged 18 to 55 years at the time of informed consent&#xD;
      (inclusive) will be randomized with the aim to have 8 subjects participate in each cohort.&#xD;
      Within each cohort, 6 subjects will receive AZD2373 and 2 subjects will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel dosing will be applied for each cohort and will be divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (sentinel group): 1 active, 1 placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (the rest of the cohort): 5 active, 1 placebo. The safety data of up to 72 hours&#xD;
           post-dose in Group 1 will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator (PI) before the&#xD;
           subjects in Group 2 are dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period of maximum 35 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Treatment Period during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the&#xD;
           day before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration (Day -1) until at&#xD;
           least 72 hours after IMP administration; discharged from the Clinical Unit on Day 4;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Visits on 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 weeks (Visits 3 to 10); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Final Follow up Visit 10 weeks after the last IMP dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit occurring at 5 weeks post dose (Visit 5) is optional. The expected duration for any&#xD;
      subject participating in the study is approximately 10 weeks (excluding an up to 28-day&#xD;
      Screening Period).&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    AZ has decided not to continue this study, since sufficient data are available to support&#xD;
    proposed dosing in future studies, and assessment of higher single doses are limited by&#xD;
    tolerability due to the development of Injection Site Reactions.&#xD;
