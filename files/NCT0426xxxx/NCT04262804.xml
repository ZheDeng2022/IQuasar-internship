  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, Phase II clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared with trastuzumab plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy in Chinese patients (Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan) with advanced HER2+ breast&#xD;
      cancer who have received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2 directed therapy in the&#xD;
      metastatic setting (mandatory including trastuzumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is PFS evaluated by BICR. The secondary endpoints are OS,&#xD;
      PFS evaluated by investigator, ORR, DoR, CBR, safety and tolerability, the impact of ADA, and&#xD;
      the popPK profile&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 120 Chinese subjects will be enrolled and randomized to treatment group and&#xD;
      control group in 1:1 fashion, approximately 60 subjects in each group. Eligible subjects are&#xD;
      HER2 positive, metastatic breast cancer who has received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2&#xD;
      directed therapy in the metastatic setting (mandatory to have trastuzumab, and other&#xD;
      anti-HER2 agents e.g. lapatinib, pyrotinib, and pertuzumab; in case of having received&#xD;
      (neo)adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy) in Chinese patients (Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan).&#xD;
      Subjects should Have received treatment with at least one, and no more than three, lines of&#xD;
      therapy overall in the metastatic setting (including anti-HER2 directed therapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and patients must have progressed on or following, the most recent line of&#xD;
      therapy, based on RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared&#xD;
      with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. The dosage and administering of margetuximab is 15 mg/kg&#xD;
      IV Q3W. Trastuzumab was administered 8 mg/kg loading dose, 6 mg/kg subsequent doses, IV Q3W.&#xD;
      Prior to randomization to either margetuximab or trastuzumab, investigators selected one of&#xD;
      four backbone chemotherapy regimens given at standard doses: capecitabine, vinorelbine or&#xD;
      gemcitabine. Capecitabine and vinorelbine should be selected in priority. Gemcitabine could&#xD;
      be selected only if capecitabine and vinorelbine were used in previous treatment. Subject&#xD;
      will receive the treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, initiation of subsequent anti-tumor treatment therapy, or death (whichever occurs&#xD;
      first). Subject is not allowed to crossover after disease progression. Randomization was&#xD;
      stratified by number of metastatic sites (≤2, &gt;2) and chemotherapy chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of HER2 positive is to have at least once 3+ by IHC, FISH positive or CISH&#xD;
      positive in the pathological test/retesting. Subject should provide original biopsy/surgical&#xD;
      excision tissue sample/latest follow-up sample after randomization, for the centralized test&#xD;
      and review when necessary.&#xD;
