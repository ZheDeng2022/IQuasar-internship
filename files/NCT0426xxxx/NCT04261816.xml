    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study. Patients who underwent liver transplantation from&#xD;
      January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 were admitted to the study and divided into two groups.&#xD;
      Operating room extubation group: early extubation in the operating room immediately following&#xD;
      liver transplantation. Intensive care unit (ICU) extubation group: delay extubation in the&#xD;
      ICU following liver transplantation. The primary objectives were to compare the incidence of&#xD;
      composite outcome between the two groups. secondary objectives were to compare outcomes such&#xD;
      as length of stay, hospital length of stay, and total cost between the two groups.&#xD;

      Patients who underwent liver transplantation from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 were&#xD;
      admitted to the study. Inclusion criteria: (1) adult patients (age ≥ 18 years), (2)&#xD;
      undergoing liver transplantation. Exclusion criteria were the following: (1)&#xD;
      re-transplantation; (2) multi-visceral transplantation; (3) intraoperative death; (4) severe&#xD;
      encephalopathy (West Haven criteria III or IV); (5) those who had preoperative mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation; (6) incomplete clinical data. The primary objectives was a composite of 30-day&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, in-hospital AKI, or in-hospital moderate to severe pulmonary&#xD;
      complications. Complications were defined and graded as mild, moderate, or severe as&#xD;
      described by European Perioperative Clinical Outcome definitions and were included if they&#xD;
      occurred in hospital after surgery. The secondary objectives included in-hospital moderate to&#xD;
      severe infectious complications, unplanned reintubation rates, ICU and postoperative hospital&#xD;
      lengths of stay, and total hospital cost.&#xD;
