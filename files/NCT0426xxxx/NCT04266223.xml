      A pilot-stage device feasibility study investigating a mask-free motion-monitoring patient&#xD;
      immobilisation system for use during radiation therapy treatment of head and neck cancer&#xD;
      (HNC). This mask-free system combines the standard radiation therapy (RT) head rest to help&#xD;
      the patient remain still with a surface guidance detection system that uses sensors to detect&#xD;
      and track patient movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will have RT treatment for head and neck cancer involving an immobilisation mask&#xD;
      will be asked to lie on the treatment couch for the normal treatment fraction time while the&#xD;
      surface monitoring system is activated. We will then assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) The level of acceptance of the system by HNC patients currently being treated with RT&#xD;
      using an immobilisation mask, and ii) The ability of the surface guidance system to monitor&#xD;
      movement of the patients&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy (RT) is a central treatment modality for 74% of head and neck cancer (HNC)&#xD;
      patients where preservation of the form and function of localised organs and tissue is of&#xD;
      prime importance. Radiation therapy offers the possibility of organ preservation by providing&#xD;
      a non-surgical approach to curative treatment, while helping to limit the extent of surgery&#xD;
      in cases where definitive surgery is unavoidable. Radiation therapy also has an important&#xD;
      role in maintaining quality of life in the palliative management of incurable HNC, where it&#xD;
      can prevent and alleviate pain, bleeding, tumour fungation and difficulty with swallowing,&#xD;
      breathing and speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State-of-the-art RT for HNC delivers lethal radiation doses to the cancer while sparing vital&#xD;
      organs situated just a few millimetres away. To achieve this level of accuracy, tight-fitting&#xD;
      thermoplastic head and neck masks are used to immobilise the patient in the desired treatment&#xD;
      position for the duration of each of their RT treatments. These thermoplastic immobilisation&#xD;
      devices are accepted internationally as the necessary standard and included in published&#xD;
      guidelines. Open masks are an emerging immobilisation measure and a first step to reduce&#xD;
      patient discomfort and anxiety. An open mask has a smaller visual restriction and fewer&#xD;
      restraint points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, thermoplastic immobilisation masks are the accepted clinical standard for HNC RT,&#xD;
      it is widely recognised and acknowledged that there are several limitations with their use.&#xD;
      Changes to the mask's fit may be needed due to patient weight loss, tumour shrinkage, or&#xD;
      treatment related oedema. Thus, radiation therapists are required to monitor the mask for fit&#xD;
      throughout the treatment course, undertake imaging at regular intervals and make corrections&#xD;
      as per published guidelines and local protocols. There is also risk of movement of the&#xD;
      patient within the mask, which may lead to under dosing of the target and overdosing of&#xD;
      organs at risk. Court et al. reported that patients in their study needed to be repositioned&#xD;
      in the immobilisation mask before treatment for 14% of fractions; 30% of the repositioning&#xD;
      was for shoulder shifts of 1 cm or greater. Neubauer et al. observed shoulder motion of 2-5&#xD;
      mm in each direction on average (20 mm max). These shifts resulted in coverage loss (dose to&#xD;
      99% of the clinical target volume decreased by up to 1Gy) or increased dose to organs at risk&#xD;
      (e.g., dose to brachial plexus increased by 0.7Gy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACRF Image X Institute at the University of Sydney has developed a novel surface guidance&#xD;
      system that can be mounted to any RT imaging and treatment couch. This system is currently&#xD;
      being used in a clinical trial (NCT02881203) to guide breast cancer patients into a&#xD;
      reproducible breath hold: the patient's chest position is measured via surface imaging and&#xD;
      the system delivers visual feedback to the patient via a screen for the patient to correct&#xD;
      their breath hold level if necessary (i.e., surface guidance). This system uses off-the-shelf&#xD;
      electronics, most importantly a sensor which includes an optical and a depth camera,&#xD;
      delivering frames at a rate of 30Hz and allowing the patient and operator to see an augmented&#xD;
      reality video feed, including the surface depth information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to this, we will apply optical and depth cameras for head and neck surface monitoring&#xD;
      by integrating a second sensor and adapting it to the different location of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot-stage, single-arm study investigating the technical feasibility and patient acceptance&#xD;
      of a non-interventional, non-invasive, mask-free surface detection system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Towards the end of their scheduled radiation therapy treatments, people being treated for HNC&#xD;
      with RT using a thermoplastic immobilisation mask will be asked to lie in a treatment&#xD;
      position on a treatment couch using a standard radiation therapy headrest without the mask,&#xD;
      for the normal amount of time taken for individual radiation therapy treatments (20 minutes).&#xD;
      During this time, the mask-free surface detection system will detect and record their&#xD;
      location and movement. Data collected by the surface detection system during this couch&#xD;
      session will be analysed to determine the feasibility of using the equipment to detect&#xD;
      location and movement over this period. Data collected directly from the participants&#xD;
      immediately before, during and following the couch session will be used to determine their&#xD;
      acceptance of the system in terms of comfort and anxiety when compared with wearing the mask,&#xD;
      and any suggestions for improvement of the system. Data collected directly from the radiation&#xD;
      therapists following the couch session will be used to investigate their thoughts on the&#xD;
      abilities of the system, ease of use and suggestions they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of changes in appearance due to weight loss over the course of HNC&#xD;
      radiation therapy treatment, a 5-minute surface monitoring couch session conducted before the&#xD;
      start of radiation therapy will record baseline surface-monitoring information only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will occur at the University of Sydney outside of participant sessions.&#xD;
