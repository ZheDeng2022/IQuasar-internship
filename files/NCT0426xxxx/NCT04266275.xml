      The purpose of this study is to see if curcumin can suppress HPV infection in women with&#xD;
      low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) disease or treated high-grade squamous&#xD;
      intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) disease. This study plans to explore the effect of curcumin as&#xD;
      a potential medical treatment in HIV-uninfected and infected women with mild precancerous&#xD;
      lesions of the cervix or recently treated high-grade precancerous lesions at risk for&#xD;
      persistent HPV infection. About 200 women with low-grade precancerous lesions of the cervix&#xD;
      or recently treated high-grade precancerous lesions will be enrolled to either insert 2000 mg&#xD;
      of curcumin capsules in their vagina once a week or placebo after undergoing colposcopy or&#xD;
      loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). They will have a repeat visit in 6 months&#xD;
      where they will undergo a Pap smear and HPV test to determine if there are higher rates of&#xD;
      HPV clearance after curcumin administration. If HPV is present or the Pap smear is abnormal,&#xD;
      patients will then undergo colposcopic examination to evaluate cervical histology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. The causative agent responsible&#xD;
      for cervical cancer is the persistent infection with oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV).&#xD;
      Rates of cervical cancer and HPV infection are increased particularly in HIV-infected women&#xD;
      due to immunosuppression with cervical cancer categorized as an AIDS-defining diagnosis.&#xD;
      Despite the promise of HPV vaccine in the prevention of cervical cancer, the widespread&#xD;
      availability of this vaccine is limited due to cost and accessibility. Therefore, prevention&#xD;
      strategies to reduce the risk of cervical cancer after HPV exposure entail treatment at the&#xD;
      premalignant state, including low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and&#xD;
      high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), along with the eradication of HPV&#xD;
      infection. There is a desperate need for an inexpensive, non-invasive alternative method to&#xD;
      treat these premalignant cervical lesions and potentially suppress HPV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin, an extract from turmeric, a popular culinary spice, has been used in traditional&#xD;
      Indian medicine for its anti-inflammatory and anti-infectious properties. Recent studies have&#xD;
      shown the potential effect of curcumin to reduce tumors and precancerous lesions in animal&#xD;
      and human cancer cells. It is postulated that curcumin achieves its effect on cancer cells by&#xD;
      modulating different cellular pathways as well as altering HPV effect on tissue cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if curcumin can suppress HPV infection in women with LSIL&#xD;
      disease or treated HSIL disease. The researchers plan to explore the effect of curcumin as a&#xD;
      potential medical treatment in HIV-uninfected and infected women with mild precancerous&#xD;
      lesions of the cervix or recently treated high-grade precancerous lesions at risk for&#xD;
      persistent HPV infection. About 200 women with low-grade precancerous lesions of the cervix&#xD;
      or recently treated high-grade precancerous lesions will be enrolled to either insert 2000 mg&#xD;
      of curcumin capsules in their vagina once a week or placebo after undergoing colposcopy or&#xD;
      LEEP. They will have a repeat visit in 6 months where they will undergo a Pap smear and HPV&#xD;
      test to determine if there are higher rates of HPV clearance after curcumin administration.&#xD;
      If HPV is present or the Pap smear is abnormal, patients will then undergo colposcopic&#xD;
      examination to evaluate cervical histology.&#xD;

    <description>Curcumin (Curcumin C3 Complex prepared by Sabinsa Corporation), a constituent of the spice turmeric, is considered to be a low-toxicity, dietary-derived agent with chemopreventative and therapeutic benefits.&#xD;
Study participants will be instructed to insert four 500 mg (2000 mg total) curcumin capsules once a week (excluding days when they are on their menses) for 20 weeks. Participants will insert capsules using the vaginal applicator while lying on their back with their knees bent. Participants will be instructed to gently insert the capsules into the vagina as far as they will go comfortably, similar to a tampon insertion or other common intravaginal drugs.&#xD;
Cervical cytology and HPV testing will be performed at baseline and 6 months after the baseline visit. If cervical cytology or HPV testing is abnormal at 6 months, a colposcopy with biopsies will be performed. All samples will be used to analyze for the study outcomes.</description>
