    <textblock>
      An international Consortium (BACk pain in Elders: BACE) was established in 2008 in order to&#xD;
      create standardised methodology for large cohort studies and share data on the burden of back&#xD;
      pain in older people. BACE cohort studies have been established in several countries with the&#xD;
      primary objective to establish the clinical course and burden of back pain in elderly, to&#xD;
      identify prognostic factors for chronic back pain and disability, and to explore usual care&#xD;
      provided in primary care. The BACE-N is a BACE cohort study conducted in Norway, including a&#xD;
      broad network of clinicians covering general practitioners, physiotherapists and&#xD;
      chiropractors working in the primary healthcare. The BACE-N project will provide new&#xD;
      knowledge on prognosis of back-related disability and pain in elderly people who seek help in&#xD;
      the primary healthcare, the clinical course of back pain over two follow-up years, including&#xD;
      a thorough description of healthcare utilisation and their costs, and prognostic factors that&#xD;
      influence good or poor prognosis for these people.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Back pain represent a considerable burden worldwide, and is predominantly managed in primary&#xD;
      care. Between 2010 and 2050, the number of people aged 60 years and older will increase by&#xD;
      56% in developed countries, and this transition will increase the burden of chronic back&#xD;
      disability. Most previous studies on (low) back pain have excluded people above 60 years of&#xD;
      age, leading to a large knowledge gap regarding the prognosis of back-related disability and&#xD;
      pain in older people and which factors influence the transition from acute to chronic stage.&#xD;
      Further, back pain outcomes used in the few existing studies are not selected to capture the&#xD;
      burden and characterization of back pain in older people. Therefore, the international&#xD;
      Consortium (BACk pain in Elders: BACE) was established in 2008 in order to create&#xD;
      standardised methodology for large cohort studies and share data on the burden of back pain&#xD;
      in older people. BACE cohort studies have been established in several countries, also&#xD;
      currently in Norway, with the primary objective to establish the clinical course and burden&#xD;
      of back pain in elderly, to identify prognostic factors for chronic back pain and disability,&#xD;
      and to explore usual care provided in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims for the BACE-N are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Explore potential differences in baseline characteristics, including main domains of&#xD;
           measurements of putative prognostic factors and outcomes, across patients who seek&#xD;
           general practitioner, physiotherapist and chiropractor in primary care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish the 1- and 2-year clinical course (overall prognosis) and burden of&#xD;
           back-related disability (defined as the primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish the 1- and 2-year clinical course (overall prognosis) and burden of pain&#xD;
           (severity, location/radiation/neurological signs, stiffness, sleep, and use of pain&#xD;
           medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe usual care provided in the primary care (for the initial episode of back pain)&#xD;
           and cost of illness due to total healthcare consumption (including secondary care such&#xD;
           as hospitalisation and institutionalisation) and production loss during one year of&#xD;
           follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess the association between established prognostic factors in the middle-aged back&#xD;
           pain population (comorbidity and psychosocial profile) and back-related disability at&#xD;
           1-and 2-years follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Develop and validate a prognostic model for long-term back-related disability at 1- and&#xD;
           2-years follow-up in these people&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Explore prognostic factors associated with persistent and/or recurrent back pain at 1-&#xD;
           and 2 years follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Explore prognostic factors associated with costs of illness during 1-year of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Establish the 1- and 2-year incidence of falls and loss of independence (Falls Efficacy&#xD;
           Scale) and explore prognostic factors associated with falls and loss of independence&#xD;
           during 1- and 2-year of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Assess the clinical course (overall prognosis) in main outcomes (disability, pain, and&#xD;
           costs of illness) across patients who seek general practitioner, physiotherapist and&#xD;
           chiropractor in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Assess gender differences in clinical course, prognostic factors and usual care in these&#xD;
           people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these specific aims, the BACE-N includes several methodological studies as&#xD;
      several of the measurements from the original BACE protocol had to be translated and&#xD;
      validated for a Norwegian context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective observational cohort study with linked methodological&#xD;
      studies within a primary care setting, recruiting 450 patients from three main back pain&#xD;
      health professionals; general practitioners, physiotherapists and chiropractors. The patients&#xD;
      are followed by questionnaire at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after inclusion. The data collected&#xD;
      in the BACE-N adheres to the standardised methods described in the published protocol from&#xD;
      2011 (Scheele J, Luijsterburg PA, Ferreira ML, Maher CG, Pereira L, Peul WC, et al. Back&#xD;
      complaints in the elders (BACE); design of cohort studies in primary care: an international&#xD;
      consortium. BMC Musculoskelet Disord. 2011;12:193). Likewise, the statistical approach&#xD;
      adheres to the original plan and the PROGnosis RESearch Strategy (PROGRESS), covering overall&#xD;
      prognosis research, prognostic factor research, and prognostic model research. The&#xD;
      methodological studies in the BACE-N are conducted in line with the COSMIN recommendations. A&#xD;
      protocol for the BACE-N will be registered.&#xD;

        criteria and complete the consent to participate respond to a comprehensive baseline&#xD;
        questionnaire and undergo a standardised physical examination. The questionnaire is&#xD;
        preferably completed electronically, but a paper version is also available for patients who&#xD;
