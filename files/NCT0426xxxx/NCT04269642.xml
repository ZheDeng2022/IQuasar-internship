    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sustained release (SR)-Exenatide (PT320,&#xD;
      Q1W and Q2W) in the treatment of patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      comparison, phase IIa clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sustained release&#xD;
      (SR)-Exenatide (PT320) in the treatment of patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exenatide (GLP-1) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and obesity. In addition, several research groups have&#xD;
      confirmed that Exenatide has beneficial aspects due to the neuroprotective effects in&#xD;
      neuronal cells in patients with PD. Peptron has developed a sustained-release (SR)-Exenatide,&#xD;
      (PT320, Q1W and Q2W), which has shown a higher Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) penetration rate and&#xD;
      better patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of PT320 on symptom improvement&#xD;
      and the inhibition of disease progression in the treatment of patients with early Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. Also, pharmacokinetic analysis of PT320 in blood cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and&#xD;
      exosome analysis of biomarkers related to Exenatide will be being tested, as exploratory&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;

    <time_frame>48 week</time_frame>
    <description>Change of MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society -Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale ) part 3 score from baseline at 48 weeks.&#xD;
The MDS-UPDRS has four parts: Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part II (motor experiences of daily living), Part III (motor examination) and Part IV (motor complications). The MDS-UPDRS consists of five measures, 0(normal) to 4(severe), according to each item, and is evaluated as the total score per part of Part 1 to 4. A 0 means there is no disability, and the higher the score, the more the disability is reflected.</description>

    <description>Change of K-PDQ-39 (korean-The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaires-39) score from baseline at 48 and 60 weeks. PDQ-39 is an assessment of Parkinson's disease and comprises a total of 39 questions. Based on the past month's experience, each item consists of a five-point scale of 0(never) to 4 (always) and is checked by the test subjects themselves. The total score of PDQ-39 is evaluated as a percentage of 0-100%, and as the score increases, the symptom becomes more severe.</description>

    <measure>MoCA-K score</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 24, 48 and 60 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change of MoCA-K (Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Korean) score from baseline at 24, 48 and 60 weeks.&#xD;
MoCA-K is designed to evaluate mild cognitive disorders. The raters evaluate cognitive functions such as attention and concentration, memory, language, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The execution time takes about 10 minutes and is evaluated by the sum of the scores of each item. A perfect score of 30 points or more is considered normal.</description>

    <measure>K-NMSS score</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 24, 48 and 60 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change of K-NMSS (Korean-Non Motor Symptoms Scale) score from baseline at 24, 48 and 60 weeks.&#xD;
K-NMSS evaluates non-motorative symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It consists of a total of 30 questions, separated by nine aspects: cardiovascular function, sleep/ fatigue, sexual function, and other non-motor symptoms. The evaluation period is evaluated based on the experience of the last month.&#xD;
For each aspect, the grade point is evaluated as the degree of severity (level 0-3) and frequency (1-4), and the evaluation score is obtained by multiplying the degree and frequency of severity.&#xD;
The K-NMSS has a range of 0-360 points, and the higher the score, the more severe the symptoms are judged.</description>
