    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies a sexual health counseling intervention during radiation therapy&#xD;
      in improving quality of life for women with gynecologic cancer. Women with gynecologic cancer&#xD;
      often suffer long-term complications from treatment that can affect their physical and&#xD;
      psychological well-being. An early sexual health counseling intervention prior to and after&#xD;
      radiation may improve symptoms management and reduce the physical and psychological effects&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of a sexual health counseling intervention before and after&#xD;
      pelvic radiation for women with gynecologic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of a sexual health counseling intervention on&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes in quality of life, sexual function, and genitourinary symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sexual health counseling prior to starting and at the completion of&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 6 months after radiation.&#xD;
