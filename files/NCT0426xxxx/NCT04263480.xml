  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) chemotherapy induces only low CR/VGPR (Complete&#xD;
      Remission/ Very Good Partial Response) rates and responses of short duration compared to&#xD;
      other indolent lymphomas. Thus, innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent&#xD;
      activity and tolerability in WM. Chemotherapy-free approaches are highly attractive for this&#xD;
      patient group. Based on its high activity in WM and its low toxicity, Ibrutinib was approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of WM by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, also Ibrutinib fails&#xD;
      to induce CRs and the VGPR rate is 16% in relapsed patients. In addition, activity of&#xD;
      Ibrutinib depends on the genotype: compared to MYD88mut/CXCR4WT patients Ibrutinib single&#xD;
      agent therapy induces substantially lower response rates in patients with the&#xD;
      MYD88mut/CXCR4mut or the MYD88WT/CXCR4WT genotype (major response (at least PR) in 91.7 %&#xD;
      compared to 61.9 and 0 %, respectively). Phase II data have indicated that the proteasome&#xD;
      inhibitor Carfilzomib is able to overcome the inferior prognosis of Ibrutinib in&#xD;
      MYD88mut/CXCR4mut and MYD88WT/CXCR4WT patients, as response rates were high for all genotypes&#xD;
      in a phase II study combining Carfilzomib with Rituximab and Dexamethasone. Based on this the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that addition of Carfilzomib to Ibrutinib will increase the VGPR/CR&#xD;
      rate compared to Ibrutinib alone in patients with WM, in particular in patients carrying the&#xD;
      CXCR4 mutation. In addition, the investigators hypothesize, that the combination Carfilzomib&#xD;
      and Ibrutinib will be also highly active in MYD88 wildtype patients and that this combination&#xD;
      will be at least as efficient in treatment naïve patients as in relapsed/refractory patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) conventional chemotherapy induces only low Complete&#xD;
      Remission (CR) rates and responses of short duration compared to other indolent lymphomas.&#xD;
      Thus, innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in&#xD;
      patients with WM, who are mostly of advanced age. Today, chemotherapy in combination with the&#xD;
      anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab is still the backbone of treatment in patients with WM and is&#xD;
      recommended as first line in national and international treatment guidelines.With the&#xD;
      approval of Ibrutinib by the EMA 2015 for patients with relapsed WM or for patients not&#xD;
      eligible for chemotherapy with treatment naïve WM treatment landscape has changed in this&#xD;
      lymphoma subtype and there is an urgent need to evaluate to which extent chemotherapy-free&#xD;
      approaches add clinical benefit to the patient. Based on its high activity in WM and its low&#xD;
      toxicity, Ibrutinib was approved for the treatment of WM by the EMA. However, also Ibrutinib&#xD;
      fails to induce CRs and the VGPR (Very Good Partial Response) rate is 16% in relapsed&#xD;
      patients. In addition, activity of Ibrutinib depends on the genotype with inferior response&#xD;
      rates in MYD88mut/CXCR4mut patients and in patients with unmutated MYD88 and CXCR4 compared&#xD;
      to MYD88mut/CXCR4WT patients (major response (at least PR) in 91.7 % compared to 61.9 and 0&#xD;
      %, respectively). Phase II data have indicated that the proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib is&#xD;
      able to overcome the inferior prognosis of Ibrutinib in MYD88mut/CXCR4mut and MYD88WT/CXCR4WT&#xD;
      patients, as response rates were high for all genotypes in a phase II study combining&#xD;
      Carfilzomib with Rituximab and Dexamethasone. Based on this the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that addition of Carfilzomib to Ibrutinib will increase the VGPR/CR rate compared to&#xD;
      Ibrutinib alone in patients with WM, in particular in patients carrying the CXCR4 mutation.&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators hypothesize, that the combination Carfilzomib and Ibrutinib&#xD;
      will be also highly active in MYD88 wildtype patients and that this combination will be at&#xD;
      least as efficient in treatment naïve patients as in relapsed/refractory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an international, phase III, multicenter, open label and randomized trial&#xD;
      comparing Carfilzomib in combination with Ibrutinib (treatment Arm A) versus Ibrutinib&#xD;
      (treatment arm B) in male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years of de novo and&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory WM in need of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase III study will consist of an open labeled, stratified 1:1 randomization between Arm&#xD;
      A and Arm B. Stratification factors are MYD88 and CXCR4 status (positive vs. negative) and&#xD;
      number of prior lines (0 vs. ≥ 1 treatment lines). A stratified central block randomization&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to test the efficacy and toxicity of Carfilzomib and&#xD;
      Ibrutinib in patients with treatment naïve or relapsed WM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the rate of CR or VGPR 12 months after the start of&#xD;
      treatment using the response criteria updated at the Sixth IWWM (CR/VGPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      184 patients at approximately 60 investigator sites will be recruited. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up after end of treatment. Patients will receive Ibrutinib in both treatment arms&#xD;
      until progression, non-tolerated toxicity or until the study duration has reached its maximum&#xD;
      of 7 years after the first patient was included into the trial. Follow-up (5 years or until&#xD;
      disease progression for patients who discontinue treatment due to toxicity) or survival&#xD;
      follow-up (for patients with progression disease) will be performed until the study duration&#xD;
      has reached its maximum of 7 years after the first patient was included into the trial.&#xD;

        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proven clinicopathological diagnosis of WM as defined by consensus panel one of the&#xD;
             Second International Workshop on WM. Histopathology has to occur before randomization&#xD;
             within the last 4 months. In addition, pathological specimens have to be sent to the&#xD;
             national pathological reference center prior to randomization for the determination of&#xD;
             the mutational status of MYD88 and CYCR4. Immunophenotyping will be performed in each&#xD;
             center and saved locally. The positivity for CD20 can be assumed from any previous&#xD;
             bone marrow immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry analysis performed up to 4 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Flow cytometry of bone marrow and blood cells will include at&#xD;
             least one double staining and assess the expression of the following antigens: surface&#xD;
             immunoglobulin, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD10, CD38 and CD23. Patients are eligible if tumor&#xD;
             cells express the following antigens: CD19, CD20, CD38 and if they are negative for&#xD;
             CD5, CD10 and CD23 expression. Patients with tumor cells positive for CD5 and/or CD23&#xD;
