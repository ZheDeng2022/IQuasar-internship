  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is clinically used as the gold standard for detection of colon cancer (CRC) and&#xD;
      removal of adenomatous polyps. Despite the success of colonoscopy in reducing cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths, there exists a disappointing level of adenomas missed at colonoscopy. &quot;Back-to-back&quot;&#xD;
      colonoscopies have indicated significant miss rates of 27% for small adenomas (&lt; 5 mm) and 6%&#xD;
      for adenomas of more than 10 mm in diameter. Studies performing both CT colonography and&#xD;
      colonoscopy estimate that the colonoscopy miss rate for polyps over 10 mm in size may be as&#xD;
      high as 12%. The clinical importance of missed lesions should be emphasized because these&#xD;
      lesions may ultimately progress to CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations in human visual perception and other human biases such as fatigue, distraction,&#xD;
      level of alertness during examination increases such recognition errors and way of mitigating&#xD;
      them may be the key to improve polyp detection and further reduction in mortality from CRC.&#xD;
      In the past years, a number of CAD systems for detection of polyps from endoscopy images have&#xD;
      been described. However, the benefits of traditional CAD technologies in colonoscopy appear&#xD;
      to be contradictory, therefore they should be improved to be ultimately considered useful.&#xD;
      Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), and computer vision have&#xD;
      shown potential to assist polyp detection during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Average experienced endoscopists (each having performed &lt;2000 screening colonoscopies) will&#xD;
      perform the endoscopic procedure.&#xD;

        Based on the observed prevalence of adenomas (35%) among patients undergoing colonoscopies&#xD;
        at our center within the last 12 months, a sample size of 322 subjects per arm could allow&#xD;
        for a 90% power to show the non-inferiority (primary end-point) of the AI-aided arm by&#xD;
        excluding that the one-side 95% CI will exclude a difference of 10% in favour of the&#xD;
        standard group. Such sample size will also have a 80% power to detect as statistical&#xD;
        significant (Î±=0.05; two-sided test) a 10% absolute increase in the detection rate of&#xD;
        adenomas in the AI-aided arm (secondary end-point).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performing a sub-stratification according to operator experience, we will planning to&#xD;
        enroll the 322 subjects per arm performed by experts and 322 subjects per arm performed by&#xD;
        average operator.&#xD;
