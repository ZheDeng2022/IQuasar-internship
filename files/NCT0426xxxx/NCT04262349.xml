      The aim of this study is to compare the control group and the intervention to be applied to&#xD;
      the education program used to increase sleep quality in nulliparous women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a randomized controlled training intervention study in the pre-test and&#xD;
      post-test order. The population of the study consisted of nulliparous pregnant women who&#xD;
      applied to the Konya Dr. Ali Kemal Belviranlı Maternity and Children Hospital Pregnancy&#xD;
      School and met the criteria for inclusion in the study at time of the study. Sample size was&#xD;
      calculated with G * Power 3.0.10 program with an effect size of 0.3 (medium effect level) and&#xD;
      a power of 80%. A total of 180 pregnant women were identified as 90 in the intervention group&#xD;
      and 90 in the control group. Considering that data will be lost due to reasons such as&#xD;
      discontinuation and exclusion criteria during pregnancy 10% more of the determined number was&#xD;
      included in the study and the sample size was calculated as 198 pregnant women and 252&#xD;
      pregnant women were reached during the study. 36 pregnant women in the intervention group and&#xD;
      35 pregnant women in the control group were excluded from the study for different reasons and&#xD;
      the study was completed with 181 pregnant women (90: control: 91). The groups were determined&#xD;
      by randomization. During the conduct of the study, all pregnant women who applied to the&#xD;
      pregnant school and met the criteria for participation in the study were recorded in the&#xD;
      pre-training registry and numbered in the order of registration. Every week because of&#xD;
      differences in the number of pregnant women who attended the school participating women were&#xD;
      divided into two groups using a random number table created in the program via the computer&#xD;
      itself. The purpose of the study was explained to pregnant women, informed consent form and&#xD;
      data collection tools of the study were collected by face to face interview technique. In the&#xD;
      first interview to all pregnant women; Personal Information Form, Course Information Form,&#xD;
      Pittshburg Sleep Quality Index (PUKI) and General Self-Efficacy Scale were applied. Pregnant&#xD;
      women in the intervention group were given a two-session training program to improve sleep&#xD;
      quality and &quot;Sleep Guide&quot; and &quot;Safe Baby Sleep Conditions Brochure&quot;. Pregnant women in the&#xD;
      control group were subjected to routine practice without any training given by the&#xD;
      researcher. Four weeks after the completion of the sleep training, all pregnant women were&#xD;
      contacted by telephone and the data collection tools were applied for the second time and the&#xD;
      final test applications were completed. After completion of the data collection process made&#xD;
      a new plan for training to improve the quality of sleep to pregnant women in the control&#xD;
      group and the &quot;Sleep Guide&quot; and &quot;Safe Baby Sleep Conditions Brochure&quot; is given.&#xD;

    <description>Pittshburg Sleep Quality Index (PUKI):&#xD;
PUKI is a self-report scale that evaluates sleep quality and disorders in the past month.&#xD;
It consists of 24 questions in total, 19 of which are self-report based questions.&#xD;
The last 5 questions are not included in the scoring, they are used for clinical evaluation.&#xD;
Each item of the scale is evaluated as 0-3 points.&#xD;
Seven &quot;component&quot; scores are created from nineteen items. While some components consist of evaluating a single substance, some components are the result of combining several items.&#xD;
Components that make up the scale; subjective sleep quality, sleep delay, sleep duration, habitual sleep effectiveness, sleep disorders, use of sleeping pills and daytime dysfunction.&#xD;
The scale total score is obtained by calculating the points of these seven components and the maximum scale score that can be obtained is 21.&#xD;
Increased score indicates poor sleep quality.&#xD;
A total scale score of 5 and above is expressed as bad sleep.</description>
