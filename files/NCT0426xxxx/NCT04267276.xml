    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure&#xD;
             (BP), pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead electrocrdiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 65 years (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the trial, in&#xD;
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are sexually active must use, with their partner, highly effective&#xD;
             contraception from the time of administration of trial medication until 3 months after&#xD;
             administration of trial medication. Adequate methods are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus use of hormonal contraception by the female partner that started at&#xD;
                  least 2 months prior to administration of trial medication (e.g., implants,&#xD;
                  injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus surgical sterilization (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to&#xD;
                  enrolment), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus surgically sterilised partner (including hysterectomy), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus intrauterine device, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condoms plus partner of non-child bearing potential (including homosexual men)&#xD;
                  Subjects are required to use condoms to prevent unintended exposure of the&#xD;
                  partner to the trial drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alternatively, true abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with the subject's&#xD;
        preferred and usual lifestyle. If a subject is usually not sexually active but becomes&#xD;
        active, with their partner, they must comply with the contraceptive requirements detailed&#xD;
        above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal&#xD;
             and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 139 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 45 to 89 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the&#xD;
             range of 40 to 100 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere&#xD;
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple&#xD;
             hernia repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial&#xD;
             medication or its excipients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of drugs within 30 days of planned administration of trial medication that might&#xD;
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (including drugs that cause QT/ QTc&#xD;
             interval prolongation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 60 days of planned&#xD;
             administration of investigational drug in the current trial, or concurrent&#xD;
             participation in another clinical trial in which investigational drug is administered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking habit other than incidental. Incidental smoker is defined as a person who will&#xD;
             not smoke more than 5 cigarettes per week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to refrain from smoking in the clinical research unit&#xD;
&#xD;

             alcohol equals approximately 250 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 35 mL of spirits))&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days of planned administration of trial&#xD;
             medication or intended blood donation during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within 96 hours prior to the&#xD;
             administration of trial medication and during the trial until the discharge at Day 9&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are&#xD;
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,&#xD;
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with trial&#xD;
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of chronic kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)&#xD;

             prior to screening or 1.1-2.0 mSv in the past 2 years or 2.1-3.0 mSv in the past 3&#xD;
             years etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to radiation for diagnostic reasons (except dental X-rays and plain X-rays of&#xD;
             thorax and bony skeleton (excluding spinal column) in the period of 1 year prior to&#xD;
             screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Irregular defecation pattern (less than a mean of one bowel movement every other day)&#xD;
