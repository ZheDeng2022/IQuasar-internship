      Aim of Work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, study is to compare between three modes of&#xD;
      ventilation during cardiopulmonary bypass in pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      undergoing corrective cardiac surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the present study is that high frequency low volume positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation is better than continous positive airway pressure (CPAP)and passive deflation on&#xD;
      direct PAP (pulmonary artery pressure ) reading and immediate oxygenation after&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass CPB in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgeries for congenital&#xD;
      heart defects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients will be randomized in a double blinded fashion to get enrolled into 3 equal&#xD;
      groups: Group HFPPV patients (n = 8) will receive high frequency positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation during cardiopulmonary bypass at tidal volume 2 ml/kg and respiratory rate 80,&#xD;
      whereas Group CPPV patients (n = 8 ) will receive continuous positive airway pressure of 10&#xD;
      cmH2O during the bypass, while Control group patients (n = 8 ) will be disconnected from the&#xD;
      ventilation (passive deflation) .The study will be conducted in the pediatric cardio-thoracic&#xD;
      operation rooms in AbulReesh Hospital in Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced Monitoring where Naso-pharyngeal temperature probe will be placed, a Central venous&#xD;
      catheter to monitor central venous pressure and an arterial cannula to monitor invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure after that, standard cardiopulmonary bypass technique will be used in all patients.&#xD;
      Before aortic cannulation, patients will receive IV heparin 400 U.kg-1 aiming to produce&#xD;
      activated clotting time ACT value &gt; 400 sec. A membrane oxygenator (minimax plus; Medtronics&#xD;
      Inc.) will be used during cardiopulmonary bypass. Priming solution in the form of iso-tonic&#xD;
      saline solution supplemented with heparin added to fresh whole blood in appropriate amounts&#xD;
      to achieve a haematocrit 20-25% during CPB will be used. Furosemide in a dose of 1 mg/kg/min&#xD;
      will be given to all patients. Venting of left heart will be performed with a left atrial&#xD;
      vent inserted through a small incision at the inter-atrial septum. Anesthesia during CPB will&#xD;
      be given by Sevoflurane administrated via a vaporizer inserted into the oxygenator gas supply&#xD;
      with a constant gas flow 3 liter/min. A non-pulsatile roller pump (model10.10.00; Stocket&#xD;
      instruments; Munich, Germany) will be used and the pump flow will be adjusted at 2.4 to 2.6&#xD;
      L/min /m2 during the normothermic period targeting mean arterial blood pressure between 40&#xD;
      and 60 mmHg. Moreover, all patients will receive milrinone loading dose of 50mcg/kg/min the&#xD;
      maintanence 0.5-1 mcg/kg/min and or adrenaline 0.02-0.1 mcg/kg/min will be utilized to&#xD;
      facilitate weaning from CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sternotomy and direct exposure of the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary artery systolic&#xD;
      pressure (PASP) will be monitored by a direct arterial catheter 22 gauge inserted by the&#xD;
      surgeon into the pulmonary artery, was calculated and recorded immediately after sternotomy,&#xD;
      after aortic clamp removal, and 10 minutes after initiation of protamine infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After application of aortic cross clamp and administration of cold blood cardioplegia&#xD;
      solution (Saint Thomas cardioplegic solution) 40 ml/Kg to be followed by doses of 10ml/Kg&#xD;
      every 30 minutes.), Group A patients will receive high frequency low volume positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (HFPPV) during cardiopulmonary bypass at tidal volume Vt 2 ml/kg and respiratory&#xD;
      rate RR 80, whereas Group B patients (n =8 ) will receive continous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      CPAP of 10 cmH2O, and group C patients will be disconnected from the ventilator (passive&#xD;
      deflation) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, Lung Ultrasound Score will be obtained after induction of anesthesia and at the end&#xD;
      of surgery after chest closure, The duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit and immediate post bypass oxygenation as well as the requirement for&#xD;
      inotropic and vaso-tropic support during the first 24 hours study period will be recorded for&#xD;
      all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound will be performed after induction of anesthesia and at the end of the&#xD;
      operation with a 5-MHz curved array probe (MindrayDC-N6; Mindray; Shenzhen, China). Patients&#xD;
      will be investigated in supine position by a well-trained physician recording five seconds&#xD;
      videos that will be assessed by two different observers who will be blinded from the patient&#xD;
      data. Lung ultrasound will be assessed for the presence of B lines.&#xD;
