    <textblock>
      In the absence of 2019-ncov specific therapeutic drugs, arbidol is effective against a&#xD;
      variety of coronaviruses in vitro pharmacodynamics. In order to observe the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of arbidol in the treatment of 2019-ncov infected pneumonia, this study is planned.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of&#xD;
      pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome&#xD;
      information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a&#xD;
      real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. The number of cases&#xD;
      of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of&#xD;
      January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally.&#xD;
      Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained&#xD;
      person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the&#xD;
      level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no specific treatment for 2019-ncov-infected pneumonia. Arbidol tablet is&#xD;
      a non-nucleoside broad-spectrum antiviral drug with immune-enhancing effect. Abidor is&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic in vitro against a variety of coronaviruses.This is a randomized, open,&#xD;
      multicenter clinical study of pneumonic subjects diagnosed with 2019-ncov infection. The main&#xD;
      objective was to compare the viral negative conversion rate in the first week after the&#xD;
      subjects were randomized to arbidol plus basic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 380 eligible patients with pneumonia diagnosed with 2019-ncov infection were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups at a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients will receive one of two treatment regimens: A .Abidor tablets + basic treatment B.&#xD;
      basic treatment Arbidol tablets: take 2 tablets/time, 3 times/day for 14-20 days Basic&#xD;
      treatment :The basic treatment used by the investigator was based on the condition of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
