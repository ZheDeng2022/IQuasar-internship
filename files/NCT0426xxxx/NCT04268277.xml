    <textblock>
      For marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) Rituximab in combination with conventional chemotherapy is&#xD;
      widely used for those patients who fail local therapy or do not qualify for such. Depending&#xD;
      on the MZL subtype Rituximab/chemotherapy is able to induce in part long remissions, but does&#xD;
      not prevent relapse later on. In addition, chemotherapy associated toxicity is often&#xD;
      problematic in MZL patients, who are mostly of advanced age. Thus, chemotherapy-free&#xD;
      approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Rituximab single agent is a widely&#xD;
      used chemotherapy-free approach in MZL, but was significantly inferior compared to&#xD;
      Rituximab/chlorambucil in a large randomized prospective clinical trial in treatment naïve&#xD;
      MZL with a CR rate of 55.8% vs. 78.8%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Thus, it is the major aim to&#xD;
      develop chemotherapy-free approaches for MZL, which approach or surpass efficacy of&#xD;
      rituximab/chemotherapy combinations, but avoid chemotherapy associated toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Checkpoint inhibitors such as Pembrolizumab have revolutionized cancer treatment and have&#xD;
      also shown first encouraging results in Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Based on these observations it&#xD;
      is the aim of this study to test the toxicity and efficacy of Pembrolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed MZL in&#xD;
      need of treatment, who are not eligible or failed local therapy, following the assumption&#xD;
      that this novel chemotherapy-free combination is significantly more efficient than Rituximab&#xD;
      single agent therapy and at least as efficient as rituximab/chemotherapy, but avoids&#xD;
      chemotherapy-related toxicity.&#xD;

      single agent therapy and at least as efficient as rituximab/chemotherapy, but avoids&#xD;
      chemotherapy-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the trial is to test the efficacy and toxicity of treatment with&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab and Rituximab in patients with MZL in need of treatment, who have failed or are&#xD;
      not eligible for local therapy or relapsed. For efficacy the rate of complete remissions&#xD;
      (according to the GELA criteria for gastric MALT or to the Cheson 2007 criteria for nodal and&#xD;
      splenic MZL) after end of treatment (18 cycles) will be primarily analyzed. For toxicity&#xD;
      assessment treatment associated adverse events, quality of life and cumulative incidence of&#xD;
      secondary malignancies will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a European multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of 18 cycles of&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab and Rituximab in patients aged ≥ 18 years with previously untreated or relapsed&#xD;
      MZL in need of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is the complete response (CR rate (CRR) determined after end of treatment&#xD;
      (18 cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study flow will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously untreated or relapsed patients will be screened for eligibility for the&#xD;
           trial. If the patient is eligible for the study, the patient will be registered before&#xD;
           the first cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who progress at any time point during treatment are considered as treatment&#xD;
           failure. They will be followed up for overall survival until end of follow up period or&#xD;
           death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients, who achieve at least a SD after treatment will be followed up for response&#xD;
           until progression/relapse and for overall survival until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that a total of 56 patients at approximately 15 investigator sites in Germany&#xD;
      and 3 centers in Austria will be registered. Every patient will receive treatment over a time&#xD;
      period of 18 cycles (each cycle lasts 3 weeks). Subsequently, patients will be monitored&#xD;
      every 3 months for 2 additional years, subsequently every 6 months for three additional&#xD;
      years. The follow-up phase will be shorter than 5 years if End of Study is reached before&#xD;
      this time period.&#xD;

        this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed CD20 positive de novo or relapsed MALT Lymphoma in need of treatment&#xD;
             following or being not eligible for local therapy (including surgery, radiotherapy and&#xD;
             antibiotics e.g. for H. pylori-positive gastric lymphoma arisen at any extranodal&#xD;
             site) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed CD20 positive de novo or relapsed splenic MZL in need of treatment following&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Confirmed CD20 positive de novo or relapsed nodal MZL in need of treatment following&#xD;
             or not being eligible for local therapy (radiotherapy). The need of treatment is&#xD;
             applicable in the case of B symptoms, deterioration of peripheral blood counts due to&#xD;
             lymphoma infiltration of the bone marrow, rapid enlargement of lymph nodes or&#xD;

&#xD;
        • At least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (&gt;=1.5 cm in its largest dimension by&#xD;
        CT/PET-CT scan or MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        For splenic MZL (SMZL):&#xD;
&#xD;
        In patients with splenic MZL, an enlarged spleen on CT scan and lymphoma cell infiltration&#xD;
        has to be seen in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least one of the following criteria must be fulfilled:&#xD;
