  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I/Ib study is to determine the safety profile of NIZ985 (new&#xD;
      formulation), and if it can be safely combined with Spartalizumab and to determine the&#xD;
      appropriate dose and schedule for further study. Moreover, the study will characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profiles of NIZ985 as a single agent and in combination with Spartalizumab&#xD;
      and identify preliminary anti-tumor activity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/Ib, open-label, global, multi-center study of subcutaneously administered&#xD;
      NIZ985 alone and in combination with Spartalizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors and&#xD;
      lymphoma who have progressed after obtaining a previous response to anti-PD-1/ Check Point&#xD;
      Inhibitor (CPI) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. Two separate arms will&#xD;
      be examined during the escalation portion: 1) evaluation of NIZ985 as a single agent.&#xD;
      Spartalizumab may be added at the time of the first disease re-evaluation and 2)&#xD;
      administration of NIZ985 and Spartalizumab as a combination starting from Cycle 1Day 1.&#xD;

          8. Infection(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active HBV or HCV infection (per institutional guidelines). Patients with chronic&#xD;
                  HBV or HCV disease that is controlled under antiviral therapy are allowed in&#xD;
                  expansion but not in escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy. Patients requiring systemic&#xD;
                  antibiotics for infection must have completed treatment before screening is&#xD;
                  initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Patients previously exposed to CPI treatment who were adequately treated for skin rash&#xD;
             or with replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of or current interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis grade ≥ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug, except for palliative&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Treatment with cytotoxic or targeted antineoplastics within 3 weeks of initiation of&#xD;
             study treatment. For cytotoxic agents that have major delayed toxicities, a washout&#xD;
             period of one cycle is indicated (examples are nitrosoureas and mitomycin C which&#xD;
             typically require a 6 week washout). Prior antibodies or immunotherapies require a 4&#xD;
             week washout. Ongoing bisphosphonate therapy and growth hormone-releasing hormone&#xD;
             (GHRH) agonist therapy is allowed. Supportive therapy with denosumab is allowed. For&#xD;
             patients with lymphoma, the following washout criteria may be used:&#xD;

             kinase inhibitors or other targeted small molecules, and toxin immunoconjugates) or&#xD;
             any experimental therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, before&#xD;
             the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Presence of Grade ≥ 2 toxicity according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), from prior cancer therapy with&#xD;
             the exception of neuropathy (inclusion of patients with neuropathy of Grade 2 or less&#xD;
             is permitted), ototoxicity, and alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Two weeks since major surgery treatment (mediastinoscopy, insertion of a central&#xD;
             venous access device and insertion of a feeding tube are not considered major surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Use of any live vaccines against infectious diseases within 4 weeks of initiation of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Use of hematopoietic growth factors or transfusion support ≤ 2 weeks prior to start of&#xD;
             study treatment. If growth factors were initiated more than 2 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment and the patient is on a stable dose, they can be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Any medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgement, prevent the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns, compliance with&#xD;
             clinical study procedures, or interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             while taking study medication and for 150 days after stopping medication. Highly&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking investigational drug(s). In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected, or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine&#xD;
                  system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable&#xD;
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal&#xD;
                  hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
             have had over 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
             clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate [generally age from 40 to 59 years], history of&#xD;
             vasomotor symptoms [e.g. hot flush]) in the absence of other medical justification or&#xD;
             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy&#xD;
             alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up&#xD;
             hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. A condom is required for all sexually active male participants to prevent them from&#xD;
             fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to&#xD;
             their partner. Sexually active males receiving NIZ985 as a single agent or in&#xD;
             combination with Spartalizumab must use a condom during intercourse for 30 days after&#xD;
             their last dose of NIZ985. In addition, male participants must not donate sperm for 30&#xD;
             days after the last dose of NIZ985. Patients should not father a child during this&#xD;
             post treatment period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as&#xD;
             well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the&#xD;
             drug via semen.&#xD;
