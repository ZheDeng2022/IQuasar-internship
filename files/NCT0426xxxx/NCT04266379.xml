      This study is a RCT of 3 month at home comparing closed-loop control (CLC) system vs sensor&#xD;
      and pump therapy (S&amp;P), with a 3-month extension phase, in Type 1 diabetic patient prone to&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. After a 2-week run-in phase with blinded CGM, patients who spent 5% or more&#xD;
      time below 70mg/dL will be eligible to continue. They will will be randomly assigned 2:1 to&#xD;
      the use of closed-loop control (CLC) using Tandem Control-IQ vs S&amp;P for 3 months, which is&#xD;
      the timing of the primary outcome for the RCT. After 3 months, the S&amp;P group will use CLC for&#xD;
      up to 3 months and the CLC group will continue using CLC for up to 3 additional months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is randomized controlled trial of 3 month at home closed-loop control (CLC) system&#xD;
      vs sensor and pump therapy (S&amp;P), with a 3-month extension phase. The objective is to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of home use of a Control-to-Range (CTR) closed-loop (CL) system in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes prone to hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLC system will consist of Tandem Control-IQ Automated Insulin Delivery System (AIDS),&#xD;
      including Tandem X2 insulin pump with embedded Control-IQ algorithm and Dexcom G6 CGM&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is signed, eligibility will be assessed. All participants will initiate a&#xD;
      run-in phase of 2 weeks of blinded Dexcom G6 CGM wear and personal insulin pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to overall initiation of the RCT, the time spent with CGM below 70 mg/dl during the&#xD;
      run-in phase will be assessed. Only patients showing % time with CGM &lt;70 mg/dl of 5% or above&#xD;
      can be randomized. Included patients who cannot be randomized will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent participants who show randomization criteria during the run-in phase will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned 2:1 to the use of closed-loop control (CLC) using Tandem Control-IQ vs S&amp;P&#xD;
      for 3 months, which is the timing of the primary outcome for the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months, the S&amp;P group will use CLC for up to 3 months and the CLC group will continue&#xD;
      using CLC for up to 3 additional months.&#xD;
