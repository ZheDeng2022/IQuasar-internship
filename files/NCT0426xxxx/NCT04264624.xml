  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first step in the management of periodontal disease involves the non-surgical removal of&#xD;
      the soft and hard bacterial deposits at all supra- and sub-gingival sites, especially into&#xD;
      deep pockets, which can be carried on with different instruments. Unfortunately it seems&#xD;
      that, after the initial therapy, many patients still present with active pockets (residual&#xD;
      pockets) requiring further treatment and posing a risk of disease progression. This might be&#xD;
      due to limitations of the instruments applied and patient-related factors. Air-polishing with&#xD;
      low-abrasiveness powders seems to be very effective in the removal of supra- and sub-gingival&#xD;
      biofilm and could provide additional benefits during the treatment of pockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the present randomized controlled trial was that the adjunctive use of a&#xD;
      sub-gingival nozzle for air-polishing with erythritol powder in pockets with probing depth of&#xD;
      5-9mm and with bleeding (experimental sites) can bring clinical and microbiological&#xD;
      advantages during the active therapy of periodontal disease, and reduce the number of&#xD;
      residual pockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the patients, upon initial evaluation, were divided in 2 study&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The control group, undergoing a standard procedure involving air-polishing&#xD;
           supra-gingivally and at healthy sub-gingival sites followed by debridement with an&#xD;
           ultrasonic scaler at deep pathological pockets&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study group, undergoing the same procedure but with the additional use of a&#xD;
           sub-gingival nozzle at deep pathological pockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healing of the experimental sites and the prevalence of residual pockets will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 3 months after the initial therapy and compared between the two groups.&#xD;

      OUTCOME&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome measure: 3-month change in the number of sites with probing depth (PD)&#xD;
           5-9 mm and positive to bleeding upon probing (BoP). Sites characterized by PD 5-9 mm and&#xD;
           BoP+ will be therefore identified as &quot;experimental sites&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcomes: 3-month changes in the following clinical parameters assessed at&#xD;
           experimental sites: clinical attachment level (CAL), PD, number of sites harboring&#xD;
           supra-gingival plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other evaluations: Pocket microbiological (subgingival plaque) samples at one&#xD;
           (interproximal) experimental site for analysis of periodontal pathogens at baseline and&#xD;
           3 months following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Forty (40) adults, aged 18-75 years, will be entered into study&#xD;
      (randomized). It is expected that at least thirty-two (32) subjects will complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized subjects who deviate from the protocol (major protocol deviation) and, for this&#xD;
      reason, are excluded from the analysis, will be replaced to guarantee that the sample&#xD;
      required for the analysis (32) is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male and female subjects, aged 18-75 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;

           genetic disorder, ongoing malignant disease of any type that could influence the outcome&#xD;
           of the treatment and might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate to severe periodontitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 8 experimental sites (PD 5-9 mm and BoP+).&#xD;
&#xD;
