      The aims of this study were to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the Care &amp; Organize&#xD;
      Our Lifestyle (COOL) program, a self-regulation theory-based mHealth program, on improving&#xD;
      disease knowledge and physical activity in youth with congenital heart disease (CHD). The&#xD;
      COOL program is a 12-month randomized controlled trial that compared two active intervention&#xD;
      groups to a standard-care control group (n = 47). Participants with simple and moderate CHD&#xD;
      aged 15-24 years were recruited from pediatric or adult CHD outpatient departments.&#xD;
      Participants in one active intervention group (n = 49) were provided with COOL Passport, a&#xD;
      mobile healthcare application. Those in the other group (n = 47) were provided with access to&#xD;
      the Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game-based interactive platforms along with COOL&#xD;
      Passport. Outcomes were the Leuven Knowledge Questionnaire for CHD and the International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire-Taiwan Show-Card Version.&#xD;

      Background: Mobile health initiatives may provide youth with congenital heart disease (CHD)&#xD;
      relevant health information and a platform for managing the complex health care needs&#xD;
      associated with undergoing transitional care.&#xD;
