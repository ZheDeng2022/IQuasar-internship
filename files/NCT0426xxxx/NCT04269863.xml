  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiplatelet therapies are important to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with&#xD;
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) through the prevention of thrombus formation. Aspirin (ASA)&#xD;
      is a readily available and affordable antiplatelet medication that can help reduce adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events by up to 25%. However, 25-60% of PAD patients are &quot;ASA insensitive&quot;&#xD;
      having a lower than normal ability to inhibit platelet aggregation after standard aspirin&#xD;
      dosing. In a previous study conducted by our lab, we were able to demonstrate a methodology&#xD;
      for personalizing antiplatelet therapy using two platelet function tests, Platelet Function&#xD;
      Analyzer-100 (PFA 100) and Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA). To investigate this&#xD;
      methodology further, we would like to conduct a pilot study on two cohorts of patients, one&#xD;
      population continuing with their current medications (81mg ASA), and a second group who will&#xD;
      get personalized antiplatelet therapy using our methodology (81-325mg ASA). In this study,&#xD;
      150 PAD patients taking 81mg Aspirin therapy presenting for clinical follow-up, or in-patient&#xD;
      intervention, in vascular clinics or the emergency room, will be recruited to our study. 75&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned undergo platelet analysis using PFA-200 and LTA, and will&#xD;
      have their antiplatelet therapy personalized. Patients will then be followed up in order to&#xD;
      see if the patients with personalized therapy have better platelet inhibition. This study&#xD;
      will allow us to help personalize antiplatelet therapy in PAD patients, allowing for better&#xD;
      patient outcomes and decreased adverse cardiovascular events.&#xD;
