  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease with a poor prognosis. More&#xD;
      accurate tests to predict disease progression and response to treatment are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is a blood marker associated with IPF. Results from previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that levels of KL-6 are higher in patients with IPF compared to people&#xD;
      without the disease. In addition, it is not clear what impact treatment has on KL-6 levels,&#xD;
      and whether this could help us to monitor how effective treatment for IPF is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to perform a study in which KL-6 levels in the blood of patients with&#xD;
      a new diagnosis of IPF are measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months to look for and changes&#xD;
      in the levels of KL-6 in the blood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Effective treatment which slows the progression of IPF has recently become available however,&#xD;
      it is costly and at present is limited to patients who meet specific criteria based on their&#xD;
      breathing tests. The breathing tests currently available to monitor progression of the&#xD;
      disease are not always reliable and do not predict which patients will respond to treatment.&#xD;
      More accurate tests to predict disease progression and response to treatment are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is a blood marker associated with IPF. Results from previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that levels of KL-6 are higher in patients with IPF compared to people&#xD;
      without the disease. The majority of studies using KL-6 in IPF have taken place in Japan and&#xD;
      there is limited evidence of how useful it is in a European population. In addition, it is&#xD;
      not clear what impact treatment has on KL-6 levels, and whether this could help us to monitor&#xD;
      how effective treatment for IPF is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to perform a study in which KL-6 levels in the blood of patients with&#xD;
      a new diagnosis of IPF are measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months to look for and changes&#xD;
      in the levels of KL-6 in the blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess changes in serum KL-6 levels in patients with IPF&#xD;
      over a 12-month period and assess if this correlates with changes in lung function and if&#xD;
      KL-6 levels change in response to treatment with antifibrotic therapy.&#xD;
