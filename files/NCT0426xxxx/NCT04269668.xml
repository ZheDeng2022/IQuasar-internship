  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop systems are becoming an integral part of diabetes management. These systems were&#xD;
      uniformly proven to improve glycemic control, reduce hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia while&#xD;
      modestly reducing HbA1c levels and improving quality of life. While overnight control is&#xD;
      close to optimal under closed loop control, postprandial hyperglycemia during daytime remains&#xD;
      a challenge. The advanced hybrid closed loop system was designed with an improved auto-basal&#xD;
      control and additional auto-bolus module that delivers correction boluses automatically. In&#xD;
      addition, this system was developed to improve user experience by significantly reducing the&#xD;
      amount of alarms and exits from Auto Mode. Therefore, this system might have an advance in&#xD;
      treating hyperglycemia over the hybrid closed loop that controls glucose levels by modulation&#xD;
      of insulin basal rate only. Therefore, we propose the current study that will compare 6 weeks&#xD;
      glycemic control using hybrid closed loop versus advanced hybrid closed loop that add&#xD;
      correction boluses among young children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of 6 weeks&#xD;
      glucose control using Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL-670G) compared to Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop&#xD;
      System (AHCL- 670G) in young subjects with sub-optimally controlled type 1 diabetes. A total&#xD;
      of 28 subjects (age 7-14 years) will be enrolled at two investigational centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the cross-over study participants will be offered with an extension period,&#xD;
      during which they will be offered to use their preferred closed-loop system for another 3&#xD;
      months&#xD;
