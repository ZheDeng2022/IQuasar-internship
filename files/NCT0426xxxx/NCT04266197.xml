  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of RT234 on exercise parameters&#xD;
      assessed by a specialized exercise test (Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test or CPET) in patients&#xD;
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consequences of pulmonary arterial hypertension are significant limitations in&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), exercise capacity, as well as profound dyspnea with physical&#xD;
      exertion. The objective of the present study is to assess the ability of a single inhaled&#xD;
      dose of RT234 to acutely improve primary CPET measures of CRF and exercise capacity, and to&#xD;
      lower the sensation of dyspnea with physical exertion compared to baseline CPET measures.&#xD;
