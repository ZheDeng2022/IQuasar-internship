    <textblock>
      The recent introduction of anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and anti- PD-L1&#xD;
      (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) immune checkpoint inhibitors revolutionized oncological&#xD;
      guidelines. Durable responses and prolongation of survival with these agents come at the&#xD;
      price of the development of immune related adverse events (irAEs). Innovative tools are&#xD;
      required in order to manage irAEs and to prevent their potential relapse, with the goal to&#xD;
      improve the outcome of patients. In this regard, the Investigators aim to develop a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary clinical pathway for cancer patients that are treated with immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidences in immuno-oncology showed an important role of the immune system in tumor&#xD;
      control. In fact, immune response, both innate and adaptive one, is the first defensive&#xD;
      mechanism against cancer. However, several tumors, during their progression, develop an&#xD;
      immune-tolerance characterized by the activation of immune inhibitory pathways including PD-1&#xD;
      and PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent introduction of anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and anti-PD-L1&#xD;
      (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) immune checkpoint inhibitors revolutionized oncological&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the aforementioned agents are approved for the treatment of advanced malignant&#xD;
      melanoma; non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the number of&#xD;
      treatment indications for immune checkpoint inhibitors is expanding. Durable responses and&#xD;
      prolongation of survival with these agents come at the price of the development of&#xD;
      immune-related adverse events (irAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune-related adverse events are due to the loss of immune-tolerance towards structures of&#xD;
      the self, with the induction of chronic inflammation with an autoimmune mechanism that can&#xD;
      involve numerous organs and systems. The most frequent irAEs reported in clinical trials are&#xD;
      represented by skin toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, endocrine toxicity, pulmonary&#xD;
      toxicity, and others such as polymyalgia rheumatica, polyarthritis, myositis, nephritis,&#xD;
      polyradiculoneuritis, encephalitis and myocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The irAEs reported in clinical trials with nivolumab amount to a maximum of 85% considering&#xD;
      all grade of toxicities, while approximately 75% of patients treated with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      presented irAEs. Grade 3/4 irAEs were reported in 10% of patients treated with anti-PD-1.&#xD;
      With atezolizumab fewer patients had treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events (15%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases, irAEs occur within some weeks after starting of immunotherapy; however these&#xD;
      toxicities have been reported later and also years after treatment discontinuation. The&#xD;
      development of irAEs is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in cancer&#xD;
      patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and therefore they may significantly&#xD;
      affect the quality of life, even in patients achieve the control of neoplastic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overseeing, early diagnosis and clinical management of immune checkpoint inhibitors'&#xD;
      toxicities in the clinical setting are, currently, not standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovative tools are required in order to manage irAEs and to prevent their potential&#xD;
      relapse, with the goal to improve the outcome and quality of life of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the Investigators also aim to evaluate a model of multidisciplinary clinical&#xD;
      pathway for cancer patients that are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in order to&#xD;
      improve their management and also ameliorate the quality of life of patients that develop&#xD;
      irAEs.&#xD;
