  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of this study is to determine if the innate immune response is dysregulated in&#xD;
      people with fibromyalgia, compared to healthy controls. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy will&#xD;
      be used to measure changes in the brain's metabolic profile following an experimental immune&#xD;
      stimulus, to test whether individuals with fibromyalgia show a heightened immune response in&#xD;
      the brain. The ultimate goal of this research is to better understand the role of brain&#xD;
      inflammation in the pathophysiology of chronic pain and fatigue, which will guide the&#xD;
      development of more effective therapies for these conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two sessions: the screening session and the experimental session.&#xD;
      During the initial phone screening, individuals who contact the study team will be given&#xD;
      information about the study, including a description of all study-related procedures. If&#xD;
      interested, participants will then be taken through a phone screen interview that will ask&#xD;
      them to report demographic information (date of birth, race, ethnicity), height and weight,&#xD;
      and list of medical conditions and current medications, surgical history within the past&#xD;
      year, amount of weekly consumption of alcohol, tobacco products, and illicit substances,&#xD;
      viral or bacterial infections within the past 3 months, recent vaccines received, and current&#xD;
      participation in other research. The standard MRI Safety form will be administered to ensure&#xD;
      participants do not have ferromagnetic implants or other contraindications to MRI (e.g.&#xD;
      claustrophobia).A self-report will also be administered to ascertain that potential&#xD;
      fibromyalgia participants meet 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for&#xD;
      fibromyalgia. The phone screen is intended to reduce participant burden by identifying&#xD;
      exclusion criteria without the need to attend at UAB. Participants who meet initial screening&#xD;
      criteria will be invited to attend an in-person screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, participants will go to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on the&#xD;
      15th floor of Jefferson Tower. Participants will be asked to fast prior to this visit.&#xD;
      Participants will provide written informed consent before any study procedures are initiated.&#xD;
      Participants will provide a urine sample for pregnancy testing. Vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate), aural temperature, height and weight will be measured and recorded. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo 12-lead electrocardiogram and provide a maximum of 60cc of blood into labeled&#xD;
      blood collection tubes for screening tests. A tender point exam will be administered to&#xD;
      assess fibromyalgia symptomatology. The procedure uses a pressure algometer, a hand-held&#xD;
      instrument with a small rubber tip that is applied to the participant's skin over&#xD;
      standardized regions of the body (occipital, low cervical, upper trapezius, supraspinatus,&#xD;
      anterior second rib, lateral epicondyle, gluteal, greater trochanteric, or medial knee).&#xD;
      Pressure is slowly increased at a constant rate until the participant reports the sensation&#xD;
      changing from one of pressure to one of pain or discomfort. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      demographics form , Brief Pain Inventory, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Multidimensional&#xD;
      Fatigue Inventory, and Multiple Abilities Symptom Questionnaire. The blood will be tested by&#xD;
      the UAB Hospital Labs to ensure that the participant meets the study criteria. The ECG will&#xD;
      be forwarded to the study physician who will assess for evidence of conduction abnormalities&#xD;
      or of ischemia. If the blood tests or ECG are abnormal, the study physician will determine if&#xD;
      the participant should be advised to see their PCP. Following availability of all results&#xD;
      from the screening visit, participants will be contacted via phone and informed of their&#xD;
      eligibility to attend the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the experimental session, the administration of endotoxin, brain imaging, and related&#xD;
      procedures will be performed at the CRU. No fasting is required prior to this visit, and&#xD;
      participants will be asked to eat breakfast prior to arrival and will be provided with meal&#xD;
      suggestions. Baseline vital sign measurements consisting of resting blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
      rate will be measured and recorded within 60 minutes prior to the start of imaging. ECG and&#xD;
      pregnancy tests will be repeated and participants will be excluded from participation in the&#xD;
      session if conduction abnormalities are found (same criteria as used during screening) or if&#xD;
      participants are found to be pregnant. Participants will undergo MRI imaging for&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour. Participants will leave the scanner and complete questionnaire measures&#xD;
      assessing participant's current level of fatigue, pain, and mood symptoms. Grip strength will&#xD;
      also be assessed. A low dose of endotoxin (0.3ng/kg) will then be administered by the study&#xD;
      nurse via intravenous infusion. Vital signs will be periodically monitored for the rest of&#xD;
      the session. Participants will remain in the laboratory for three hours before being placed&#xD;
      into the MRI scanner to complete a second, identical, imaging session. The self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire measures and grip strength will be repeated every hour following endotoxin&#xD;
      administration in order to quantify changes in symptoms due to LPS. To avoid participant&#xD;
      discomfort and to optimize study integrity, a standardized meal of approximately 600-kcal&#xD;
      will be provided to each participant between the two MRI sessions, as well as a later snack&#xD;
      of approximately 200-kcal. The meal is standardized to caloric quantity and timing to offset&#xD;
      any effects of food intake on the immune response.&#xD;
