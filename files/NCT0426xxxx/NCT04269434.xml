    <textblock>
      A Multicentre, controlled, randomized trial of 3 site (urethra, pharynx and rectum) sampling&#xD;
      performed every 3 months (3x3) for Neisseria gonorrhoea (Ng)/Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct)&#xD;
      screening (comparator) vs. no screening (intervention).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, controlled, randomized trial of 3x3 Ng/Ct screening (comparator)&#xD;
      vs. no screening (intervention). It will be performed in the PrEP cohorts situated at the&#xD;
      Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Hôpital Saint-Pierre (HSP), Liège University Hospital&#xD;
      (CHU), University Hospital of Gent (UZG) and Erasmus Hospital (EH). All men in follow up at&#xD;
      these five centres who report having had sex with another man in the previous year and are&#xD;
      enrolled for PrEP follow up will be eligible to participate in the study. After signing&#xD;
      informed consent participants will be randomized via a computer-generated schema to either&#xD;
      3x3 screening or no Ng/Ct screening. In both arms, participants will be followed up in an&#xD;
      identical fashion including 3x3 screening. The only difference between the arms will be that&#xD;
      in the screening arm, Ng/Ct results will be sent by the STI Laboratory to the study&#xD;
      physicians and these participants will be treated and partner contact tracing will be done.&#xD;
      The Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Laboratory will only process the samples/report the&#xD;
      results from the non-screening arm at the end of the study. In both arms, all individuals&#xD;
      with symptoms compatible with Ng or Ct will be tested and treated for these infections&#xD;
      according to current best practice guidelines. At the end of the 12-month study period,&#xD;
      participants whose most recent tests were positive for Ng or Ct will receive treatment for&#xD;
      these.&#xD;
