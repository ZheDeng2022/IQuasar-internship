    <textblock>
      Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disorder in North America, affecting more than 31&#xD;
      million people annually. Common therapy for CRS includes intranasal corticosteroids (INCS)&#xD;
      such as budesonide. At our centre , the current practice is to administer budesonide two&#xD;
      ways: the mucosal atomization device (MAD), which is a nasal spray or impregnated budesonide&#xD;
      in nasal saline irrigation (INSI), which is a nasal rinse. Our study aims to see which method&#xD;
      of administering budesonide has the best treatment outcomes after sinus surgery. This study&#xD;
      will follow patients over a six-month period of time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) is&#xD;
      a common condition affecting millions of North Americans. CRS is a multifactorial disease&#xD;
      that causes inflammation within the sinonasal passages. Symptoms include; dysosmia, nasal&#xD;
      blockage, sinus pain, and discolored mucous. Olfactory dysfunction is commonly seen in the&#xD;
      CRS patient population. It is estimated that up to 78% of CRS patients have a decreased sense&#xD;
      of smell. Therefore, validated smell tests such as Sniffin'Sticks have been used to determine&#xD;
      the severity and presence of dysosmia. In addition, patients are frequently colonized with&#xD;
      various bacteria or fungi which may further aggravate patient's symptoms. Together, these&#xD;
      manifestations lead to a decreased quality of life in CRS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basis of therapy is to increase mucociliary clearance, improve drainage and relieve&#xD;
      obstruction, and eliminate signs of inflammation. Common therapy for the inflamed nasal&#xD;
      mucosal lining includes intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) or systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
      Budesonide (Pulmicort) is a corticosteroid which is the mainstay treatment for CRS patients.&#xD;
      They have been proven to be very effective in reducing SNOT-22 scores, endoscopic scores, and&#xD;
      reducing recurrence in varying severity and subtype of CRS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current practice at our institution is to administer budesonide via two modalities: the&#xD;
      mucosal atomization device (MAD, Wolfe-Tory Medical, Salt Lake City, UT) or impregnated&#xD;
      budesonide in nasal saline irrigation (INSI) using a NeilMed squeeze bottle (NeilMed&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, Santa Rosa, California). The MAD atomizes the medication into particles from&#xD;
      30-100 um in size thus increasing the surface area for drug absorption. At our centre, INSI&#xD;
      is frequently employed for CRS patients in the acute postoperative period. Postoperative use&#xD;
      of INSI has shown to demonstrate significant improvement in quality of life and endoscopy&#xD;
      findings in CRS patients. However, patients can potentially experience headaches and&#xD;
      discomfort, which can affect their adherence to this treatment regimen. Therefore, for&#xD;
      recalcitrant and non-responsive CRS patients, an alternative treatment method is to utilize&#xD;
      budesonide via a MAD in its concentrated form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is literature that exemplifies the benefit of adding budesonide to&#xD;
      postoperative management of CRS patients, there is yet to be a study that assesses the most&#xD;
      effective modality of administering the corticosteroid. Therefore, this study aims to&#xD;
      prospectively assess the efficacy of INSI and MAD in delivering high-dose nasal&#xD;
      corticosteroids in CRS patients. By determining which administration technique is more&#xD;
      effective, it will lead to better postoperative outcomes for patients suffering from CRS.&#xD;
      Overall, the investigators hope the results from this study will be a step forward in the&#xD;
      understanding which administration modality of intranasal corticosteroids is most effective&#xD;
      in ameliorating patient disease and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the postoperative efficacy of budesonide in CRS patients delivered via mucosal&#xD;
      atomization device (MAD) or impregnated budesonide in nasal saline irrigation (INSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that budesonide delivered via MAD will be more effective&#xD;
      postoperatively at decreasing objective evidence and subjective symptoms of CRS compared to&#xD;
      INSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Follow-up Visits Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be obtained from each participant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Demographic data: Age Gender Smoking status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Lund-Kennedy (MLK) scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sinonasal cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) and EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sniffin' Sticks Smell Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine Blood work (Only at week 1 and month 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized double cohort study at the St. Paul's Sinus Centre. Patients&#xD;
      who have an upcoming sinus surgery will be recruited to this study. After the patients have&#xD;
      signed the informed consent form and have undergone sinus surgery, they will have their&#xD;
      baseline visit. Patients will be divided into the MAD or INSI arm randomly. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to take budesonide at least 5 days a week to assure changes seen are directly&#xD;
      correlated to taking budesonide. Baseline will be the 1-week postoperative visit following&#xD;
      the patient's sinus surgery. Further data will be collected at month 3 and lastly at the&#xD;
      patients 6 month follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of Patient Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Patients who experience signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of hypersensitivity to iodine, burning, itching, pain redness, tiredness, nausea&#xD;
      or vomiting will be asked to stop the rinses immediately. The reaction will be noted and the&#xD;
      code will be broken so that a discussion can occur between the physician and the patient&#xD;
      regarding the use of iodine with the nasal rinses. Patients who meet any of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria that were not noted at the beginning of the study will be removed from this study&#xD;
      and the physician will discuss the future management options with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect 60 patients (30 patients per study arm) for the number of&#xD;
      participants in this prospective double cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the baseline characteristic data and the data&#xD;
      from the administered surveys and objective findings of eosinophil and IgE blood work,&#xD;
      cultures, Sniffin' Sticks smell test and MLK scores. In addition, rigorous statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted on the Likert scale-based SNOT-22 and EQ-5D-5L surveys. These&#xD;
      analyses will include cross-tabulations (Pearson's chi square test) and confidence interval&#xD;
      calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience signs and symptoms of budesonide reaction will be noted and the code&#xD;
      will be broken so that a discussion can occur between the research supervisor and the patient&#xD;
      regarding the use of the topical iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can contact the office anytime if they notice any of the signs or symptoms of iodine&#xD;
      reaction and will be seen by the research supervisor (or designate) within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events (AE's)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All expected and unexpected adverse events will be recorded and graded by the research&#xD;
      supervisor. Stable chronic conditions, which are present prior to the clinical trial entry&#xD;
      and do not worsen, are not considered adverse events and will be accounted for in the&#xD;
      patient's medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording/Documentation of Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each patient visit, the research supervisor will ask appropriate questions and perform&#xD;
      a physical exam to elicit any adverse events. The research supervisor will also review blood&#xD;
      work obtained from the patient. All reportable adverse events will be recorded on appropriate&#xD;
      case report form. The research supervisor will also write the stop date, the severity of the&#xD;
      AE and his judgment of the AE's relationship to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAE's)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An SAE is defined as an AE meeting one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death occurring between Day 0 and 182 days (6 months) of the study. Life Threatening Event&#xD;
      (defined as a participant at immediate risk of death at the time of the event) In-patient&#xD;
      hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization between Day 0 and 42 of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity In the event of SAE, the&#xD;
      research supervisor will discuss with the patient (or next of kin) whether there is a&#xD;
      relationship between the study and the SAE. If there is a relationship, the PI will be&#xD;
      responsible for coordinating care for the patient until the SAE has been addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy During the Trial Patients will be responsible for determining if they are pregnant&#xD;
      or become pregnant during the study. If patients notify the PI they are pregnant, they will&#xD;
      be removed from the study and the medical management options will be discussed.&#xD;
