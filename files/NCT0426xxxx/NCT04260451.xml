  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary complications are the most common complication in thoracic surgery and the leading&#xD;
      cause of mortality.Therefore, lung protection is utmost important, and protective ventilation&#xD;
      is strongly recommended in thoracic surgery. Protective ventilation is a prevailing&#xD;
      ventilatory strategy in these days and is comprised of small tidal volume, limited&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure, and application of positive end-expiratory pressure. However, several&#xD;
      retrospective studies recently suggested that tidal volume, inspiratory pressure, and&#xD;
      positive end-expiratory pressure are not related to patient outcomes, or only related when&#xD;
      they influenced the driving pressure. Recently, the investigators reported the first&#xD;
      prospective study about the driving pressure-guided ventilation in thoracic surgery. PEEP was&#xD;
      titrated to bring the lowest driving pressure in each patient and applied throughout the one&#xD;
      lung ventilation. The application of individualized PEEP reduced the incidence of pulmonary&#xD;
      complications.However, that study was small size single center study with 312 patients. Thus,&#xD;
      investigators try to perform large scale multicenter study. Through this study investigators&#xD;
      evaluate that driving pressure-guided ventilation can reduce the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      pulmonary complications compared with conventional protective ventilation in thoracic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowdays, the usual setting of protective ventilation during one lung ventilation is tidal&#xD;
      volume (VT) 5 ml/kg of predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm&#xD;
      H2O and plateau pressure (Pplat) less than 25 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications is still being observed&#xD;
      even with a protective ventilatory strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving pressure is [Pplat - PEEP] and is the pressure required for the alveolar opening.&#xD;
      Static lung compliance (Cstat) is expressed as [VT / (Pplat - PEEP)]. Thus, driving pressure&#xD;
      is also expressed as [VT / Cstat]. Driving pressure has an inverse relationship with Cstat&#xD;
      and orthodromic relationship with VT according to this formula. High driving pressure&#xD;
      indicates poor lung condition with decreased lung compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, investigator try to prove that driving pressure limited ventilation is superior in&#xD;
      preventing postoperative pulmonary complications to existing protective ventilation in large&#xD;
      scale multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruit maneuver perform all group after intubation (stepwise increase of positive end&#xD;
      expiratory pressure 5,10,15 cmH2O with tidal volume 5mL/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control arm receives existing conventional protective ventilation with tidal volume of&#xD;
      5mL/kg of ideal body weight and PEEP of 5 cmH2O during one-lung ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The driving pressure arm receives driving pressure limited ventilation with tidal volume of&#xD;
      5mL/kg of ideal body weight and individualized PEEP. Individualized PEEP is adjusted to&#xD;
      minimize driving pressure, it find through decremental PEEP titration from 10 to 2 cmH2O&#xD;
      during one-lung ventilation.&#xD;
