  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current international guidelines recommend a three-month blanking period after pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF). Early recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia&#xD;
      (ERAT; comprising of AF, left atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter) is common, occurring in&#xD;
      up to 65% of patients, but in the first month is generally thought not to predict long-term&#xD;
      AF recurrence, and re-intervention is not recommended. Suggested causes for ERAT include&#xD;
      inflammation and arrhythmogenic structural changes caused by ablation lesions. Early, purely&#xD;
      inflammatory ERAT would not lead to late AF recurrence as pulmonary vein reconnection is&#xD;
      established as the main factor associated with long-term recurrence in paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown ERAT in the second to third month (rather than first month) to be&#xD;
      a stronger predictor of late AF recurrence, due to presumed reduction in the contribution of&#xD;
      the acute inflammatory response after this. Biochemical data have shown that the&#xD;
      post-ablation inflammatory phase is usually limited to the first month after both&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) and cryoballoon (CB) ablation, though inflammatory markers have been&#xD;
      shown to be less elevated following CB PVI. Histologically, lesions formed by the two&#xD;
      modalities differ significantly. RF lesions are characterised by irregular boundaries and&#xD;
      significant disruption to the endothelium, exposing the sub-endothelial layer and resulting&#xD;
      in significant and sustained platelet activation, changes which can last for many months. CB&#xD;
      lesions on the other hand, are observed as well demarcated and homogenous within one week,&#xD;
      with reduced thrombogenicity, which may lead to reduced inflammation. ERAT following CB&#xD;
      ablation cannot be accurately predicted by inflammatory response and it is postulated that&#xD;
      endothelial function may play a role in the development of ERAT in such patients. Some&#xD;
      studies have shown reduced recurrence rate and re-hospitalisation amongst the CB population,&#xD;
      including the FIRE and ICE trial, potentially resulting in a better patient experience with&#xD;
      CB and the possibility of a shorter blanking period. Post-ablation inflammatory response is&#xD;
      more predictive of ERAT following RF than CB PVI, and the latter is considered to be&#xD;
      associated with less inflammation. There is however, a paucity of data evaluating endothelial&#xD;
      function post-AF ablation and its correlation with ERAT or late recurrences of arrhythmia.&#xD;
      Given that earlier re-intervention in patients with ERAT in the third month of the blanking&#xD;
      period can result in greater outcomes with respect to late recurrence of AF, if it can be&#xD;
      demonstrated that endothelial function testing in the first few months post-CB PVI can be&#xD;
      predictive of later ERAT, then shortening the blanking period following CB PVI and performing&#xD;
      repeat ablation to control troublesome later ERAT may reduce overall patient morbidity and&#xD;
      re-hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this novel pilot study is to examine the relationship between the&#xD;
      post-ablation inflammatory response, endothelial function and timing and frequency of ERAT&#xD;
      for patients undergoing RF and CB PVI for paroxysmal or short-lived persistent (less than 6&#xD;
      months' duration) AF. If the initial data provides hypothesis generating information, the aim&#xD;
      would be to perform the study on a larger basis with higher statistical power to determine&#xD;
      whether early post-ablation endothelial function testing can predict recurrences and identify&#xD;
      those suitable for earlier re-intervention.&#xD;
