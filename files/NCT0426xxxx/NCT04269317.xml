    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Tixel C&#xD;
      device for the treatment of acne scars, for improvement in the appearance of surface texture.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      44 participents between two research locations with moderate acne scars will receive 3-5&#xD;
      treatments sessions with the Tixel C device according to investigator's review of subject&#xD;
      response. Improvement of acne scarring will ve evaluated at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment response will be evaluated as well as any incidence of side efects throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

    <description>Safety of the investigational device shall be assessed via quantification of the incidence of devicerelated/non-related undesired effects, which shall be documented and reported as an Adverse Event (AE) or as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). Known undesired effects may be any of the list stated in the previous paragraph of Expected Possible Side Effects, or any other undesired effect, not described in the said list. The incidence of the device related undesired effects should be analyzed considering severity, causal relation to the investigational device and duration, whether it is transient or permanent.</description>
