  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether a primarily self-guided program can&#xD;
      produce changes in weight, body fat and cardiovascular risk among young men.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This self-guided lifestyle intervention may help men to reduce weight and improve heart&#xD;
      health because it has been adapted to meet the possible weight loss needs of young men. Young&#xD;
      men may experience reductions in body weight after enrollment in the intervention, but this&#xD;
      is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation lasts approximately 3 months. Participants will be assessed by the study&#xD;
      staff and fill out questionnaires about current lifestyle practices (diet, physical activity,&#xD;
      sleep habits, risk behaviors). Weight, medical events, and medication use within the last 3&#xD;
      months will be assessed. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a&#xD;
      coin) to the control group or self-guided group.&#xD;

Participants will receive a tool kit that includes evidence-based resources (scale for self-weighing, handouts that will include free self-monitoring apps and strategies for no-cost exercise, sample meal plans and meal planning tips, and tips for healthy living that emphasize risk areas) to assist them during the self-guided phase, as well as weekly health risk text messages.</description>
