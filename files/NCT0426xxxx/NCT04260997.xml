  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17™ has shown promise in several pre-clinical and randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials for weight management outcomes. The current randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial will further assess L. gasseri BNR17™ on&#xD;
      body composition and weight management, and in a study population that is distinct to prior&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials on the strain. The study will recruit 126 overweight adult&#xD;
      participants who will be randomly assigned to consume L. gasseri BNR17™ or placebo once daily&#xD;
      for 12 weeks.&#xD;
