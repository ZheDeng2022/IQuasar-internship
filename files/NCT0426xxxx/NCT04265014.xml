  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The investigators aim is to indicate that the &quot;goal directed fluid management&quot; is&#xD;
      more effective for open abdominal surgeries by performing perioperative hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitorisation using a minimal invasive pulse counter analysis method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will be included 90 participants with ASA II-III risk score aged from&#xD;
      18-64 years. The prospective and randomized participants will be divided into 2 groups as&#xD;
      liberal (Group L) and goal-directed fluid therapy (Group G) fluid treatment. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters and arterial blood gas analysis will be recorded at 30 min intervals. Preoperative&#xD;
      and postoperative creatinine values, CR-POSSUM physiological score, Charlson comorbidity&#xD;
      index (CCI), perioperative and postoperative vasopressor use, postoperative acute kidney&#xD;
      injury network (AKIN), postoperative intensive care requirements, duration of hospital stay&#xD;
      and 30-day mortality will be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood will be taken and assessed from the participants preoperatively one day before surgery&#xD;
      and creatinine, neutrophil, lymphocyte and neutrophil / lymphocyte values will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the gastrointestinal surgery team is the same, randomization will not be applied for&#xD;
      the primary operating surgeon and primary surgeon selection will not be performed.&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will have age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      comorbidities, CCI, POSSUM physiologic score and ASA risk score recorded. After being taken&#xD;
      to the operation room, standard monitoring (ECG, SO2, NIBP) will be performed. A peripheral&#xD;
      venous route will be opened with an 18-gauge needle. Participants will be began 5 mL/kg/hr&#xD;
      crystalloid (isolyte) infusion as standard. Later participants who accept will have an&#xD;
      epidural catheter inserted at the thoracic 10-11 level. After ensuring hemodynamic&#xD;
      stabilization in both groups, sedation will be provided with 0.03 mg/kg midazolam and&#xD;
      arterial monitoring will be provided with radial artery cannulation with a 20-gauge&#xD;
      peripheral cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction and General Anesthesia Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For induction 1-2 mcg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium will be used,&#xD;
      and participants will be orotracheally intubated after two minute ventilation. A MAQUET&#xD;
      flow-I anesthesia device will be placed in volume control (VC) mode by setting to 8 mL/kg&#xD;
      tidal volume and 12/min respiratory count according to ideal body weight with PetCO2 35-45&#xD;
      mmHg. Later, central venous catheterization will be performed on the right internal jugular&#xD;
      vein using USG guidance. Sevoflurane (MAC 0.7-0.9) and remifentanil infusion (0.05-0.3&#xD;
      mcg/kg/min) will be used in anesthesia maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After radial artery and central jugular vein catheterization in Group G, they will be linked&#xD;
      to an EV1000 Flo-trac monitor and monitoring provided continuous mean arterial pressure (MAP)&#xD;
      monitoring with heart rate (HR), stroke volume variation (SVV), central venous pressure&#xD;
      (CVP), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and cardiac index (CI) measured every&#xD;
      minute. After monitoring blood gas will be taken and the initial value accepted as time-1&#xD;
      (t1). At 5 minute intervals, mean arterial pressure (MAP), momentary heart rate (HR) will be&#xD;
      recorded, with CVP, CI, SVV, and SVRI recorded at 30 minute intervals for a total of 240&#xD;
      minutes (t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9), urine amount and blood gas values (pH, PCO2,&#xD;
      PO2, bicarbonate (HCO3), base minus (BM), lactate (lac), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht))&#xD;
      will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group L, radial arterial cannulation and central jugular venous catheterization will be&#xD;
      performed with the first value during monitoring accepted as t1. Then HR and MPA will be&#xD;
      recorded at 5-minute intervals, CVP at 30 minute intervals for a total of 240 minutes (t1,&#xD;
      t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9) and urine amount and blood gas values (pH, PCO2, PO2, HCO3,&#xD;
      BM, lac, Hb, Ht) will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peroperative fluid management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group G:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fluid management will be performed according to SVV and CI monitoring. When participants&#xD;
           have SVV&gt;10%, 250 cc crystalloid will be administered and when SVV fell below 10% during&#xD;
           30-minute monitoring standard (5 mL/kg/hr) crystalloid infusion continues. If SVV&#xD;
           continues above 10%, a second fluid bolus of 250 cc colloid (minifluid challenge) will&#xD;
           be administered. If the desired SVV level can not be reached, the Hct values will be&#xD;
           examined. Blood replacement will be performed when Hct&lt;30% in participants with coronary&#xD;
           artery disease (CAD) and when Hct&lt;25% for other groups. If the desired SVV level can not&#xD;
           be reached in spite of blood replacement products, if CI will be below 2.5 L/min/m2&#xD;
           vasopressor will begun. If SVV will be at normal values with CI below 2.5 L/min/m2,&#xD;
           inotrop will begun.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group L:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid management will be performed according to MAP, HR and urine output. If peroperative&#xD;
      urine amounts will be &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hr during two-hour monitoring, with MAP&lt;65 mmHg, HR&gt;100/min&#xD;
      for at least 30 minutes and CVP falls 20% compared to basal values, the same anesthesiologist&#xD;
      will begin additional fluid replacement of 5 mL/kg/hr based on clinical experience. Blood&#xD;
      product replacement will be provided at Hct&lt;30% for those with coronary artery disease and at&#xD;
      Hct&lt;25% for other participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operation durations, administered fluid types, fluid amounts and blood product amounts&#xD;
      will be recorded. Participants having intensive care need preoperatively planned intensive&#xD;
      care will have planned admission, while participants developing hemodynamic instability&#xD;
      linked to peroperative surgery or anesthesia will be admitted as unplanned care. All&#xD;
      participants will have creatinine, neutrophil, lymphocyte and neutrophil/lymphocyte values&#xD;
      recorded in the 1st and 24th hours postoperative and participants with fever (&gt;38 °C) in the&#xD;
      1st day will be recorded. Acute kidney injury network (AKIN) classification will be made&#xD;
      according to creatinine values measured preoperatively and on the postoperative 1st day. In&#xD;
      the postoperative 30-day period, duration of hospital stay, surgical and pulmonary&#xD;
      complications, inotrop or vasopressor requirements, reason for admission to intensive care,&#xD;
      and duration of stay in intensive care if required will be recorded.&#xD;
