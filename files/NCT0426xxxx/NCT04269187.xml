  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients are a group of patients with special needs during hospitalization.&#xD;
      The vast majority of them is mechanically ventilated and requires continuous assessment of&#xD;
      vital parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is quite impressive that assessment of respiratory muscles, and specifically of the&#xD;
      diaphragm, is lacking in the daily practice of ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diaphragm-the main inspiratory muscle-is considered so important in ICU. A lot of time in&#xD;
      ICUs is spent on weaning patients from mechanical ventilation. Although weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation can be a rapid and uneventful process for the majority of the&#xD;
      patients, it can be difficult in as many as 20-30% of them (1)(2). It is during weaning that&#xD;
      the diaphragm becomes the major pathophysiological determinant of weaning failure or success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning failure is defined as failing a spontaneous breathing trial or developing a&#xD;
      post-extubation respiratory distress that requires re-intubation or non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
      within 48 h following extubation (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, identification of reliable predictors of weaning failure may represent potential avenues&#xD;
      of treatment that could reduce the incidence of weaning failure and its associated morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known predictors of weaning failure include chronic obstructive airway disease (3), cardiac&#xD;
      failure(4-6), lung de-recruitment (7), pneumonia (8) and diaphragmatic dysfunction (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is a clinical predictor of failure of weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and it is widely used in clinical research and in practice (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, diaphragmatic ultrasonography could be a promising tool for predicting reintubation&#xD;
      within 48 hours of extubation. As it permits direct assessment of diaphragm function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be mentioned that diaphragmatic dysfunction among patients hospitalized in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) is commonly attributed to critical illness polyneuropathy and&#xD;
      myopathy. Mechanical ventilation, even after a short period of time, can also induce&#xD;
      diaphragmatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent researches have shown that theophylline improves diaphragmatic contractility in&#xD;
      isolated muscle preparations in animals and in normal human subjects. The question now does&#xD;
      the theophylline have a significant role in critical ill patients with diaphragmatic&#xD;
      dysfunction whether they are diabetic or not ?&#xD;

      All patients will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. diaphragmatic ultrasound : diaphragmatic thickness and excursion will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. theophyllin treatment; 200 mg/d orally for 12 days then reassessment of diaphragm by&#xD;
           ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. weaning trial ; Patients are considered ready for weaning when they meet all the&#xD;
           following criteria: fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt; 0.5, positive end expiratory&#xD;
           pressure (PEEP) â‰¤ 5 cm water , Pa O2/Fi O2&gt; 200, respiratory rate (RR) &lt;30 breaths/min,&#xD;
           alert and cooperative, and hemodynamically stable in the absence of any vasopressor&#xD;
           therapy support.(11)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) will be measured. It's defined as the ratio&#xD;
                between the respiratory rate (breaths/min) and tidal volume (TV) (liters).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial with a T-piece and zero pressure support (before&#xD;
                extubation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. extubation is done &amp; follow up for 48 hours&#xD;
