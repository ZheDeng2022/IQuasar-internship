  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a lower&#xD;
      extremity telerehabilitation protocol with aims to improve lower extremity recovery among&#xD;
      community-living stroke survivors across Canada.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty percent of stroke survivors experience some form of motor impairment, such as loss or&#xD;
      limitation of function in muscle control or movement, or mobility limitation. Regaining&#xD;
      walking ability is a priority for most and is achieved in approximately 80%. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      the occurrence of falling while walking is as high as 73% of all people who recover the&#xD;
      ability to walk post-stroke, with falls often occurring within the first few months of&#xD;
      returning home from rehabilitation. This highlights the challenges with transitioning to the&#xD;
      community for continued post-stroke rehabilitation. Unfortunately, due to increasing demand&#xD;
      on our healthcare and rehabilitation systems and limited service capacity, stroke survivors&#xD;
      receive minimal to no follow-up rehabilitation after returning to community-living. As a&#xD;
      result, it is common for stroke survivors to report unmet lower extremity rehabilitation&#xD;
      needs, and thus ongoing walking/mobility impairment, balance issues, high incidence of falls,&#xD;
      and difficulties participating in desired social roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid growth in the use of the Internet and personal mobile technologies, including&#xD;
      computers, smartphones, and tablets has opened up an array of possibilities through which&#xD;
      patients can remotely access specialized health services, such as telerehabilitation&#xD;
      supports, while in their homes and communities. The use of technologies to facilitate optimal&#xD;
      rehabilitation and recovery after stroke is under-utilized in Canada, despite being highly&#xD;
      recommended in Canadian stroke guidelines, and positive beliefs about its potential among&#xD;
      people with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the feasibility (e.g. safety, recruitment rate, retention rate, fidelity and&#xD;
           adherence, burden) of a lower extremity telerehabilitation protocol among&#xD;
           community-living stroke survivors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the size of effect of TRAIL on clinical outcomes of functional mobility,&#xD;
           lower extremity strength and motor impairment, functional balance, quality of life,&#xD;
           balance self-efficacy, and goal attainment among community-living stroke survivors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that the the telerehabilitation protocol will demonstrate sufficient&#xD;
      feasibility to support a larger, multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that stroke survivors will improve in functional mobility,&#xD;
      lower extremity strength and motor impairment, functional balance, quality of life, balance&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and goal attainment following 4-weeks of telerehabilitation with a trained&#xD;
      therapist&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will use a single group, pre- post- study design trial.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the telerehabilitation program will receive a graded exercise and self-management intervention. This program will be delivered in a ≤2:1 participant:therapist ratio. Each participant grouping will receive two 60-90 minutes telerehabilitation sessions per week for 4 weeks focusing on lower extremity recovery (total 8-12 hours), with a therapist trained in the use of technology for the provision of rehabilitation. Participants will also be asked to complete at least one additional independent self-managed exercise session each week. This independent exercise session will include selected exercises from the telerehabilitation sessions that will be safe to perform without therapist oversight, and jointly agreed upon by the participant and therapist.</description>
