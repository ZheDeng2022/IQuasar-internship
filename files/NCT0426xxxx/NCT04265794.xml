  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal involves a collaboration with the Massachusetts Alliance of Boys and Girls&#xD;
      Clubs. The goal is to evaluate the efficacy of youth empowerment intervention targeting&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverage consumption on childhood obesity among youth. The 12-session 6-week&#xD;
      intervention consists of health and narrative sessions and youth-led activities. For this&#xD;
      cluster randomized controlled trial [RCT} at 10 sites, the investigators will recruit 45&#xD;
      parent-child pairs per site for a total of 450 parent-child pairs. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      child participants' body mass index (BMI) z scores. Secondary outcomes include children's&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverage intake, water intake, and youth empowerment. Change in outcomes over&#xD;
      time among participants in the intervention sites will be compared to change in outcomes over&#xD;
      time among participants&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over one-third of children in the U.S. are overweight or obese and at risk for short-term and&#xD;
      long-term health consequences, including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and certain&#xD;
      types of cancer. Substantial evidence exists on reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB)&#xD;
      consumption as a critical dietary target for childhood obesity prevention. Efficacious&#xD;
      behavioral interventions targeting SSBs are lacking, particularly among low-income and ethnic&#xD;
      minority early and pre-adolescent youth who have higher SSB intake and obesity risk. Youth&#xD;
      empowerment interventions hold potential for catalyzing behavior change in childhood obesity&#xD;
      intervention contexts and may be particularly engaging for low-income and ethnic minority&#xD;
      youth. However, few studies of youth empowerment health interventions have utilized rigorous&#xD;
      study designs or examined empowerment as a mediator/mechanism of change. To this gap, the&#xD;
      research team has worked collaboratively with Boys and Girls Clubs of America (BGCs), a&#xD;
      national system of after-school care that reaches 4 million youth annually, to develop and&#xD;
      pilot-test a community-based youth empowerment intervention on reducing SSB intake and&#xD;
      preventing childhood obesity. Grounded in Empowerment Theory, the intervention targets SSB&#xD;
      consumption through health sessions that empower youth through developing their confidence&#xD;
      and skills; narrative sessions that empower youth through cultivating critical thinking, and&#xD;
      youth-led activities that empower youth through opportunities to produce change within their&#xD;
      families. The resulting H2GO! intervention is designed to be delivered within BGCs by BGC&#xD;
      staff. Building on the successful pilot study of H2GO!, the research team is now positioned&#xD;
      to test the efficacy of the H2GO! intervention in collaboration with the BGC network in MA,&#xD;
      which collectively serves over 160,000 children each year. Using a cluster-randomized design,&#xD;
      a total of 10 BGC sites will be randomly assigned to the H2GO! intervention or a wait-list,&#xD;
      usual care condition. A total of 450 parent-child pairs (N=45 parent-child pairs per site)&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Data will be collected at baseline, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months and&#xD;
      include child anthropometrics, SSB and water intake, and youth empowerment. Specific aims of&#xD;
      the proposal include: 1) test the efficacy of the H2GO! intervention on child BMI z scores&#xD;
      using a cluster randomized controlled trial; 2) test the efficacy of the H2GO! intervention&#xD;
      on child SSB and water intake; 3) examine youth empowerment as a mediator of intervention&#xD;
      effects. Findings from this proposal will provide evidence of youth empowerment as an&#xD;
      approach to reduce SSB intake and obesity risk and contribute to a long-term goal of&#xD;
      producing an intervention model for childhood obesity prevention that is well-positioned for&#xD;
      dissemination through youth-based settings.&#xD;

    <description>Child participants will participate in a 6-week behavioral intervention consisting of 12 group-based weekly sessions (1-hour sessions twice a week) delivered by trained staff in the Boys and Girls Club setting. Each week consisted of a 1-hour health session and a 1-hour narrative session (delivered on separate days). Child participants will also receive reusable water bottles and a pictorial intervention booklet, which includes worksheets and parent-child take-home activities targeting attitudes, knowledge, and skills related to sugar-sweetened beverage and water consumption. Parent participants will be exposed to intervention messages (e.g., reduce SSB intake) through weekly parent-child take-home activities, child sharing of narratives produced, and a culminating open house event.</description>
