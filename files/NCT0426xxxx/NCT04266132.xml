  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional analgesia for inguinal hernia repair in children has attracted increasing interest&#xD;
      and different techniques like Caudal block, lumbar epidural block, wound infiltration,&#xD;
      Ilio-inguinal nerve block and paravertebral block have been used with varying success.&#xD;
      Ilio-inguinal nerve blockade has been widely used in this context but the duration of the&#xD;
      block is also limited to the early postoperative period. Paravertebral blockade has been&#xD;
      shown to produce long lasting postoperative analgesia when used in combination with general&#xD;
      anaesthesia in paediatric herniorrhaphy . Ultrasound-guided retrolaminar block is one of the&#xD;
      newer and technically simpler alternatives to the traditional PV block . The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to test the efficacy and safety of ultrasound guided retrolaminar block(RLB) as an&#xD;
      analgesic technique in surgery of pediatric inguinal hernia in comparison with with&#xD;
      ilioinguinal nerve block(INB). It is hypothesized that RLB block will provide longer duration&#xD;
      of postoperative analgesia than INB with few side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Regional analgesia for inguinal hernia repair in children has attracted increasing interest&#xD;
      over the past few years. Caudal block, lumbar epidural block and wound infiltration using a&#xD;
      variety of local anesthetic drugs and adjuncts have been used with varying success.&#xD;
      Ilio-inguinal nerve blockade has been widely used in this context and despite being generally&#xD;
      safe, complications may occurr. The duration of ilio-inguinal nerve block is also limited to&#xD;
      the early postoperative period. Paravertebral blockade has been shown to produce long lasting&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia when used in combination with general anaesthesia in paediatric&#xD;
      herniorrhaphy, and has also been proposed as an alternative to general anaesthesia in adult&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair. Ultrasound-guided retrolaminar block is one of the newer and&#xD;
      technically simpler alternatives to the traditional PV block. The first case report of a&#xD;
      landmark lamina technique was followed by a study in mastectomy patients where this &quot;blind&quot;&#xD;
      technique was used to inject local anesthetic between the thoracic laminae and the deep&#xD;
      paraspinous muscles. This technique would logically decrease the chances of pleural injury,&#xD;
      while the risk of inadvertent neuraxial injection remains. ultrasound guidance has improved&#xD;
      the lamina technique, defining the site of injection as &quot;retrolaminar&quot; by real-time&#xD;
      sonographic identification of the lamina and the needle tip-lamina contact, thus minimizing&#xD;
      the risk of epidural injection associated with the blind technique. This was immediately&#xD;
      followed by a report by the same group describing their first experiences with the&#xD;
      retrolaminar technique in patients with multiple rib fractures.To our knowledge, no studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of ultrasound guided retro-laminar block in&#xD;
      pediatric patients. Therefore, this study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of retrolaminar block and compare it with the ilioinguinal nerve block in pediatric&#xD;
      patients undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia repair. The study will include 60 patients who&#xD;
      will be scheduled for elective outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated using computer generated random numbers to one of two treatment groups: ultrasound&#xD;
      guided ilio-inguinal nerve block (INB Group, n =30) or ultrasound guided retrolaminar block&#xD;
      (RLB Group, n =30) using the sealed opaque envelope technique. The eligible patients for this&#xD;
      study will be preoperatively evaluated regarding their medical history, clinical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory results (complete blood picture, coagulation profile). The day before the surgery,&#xD;
      the study protocol will be explained to parents of all patients in the study who will be kept&#xD;
      fasting prior to surgery. General anaesthesia will be induced with 8% sevoflurane in oxygen&#xD;
      via a facemask. After establishing venous access, a laryngeal mask will be placed and&#xD;
      anaesthesia was maintained with 1 MAC sevoflurane and oxygen. Intraoperative monitoring&#xD;
      included ECG, heart rate, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure and end tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide concentration.During the operation, any haemodynamic changes in excess of 15% from&#xD;
      baseline values resulted in a step-wise increase or decrease of the sevoflurane&#xD;
      concentration. 0.3 ml.kg of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected at the level of L1 lamina in&#xD;
      RLB group. 0.3 ml.kg of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected between the transversus abdominis&#xD;
      and internal oblique toward the ilioinguinal nerve in INB group. Systolic blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate will be recorded immediately prior to skin incision (baseline), 60 s after skin&#xD;
      incision, during sac traction and on closure of the wound. Pain levels will be assessed post&#xD;
      operatively using FLACC (face, legs, activity, cry, consolability) scale at 30 minutes and at&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 hours by trained nurses and second anesthesist who will be blinded to&#xD;
      group allocation. When the FLACC score is more than 2 and less than or equal to 5, 15 mg/kg&#xD;
      acetaminophen IV will be administered. When the FLACC score is more than 5, 0.5Î¼g/kg fentanyl&#xD;
      IV will be coadministered with acetaminophen in the recovery room. Parents will be informed&#xD;
      about the pain evaluation, and when patients have pain at home, parents will give 7 mg/kg&#xD;
      oral ibuprofen. The anesthesiologist will record data received from the parents over the&#xD;
      phone. Parental satisfaction after surgery will be recorded. Satisfaction levels of the&#xD;
      parents will be given verbally as a level from 1 to 10, with the lowest level of satisfaction&#xD;
      at a value of 1 and the highest level at 10.&#xD;
