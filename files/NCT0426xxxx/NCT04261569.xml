  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease has only pharmacological (essentially dopaminergic) and surgical&#xD;
      treatment (essentially high-frequency deep brain stimulation), that are symptomatically&#xD;
      effective. none of them is curative, and has the ability to slow down the disease and to&#xD;
      protect dopaminergic neurons from death by neurodegeneration. Experimental results, based on&#xD;
      preclinical studies, suggest that brain illumination in the Near-InfraRed (NIR) range is&#xD;
      likely to slow down this neurodegenerative process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a medical device system (called Ev-NIRT) has been developed for 670 nm intracerebral&#xD;
      illumination of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and is planned to be tested for&#xD;
      the treatment of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study the investigators will evaluate the feasibility and tolerance of surgery&#xD;
      and brain illumination thanks to the Ev-NIRT medical device, in a group of 7 de novo&#xD;
      Parkinson's patients implanted with the innovative medical device. Patients will be monitored&#xD;
      for 4 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The level of neuroprotection induced by illumination at 670nm appears effective in&#xD;
      preclinical studies, and justify the transfer into a clinical trial. The investigators&#xD;
      currently have developed and produced implantable devices, to be implanted into the brain&#xD;
      through a minimally invasive endoventricular route. The electrical energy required is&#xD;
      supplied by the batteries adapted from those used for deep brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of trans ventricular implantation is ensured by the experience gained by our&#xD;
      team in the endoventricular stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus in the cluster&#xD;
      headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical study, the investigators will evaluate the tolerance and safety of&#xD;
      intraventricular surgical technic and illumination by the Ev-NIRT medical device implanted&#xD;
      into the brain of 7 patients with Parkinson's disease. idiopathic, aged 25-65 years, at a&#xD;
      very early stage (less than 2 years of evolution). The NIR illumination will begin&#xD;
      immediately after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also evaluate secondarily, the neuroprotective effect of this new&#xD;
      treatment modality, by comparing the decrease of dopaminergic neurons by Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET)-scan using [11C]PE2I) tracer of implanted patients to that of a control&#xD;
      group of 7 patients whose characteristics in terms of duration of evolution and clinical&#xD;
      severity are identical, but who are not implanted, and therefore not exposed to NIR&#xD;
      illumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET-scan-PE2I exam is conducted in both groups annually for 4 years (a total of 5&#xD;
      measurements) and compared to the PE2I PET obtained at the beginning of participation in the&#xD;
      study. A group-wide comparison will be made between the NIR group and the control group.&#xD;
