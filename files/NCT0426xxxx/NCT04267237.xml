      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and&#xD;
      biomarkers of RO7198457 plus atezolizumab compared with atezolizumab alone in patients with&#xD;
      Stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)&#xD;
      positive following surgical resection and have received standard-of-care adjuvant&#xD;
