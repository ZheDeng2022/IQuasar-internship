  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) is a serious health issue that should be managed in order to limit&#xD;
      its adverse health consequences. SAS is known to induce cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and&#xD;
      depression. The prevalence of SAS is still growing with social and economic repercussion.&#xD;
      Today, polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard reference method for SAS diagnosis.&#xD;
      However, it is a constraining and expensive technology. In order to improve patients' life&#xD;
      quality, many new technologies have been developed for the SAS diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the Sunrise®, a new medical integrated solution for SAS&#xD;
      diagnosis, in comparison with PSG. This solution consists in a chin sensor recording&#xD;
      mandibular movements and measuring the respiratory event index (ERI) through an artificial&#xD;
      intelligence algorithm analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sunrise® is a type IIa medical device with the CE label. It is a new home sleep technology,&#xD;
      non-invasive, reliable and affordable by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the device in comparison with&#xD;
      PSG for sleep apnea diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 subjects, suspected to be apneic, will be equipped at home by the chin sensor, the&#xD;
      Sunrise® device, recording their mandibular movements while sleeping. The Sunrise® solution&#xD;
      will provide the respiratory event index (REI) as well as the respiratory micro-arousals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion visit will be executed at the University Hospital Grenoble Alpes. However, PSG and&#xD;
      Sunrise® will be set at the patient's home by IC@dom. The first night, the patient will be&#xD;
      equipped by both PSG and Sunrise® and only by the Sunrise® for the two following nights.&#xD;
