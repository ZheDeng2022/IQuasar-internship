      The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effect of FES on stimulation of the anterior&#xD;
      tibial group by using the WalkAide foot drop stimulator on improving walking and balance&#xD;
      abilities in children with hemiplegic CP.&#xD;

      The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effect of FES on improving walking and balance&#xD;
      abilities in children with hemiplegic CP. Forty children with hemiplegic CP will be assigned&#xD;
      randomly into two groups (A &amp; B). Control group (A) will receive conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
      program for lower limb, balance and gait training. Study group (B) will receive conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation program as in group (A) in addition to FES by using the WalkAide foot drop&#xD;
      stimulator. Patients' evaluation will be carried out before and after training to assess&#xD;
      walking ability and balance performance.&#xD;
