    <textblock>
      In this feasibility study the investigators intend to treat patients with high mutational&#xD;
      uterine cancer with two cycles immune checkpoint inhibition before standard-of-care&#xD;
      hysterectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to establish proof-of-concept for use of immune checkpoint blockade&#xD;
      (ICB) as novel neo-adjuvant therapy in (deficient mismatch repair) dMMR and (Polymerase Îµ&#xD;
      mutation)POLE-EDM uterine cancer (UC). When ICB proves to be feasible as defined in the&#xD;
      primary endpoint, a follow-up with a larger multicenter studies to determine clinical&#xD;
      efficacy, such as postponing standard-of-care surgery or randomized studies to&#xD;
      standard-of-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators planned a window-of-opportunity study of ICB in primary dMMR UC (n=10) and&#xD;
      primary POLE-EDM UC (n=10) patients. ICB (pembrolizumab; anti-PD1) will be administered in&#xD;
      two cycles of 3 weeks between diagnosis and standard-of-care hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor responses to pembrolizumab will be assessed 3 weeks after the second cycle of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab by a pathologist (primary endpoint) and MRI (secondary endpoint).After&#xD;
      treatment with immun checkpoint blockade a hysterectomy will take place (standard-of care).&#xD;
      Peripheral blood and tumor samples will be used to evaluate immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary dMMR/ POLE-EDM UC patients of any stage and/or grade who are intended to be treated&#xD;
      with a hysterectomy recruited from the North-Netherlands oncological region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Pembrolizumab, 200mg IV Q3W for a total of 2 administrations per patient,&#xD;
      integrated into standard-of-care protocol prior to surgery. Based on the well-established&#xD;
      time lines, the interval between diagnosis and standard of care hysterectomy is sufficient to&#xD;
      treat patients with two cycles of pembrolizumab without interfering with standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the response rate of the tumor assessed by pathology in uterine&#xD;
      cancer patients treated with neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab. The secondary endpoint is the&#xD;
      objective response rate of the tumor by MRI using RECIST. Exploratory objectives are&#xD;
      immunogenicity, safety and the value of a pipelle biopsy as a predictor for response.&#xD;
