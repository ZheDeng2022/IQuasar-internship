  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label phase I clinical trial designed to determine the safety&#xD;
      of personalized and adjusted neoantigen peptide vaccine (PANDA-VAC) administered concurrently&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be offered clinical trial participation if per RECIST 1.1 they are determined&#xD;
      to have stable disease, mixed response, oligoprogressive state (defined as disease&#xD;
      progression at a limited number of anatomic sites, with continued response or stable disease&#xD;
      at other sites) or non-threatening progressive disease (defined as progression that fits a&#xD;
      clinical pattern where the treating physician believes that PD-1 therapy post-progression is&#xD;
      appropriate (e.g. multiple sub-centimeter nodules that do not compromise the bronchus)) to an&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. Eligible subjects will initiate or continue pembrolizumab&#xD;
      monotherapy and will have archival tissue and a buccal swab sample (matched normal sample&#xD;
      genomic DNA) collected. Whole exome and single cell sequencing studies will be performed&#xD;
      using the archival tumor and matched normal sample to identify tumor specific mutations and&#xD;
      predict personalized human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding proteins. Based on this&#xD;
      information, 6 neoantigens will be selected for inclusion in the primary personalized&#xD;
      vaccine. The primary therapeutic neoantigen vaccine product (PANDA-VAC) will be comprised of&#xD;
      6 peptides at a dose of 300 micrograms (µg) per peptide admixed with local adjuvant&#xD;
      Poly-ICLC. PANDA-VAC will be administered subcutaneously to six subjects after their first&#xD;
      protocol-mandated disease assessment on pembrolizumab monotherapy. The subjects will receive&#xD;
      five priming doses and two booster vaccinations of PANDA-VAC in combination with continued&#xD;
      pembrolizumab treatment. Enrollment of the first 3 subjects to receive PANDA-VAC will be&#xD;
      staggered by 4 weeks to monitor for acute and subacute adverse events. Subjects with partial&#xD;
      response, stable disease, mixed response, oligoprogressive state or non-threatening&#xD;
      progressive disease (in the opinion of the treating physician) following the full series of&#xD;
      vaccinations may receive adapted vaccine adjusted to address neoantigens emerging during&#xD;
      initial PANDA-VAC and pembrolizumab combination therapy. Subjects will have tissue collected&#xD;
      for DNA and RNA sequencing and prediction of HLA binding proteins, as delineated above for&#xD;
      the initial vaccine production. The therapeutic neoantigen vaccine product will be comprised&#xD;
      of up to 2 additional peptides at a dose of 300 μg per peptide (up to 8 total peptides).&#xD;
      Peptides targeting neoantigens no longer represented in sequencing data may no longer be&#xD;
      included in the neoantigen vaccine product. The primary endpoint of this trial aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of the vaccination administered concurrently with pembrolizumab therapy,&#xD;
      by estimating the unacceptable toxicity rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As generation of either the primary therapeutic or adapted neoantigen vaccine requires: (1)&#xD;
      whole exome sequencing studies of the tumor and a matched normal sample from a buccal swab&#xD;
      pre-treatment; (2) RNA sequencing of the tumor pre-treatment; and (3) whole exome sequencing&#xD;
      of circulating cell-free DNA and DNA derived from circulating tumor cells, information gained&#xD;
      from these analyses will also provide extensive exploratory data. With this data, we will&#xD;
      study relationships of mutational and genes expression profiles with depth of response to&#xD;
      therapy. The purpose of these studies is to generate initial data that will allow us to&#xD;
      estimate effect size and variance of the change in immune features with therapeutic&#xD;
      neoantigen vaccine treatment in order to design prospective correlative studies in future&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;

             dose of pembrolizumab or PANDA-VAC, whichever is longer. Male subjects should agree to&#xD;
             refrain from sperm donation while taking pembrolizumab and/or PANDA-VAC and for at&#xD;
             least 90 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab or PANDA-VAC, whichever is longer.&#xD;
             Should a female partner of a male subject become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in the study, he should inform his treating physician and the&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Subject is willing to consent to a mandatory biopsy that is required for adapted&#xD;
             vaccine generation and correlative studies if the subject has partial response, stable&#xD;
             disease, mixed response, or oligoprogressive state following the full series of five&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Subject must have recovered from all reversible acute toxic effects of the previous&#xD;
             cancer treatment regimen (other than alopecia) to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline.&#xD;
