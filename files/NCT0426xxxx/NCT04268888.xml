  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of nivolumab to TACE/TAE in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma. All patients will receive TACE/TAE and half will&#xD;
      receive nivolumab.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of HCC patients present with, or progress to, intermediate stage&#xD;
      disease and these patients are typically treated with transarterial chemo-embolisation (TACE)&#xD;
      or transarterial embolisation (TAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since TACE/TAE is generally a palliative therapy, it provides a potential backbone&#xD;
      for the addition of effective systemic therapies with the aim of improving survival outcomes.&#xD;
      Since TACE may liberate an abundance of tumour antigens and 'danger' signals, it may lend&#xD;
      itself to combination with immunotherapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody. Nivolumab targets the programmed death-1 PD-1)&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative&#xD;
      regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes.&#xD;
