  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 15-25% of ovarian cancer (OC) patients carry germ-line mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2&#xD;
      genes. Recent evidences showed that OC women with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (gBRCAmut) have&#xD;
      an improved survival and higher platinum-sensitivity compared to BRCA1/2 naive (BRCAwt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, disease appearance in BRCAmut women is more diffuse than in BRCAwt cases, with&#xD;
      significantly higher peritoneal tumour load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, BRCAmut women additionally show a higher benefit of platinum-based neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (NACT) plus interval debulking surgery compared with BRCAwt women in terms of&#xD;
      clinical and pathological responses, suggesting that BRCA mutational status might be used as&#xD;
      a molecular tool to personalize treatment in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OLAPARIB in BRCA mutation carriers Olaparib is a potent oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP) inhibitor that causes synthetic lethality in BRCA1/2-deficient tumour cells. In&#xD;
      patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer, olaparib maintenance&#xD;
      treatment significantly improved the duration of progression-free survival compared with&#xD;
      placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35 [95% CI (confidence interval) 0.25-0.49]; p&lt;0.0001), with the&#xD;
      greatest clinical benefit in patients with BRCA mutations (HR 0.18 [95% CI 0.10-0.31];&#xD;
      p&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data suggest that olaparib might also potentiate the efficacy of DNA-damaging&#xD;
      chemotherapies, including platinum-containing drugs such as carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent phase Ib/II study, olaparib plus weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel in relapsed&#xD;
      ovarian cancer patients was shown to be safe, well tolerated and effective, especially in&#xD;
      germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAmut) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possibly, the addition of a PARP inhibitor (olaparib) to NACT in HGSOC patient with germline&#xD;
      or somatic BRCA1/2 mutation is able to increase the pathological complete response rate to&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy. Combination of intermittent olaparib with weekly carboplatin and&#xD;
      paclitaxel might achieve a higher pathological response rate, with an acceptable toxicity&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
