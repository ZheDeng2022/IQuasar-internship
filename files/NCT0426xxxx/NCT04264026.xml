      This will be a single-site, open-label phase 2 study designed to test the feasibility of&#xD;
      administering MDMA in conjunction with psychotherapy for combat-related treatment-resistant&#xD;
      PTSD in US military veterans currently enrolled in VA. MDMA will be given in conjunction with&#xD;
      structured psychotherapy in three single-dose psychotherapy sessions in a hospital setting&#xD;
      over the course of 12 weeks, along with preparatory and integration psychotherapy sessions&#xD;
      in-between each active-dose session. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      risks, benefits, and feasibility of MDMA used in conjunction with manualized psychotherapy,&#xD;
      on reduction of symptoms, or remission of PTSD, as evaluated by standard clinical measures,&#xD;
      in a VA Healthcare System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for the study is the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5),&#xD;
      a semi-structured interview used in the majority of clinical trials for PTSD, which will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, primary endpoint, and at the long-term 12-month follow-up visit.&#xD;
      Secondary safety and efficacy measures will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned duration of this study is 1-3 years, with each active treatment period lasting&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks, along with a long-term follow-up 12 months after the last active-drug&#xD;
      session.&#xD;

      This will be a single-site, open-label study, investigating the use of MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy for treatment-resistant combat-related PTSD. This study will consent up to 50&#xD;
      current-era combat veterans for study and the first 10 participants who meet criteria will be&#xD;
      eligible to receive study medication. Any patient who drops out before the third Experimental&#xD;
      Session will be replaced. Dropout rates will be recorded. In this protocol, enrollment is&#xD;
      defined as the time the participant signs informed consent. Time from initial&#xD;
      screening/enrollment to collection of the primary endpoint will last approximately 12-18&#xD;
      weeks. To assess durability of treatment, participants will be assessed approximately 12&#xD;
      months after the last MDMA session for the long-term follow-up. The study will consist of a&#xD;
      prescreening/screening/enrollment period, three pre-experimental (preparatory) dose&#xD;
      psychotherapy sessions (spaced approximately one week apart), three experimental dose therapy&#xD;
      sessions, nine integrative follow-up sessions, one assessment of primary endpoint, and a&#xD;
      long-term 12-month follow-up assessment. Psychiatric medication tapering will occur after&#xD;
      eligibility confirmation (after completion of baseline CAPS-5, prior to Experiential&#xD;
      Sessions) to allow for appropriate medication washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy in combat-related treatment resistant PTSD. Effectiveness will be measured by&#xD;
      evaluating the change in CAPS-5 scores from baseline to the primary endpoint. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be collected 2 months after the third Experimental Session with MDMA. To access&#xD;
      long-term effectiveness, CAPS-5 will also be collected at the long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess changes in self-reported PTSD symptoms as measured with the PTSD-symptom&#xD;
           checklist at screening and baseline, during most face-to-face visits, at the primary&#xD;
           endpoint, and during the long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Life Event Checklist (LEC) for PCL-5 will be administered at baseline (screening),&#xD;
           primary endpoint, and long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess depression symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline&#xD;
           (screening), primary endpoint, and long-term 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess changes in alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) will be used to measure&#xD;
                baseline alcohol use over the past year prior to study entry (at screening) and at&#xD;
                long-term follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Alcohol use starting after study screening will be monitored based on participants&#xD;
                self-report. Participants will be directed to keep a Drinking Diary throughout the&#xD;
                study measuring the number of standard alcoholic beverages consumed per day.&#xD;
                Drinking Diary for each participant will be collected weekly until their last&#xD;
                psychotherapy visit. Participants will continue to record weekly alcohol use on&#xD;
                their own until collection at the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess changes in drug consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
           (screening) and at long-term follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess changes in self-reported sleep quality via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&#xD;
           (PSQI) from baseline (screening) to primary endpoint and long-term 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess changes in posttraumatic growth via Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) scores&#xD;
           from baseline (at screening) to primary endpoint and long-term 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Healthcare utilization will also be assessed by retrospective chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve months after the final Experimental Session, the long-term effects of MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy on symptoms of PTSD will be assessed via CAPS-5 and PCL-5 with LEC, alcohol use&#xD;
      via AUDIT, drug use behaviors via DUDIT, depression via BDI-II, self-reported sleep quality&#xD;
      via PSQI, post-traumatic growth via PTGI, suicidality via C-SSRS, and response to research&#xD;
      participation via RRPQ (Reactions to Research Participation Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be assessed for suicidality at every face-to-face visit.&#xD;

    <description>CAPS-5 is the gold standard measurement tool for evaluating PTSD in current FDA-approved medication trials for PTSD. The CAPS-5 is a standardized method to evaluate the frequency and intensity dimensions of each PTSD symptom, impact on functioning, overall severity of the symptom complex, and a dichotomous outcome based on DSM-5 criteria on whether the participant meets diagnostic criteria for PTSD. CAPS-5 scores will be measured at baseline, 2 months after the last drug session, and at the long-term 12-month follow-up.</description>

             directly with their therapist. Subjects may not change therapists, increase the&#xD;
