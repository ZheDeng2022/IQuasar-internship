  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco smoking is a major health problem, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      due to cancer, impaired pulmonary function, and cardiovascular diseases. Chronic nicotine&#xD;
      consumption related to smoking may affect pulmonary function and can cause neuronal&#xD;
      alterations leading to increased emotional distress and decreased cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      especially when the smoker attempts to quit. These may explain the huge difficulty in&#xD;
      quitting and the dependence on cigarettes as a means of maintaining emotional balance. The&#xD;
      possibility that reduced sleep quality is a major negative outcome that contributes to&#xD;
      nicotine addiction has been largely overlooked. Several studies have shown that smoking and&#xD;
      smoking cessation disrupt sleep quality; however, the vast majority of these studies were&#xD;
      based on subjective reports. Moreover, it is not clear to what degree disrupted sleep quality&#xD;
      among smokers may be related to reduced pulmonary function, and to what degree reduced sleep&#xD;
      quality contributes to the emotional cognitive distress of active and abstinent smokers and&#xD;
      to their urge to smoke. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that smoking and early phases&#xD;
      of smoking cessation will be associated with reduced sleep quality. This poor sleep quality&#xD;
      will be associated with emotional and cognitive symptoms and difficulty in abstaining from&#xD;
      tobacco smoking. Successful abstinence from smoking over time will lead to normalization of&#xD;
      the quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiments to investigate this hypothesis will be conducted on healthy young adults&#xD;
      addressing the following specific aims: 1) To examine physiological and psychological factors&#xD;
      predicting reduced quality of sleep among smokers, including: poor pulmonary function, the&#xD;
      degree of nicotine dependence, altered regulation of stress systems (HPA axis and the&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system), and emotional distress (anxiety and depression); 2) To explore&#xD;
      the impact of smoking cessation on sleep quality and related symptoms. Specifically, whether&#xD;
      smoking cessation induces fragmented sleep and poor sleep quality, and whether the diminished&#xD;
      sleep quality can predict the magnitude of emotional and cognitive symptoms; 3) To examine&#xD;
      whether poor sleep (before and during abstinence) can predict the level of the urge to smoke&#xD;
      and smoking relapse among abstinent smokers; 4) To explore whether sleep quality ultimately&#xD;
      improves following prolonged abstinence from smoking. Addressing these aims, nonsmokers and&#xD;
      smokers will be examined before and during smoking abstinence on the following measures:&#xD;
      quality of sleep via actigraphy and polysomnography (PSG), pulmonary function test,&#xD;
      biological markers of stress (cortisol and α-amylase) and smoking (i.e., cotinine, the main&#xD;
      metabolite of nicotine), and emotional and cognitive functioning via psychometric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study will provide novel insight on the role of sleep in nicotine addiction.&#xD;
      Experiments will show how reduced quality of sleep may result from chronic smoking and&#xD;
      interfere with attempts to quit smoking. Also, the experiment will shed light on the&#xD;
      interrelated physiological and psychological mechanisms that mediate the interplay between&#xD;
      smoking addiction and sleep. The research will utilize a variety of powerful methods and an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary collaboration of experts in the fields of sleep, addiction, and pulmonary&#xD;
      medicine. It is anticipated that the results will contribute substantially to our knowledge&#xD;
      of smoking addiction and may promote the development of effective therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      to this major public health problem.&#xD;

      Scientific background Tobacco smoking is a major health problem, leading to considerable&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality due to cancer, pulmonary illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      (Taghizadeh, Vonk &amp; Boezen, 2016). The main psychoactive and addictive substance in tobacco&#xD;
      is nicotine (Zaparoli &amp; Galduroz, 2012). Nicotine addiction is a complex phenomenon that&#xD;
      involves both physical and psychological dependence (Cohrs et al., 2014), which causes not&#xD;
      only difficulty in quitting but also a strong tendency to return to smoking after having quit&#xD;
      for a long time) Zaniewska, Przegalinski &amp; Fillip, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common theoretical model of addiction (Koob &amp; Volkow, 2016) holds that the transition from&#xD;
      occasional smoking to addiction involves an upregulation of neurobiological stress systems.&#xD;
      Consequently, even a brief period of abstinence from smoking, leading to reduced&#xD;
      concentration of nicotine in the body, induces both emotional withdrawal symptoms (anxiety,&#xD;
      restlessness, irritability, anhedonia) and cognitive withdrawal symptoms (diminished memory&#xD;
      and attention) that may in turn produce a compulsive urge to smoke again, in order to ease&#xD;
      the unpleasant sensations (Koob &amp; Volkow, 2016). Although some studies suggest reduced&#xD;
      quality of sleep is also among the consequences of smoking and smoking cessation (Cohrs et&#xD;
      al., 2014; Colrain, Trinder &amp; Swan, 2004) this issue was not fully explored, and the&#xD;
      contribution of the reduced quality of sleep to negative emotional situations and to the&#xD;
      motivation to smoke is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking and sleep. Smokers report more sleep disturbances such as insomnia (i.e., a variety&#xD;
      of complaints reflecting dissatisfaction with the ability to initiate and maintain sleep,&#xD;
      along with a significant reduction in total sleep time followed by daytime sleepiness)&#xD;
      (Kaneita et al., 2005; Phillips &amp; Danner, 1995), and a correlation was found between the&#xD;
      level of addiction to cigarettes and reduced quality of sleep (Palmer, Harrison &amp; Hiorns,&#xD;
      1980; Patten et al., 2000). A deleterious effect of smoking on the quality of sleep could&#xD;
      partially result from disturbed pulmonary function (Simon-Tuval et al., 2011). Indeed, heavy&#xD;
      smokers are at high risk for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (Tarasiuk et al.,&#xD;
      2006), which causes disturbed sleep leading to reduced quality of life (Scharf et al., 2011;&#xD;
      Won &amp; Kryger, 2014). Moreover, even in young, seemingly healthy, moderate smokers there is a&#xD;
      clear reduction in pulmonary function, and a negative correlation was found in healthy adults&#xD;
      between pulmonary functioning and sleep quality (Phillips et al., 1989). However, this factor&#xD;
      could not solely explain the relationship between smoking and quality of sleep, as studies&#xD;
      have shown an increased number of awakenings in the course of the night during early phases&#xD;
      of smoking cessation (Hatsukami, Hughes &amp; Pickens, 1985; Hatsukami et al., 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reliability of subjective sleep measures is not unequivocal and needs support from&#xD;
      objective measurements (Pillar, Malhotra &amp; Lavie, 2000). To date, only a handful of studies&#xD;
      compared the sleep architecture of active and quitting smokers to that of nonsmokers using&#xD;
      polysomnographic (PSG) tests (consisting of brain wave, muscle tension, eye movement, and&#xD;
      other measurements). These studies confirmed the deleterious effects of smoking and smoking&#xD;
      cessation on the quality of sleep. Zhang and colleagues (2006) found that compared to&#xD;
      nonsmokers, the sleep of smokers was characterized by shorter duration, longer time to reach&#xD;
      (rapid eye movement) REM sleep, longer time spent in light sleep (stage 1), less time spent&#xD;
      in deep sleep (stages 3 and 4, slow-wave sleep-SWS), and lower sleep efficiency (percentage&#xD;
      of actual sleep time of the total time spent in bed). Similarly, sleep duration among smokers&#xD;
      was shorter than among nonsmokers (Jaehne et al., 2012). Likewise, PSG tests conducted on&#xD;
      individuals undertaking smoking cessation demonstrated increases in the number of awakenings&#xD;
      at night (Prosise et al., 1994), shortening of REM latency, shortening of SWS sleep duration,&#xD;
      and extension of the phases of light sleep (stages 1 and 2) (Moreno-Coutiño,&#xD;
      Calderón-Ezquerro &amp; Drucker-Colín, 2007; Wetter et al., 2000), all indications of reduced&#xD;
      quality of sleep. Yet, these PSG studies also had limitations as they were usually conducted&#xD;
      on a small number of patients on a single night, under the artificial conditions of sleep&#xD;
      laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of sleep, stress, and addiction to smoking. It is well accepted that sleep plays a&#xD;
      vital role in health as well as behavioral and emotional stability (Scharf et al., 2010;&#xD;
      Tarasiuk et al., 2005). Those who suffer from poor sleep quality exhibit higher rates of&#xD;
      psychological stress, depression, and various anxiety symptoms than the general population&#xD;
      (Fernández-Mendoza et al., 2009; Ohayon, 2005). The tendency toward poor sleep quality among&#xD;
      smokers and quitters, and the correlation between proper sleep and behavioral and emotional&#xD;
      stability raise the hypothesis that the impairment in sleep quality among smokers and&#xD;
      quitters affects their psychological functioning and their smoking behavior. The few studies&#xD;
      that investigated this issue demonstrated that abstaining from cigarette smoking for 48 hours&#xD;
      increased the subsequent rate of smoking (Hamidovic&amp; de Wit, 2009), and that sleep&#xD;
      disruptions during withdrawal have a negative effect on the success of smoking cessation&#xD;
      (Jaehne et al., 2009; Persico, 1992). These findings seem to integrate well into the&#xD;
      aforementioned theoretical model, which holds that exposure to nicotine leads to the&#xD;
      development of aversive psychological symptoms when the bodily nicotine concentration drops,&#xD;
      which leads to a compulsive urge to smoke to alleviate these unpleasant sensations (Cohen &amp;&#xD;
      George, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of findings suggest that these aversive psychological symptoms are due to an&#xD;
      increase in the activity of neurobiological systems that regulate stress responses (Cohen &amp;&#xD;
      George, 2013). Stress responses are regulated by two key neuroendocrinological systems: the&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system and the HPA (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical) axis. The&#xD;
      sympathetic system is responsible for increasing the level of arousal in situations of danger&#xD;
      and acute stress. It involves mainly the secretion of adrenaline by the adrenal gland.&#xD;
      Studies indicate that level of the α-amylase enzyme in the saliva is an indirect but reliable&#xD;
      measure of sympathetic activity (Rohleder et al., 1994). It has been demonstrated that the&#xD;
      α-amylase levels before and after smoking cessation predicted the measure of success in&#xD;
      persisting with abstinence from smoking over time (Duskova et al., 2010). The HPA system&#xD;
      regulates physiological reactions related to coping with ongoing stressors. Specifically, it&#xD;
      induces secretion of the Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (CRH) from the paraventricular&#xD;
      nucleus, located in the hypothalamus, to the anterior pituitary gland, which in response&#xD;
      secretes the AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone (ACTH) that stimulates the release of cortisol by&#xD;
      the adrenal gland (Ma et al., 2011). Cortisol levels in the body generally rise sharply in&#xD;
      response to stressors, but in people who are in chronic stress situations, regulation of the&#xD;
      HPA system may be disrupted, which is manifested by reduced secretion of cortisol both in the&#xD;
      basal situation and in response to stress (Miller, Chen &amp; Zhou, 2007). This sub-regulation&#xD;
      may reflect difficulty in coping with stress (Miller, Chen &amp; Zhou, 2007): low levels of&#xD;
      cortisol are associated with an increased level of depression (Moraes et al., 2016),&#xD;
      aggression (Granger, 1998), and impulsiveness (Blomqvist et al., 2007). Note that while acute&#xD;
      exposure to nicotine increases levels of cortisol temporarily (Newhouse et al., 1990;&#xD;
      Winternitz &amp; Quillen, 1977), secretion of cortisol in chronic smokers in response to stress&#xD;
      is reduced relative to that of nonsmokers (Kirschbaum, Strasburger &amp; Langkrär, 1993; Rohleder&#xD;
      &amp; Kirschbaum, 2006). Moreover, studies indicate a decrease in cortisol levels during smoking&#xD;
      cessation (Steptoe &amp; Ussher, 2006; Targovnik,1989), which correlates with the intensity of&#xD;
      the somatic and emotional withdrawal symptoms and with the level of the urge to smoke (Cohen,&#xD;
      al'Absi &amp; Collins, 2004; Targovnik,1989); it also correlates with the level of success in&#xD;
      persisting with smoking cessation over time (al'Absi et al.,2004; Frederick et al., 1998).&#xD;
      This may be due to the development of sub-regulation by the HPA system, similarly to the&#xD;
      situation of those suffering from chronic stress (Richardson et al., 2008), which in turn&#xD;
      leads to the sensitization of the mechanisms of stress in the brain, such as increasing the&#xD;
      activity of CRH in the limbic system (Vendruscolo et al., 2012). The literature partially&#xD;
      supports the possibility that an increase in the activity of neurobiological stress&#xD;
      mechanisms (due to chronic exposure to nicotine) contributes to disruption of the quality of&#xD;
      sleep. For example, increased sympathetic activity during the day, as reflected in high&#xD;
      levels of α-amylase, is highly correlated with insomnia (Nater et al., 2007). However,&#xD;
      various studies that have examined the relationship between different measures of cortisol&#xD;
      secretion throughout the day and night, and various indices of sleep, produced conflicting&#xD;
      results (Elder et al., 2014). Recent studies indicate that cortisol is produced at a higher&#xD;
      rate during REM sleep; therefore, prolonged sleep, which includes longer REM sleep, produces&#xD;
      higher cortisol levels (Van Lenten &amp; Doane, 2016). Note that whereas an increase in the&#xD;
      levels of stress may disrupt sleep, poor sleep quality may in itself cause stress&#xD;
      (Fernández-Mendoza et al., 2009; Ohayon, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, several studies suggest that smoking and, even more so smoking cessation, disrupt&#xD;
      sleep, and that the reduced quality of sleep may contribute to the motivation to smoke and&#xD;
      reduce the prospects for quitting. However, the number of these studies is relatively small,&#xD;
      and many of them are based on subjective reports, whose reliability is not unequivocal. The&#xD;
      minority of studies that used objective measurements usually tested a small number of&#xD;
      participants, under the artificial conditions of the sleep laboratory. Notably, the quality&#xD;
      of sleep can be measured objectively and reliably for extended periods of time in the&#xD;
      participants' natural environment using an actigraph device that is worn on the wrist and&#xD;
      analyzes movement (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2015; Sadeh et al., 1989). However, actigraphy has&#xD;
      not been used thus far for assessing the sleep quality of smokers. Moreover, to date there&#xD;
      has been no systematic study of the complex relations between sleep, pulmonary function,&#xD;
      stress systems functioning, and smoking as they relate to the development and persistence of&#xD;
      tobacco smoking addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that chronic tobacco smoking impairs sleep quality, which in turn enhances the&#xD;
      activity of stress mechanisms, and thus induces negative emotional states. The processes that&#xD;
      harm sleep quality and the processes that increase responsiveness to stress and negative&#xD;
      emotional symptoms thus reciprocally nourish each other and ultimately increase the urge to&#xD;
      smoke as a means for stress relief. Our preliminary findings support this hypothesis by&#xD;
      demonstrating that active smokers suffer from diminished quality of sleep (assessed by&#xD;
      actigraphy and questionnaires), compared to nonsmokers, an effect that was correlated with&#xD;
      markers of stress activation, namely levels of cortisol and α-amylase in the participants'&#xD;
      saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives and expected significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research will explore the role of sleep disturbances in tobacco smoking addiction. Based&#xD;
      on our preliminary findings and the available literature, the main hypothesis of this&#xD;
      proposal is that smoking, and to a greater degree early phases of smoking cessation, will be&#xD;
      associated with reduced quality of sleep. The reduced quality of sleep will, in turn, predict&#xD;
      the severity of negative symptoms and the extent of difficulty in abstaining from smoking.&#xD;
      Successful abstinence from smoking will lead to normalization of sleep. Experiments to&#xD;
      investigate this hypothesis will address the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine physiological and psychological factors predicting reduced quality of sleep&#xD;
           among smokers. The goal is to explore the deleterious effects of smoking on sleep&#xD;
           quality and to explore whether the reduced sleep quality is predicted by the following&#xD;
           factors: poor pulmonary function (FEV1, FEF), degree of nicotine dependence, emotional&#xD;
           symptoms (anxiety and depression), and altered regulation of stress systems (HPA axis&#xD;
           and the sympathetic nervous system). We expect that, compared to nonsmokers, smokers&#xD;
           will exhibit poorer sleep quality. The level of disruption to the quality of sleep will&#xD;
           be related to the intensity of nicotine dependence, poor pulmonary functioning, the&#xD;
           levels of negative emotionality, sympathetic activation, and deregulation of HPA axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the impact of smoking cessation on sleep quality and related symptoms. We&#xD;
           will examine whether smokers who try to quit experience a worsening sleep quality, and&#xD;
           whether this poor sleep quality can predict the magnitude of their stress response&#xD;
           (level of cortisol and α-amylase) and the severity of emotional and cognitive symptoms&#xD;
           as measured by the psychometric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the role of sleep quality on smoking motivation and relapse to smoking.&#xD;
           Experiments will determine whether sleep can predict the urge to smoke (in current&#xD;
           smokers) and the likelihood of abstinent smokers to relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore whether prolonged abstinence from nicotine improves sleep quality. The aim&#xD;
           here is to examine whether smoking cessation ultimately induces normalization of sleep&#xD;
           and related factors, including pulmonary functioning, stress response (level of cortisol&#xD;
           and α-amylase), and emotional and cognitive functioning. Smoking abstinence will be&#xD;
           verified by measurement of cotinine in the participant's saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Significance. Experiments will show how reduced quality of sleep may result from&#xD;
      chronic smoking and interfere with attempts to quit smoking. This study will shed light on&#xD;
      the interrelated physiological and psychological mechanisms that mediate the interplay&#xD;
      between smoking addiction and sleep, including psychological distress, dysfunctional stress&#xD;
      mechanisms, and reduced pulmonary functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will utilize a variety of powerful methods and an interdisciplinary&#xD;
      collaboration of experts in the fields of sleep, addiction, and respiratory medicine to&#xD;
      explore the interplay of sleep and tobacco smoking. Results of this study will provide novel&#xD;
      insight on the role of sleep in nicotine addiction. Findings of the proposed research are&#xD;
      expected to promote the use of sleep quality enhancement techniques in smoking cessation&#xD;
      interventions. Methodology Participants. Participating in the study will be 150 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, men and women, aged 18-30, with no history of mental illness or drug abuse. The&#xD;
      number of participants was established by power analysis, based on our preliminary results,&#xD;
      with addition of 20% to compensate for possible drop-outs during the study. Fifty&#xD;
      participants will be nonsmokers, and the rest regular smokers . Half of the smokers will be&#xD;
      with a stated interest in quitting and half with no such interest (non-quitting control).&#xD;
      Participants will receive a compensation fee of 400 NIS (roughly 100 US dollars). All&#xD;
      procedures used in this study have been approved by Yezreel Valley College (YVC)&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedure. Participants will be recruited from the student body of the college and,&#xD;
      via advertisement, from the surrounding communities. All study sessions will start between&#xD;
      7:00 AM and 9:00 AM (up to 30 minutes following awakening) either at the YVC Psychobiology&#xD;
      Laboratory or in the participant's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 3 groups (N=50): smokers attempting to quit (smoking cessation group,&#xD;
      SCG), nonsmokers group (NSG), and a group of smokers not attempting to quit (SNCG). The&#xD;
      latter group is needed in order to assure that changes in certain measures following smoking&#xD;
      cessation are not due to time-related events that are not related to abstinence from tobacco.&#xD;
      The study design includes 4 stages: A) Baseline. B) First week of nicotine cessation. C +D)&#xD;
      Follow up tests three months and six months following the initiation of smoking cessation.&#xD;
      Note that although the 2 control groups (i.e., the nonsmokers group (NSG) and the group of&#xD;
      smokers not attempting to quit (SNCG)) will not undergo smoking cessation, they will be&#xD;
      evaluated with the same tests and at the same time points as the smoking cessation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Phase: At the first session, all the participants will be asked to sign a consent&#xD;
      form and provide background information. After assessing their smoking status by checking the&#xD;
      level of carbon monoxide (CO) in their breath, they will be asked to give a saliva sample (to&#xD;
      test the levels of cortisol and α-amylase) by spitting into a test tube (1.5 mL minimum). To&#xD;
      further validate the participants' smoking status, the saliva samples will also be used to&#xD;
      detect the levels of cotinine, the primary metabolite of nicotine. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a broad spectrum of questionnaires, evaluating their level of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, quality of sleep, and smoking dependence (questionnaires are described in detail&#xD;
      below), as well as completing the Cognitive Assessment Battery (CAB), a computerized&#xD;
      neurocognitive test designed to assess a large range of cognitive skills related to executive&#xD;
      functions. In addition, their pulmonary functioning will be assessed via spirometry. Finally,&#xD;
      participants' sleep will be continuously monitored over a 1-week period by a miniature&#xD;
      wrist-worn actigraph, and will be recorded during the last two nights of this week by PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking cessation phase: At the end of the baseline week, participants of the smoking&#xD;
      cessation study group will begin abstaining from smoking, while participants on the 2 control&#xD;
      groups (i.e., the nonsmokers group (NSG) and the group of smokers not attempting to quit&#xD;
      (SNCG) will carry on with their regular routine. In the morning of the first day of smoking&#xD;
      cessation, all participants will provide saliva samples and complete the same set of&#xD;
      questionnaires as in the baseline phase. All participants will then be asked to wear the&#xD;
      actigraphy device during the second week as well, and to return to the lab for additional&#xD;
      sessions after 48 hours, 72 hours, 5 days, and one week (altogether four times). At each of&#xD;
      these sessions, the smoking status of the participants will be assessed by means of the&#xD;
      exhalation test, and participants will again be asked to provide a saliva sample, and&#xD;
      complete the same set of questionnaires. On the last two nights of this week, participants'&#xD;
      sleep will also be recorded by PSG. On the morning of day 7 of abstinence, all participants&#xD;
      will also complete (again) the CAB neurocognitive test. Follow up phase: Will be conducted on&#xD;
      all participants three months and six months into the smoking cessation process of the&#xD;
      smoking abstinence group. At each of these time points, all participants will be summoned for&#xD;
      an additional data collection session in which it will be determined who of the smoking&#xD;
      abstinence participants relapsed back to smoking. In addition, all participants will again be&#xD;
      asked to complete the set of questionnaires and the CAB neurocognitive test. The pulmonary&#xD;
      functioning of the participants will again be measured by spirometry and they will be asked&#xD;
      to wear the actigraph device for one week. In addition, their sleep will be recorded for two&#xD;
