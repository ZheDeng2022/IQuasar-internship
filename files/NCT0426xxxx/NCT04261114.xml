  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to explore what it is about the experience of chronic pain that may cause&#xD;
      emotional distress in some young people but not in others, and how particular individual&#xD;
      characteristics, as well as family factors may contribute to young persons' pain experiences&#xD;
      and their emotional responses to pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-part observational follow-up study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part one will explore (a) whether the current sample reports emotional distress, including&#xD;
      feelings of burdensomeness, hopelessness and thoughts and acts of self-harm, and if young&#xD;
      people perceive there to be a link between pain and any such feelings of distress, and (b)&#xD;
      which aspects of the pain experience, if any, are associated with such distress, using&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part two will explore potential individual-level and family-level risk and resilience factors&#xD;
      underpinning the hypothesised relationship between aspects of the pain experience and&#xD;
      burdensomeness, hopelessness and thoughts and acts of self-harm, using adolescent and&#xD;
      parental baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part three, adolescent participants will be invited to complete daily diaries on their&#xD;
      pain experience, three times per day over 7 days, in order to investigate which aspects of&#xD;
      the pain experience are associated with burdensomeness and hopelessness at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the potential to improve the care of young people with chronic pain, and in&#xD;
      particular the emotional support that young people receive.&#xD;
