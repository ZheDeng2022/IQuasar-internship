  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to effectively use a client-centered community-based intervention&#xD;
      to engage people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in healthcare that helps reduce risky behaviors and&#xD;
      lower infectious disease risks. Participants in the intervention group of this study will&#xD;
      undergo a 12-week intensive multilevel harm reduction case-management intervention at three&#xD;
      rural Vivent Health offices geared towards reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), and overdose risks in PWIDs. Prevention Navigators (PNs) at each&#xD;
      office will help coordinate referrals to reduce substance use disorder and increase&#xD;
      engagement in the substance use disorder care cascades. PNs will also engage participants in&#xD;
      HIV, HCV, and sexually transmitted infections(STIs) care cascades.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will be conducted by an experienced, interdisciplinary team working across&#xD;
      academic, public health, and non-government sectors. The main community partner Vivent&#xD;
      Health, formerly known as the AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin (ARCW), is a unique,&#xD;
      state-wide organization that provides harm reduction services, including syringe services and&#xD;
      confidential HIV and HCV testing, to clients at 10 fixed sites and numerous mobile units&#xD;
      reaching all 72 Wisconsin counties. Based on investigator's preliminary studies and prior&#xD;
      collaborations, investigator has selected 6 counties in rural Wisconsin, three of which&#xD;
      investigator will deploy and evaluate the Client-Centered Prevention Home intervention model&#xD;
      at Vivent Health field offices located within these service areas. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention will undergo a 12-week intensive multilevel harm reduction case-management&#xD;
      intervention geared towards coordinating referrals to reduce substance use disorder and&#xD;
      increase engagement in the substance use disorder care cascades, and reduce vulnerability to&#xD;
      HIV, STIs, and HCV and increase in engagement in the HIV, STI, and HCV care cascades.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention arm will work with Prevention Navigators to undergo a risk&#xD;
      assessment and identify problems and create goals that they want to achieve. Each session&#xD;
      after that will be used to review the needs assessment and goals. During their last meeting,&#xD;
      participants and prevention navigators will develop a discharge plan that will enable the&#xD;
      participants to work on their goals on their own. Participants at all six sites will undergo&#xD;
      rapid testing for HIV, HCV, and STIs, and fill out survey questionnaires to evaluate risk&#xD;
      behaviors, intervention effectiveness, and general needs of the communities. There are three&#xD;
      groups in this study which consist of intervention, delayed intervention (3 month wait-list&#xD;
      period before intervention begins), and a nonintervention control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per the protocol amendment approved on 9/3/2021, no additional participants will be recruited&#xD;
      into the delayed intervention arm and therefore the anticipated enrollment has change to 405.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be enrolled using a parallel crossover and cross-site study design. At three sites, participants will be enrolled in immediate intervention, or a 3 month wait list intervention, serving as a control for three months before engaging in the intervention.

    <measure>Change in the addiction treatment accessibility and utilization as assessed by change in Likert scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Following questions will be asked on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1=strongly disagree and 5=strongly agree:&#xD;
If I wanted to start a medical treatment for opioid or heroine addiction, I could easily get into a methadone program&#xD;
If I wanted to start medical treatment for opioid or heroin addiction, I could easily get buprenorphine or Suboxone or Subutex.&#xD;
An increase in the Likert scale among intervention participants is associated with increased access to addiction treatment programs compared to the controls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the addiction treatment accessibility and utilization as assessed by change in frequency of &quot;Yes&quot; answers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Following questions will be asked with yes or no answers.&#xD;
In the last 3 months, have you gone to a self-help group like Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, Celebrate Recovery, or Rational Recovery?&#xD;
In the past 3 months, have you received outpatient counseling from a provider or program?&#xD;
In the past 3 months, have you stayed overnight at a residential or inpatient drug treatment facility?&#xD;
In the past 3 months, have you been in detox?&#xD;
In the past 3 months, have you stayed overnight at a sober house?&#xD;
In the past 3 months, have you gotten buprenorphine maintenance medication-like Suboxone or Subutex-from a doctor or program?&#xD;
In the past 3 months, have you gotten methadone maintenance from a clinic?&#xD;
In the past 3 months, have you gotten buprenorphine shots - like Sublocade - from a doctor or program?&#xD;
Among the intervention group, an increase number of &quot;yes&quot; answers over time will show an improvement in this outcome, compared to the control group.</description>
