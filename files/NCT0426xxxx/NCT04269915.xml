&#xD;
          -  Subject is able to communicate well with the investigator, is available to attend all&#xD;
             study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject will remain within Europe (excluding Corsica) during the study period and is&#xD;
             reachable by mobile telephone from week 3 to week 8 of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to refrain from blood donation to &quot;Sanquin&quot; (blood bank) or for other&#xD;
             purposes throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female subjects: subject agrees to use adequate contraception and not to&#xD;
             breastfeed for the duration of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history, or evidence at screening, of clinically significant symptoms, physical&#xD;
             signs or abnormal laboratory values suggestive of systemic conditions, such as&#xD;
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neurological, dermatological, endocrine,&#xD;
             malignant, haematological, infectious, immune-deficient, psychiatric and other&#xD;
             disorders, which could compromise the health of the volunteer during the study or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results. These include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to, any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  body weight &lt;50 kg or Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;18.0 or &gt;30.0 kg/m2 at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis&#xD;
                  C virus (HCV) screening tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  the use of immune modifying drugs within three months prior to study onset&#xD;
                  (inhaled and topical corticosteroids and oral anti-histamines exempted) or&#xD;
                  expected use of such during the study period;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell&#xD;
                  carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any history of treatment for severe psychiatric disease by a psychiatrist in the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  history of drug or alcohol abuse interfering with normal social function in the&#xD;
                  period of one year prior to study onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The chronic use of any drug known to interact with praziquantel, artesunate or&#xD;
                  lumefantrine metabolism (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidon,&#xD;
                  dexamethasone, rifampicin, cimetidine, flecainide, metoprolol, imipramine,&#xD;
                  amitriptyline, clomipramine, class I-A and III anti-arrythmics, antipsychotics,&#xD;
                  antidepressants, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole- and triazole&#xD;
                  antimycotics, antihistamines) Because lumefantrine may cause extension of&#xD;
                  QT-time, chronic use of drugs with effect on QT interval are excluded from the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female subjects: positive urine pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of schistosomiasis or treatment for schistosomiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serology for schistosomiasis or elevated serum CAA at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to or contra-indications (including co-medication) for use of&#xD;
             praziquantel, artesunate or lumefantrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Being an employee or student of the department of parasitology or infectious diseases&#xD;
             of the Leiden University Medical Center.&#xD;
