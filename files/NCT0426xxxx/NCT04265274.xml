      This is a proof-of-concept study to define efficacy of vinorelbine, cisplatin, disulfiram and&#xD;
      copper in CTC_EMT positive refractory metastatic hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in breast cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy, 5-10% of patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer have metastatic disease at initial presentation, and approximately 30% of&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer develop metastatic disease during the course of disease.&#xD;
      Metastatic cascade is a multistep process that enables the migration of tumor cells from the&#xD;
      primary site to a distant location, where they can potentially establish a new cancer growth.&#xD;
      To execute the metastatic cascade, epithelial cancer cells must detach from the primary&#xD;
      tumor, pass through the peripheral circulation, extravasate at the distant site and create a&#xD;
      new tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental and clinical data suggest a close relationship between activation of EMT program&#xD;
      and generation of CTCs. EMT is associated with a set of molecular changes in epithelial&#xD;
      cancer cells that results in increased motility and the induction of proteases that are&#xD;
      involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix facilitating thus invasion and&#xD;
      intravasation into the bloodstream. EMT has also been linked to the stem cell phenotype and&#xD;
      resistance to apoptotic signals, facilitating EMT-derived CTCs to survive in foreign&#xD;
      environments. Cancer stem cell phenotype is closely related to ALDH expression. Several&#xD;
      studies showed that CTCs with EMT phenotype is associated with inferior outcome in primary as&#xD;
      well as in metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a biomarker study in primary breast cancer, CTC_EMT were detected in 77 (18.0%) of&#xD;
      patients. Patients without detectable CTC_EMT in the peripheral blood had significantly&#xD;
      superior DFS compared to patients with detectable CTC_EMT (HR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.22 - 0.78, p =&#xD;
      0.0003). Prognostic value of CTC_EMT was demonstrated in all subgroups of patients, most&#xD;
      pronounced in hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative subgroup. In multivariate analysis,&#xD;
      presence of CTC_EMT, axillary nodal involvement and hormone receptor status were&#xD;
      independently associated with DFS. Presence of CTC_EMT could lead to better identification of&#xD;
      patients with increased risk of recurrence, especially in hormone receptor positive, HER-2&#xD;
      negative primary breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disulfiram (DSF) in combination with copper (Cu) has been reported to override drug&#xD;
      resistance in cancer cells, and DSF combined with chemotherapy based on the microtubule&#xD;
      inhibitor vinorelbine appears to prolong survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on aforementioned data, it is suggested that there is strong rationale to inhibit ALDH&#xD;
      in MBC. Inactivation of ALDH by disulfiram/copper will be lead to increase of objective&#xD;
      response rate in patients with refractory MBC.&#xD;

             taxane (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel) in any combination or order. Treatment with any&#xD;
             of these agents is not required if they are contraindicated for a certain patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or two of these regimens may have been administered as adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant&#xD;
             therapy, but at least 2 must have been given for relapsed or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have proved refractory to the most recent chemotherapy, documented by&#xD;
             progression on or within six (6) months of therapy.&#xD;

             metastases) or &gt; 5 x ULN (in presence of liver metastases) AND patient is known to&#xD;
             have bone metastases, the liver specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from&#xD;
