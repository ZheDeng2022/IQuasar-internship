      This study will be conducted on a group of patients undergoing repeat elective caesarean&#xD;
      delivery attending at Mansoura university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This study will investigate patients' attending to the antenatal care clinic for elective&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy with history of previous one caesarean delivery in the period&#xD;
      between (January 2020 till January 2021).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be a group of patients with past history of previous one&#xD;
      caesarean delivery and attending for elective termination of the current pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients data will be collected and analysed as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal data: Age, residency, job, special habits, BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past obstetric history:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gravidity, parity, full term normal delivery, full term assisted vaginal deliveries, preterm,&#xD;
      stillbirth, abortion, previous pregnancy complication and complication during puerperium •&#xD;
      Previous delivery: Indication, duration, place of delivery, results of delivery, complication&#xD;
      during labour, complication during puerperium&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past medical, surgical or gynaecological history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy by assisted reproductive techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current pregnancy complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trans abdominal and trans vaginal ultrasound examination Patients will be considered to&#xD;
           have placenta praevia if the lower edge of the placenta is less than 2 cm form the&#xD;
           internal os of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placenta accreta will be considered as the following(7, 8) (Placental lacunae, Loss of&#xD;
      hypoechoic space, Abnormalities of uterus-bladder interface, Color Doppler abnormalities)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2D grey-scale Loss of the &quot;clear zone&quot; Loss or irregularity of the hypoechoic plane in the&#xD;
      myometrium underneath the placental bed (the &quot;clear zone&quot;) Abnormal placental lacunae&#xD;
      Presence of numerous lacunae including some that are large and irregular (Fin berg grade 3)&#xD;
      often containing turbulent flow visible in grey-scale imaging Bladder wall interruption Loss&#xD;
      or interruption of the bright bladder wall (the hyperechoic band or &quot;line&quot; between the&#xD;
      uterine serosa and the bladder lumen) Myometrial thinning Thinning of the myometrium&#xD;
      overlying the placenta to &lt;1 mm or undetectable Placental bulge Deviation of the uterine&#xD;
      serosa away from the expected plane, caused by an abnormal bulge of placental tissue into a&#xD;
      neighbouring organ, typically the bladder. The uterine serosa appears intact but the outline&#xD;
      shape is distorted Focal exophytic mass Placental tissue seen breaking through the uterine&#xD;
      serosa and extending beyond it. Most often seen inside a filled urinary bladder Color Doppler&#xD;
      imaging Uterovesical hypervascularity Striking amount of colour Doppler signal seen between&#xD;
      the myometrium and the posterior wall of the bladder. This sign probably indicates numerous,&#xD;
      closely packed, tortuous vessels in that region (demonstrating multi-directional flow and&#xD;
      aliasing artifact) Subplacental hypervascularity Striking amount of color Doppler signal seen&#xD;
      in the placental bed. This sign probably indicates numerous,closely packed, tortuous vessels&#xD;
      in that region (demonstrating multidirectional flow and aliasing artifact)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bridging vessels Vessels appearing to extend from the placenta across the myometrium and&#xD;
      beyond the serosa into the bladder or other organs. Often running perpendicular to the&#xD;
      myometrium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placental lacunae feeder vessels Vessels with high velocity blood flow leading from the&#xD;
      myometrium into the placental lacunae, causing turbulence upon entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      At laparotomy the following data will be reviewed(6):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 1: Abnormally adherent placenta (placenta adherenta or accreta)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Macroscopically, the uterus shows no obvious distension over the placental bed&#xD;
           (placental &quot;bulge&quot;), no placental tissue is seen invading through the surface of the&#xD;
           uterus, and there is no or minimal neovascularity Grade 2: Abnormally invasive placenta&#xD;
           (Increta)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal macroscopic findings over the placental bed: bluish/purple colouring,&#xD;
           distension (placental &quot;bulge&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant amounts of hypervascularity (dense tangled bed of vessels or multiple&#xD;
           vessels running parallel craniocaudially in the uterine serosa)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No placental tissue seen to be invading through the uterine serosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gentle cord traction results in the uterus being pulled inwards without separation of&#xD;
           the placenta (so-called the dimple sign) Histologic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hysterectomy specimen or partial myometrial resection of the increta area shows&#xD;
                placental villi within the muscular fibers and sometimes in the lumen of the deep&#xD;
                uterine vasculature (radial or arcuate arteries) Grade 3: Abnormally invasive&#xD;
                placenta (Percreta) Grade 3a: Limited to the uterine serosa Clinical criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At laparotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal macroscopic findings on uterine serosal surface (as above) and placental tissue&#xD;
           seen to be invading through the surface of the uterus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No invasion into any other organ, including the posterior wall of the bladder (a clear&#xD;
           surgical plane can be identified between the bladder and uterus)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Histologic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hysterectomy specimen showing villous tissue within or breaching the uterine serosa&#xD;
           Grade 3b: With urinary bladder invasion Clinical criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           • At laparotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placental villi are seen to be invading into the bladder but no other organs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clear surgical plane cannot be identified between the bladder and uterus Histologic&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hysterectomy specimen showing villous tissue breaching the uterine serosa and&#xD;
                invading the bladder wall tissue or urothelium Grade 3c: With invasion of other&#xD;
                pelvic tissue/organs Clinical criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At laparotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placental villi are seen to be invading into the broad ligament, vaginal wall, pelvic&#xD;
           sidewall or any other pelvic organ (with or without invasion of the bladder) Histologic&#xD;
           criteria • Hysterectomy specimen showing villous tissue breaching the uterine serosa and&#xD;
           invading pelvic tissues/organs (with or without invasion of the bladder) .For the&#xD;
           purposes of this classification, &quot;uterus&quot; includes the uterine body and uterine cervix .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The data will be analysed after putting it in the following groups,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  study group consisted of patients with placenta praevia diagnosed by TVUS, control&#xD;
                group consisted of patients undergoing elective caesarean delivery without having&#xD;
                placenta praevia by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) examination&#xD;
