    <textblock>
      This is an open label investigator initiated Phase Ib study of combination pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (Keytruda), 200mg IV 3 weekly (Q3W) with 50mg oral cyclophosphamide daily (OD) in metastatic&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma patients. 21 patients will be recruited within the United Kingdom (UK)&#xD;
      will to examine the efficacy of the combination for up to 35 administrations (2 years). This&#xD;
      study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all relevant&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAPER Trial will be looking at patients with locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic&#xD;
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma who have had previous treatment with immunotherapy and have&#xD;
      experienced disease progression. Immunotherapies aim to boost the body's natural defences to&#xD;
      fight cancer, however the tumour micro-environment may significantly impact how effective&#xD;
      this approach will be at reducing cancer growth and spread. The CAPER trial aims to evaluate&#xD;
      whether oral metronomic cyclophosphamide (50mg once daily) can alter the tumour environment&#xD;
      and ultimately lead to responses to pembrolizumab in patients who have failed prior&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who join the study will initially take cyclophosphamide 50mg tablets once a day for&#xD;
      21 days during the 'run-in period'. Following this, they will continue with cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      50mg daily alongside intravenous pembrolizumab treatment administered once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will continue both treatments until the occurrence of either disease progression,&#xD;
      unexpected toxicity, patient withdrawal, or completion of 24 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo CT scanning to evaluate response every 9 weeks during trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research biopsies will be taken at baseline (prior to treatment), after the 21 day run-in&#xD;
      period on oral cyclophosphamide, and at the time of the first CT scan (week 9 on treatment).&#xD;
      Patients will also have additional research blood samples collected at serial timepoints&#xD;
      whilst on treatment. The biopsy and blood samples will allow evaluation of the changes&#xD;
      induced by cyclophosphamide and pembrolizumab within the tumour microenvironment as well as&#xD;
      changes in circulating factors such as cytokines.&#xD;

             treatment discontinuation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ongoing Adverse Events (AEs) due to previous therapies or surgery which have not&#xD;

             investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last&#xD;
             dose of the previous investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Known previous or current Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Note: no testing is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;

             or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA positive) infection. Note: no&#xD;
             testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Known history of active tuberculosis (Bacillus Tuberculosis, TB). Note: no testing for&#xD;
             TB is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
             might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation&#xD;
             for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to&#xD;
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;
             with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 180 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of trial treatment. Note: WOCBP must have a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to trial entry (see Appendix 3). If the urine&#xD;
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required. In the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test&#xD;
             and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be&#xD;
             performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
