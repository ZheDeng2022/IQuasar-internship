  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a peptide of 28 amino acid residues that belongs to&#xD;
      the glucagon/secretin superfamily of peptides. Along with other neuropeptides, such as&#xD;
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide&#xD;
      (PACAP), it is released from the trigeminal afferents and exerts a strong vasodilating&#xD;
      activity on the cranial vasculature. Especially, it shares 70% structure with PACAP and acts&#xD;
      on the same receptors. But, unlike it, VIP cannot induce a long-lasting vasodilation and has&#xD;
      a modest capability to induce migraine attacks. Whether it may induce migraine-like attacks&#xD;
      in migraine patients, as a twenty-minute infusion of PACAP, is unknown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a peptide of 28 amino acid residues that&#xD;
      belongs to the glucagon/secretin superfamily of peptides. It is distributed in different&#xD;
      regions of the nervous system, including several autonomic ganglia and the brain. Once&#xD;
      released from neurons, it acts on the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 (VPAC1), the&#xD;
      vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (VPAC2) and the pituitary adenylate&#xD;
      cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1). All three belong to a family of&#xD;
      G-protein coupled receptors, sharing the activation of adenylate cyclase and the increase in&#xD;
      intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The three receptors are involved in many&#xD;
      physiological functions, among them the vasodilating and parasympathetic responses. VPAC1 and&#xD;
      VPAC2 are expressed in dura mater vessels and are primarily responsible for the relaxation of&#xD;
      arteries. PAC1 is located in the trigemino-autonomic system, but not in blood vessels. VIP&#xD;
      shares the binding to the three aforementioned receptors with other peptides, including the&#xD;
      pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38), and the pituitary adenylate&#xD;
      cyclase-activating polypeptide-27 (PACAP27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      20-minute infusion of VIP and PACAPs in patients with migraine dilated cranial arteries.&#xD;
      However, only PACAP27 and PACAP38 induced a sustained cranial vasodilation, and migraine&#xD;
      like-attacks. VIP-induced cranial vasodilation was of short duration, and patients did not&#xD;
      report migraine-like attacks. The discrepancy was ascribed to the preferential activation of&#xD;
      the PAC1 receptor by PACAPs, but a monoclonal antibody against PAC1 receptor recently failed&#xD;
      in migraine prevention. Currently, it is unknown whether the prolonged cranial vasodilation&#xD;
      related with the appearance of migraine-like attacks. More recently, a two-hour infusion of&#xD;
      VIP promoted a long-lasting cranial vasodilation and delayed headache in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      resembling the effect of PACAP27 and PACAP38, two closely related peptides causing migraine.&#xD;
      Whether a long-lasting infusion of VIP may induce a sustained cranial vasodilation and&#xD;
      migraine-like attacks in migraine patients, as a twenty-minute infusion of PACAP27 and&#xD;
      PACAP38, is unknown.&#xD;

    <description>Migraine-like attack fulfilling either (i) or (ii):&#xD;
(i) Headache fulfilling criteria C and D for migraine without aura according to the International Classification od Headache Disorders: C. Headache has at least two of the following four characteristics: unilateral location; pulsating quality; moderate or severe pain intensity (moderate pain intensity is considered 5 or 4 on verbal rating scale); aggravation by cough (hospitalization phase) or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (out-hospital phase); D. During headache at least one of the following: nausea and/or vomiting; photophobia and phonophobia; (ii) Headache described as mimicking the patient's usual migraine attack and treated with acute migraine medication (rescue medication).</description>

It is a verbally declared scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no headache; 1 is a very mild headache, including a feeling of pressing or throbbing; 5 is a moderate headache; 10 is the worst imaginable headache.</description>
