      Hypothesis: Infections other than HIV can cause LN inflammation and collagen damage to the&#xD;
      fibroblastic reticular cell network (FRCn), which will lead to CD4 T cell depletion and&#xD;
      impaired vaccine responses. This protocol will study yellow fever vaccine (YFV) in two&#xD;
      cohorts of people, one from Uganda and the other from Minnesota where we collect lymphoid&#xD;
      tissues (LT) and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) before and after vaccination using a new&#xD;
      technique to catalog infectious burden of the individual, determine the relationship between&#xD;
      IA, Infections, and immune response.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the difference between antibody titers in the&#xD;
      two study groups and study the relationship between endemic infections, IA, the FRCn, and CD4&#xD;
      and CD8 T cell subsets and the magnitude and durability of neutralizing antibody response to&#xD;
      YFV in a cohort shown to have elevated IA, a damaged FRCn, and pan T cell depletion and a&#xD;
      cohort that does not. This is a single arm, open-label, two cohort study of healthy adults in&#xD;
      Kampala, Uganda and in Minnesota, USA. The cohort in Uganda will be 30 adults (15 men and 15&#xD;
      women) and the cohort in Minnesota will be 16 adults (8 men and 8 women). Everyone will be&#xD;
      screened to ensure there are no contraindications to receiving YFV (e.g., immunosuppression)&#xD;
      or the planned procedures. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are discussed in detail in&#xD;
      the protocol that is included in the appendix. Participants will have an inguinal lymph node&#xD;
      and adjacent adipose tissue biopsy and leukapheresis prior to YFV and again 3 weeks after the&#xD;
      vaccine administration. The vaccine will be given in the contralateral thigh from the first&#xD;
      LN biopsy so that the second biopsy will be from a draining LN. PBMC and plasma as well as&#xD;
      urine and stool will be collected at regular intervals over the 18-month follow-up period and&#xD;
      leukapheresis will be done again at the month 18 visit.&#xD;

             administration of the vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  History of yellow fever or previous vaccination for yellow fever&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known bleeding disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgery complicated by clotting abnormality&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or behavioral disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, will make&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of acute hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the vaccine (including&#xD;

             antimetabolites, TNF inhibitors, IL-1 blocking agents, monoclonal antibodies targeting&#xD;
             immune cells), previous radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of vaccination.&#xD;
