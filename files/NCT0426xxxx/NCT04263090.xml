      A Phase1/2a Study of Rigosertib plus Nivolumab in Stage IV Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients with&#xD;
      KRAS Mutation who Progressed on First-Line Treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase I study followed by a Phase 2a dose-expansion&#xD;
      phase to study the combination of Rigosertib and Nivolumab in metastatic Kirsten rat sarcoma&#xD;
      positive (KRAS+) lung adenocarcinoma patients who have progressed on standard first line&#xD;
      treatment. Study patients will have satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria enumerated in&#xD;
      this protocol. The Phase I dose escalation plan will start with an accelerated titration&#xD;
      design (ATD) using single patient cohorts until grade 2 toxicity is experienced. At that&#xD;
      point, the ATD will be terminated and the dose escalation will enter a standard 3+3 design&#xD;
      based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). The MTD (Phase 1 primary endpoint) is defined as the&#xD;
      highest dose for which at most 1 patient out of 6 experiences a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rigosertib escalation will occur with three dose levels (dose D1: 280mg twice daily; dose D2:&#xD;
      560mg in the morning (qAM), 280mg in the evening (qPM); dose D3: 560mg twice daily; taken by&#xD;
      mouth for 21 consecutive days of the 28 day cycle), based on previous dose escalation studies&#xD;
      in other malignancies, while Nivolumab dose will be fixed at the standard dose (240mg every 2&#xD;
      weeks, given intravenously).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is determined, an additional planned 12 patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      expansion phase to further study toxicity and to determine preliminary efficacy endpoints&#xD;
      including ORR (phase 2a primary endpoint), PFS, and OS (secondary endpoints) of the&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive with detectable viral load, or anyone not on stable anti-viral (HAART)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of interstitial lung disease (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing&#xD;
             pneumonia) or active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immunosuppressive doses&#xD;
             of glucocorticoids to assist with management. A history of radiation pneumonitis in&#xD;
             the radiation field is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.&#xD;
