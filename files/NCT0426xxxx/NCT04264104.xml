  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effects of two diferente doses of nervous system mobilization&#xD;
      on athletes performance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that 60 athletes will be randomly allocated to receive either 4x10 (n=30)&#xD;
      or 8x10 (n=30) repetitions of neural mobilization .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on flexibility (knee extension test) and lower limb strength and motor control (hop&#xD;
      tests and vertical jump test) will be collected at baseline and after the neural&#xD;
      mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.&#xD;
