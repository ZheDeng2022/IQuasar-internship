      This study aims at evaluating if placement of CLARIX® CORD 1K during robotic prostatectomy&#xD;
      decreases the time to achieve complete erectile and urinary function after the surgery. As&#xD;
      part of the study, the patient will be asked to answer various questions after the surgery&#xD;
      regarding sexual and urinary function.&#xD;

      One hundred male patients who are scheduled for bilateral, nerve-sparing RARP that meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled. These patients will be equally randomized (1:1) into&#xD;
      two groups (n=50/group): one group will receive adjunctive CLARIX® CORD 1K (Amniox Medical,&#xD;
      Inc., Miami, FL) during RARP, while the other group will undergo RARP without adjunctive&#xD;
      CLARIX® CORD 1K. Subject stratification will be performed based on the surgeon that will be&#xD;
      performing the RARP. All patients will be given the same routine preoperative, perioperative&#xD;
      and postoperative evaluation and care aside from the CLARIX CORD 1K placement in the&#xD;
      treatment group during RARP. RARP will be performed at Hackensack University Medical Center&#xD;
      (30 Prospect Ave, Hackensack, NJ 07601) and follow up visits performed at Hackensack&#xD;
      University Medical Group Urology (360 Essex Street, Suite 403, Hackensack, NJ 07601) or New&#xD;
      Jersey Urology (255 W. Spring Valley Avenue Suite 101, Maywood, NJ 07607).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks prior to the RARP surgery, subjects are instructed to take low-dose oral&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (i.e. 20 mg q.d. sildenafil citrate or 5 mg q.d.&#xD;
      tadalafil) and perform standardized Kegel exercises (3x/day) which is our current standard&#xD;
      care protocol. RARP surgery will be performed at Hackensack University Medical Center&#xD;
      (Hackensack, NJ). The following are the key aspects of the RARP surgical technique which will&#xD;
      be adhered to by all surgeons: 1) dissection of the bladder neck, seminal vesicles and vasa&#xD;
      deferentia; 2) dissection of the neuroplexus from the posterior Denonvilliers' fascia and&#xD;
      lateral prostatic fascia leaving the nerves intact; 3) division of the prostatic pedicles&#xD;
      without cautery; 4) transection of the dorsal venous complex; and 5) urethrovesical&#xD;
      anastomosis. More specifically, surgical technique includes exposing the prostate in the&#xD;
      space of Retzius with the traditional anterior approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prostatovesical tissue is dissected with monopolar electrocautery scissors with entry&#xD;
      into the bladder proximal to the prostatovesical junction. The bladder neck is transected in&#xD;
      the standard fashion followed by posterior dissection of the seminal vesicles and vasa&#xD;
      deferentia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocautery is kept to a minimum when dissecting the seminal vesicles to avoid damage to&#xD;
      the neuroplexus. (Note: each step hereafter must be performed by the PI or Sub-investigators,&#xD;
      e.g. not a Resident Physician). A posterior surgical plane is then created between the rectum&#xD;
      and prostate dorsally working from a medial to lateral direction and maintaining at least 1&#xD;
      layer of Denonvilliers' fascia on the rectal wall. The endopelvic fascia is then excised from&#xD;
      lateral prostate and carried to capsule to create a plane of dissection immediately alongside&#xD;
      the prostatic capsule and keeping the nerves attached laterally to the endopelvic fascia.&#xD;
      Athermal division of each prostatic pedicle will be performed. Clips or suture may be placed&#xD;
      on each pedicle at the discretion of the surgeon. The apex of the prostate is then dissected&#xD;
      athermally sparing the neuroplexus. The dorsal vein complex is proximally transected with&#xD;
      electrocautery while using the fourth arm to place traction on the prostate to define the&#xD;
      space between the dorsal vein complex and the apex of the prostate. Apically, the prostate is&#xD;
      divided from the urethra (paying special attention to the sphincter muscle and posterior&#xD;
      lateral nerve bundle on each side) allowing the prostate to be removed. Once free, the&#xD;
      prostate is placed in a collection bag and a drain is used for a certain period at the&#xD;
      discretion of the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site bleeding is managed using standard surgical techniques with sutures or&#xD;
      cellulose polymer. If the patient is randomized to the treatment group, CLARIX CORD 1K is&#xD;
      placed flat over the neuroplexis at the 5 and 7 clock position where the largest&#xD;
      concentration of nerves exist. Sutures may be used to secure the CLARIX in place if necessary&#xD;
      and cellulose polymer (Surgicel, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) can be placed over the CLARIX CORD&#xD;
      at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point the bladder neck will be reconstructed as necessary to maintain a lumen of&#xD;
      approximately 30 french. The vesicourethral anastomosis is performed using a V-lock barbed&#xD;
      suture. The anastomosis will be tested by filling bladder to confirm the absence of leakage.&#xD;
      If indicated, a bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection is performed (with clips at the&#xD;
      discretion of the physician) using standard (borders along the external iliac artery and&#xD;
      vein, obturator fossa, obturator nerve and pubic bone) or extended (borders additionally&#xD;
      include internal iliac artery) technique at the discretion of the physician. Bleeding will be&#xD;
      adequately managed. Postoperatively, all subjects are instructed to take low-dose oral&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (i.e. 20 mg q.d. sildenafil citrate or 5 mg q.d.&#xD;
      tadalafil) and perform standardized Kegel exercises (3x/day) following urethral catheter&#xD;
      removal. When patients are sexually active, they may increase to full dosage of oral&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors up to twice a week. At 3 months after RARP, and if&#xD;
      patients have severe or worse incontinence (defined as ICIQ score of &gt;12) and desire&#xD;
      additional treatment for urinary incontinence,[42] they will undergo pelvic floor therapy.&#xD;
      Subjects will return for follow up visits at 6 weeks (±1 week), 3 months (±2 weeks), 6 months&#xD;
      (±3 weeks) and 12 months (±4 weeks) when data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcomes will be assessed including continence, potency, and satisfaction.&#xD;
      Occurrence of adverse events, number of readmissions, and need for reintervention will also&#xD;
      be recorded. Measurement of serum PSA levels will also be performed.&#xD;

    <description>CLARIX® CORD 1K (Amniox Medical, Miami, FL) is an umbilical cord allograft processed using the patented CRYOTEK™ process by TissueTech Inc. to devitalize all living cells but retain the natural structural and biological characteristics relevant to this tissue [43]. CLARIX® CORD 1K (6x3 cm in size) will be cut into two longitudinal pieces (1.5 cm in width) and placed circumferentially around each NVB as a nerve wrap during RARP. CLARIX® CORD 1K has been in market since 2013 in the United States as a &quot;361 human cell and tissue-based product (HCT/P)&quot; and is aseptically processed in compliance with current Good Tissue Practices (cGTP) as outlined in 21 CFR Part 1271.</description>
