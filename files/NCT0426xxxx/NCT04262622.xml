  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Midline laparotomies are accompanied by severe postoperative pain. Adequate post-operative&#xD;
      pain relief after major abdominal surgery reduces complications (e.g. chest infection or deep&#xD;
      venous thrombosis) and enhances recovery and early mobilization, with better patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction, and less hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard technique for post-operative analgesia after major abdominal surgery is thoracic&#xD;
      epidural analgesia (TEA). On the other hand, the complications encountered with TEA motivates&#xD;
      the search for another technique, besides that in some situations, midline incision is needed&#xD;
      while TEA is contraindicated e.g. emergency laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rectus sheath nerve block (RSB) is a regional anesthetic technique that provides midline&#xD;
      somatic analgesia and might be an alternative to TEA. It is an old technique that has been&#xD;
      revisited because of the availability of new local anesthetic agents, and the availability of&#xD;
      small-caliber catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was hypothesized that rectus sheath analgesia (RSA) might be an alternative to thoracic&#xD;
      epidural analgesia. Thereby, the aim of the current study is to find whether analgesia&#xD;
      provided through surgically placed rectus sheath catheters can be a safe and effective&#xD;
      alternative to thoracic epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective midline laparotomies.&#xD;

      Administrative design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approval is obtained from the ethics committee of faculty of medicine, IRB approval and&#xD;
           the Department of Anesthesia and Surgical Intensive Care, Zagazig University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed written consent will be obtained from all patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time without negative&#xD;
           sequences on their medical or surgical treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power of this study is calculated prospectively using G*POWER program version 3.1.9.2.&#xD;
      (Heinrich Heine; Universitat Dusseldorf; Germany). To calculate sample size, degree of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia is used as the primary outcome. A pilot study (10 patients in each&#xD;
      group) was performed to detect significant difference in the degree of postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia (following VAS). It is found that 24 patients are needed in each group to achieve&#xD;
      an alpha error level of 0.05, with 80% power and 95% confidence interval. Allowing a 5% drop&#xD;
      out rate, the final sample size needed is 25 patients in each group to detect clinically&#xD;
      significant difference of &gt;20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan Categorical data will be presented as frequencies and/or&#xD;
      percentages and analyzed with a chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Quantitative variables&#xD;
      will be analyzed with unpaired t test. Statistical analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics (version 21). A p value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups using computer generated&#xD;
      randomization tables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Thoracic epidural analgesia group (Group TEA): The skin and subcutaneous tissues will be&#xD;
      infiltrated using 1 mL lidocaine 2% approximately lateral to the inferior aspect of the&#xD;
      targeted spinous process using a 1.5-inch 25-gauge needle. A 17-gauge Tuohy needle will be&#xD;
      introduced through paramedian approach. For all patients in this group, the needle will be&#xD;
      introduced at T7 to T9. A test dose of 3 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:200,000 adrenaline will be&#xD;
      injected through the epidural catheter followed by induction of general anesthesia. On wound&#xD;
      closure 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine + 40 μg Fentanyl will be injected into the epidural catheter.&#xD;
      Thereafter, in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and in surgical intensive care unit (SICU),&#xD;
      20 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine + 40 μg Fentanyl will be administered every 6 h for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Rectus sheath block group (Group RSB): Touhy needle will be inserted 2-4 cm lateral to the&#xD;
      midline in an angle of 45 degrees to the skin, through the anterior abdominal wall until&#xD;
      reaching the potential space between the posterior layer of the rectus sheath and rectus&#xD;
      abdominis muscle. The catheter will be surgically inserted into the rectus sheath. The&#xD;
      surgeon will put the nondominant hand inside the abdomen to locate the needle tip and the&#xD;
      other hand gently push the epidural needle in the interface between the peritoneum and muscle&#xD;
      layer. The catheters will be placed at the upper end of the laparotomy wound until a 5cm&#xD;
      length is inside the rectus sheath. After securing the catheter, it will be flushed with&#xD;
      saline 0.9% and the same procedure will be repeated on the other side. After that 20 mL of&#xD;
      0.125% bupivacaine + 20 μg Fentanyl will be injected in each catheter as an initial bolus&#xD;
      dose to block the intercostal nerves to provide analgesia through the recovery period until&#xD;
      the next dose. In PACU and in SICU, 10 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine + 20 μg Fentanyl every 6&#xD;
      hours will be administered into each catheter for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' monitoring and general anesthesia for both groups All patients will be closely&#xD;
      monitored with electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, sphygmomanometer cuff and capnography.&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced by 1 µg/kg fentanyl, propofol 2 mg/kg slowly, and rocuronium&#xD;
      bromide at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal tube insertion. Following&#xD;
      induction, mechanical ventilation of the lungs will be applied to maintain end tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide between 35-40 mmHg. Anesthesia will be maintained using 1.5 MAC isoflurane.&#xD;
      Subsequent doses of rocuronium 0.01 mg/kg will be given if needed (according to nerve&#xD;
      stimulator train of four (TOF) response). Additional doses of fentanyl 1 µg/kg will be given&#xD;
      following clinical data of the patient (if both heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      increases &gt;20% from baseline despite maintaining adequate depth of anesthesia). By the end of&#xD;
      surgery, reversal of neuromuscular block will be performed using neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and&#xD;
      atropine 0.02 mg/kg and patients will be extubated before transfer to PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • For both groups: IV 1 gm paracetamol (Perfalgan)/ 8h will be given to patients. The first&#xD;
      dose of paracetamol will be given intraoperatively on wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid-based patient-driven titration protocols have been previously applied in other studies&#xD;
      [19, 20]. Thereby, for patients in both groups, if breakthrough pain occurred, the following&#xD;
      plan will be applied: ensure that the analgesic protocol of the study is followed then&#xD;
      evaluate the degree of pain according to visual analogue scale (VAS) [1] where 0= no pain,&#xD;
      and 10= worst pain possible. If VAS is ≥4= inadequate pain relief, Fentanyl-based&#xD;
      patient-driven titration protocol will be followed for supplementary IV analgesia: the&#xD;
      patient will be given 25 µg fentanyl, if after 5 min VAS is still ≥ 4, another 25µg fentanyl&#xD;
      will be given, to be repeated every 5 min if needed with a maximum dose of 1 µg/kg of&#xD;
      fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of the intervention is defined as complete absence of sensory blockade with no&#xD;
      improvement in pain severity as reported by the patient after an adequate bolus injection of&#xD;
      local anesthetic through either the TEA or RSC. Cases will be recorded if occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected from all patients during a visit 24 hours before surgery.&#xD;
      From all patients, the following data will be collected during intra- and post-operative&#xD;
      periods (for 48 hours) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vital signs [including Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), Heart rate (HR), and&#xD;
           Respiratory rate (RR)] will be recorded every 10 min during intraoperative period.&#xD;
           During postoperative period, they will be recorded every 10 min for the first hour after&#xD;
           each time of administration of local anesthetic into the catheters. For the next 5&#xD;
           hours, they will be recorded every one hour. This process will be repeated during the&#xD;
           first 48 h of post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient oxygenation will be recorded during intraoperative period and the first 48h of&#xD;
           post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Degree of postoperative pain (using VAS score) [1] and sedation level (using Ramsay&#xD;
           sedation scale (RSS) [2], will be evaluated and recorded at the following postoperative&#xD;
           times: 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours; where T0= time of arrival of the patient to&#xD;
           PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time to first dose of supplementary analgesia with IV Fentanyl will be recorded in each&#xD;
           group (starting from the time of administration of the first dose of local anesthetic&#xD;
           into the catheters, to time of VAS ≥ 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Total intra- and post-operative consumption of Fentanyl in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Complications will be recorded and managed if occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After discharge from operation room, all patients will be monitored at 1-hour intervals&#xD;
           for the presence of bowel sounds and/or the passage of flatus in order to allow oral&#xD;
           fluid intake. Time of initiation of oral fluid intake will be recorded in both groups.&#xD;
           Times for the patient to be able to ambulate independently will be also recorded. The&#xD;
           starting time-point for both functions will be the time of administration of the first&#xD;
           dose of local anesthetic into the catheters, while the end-point will be the time when&#xD;
           the patient will be able to perform these functions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient satisfaction regarding postoperative pain control using a scale of 1-3 (3-Good,&#xD;
           2-Fair, 1-Poor) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results Collected data will be presented in tables and/or suitable graphs and analyzed by&#xD;
      computer software (SPSS statistics) using appropriate statistical methods and will be&#xD;
      compared to relevant literatures and scientific researches.&#xD;
