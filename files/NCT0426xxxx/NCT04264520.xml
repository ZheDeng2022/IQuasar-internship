  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to test a brief computer-assisted intervention (psychoeducation +&#xD;
      skills) for pregnant women with elevated PTSD symptoms. In this open trial pilot feasibility&#xD;
      study, 20 pregnant women in their first trimester will be invited to participate in the study&#xD;
      if they endorse elevated PTSD symptoms. Oxytocin and cortisol will be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      one month post-intervention, three months post-intervention, and post-delivery to inform the&#xD;
      relationship between these hormones, PTSD symptoms, and peripartum/postpartum outcomes. In&#xD;
      addition to receiving the psychoeducation + skills intervention during their first trimester,&#xD;
      women will be offered a &quot;booster session&quot; intervention following delivery to enhance&#xD;
      utilization of skills during a critical period for maternal mental and physical health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) Total Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to follow-up (follow-up will occur at one-month following the baby's birth)</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 17-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess PTSD symptoms among civilians. In the current study, PCL-5 total scores will be utilized. Specifically, we will examine the impact of the intervention on change in PCL-5 scores across time (i.e., from baseline to post-delivery follow-up). Scores on the PCL-5 range from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating more symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Baby's Weight at Birth in Pounds/Ounces</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to birth of baby.</time_frame>
    <description>Each baby's weight (in pounds/ounces) will be derived from the online medical record following delivery. This outcome will be used to determine the relationship between maternal PTSD symptoms (as indexed by the PCL-5 total scores--above) and infant weight at birth.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Gestation Length in Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to birth of baby.</time_frame>
    <description>The total gestation length, in weeks, will be derived from the online medical record following the baby's birth. This outcome will be used to determine the relationship between maternal PTSD symptoms (as indexed by the PCL-5 total scores--above) and total weeks gestation at birth.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Baby's APGAR Score at Birth</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to birth of baby.</time_frame>
    <description>Each baby's APGAR score will be derived from the online medical record following delivery. APGAR scores range from 0-10, with higher scores indicating better health at birth for baby. APGAR scores will be used to determine the relationship between maternal PTSD symptoms (as indexed by the PCL-5 total scores--above) and infant health at birth.</description>
