  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is very common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and is a major&#xD;
      factor leading to impaired quality of life. Nocturnal scratching is one of the factors&#xD;
      causing sleep disturbance in AD patients. This study aims to develop and validate a digital&#xD;
      algorithm for accurately and reliably detecting and quantifying nocturnal scratch behaviors&#xD;
      related to AD using wrist actigraphy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wrist actigraphy is an investigational device being developed to detect and quantify&#xD;
      scratching behaviors in patients with AD. This study will be conducted in 2 sequential&#xD;
      stages: In Stage 1, an algorithm will be developed and in Stage 2 the algorithm developed&#xD;
      will be validated. Adult healthy volunteers or participants with AD will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Approximately 14 healthy volunteers, 14 AD patients with low disease activity and 28 AD&#xD;
      patients with high disease activity will be enrolled in the study in 5 sites across the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No drug will be administered as a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in this study may experience discomfort or inconvenience related to the&#xD;
      study procedures. Participants will be enrolled and monitored overnight for two consecutive&#xD;
      nights at an inpatient setting at a hospital or clinic. The impact of nocturnal scratching on&#xD;
      sleep parameters will be assessed by videography, actigraphy, sleep headband and completing&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
