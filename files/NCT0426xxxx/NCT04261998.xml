    <textblock>
      A service-learning programme in physiotherapy students will be performed. 30 physiotherapy&#xD;
      students will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=16) or to a control group&#xD;
      (n=16). Intervention group will perform a service-learning program with real patients with&#xD;
      heart transplantation, and will have to perform a physical therapy program adapted to a real&#xD;
      patient. Two meetings will be performed in order to establish groups, explain the project and&#xD;
      search information based on evidence in scientific databases. In addition, three meetings&#xD;
      with patients will be stated in order to establish the adapted program based on the real&#xD;
      patient's needs and characteristics. The control group will have to perform a physiotherapy&#xD;
      program without meeting real patients.&#xD;

      This study aims at determining the effect of a Service-Learning program on knowledge, ethical&#xD;
      sensitivity and acquired transversal competences. On the other hand, we aim at evaluating the&#xD;
      service performed, the skills acquired, the participation, the degree of participatory&#xD;
      evaluation and the level of satisfaction of the intervention group. All variables will be&#xD;
      measured with validated scales or questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have to describe the specific characteristics of the program, different&#xD;
      phases of the process, types of exercises recommended, contraindications, safety ranges with&#xD;
      respect to the intensity of the exercise, ways of calculating the intensity and self-control.&#xD;
      Likewise, they will have to defend the usefulness and duration of the final product through&#xD;
      an oral presentation of the program to the patients themselves. Finally, the possible doubts&#xD;
      that should exist will be solved.&#xD;
