  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to describe&#xD;
      the efficacy of R-CHOP plus copanlisib including a safety run-in phase in order to detect&#xD;
      early and common unexpected toxicities caused by the addition of copanlisib to the standard&#xD;
      immuno-chemotherapy R-CHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with DLBCL can be cured with a combined approach of CHOP chemotherapy and&#xD;
      the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in roughly 65% of cases. About one third of patients with&#xD;
      DLBCL relapse or show primary progressive disease after modern first-line therapy. The&#xD;
      outcome of these patients is poor in particular if first-line therapy contained rituximab.&#xD;
      Novel therapeutic approaches are urgently warranted. Thus, it is the goal to further improve&#xD;
      progression-free Survival (PFS) and overall Survival (OS) by combining R-CHOP with&#xD;
      copanlisib. Copanlisib is a small molecule pan-class 1 PI3K inhibitor and approved by US FDA&#xD;
      for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at&#xD;
      least two prior systemic therapies.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will receive 6 cycles of R-CHOP immunochemotherapy every two weeks with the following doses per cycle: rituximab 375 mg/m², cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m², doxorubicin 50 mg/ m², vincristine 1.4 mg/m² (dose capped at 2 mg or 1 mg for individuals above 60 years of age), prednisolone 500 mg. In addition, copanlisib at a dose of 60 mg will be administered on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle of R-CHOP in the first 6 patients. If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in no more than one out of these 6 patients during cycle 1, additional 6 patients at 60 mg will be enrolled and treated for at least 1 cycle before opening the phase II portion of the study. If a DLT is observed in 2 or more of the first 6 patients during cycle 1 the dose of copanlisib will be reduced to 45 mg on days 1 and 8 for the next 6 patients. The data of the safety run-in analysis (first 12 patients) will be presented to the Data Safety Monitoring Board and the recommended phase 2 dose will be determined.</description>

                  lymphoma) with a diagnostic biopsy performed within 3 months before study entry&#xD;
                  and with material available for central review and complimentary scientific&#xD;
                  analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 18-80 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. International Prognostic Index (IPI) 2-5&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use effective contraception when&#xD;
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed&#xD;
             consent form and 6 months after the last administration of study treatment. A woman is&#xD;
             considered of childbearing potential, i.e. fertile, following menarche and until&#xD;
             becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods&#xD;
             include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for continuous 12 months&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level&#xD;
             in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women&#xD;
             not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. The investigator or&#xD;
             a designated associate is requested to advise the patient how to achieve highly&#xD;
             effective birth control (failure rate of less than 1%), e.g. intrauterine device,&#xD;
             intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner&#xD;
             and sexual abstinence. The use of condoms by male patients is required unless the&#xD;
             female partner is permanently sterile.&#xD;

             liver involvement or with biliary obstruction due to lymphoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x&#xD;

             evaluation may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the&#xD;
             CKD-EPI formula or by 24-hour sampling. If the later result is within acceptable&#xD;
