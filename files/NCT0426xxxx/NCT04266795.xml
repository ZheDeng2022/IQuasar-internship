  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of pevonedistat +&#xD;
      venetoclax + azacitidine improves event-free survival (EFS) compared with venetoclax +&#xD;
      azacitidine in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are unfit for&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to&#xD;
      treat people who have AML. This study will compare the improvement in EFS in Arm A:&#xD;
      pevonedistat + venetoclax + azacitidine combination arm group when compared with Arm B:&#xD;
      venetoclax + azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 150 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned in&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups in 28-day treatment cycles and which will remain&#xD;
      disclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + Venetoclax 400 mg (ramp-up dose, Cycle 1 only: 100-400mg) +&#xD;
           Azacitidine 75 mg/m^2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax 400 mg (ramp-up dose, Cycle 1 only: 100-400 mg) + Azacitidine 75 mg/m^2&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 4 years. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy&#xD;
      if that occurs sooner. Participants who discontinue study treatment without evidence of&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD) will enter EFS follow-up or response follow-up (study visits every 3&#xD;
      months) or overall survival follow-up (contacted every 3 months to document subsequent&#xD;
      therapies and survival status).&#xD;

CR is defined as bone marrow blasts &lt;5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥1.0×10^9/L (1000/µL); platelet count≥100×10^9/L (100,000/µL).

If fail to achieve CR/CRi, date of treatment failure will be set on day of randomization.

    <description>EORTC -QLQ-C30 scale is used to assess HRQOL in cancer participants and contains 30 items which incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global quality of life (QOL)/health status scale. Most items have 4 response levels (1=not at all [best] to 4=very much [worst]), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale (1=very poor [worst] to 7=excellent [best]). Supplemental items on symptoms (7 items) and functional impacts (3 items) from the EORTC item are included. The supplemental 10 items have 4 response levels (1=not at all to 4=very much). Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status scale, higher scores represent better HRQOL; whereas for the symptom scales lower scores represent better HRQOL.</description>

          -  Has extramedullary AML without evidence of bone marrow involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had prior treatment with hypomethylating agents for AML (hypomethylating agent&#xD;

             treatment for MDS within 14 days before first dose of any study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a WBC count ≥25 × 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Note: Known HIV&#xD;
             positive participants who meet the following criteria will be considered eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Has hepatic cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;

             of screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As infection is a common feature of AML, participants with active infection are&#xD;
             permitted to enroll provided that the infection is under control and no signs of&#xD;
             systemic inflammatory response beyond low grade fever that makes participant&#xD;
             clinically unstable in the opinion of the investigator. Participants with uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection shall not be enrolled until infection is treated and brought under control.&#xD;
