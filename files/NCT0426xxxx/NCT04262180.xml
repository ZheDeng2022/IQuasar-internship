  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 3,000,000 breast and 760,000 endometrial cancer survivors in the US and these&#xD;
      populations will grow 30% by 2026. Increased moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity&#xD;
      (MVPA) is consistently associated with enhanced quality of life, reduced chronic disease&#xD;
      risk, and improved cancer prognosis in these survivors yet 70-90% fail to engage in the 150&#xD;
      minutes/week of MVPA recommended by the American Cancer Society. Unfortunately, since&#xD;
      physical activity support is not a part of standard survivorship care, few survivors have&#xD;
      access to efficacious MVPA interventions. A key barrier to translation of MVPA promotion into&#xD;
      care is the design of existing programs, which are resource-intensive, costly, and deliver&#xD;
      multiple components (i.e., coaching calls, supervised exercise) simultaneously to all&#xD;
      participants. This &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach does not account for individual needs, nor&#xD;
      can it realistically be implemented into care. Thus there is a critical need for effective,&#xD;
      scalable interventions that efficiently allocate resources to meet each woman's needs.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An adaptive approach that tries minimal, low resource treatments (i.e., technology tools) for&#xD;
      everyone first, and reserves the use of higher-resource components (e.g., coaching) for&#xD;
      survivors who fail to increase MVPA, offers a promising alternative to traditional&#xD;
      approaches. This engages women who lack the time or transportation to participate in more&#xD;
      intensive interventions, yet avoids providing high-resource components to those who would&#xD;
      respond well to a lower-dose intervention. Our success with integrating Fitbit MVPA data into&#xD;
      the electronic health record (EHR) with the capability to provide weekly progress feedback to&#xD;
      participants via the EHR's patient portal represents a relatively low resource (vs. coaching&#xD;
      or supervised exercise) and potentially efficacious16-19 minimal intervention that could be&#xD;
      augmented as needed. Placement of the intervention within the EHR is a major advance because&#xD;
      it communicates that MVPA is central to survivors' health and is a priority of the cancer&#xD;
      care team. Clinicians can be engaged to ensure the intervention is viewed as integral to&#xD;
      survivorship care with minimal burden by referring patients to an EHR-based intervention,&#xD;
      endorsing intervention messages delivered via the EHR and reviewing a patient's progress at&#xD;
      their clinic visits using simple EHR alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the Fitbit plus EHR integration (Fitbit+EHR) minimal intervention will be sufficient&#xD;
      for some survivors to increase their MVPA, others will need more support. Little data exists&#xD;
      to determine what strategies would be most effective for augmenting a minimal intervention.&#xD;
      Further, it is unknown how long the minimal intervention should be continued before&#xD;
      augmentations are used. Some survivors may need more support early on, while others may&#xD;
      initially succeed but later fail as the weekly MVPA goal increases. Still others may falter&#xD;
      initially and recover. Thus, this project uses an innovative adaptive experimental approach,&#xD;
      to determine the optimal augmentation tactics to our minimal (Fitbit+EHR) MVPA intervention&#xD;
      in inactive breast and endometrial cancer survivors (n=320). All women will receive the&#xD;
      Fitbit+EHR intervention. Those who do not respond (meet ≤80% of MVPA goal over previous 4&#xD;
      weeks) will be randomized to one of two more intensive augmentation tactics using technology,&#xD;
      alone, or in combination with a more traditional component: (1) online gym with access to&#xD;
      exercise videos or (2) coaching calls. Participants in the minimal intervention will be&#xD;
      evaluated for non-response every 4 weeks so augmentation is delivered when they lapse.&#xD;
      Responders will continue with the minimal intervention. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      accelerometer-measured weekly minutes of MVPA at 6 months. The investigator will also examine&#xD;
      the effects of the intervention sequences on symptom burden and functional performance,&#xD;
      important indicators of morbidity in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first systematic effort to develop an adaptive MVPA intervention in any cancer&#xD;
      population. Knowledge gained from this study will inform the development of effective,&#xD;
      scalable clinic-based interventions to improve quality of life and reduce disease burden&#xD;
      among breast and endometrial cancer survivors.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will complete the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPB), a well-validated physical function performance measure. This battery assesses lower extremity function in adults.&#xD;
The SPB score is based on timed measures of gait speed, ability to rise from a chair, and standing balance. Gait speed will be measured using the better of two recorded times over a 4-meter course. Chair stand time will be measured as the time needed to rise five times from a seated position in a chair, with arms folded across the chest. For the balance test, participants will be asked to maintain their feet side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem positions for 10 seconds each. Each individual performance measure will be scored according to established cutpoints and aggregated for a total SPB score.&#xD;
Total SPB score range: 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance).</description>
