      This study is designed to determine the effect of treating postmenopausal women with low BMD&#xD;
      and using non-surgical techniques on biomarkers of systemic inflammation (IL-6 and TNF-α) and&#xD;
      systemic bone resorption (C-terminal collagen cross-links, CTX).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of tooth supporting tissues that is characterized by&#xD;
      progressive loss of bone and periodontal attachment and which ultimately leads to tooth loss&#xD;
      if left untreated. It is a widespread condition which affects 30% of the adult population.&#xD;
      The prevalence increases to greater than 47% among adults age 30 years or older, with those&#xD;
      over 65 years old accounting for most cases Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low&#xD;
      bone mineral density(BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, which leads to&#xD;
      increased risk of fragility fractures. It has been reported that one out of two Indian&#xD;
      females above the age of 50 years and one out of five Indian men above the age of 65 years&#xD;
      are at risk of osteoporosis. It is apparent that both periodontitis and osteoporosis are&#xD;
      chronic conditions characterized by resorptive osseous changes with multiple shared risk&#xD;
      factors including age, genetics, hormonal change, smoking , as well as calcium and vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency. It has been proposed that the two diseases could also have a mutual relation and&#xD;
      this has led to a considerable number of studies investigating the same .Both osteoporosis&#xD;
      and periodontitis are more prevalent among elderly population. The number of patients who&#xD;
      suffer from both periodontitis and osteoporosis is expected to rise as the average lifespan&#xD;
      increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty percent of individuals with osteoporosis are women, largely due to the marked loss in&#xD;
      bone density associated with the withdrawal of estrogen that accompanies loss of ovarian&#xD;
      function at menopause. There is now strong evidence to suggest that systemic pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines in response to estrogen withdrawal at menopause is responsible for increased&#xD;
      osteoclastic activity.Systemic Inflammation results in an uncoupling between bone resorption&#xD;
      and formation and favours excessive bone resorption resulting in decreased bone mineral&#xD;
      density and increased fracture risk in postmenopausal women. Pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      capable of stimulating osteoclastic bone resorption include IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6,IL-11, IL-15&#xD;
      and IL-17. It has been demonstrated that while periodontitis is a local infectious disease of&#xD;
      tooth supporting structures, it is also associated with higher inflammatory mediators in the&#xD;
      systemic circulation. The data suggest that an individual's overall bone metabolism might be&#xD;
      associated with periodontal disease and be reflective of its progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of bone turnover markers (BTM) reflect the activity and number of bone forming&#xD;
      (osteoblasts) and bone-degrading (osteoclasts) cells, providing an estimate of bone&#xD;
      resorption and bone formation. BTM can be measured non-invasively in either blood or urine at&#xD;
      a fairly low cost. C-terminal collagen cross-links,CTX, is a bone resorption marker which&#xD;
      consists of cross-linked telopeptides from collagen which are released during enzymatic&#xD;
      degradation of bone matrix by the osteoclasts Scaling and root planing (SRP) is the most&#xD;
      accepted treatment for managing chronic periodontitis and is proven to be effective at&#xD;
      controlling local inflammation. Recent research has found evidence that levels of systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory markers including IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 are also reduced after SRP. Therefore,&#xD;
      treatment of periodontal disease results in reduced systemic inflammation but it is unknown&#xD;
      if this translates to better outcomes for management of osteoporosis. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      if periodontitis has an influence on bone remodeling, then levels of BTM would also vary with&#xD;
      decrease in systemic inflammation owing to resolution of periodontal inflammation following&#xD;
      non-surgical periodontal treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of&#xD;
      treating periodontal disease in patients with osteoporosis with scaling and root planing on&#xD;
      biomarkers of systemic inflammation (IL-6 and TNF-α) and systemic bone turnover (CTX). It is&#xD;
      anticipated that the results of this study could be useful in formulating recommendations for&#xD;
      interdisciplinary management of patients of concomitant periodontitis and osteoporosis.&#xD;

      MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN SETTING: The present prospective interventional study will be conducted in&#xD;
      department of Periodontology , Post Graduate institute Dental Sciences,Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PERIOD: 14 months STUDY POPULATION : Patients will be recruited from out patient&#xD;
      department of Periodontology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY The study will be conducted as follows .&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD OF RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-menopausal females with low BMD and diagnosed with stage 2 and stage 3 periodontitis&#xD;
      will be recruited from the outpatient department of Periodontology. Only those patients who&#xD;
      consent for the study will be included after obtaining an informed written consent. Dual&#xD;
      Energy X-ray Absorptiometry scan will be done for screening patients with low bone mineral&#xD;
      density . Those who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Clinical&#xD;
      periodontal parameters (CAL, PD and BOP) will be recorded and venous blood samples for&#xD;
      measuring serum levels of IL-6 ,TNF-α and sCTX will be collected. Scaling and root planing&#xD;
      will be performed in all cases. All patients will be re-evaluated after 8 weeks for recording&#xD;
      clinical periodontal parameters and serum inflammatory and bone resorption markers as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION Full mouth scaling and root planing (SRP) will be performed for all participants&#xD;
      with both ultrasonic instruments and manual instrumentation using scalers and curettes. All&#xD;
      patients will be given instructions for maintaining proper oral hygiene using soft toothbrush&#xD;
      and fluoridated toothpaste. No mouthwashes will be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS All participants will be evaluated for clinical periodontal&#xD;
      parameters (PD, CAL and BOP) at 6 weeks after completion of SRP. Serum inflammatory (IL-6,&#xD;
      TNF-α) and bone resorption markers (CTX) will be evaluated only for those participants in&#xD;
      whom &lt;10 % bleeding sites .&#xD;
&#xD;
      BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) BMI=Weight(kg)/Height²(m²)&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS Venous blood from the anticubital vein will be collected after&#xD;
      overnight fasting after applying a tourniquet in a plain vacutainer tube without additive.&#xD;
      Immediately after collection of blood samples,the samples will be centrifuged, and separated&#xD;
      serum and plasma will be stored at -20̊ c until processed. The level of following biomarkers&#xD;
      will be evaluated using ELISA kits- IL-6,TNF-α,CTX All the blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      the baseline and 8 weeks following SRP.&#xD;
