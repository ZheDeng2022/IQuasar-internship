  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to learn how quickly patients suffering from allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      (also known as hay fever) can expect symptom relief after using Azelastine Hydrochloride&#xD;
      0.15% Nasal Spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enrol about 80 male or female participants in the age of 18 to 65 years&#xD;
      suffering from an allergic rhinitis to ragweed pollen for at least 2 years. In a first phase&#xD;
      participants will be exposed to ragweed pollen in a special study room to ensure they will be&#xD;
      adequately symptomatic when they progress into the treatment phase of the study. In a second&#xD;
      phase study participants will be divided in 2 groups. After exposure to ragweed pollen one&#xD;
      group will receive Azelastine Hydrochloride 0.15% Nasal Spray and the other group will&#xD;
      receive placebo (a nasal spray which does not contain any active drug substance). In the&#xD;
      third phase of study the treatment will be switched: participants who received in the&#xD;
      previous study Azelastine Hydrochloride 0.15% Nasal Spray will receive the nasal spray&#xD;
      without any active drug substance and the other group will receive Azelastine Hydrochloride&#xD;
      0.15% Nasal Spray. During the second and third study phase the researchers will examine&#xD;
      thoroughly over 4 hours the change of nasal symptoms such as runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing&#xD;
      and nasal congestion after participants received the nasal spray.&#xD;
