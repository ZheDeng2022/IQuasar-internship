    <textblock>
      A technic of tracheal, carinal or bronchial transplantation using a stented cryopreserved&#xD;
      aortic has been implemented by Pr E. Martinod in his thoracic surgery dept. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to analyze the records of all the patients who have benefited from this&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the context of end-stage tracheobronchial disease (in particular tracheal or carinal&#xD;
      indication) this technic propose a therapeutic alternative, in the context of bronchial&#xD;
      replacement it allows to avoid pneumonectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages are to reduce mortality at 90 days, functional consequences and long-term&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observationnel study, data were collected prospectively in the medical records of all&#xD;
      patients who have undergone a trachea or artificial bronchus transplant.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Tracheal, carinal or bronchial transplantation using a stented cryopreserved aortic</intervention_name>
    <description>Radical resection of the lesions was performed using standard surgical techniques. After resection, airway reconstruction was performed using a human cryopreserved (-80°C) aortic allograft, which was not matched by the ABO and leukocyte antigen systems. To prevent airway collapse, a custom-made stent was inserted into the allograft. In patients with proximal lung tumors, the lung-sparing intervention of bronchial transplantation was used.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:Eligible patients were treated by human cryopreserved (-80°C) aortic&#xD;
        allograft after undergoing a standard preoperative evaluation and cardiopulmonary tests. A&#xD;
        multidisciplinary team approve d the treatment based on the following criteria: Patients&#xD;
        (1) had proximal lung tumors requiring a surgical resection (pneumonectomy, carinal&#xD;
        resection, or sleeve lobectomy) that may or may not have been treated with neoadjuvant&#xD;
        chemotherapy and had adequate or compromised preoperative lung function tests; or (2) had&#xD;
        significant major malignant or benign lesions of the trachea and bronchi untreated with&#xD;
        conventional therapeutic approaches, and (3) have signed an informed consent form for this&#xD;
        specific surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Patients were not treated by human cryopreserved (-80°C) aortic&#xD;
        allograft if they :&#xD;
&#xD;
        (1) had a lung tumor requiring a standard lobectomy; (2) had nonresectable major locally&#xD;
        invasive tumors; (3) had contralateral lymph node invasion; (4) had metastatic disease with&#xD;
        the exception of a unique resectable brain metastasis; (5) had tracheal lesions requiring&#xD;
        standard resection with direct anastomosis; (6) had an iodine allergy; or (7) received a&#xD;
        preoperative evaluation indicating an inability to undergo a standard lobectomy.&#xD;
