      Impact of Rapid ART Initiation on Retention in Care in the Southern US&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Goals and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major goal for this study is to determine if rapid start of antiretroviral (ART) therapy&#xD;
      increases retention in HIV medical care. The investigators hypothesize that there will be an&#xD;
      increase in retention in care with rapid start, by removing barriers that would normally&#xD;
      delay enrollment in a treatment program and enforce the importance of linkage to care and ART&#xD;
      initiation from diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this hypothesis, the investigators have the following specific aims for&#xD;
      their proposed study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study retention in care after rapid ART start in comparison to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze risk factors for decreased retention in care, with focus on high-risk&#xD;
           populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze potential demographic and geographic determinants of retention in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Generate retention in care data in a Southern US state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize the introduction of rapid start ART, as well as the&#xD;
      introduction of care navigators, will lead to improved clinical outcomes, including retention&#xD;
      in care at one year, viral suppression at one year, time to viral suppression, and time to&#xD;
      first missed appointment. In the event rapid start ART fails to have a positive impact on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, the results of this study will still positively contribute to the&#xD;
      knowledge gap, since there is a scarcity of data in the Southern United States, specifically&#xD;
      in high-risk populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities, youth, and patients&#xD;
      co-infected with hepatitis C.&#xD;
