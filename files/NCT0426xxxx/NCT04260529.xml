    <textblock>
      This Phase I/IIa trial is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of CyPep-1 when administered directly into malignant tumors in monotherapy&#xD;
      and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. Additionally, the trial will&#xD;
      monitor anti-tumor effects on both injected lesions and distant non-injected deposits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment with immune modulating agents may result in long lasting anti-tumor responses in&#xD;
      patients with cancer. However, only a subset of patients obtains durable remission. Treatment&#xD;
      strategies that aim at recruiting tumor antagonizing cellular components of the immune system&#xD;
      holds great promise. CyPep-1 is a chemically synthesized peptide with oncolytic properties.&#xD;
      It selectively targets cancer cells based on their altered molecular composition, and removes&#xD;
      the surrounding cell membrane. This releases tumor neoantigens to the microenvironment and&#xD;
      potentially induces an anti-tumour immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies showing that CyPep-1 can synergize with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in&#xD;
      terms of decreased tumor volumes and prolonged survival highlight the possible clinical&#xD;
      utility of CyPep-1 in the combination setting with ICIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/IIa, open label trial, with a dose escalation phase to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of CyPep-1 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, to identify&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose, followed by a dose expansion phase in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. The trial consists of two phases and multiple arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are preliminary anti-tumor efficacy and to assess the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of CyPep-1 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. As part of the&#xD;
      exploratory analysis, it is planned to determine local and systemic immunological effects&#xD;
      after CyPep-1 administration, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
