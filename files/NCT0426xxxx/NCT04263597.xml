  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dose chemotherapy and radiation used as preparative regimens in patients undergoing an&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) disrupts intestinal homeostasis by&#xD;
      damaging the intestinal epithelium and altering the intestinal microbiome. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that 2'-fucosyllactose (2FL) supplementation will be safe and tolerable and&#xD;
      result in an increase in the relative abundance of intestinal Bifidobacteria. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that 2FL supplementation will lead to reduction of Firmicutes&#xD;
      and/or Proteobacteria, and improved intestinal homeostasis at day+30 as measured by lower&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced levels of T-cell activation, lower markers of intestinal&#xD;
      injury (fecal human DNA and plasma reg-3-alpha), increased fecal butyrate levels and&#xD;
      ultimately lower incidence of acute GVHD and BSI at day+100.&#xD;

      This phase I/IIa study is a single center prospective study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Medical Center (CCHMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of various doses of 2FL. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be allocated to the following arms as determined by age at enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: 0-5 years; Arm 2: 5.1-10 years; Arm 3: &gt;10 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 5 patients of ages ≥10 years undergoing allogeneic HSCT. 2'-FL&#xD;
      will be administered to these patients from day-7 until day+30 after HSCT at the starting&#xD;
      dose. Once safety is determined the investigators will then enroll an additional 5 patients&#xD;
      of ages 5-10 years and administer 2'FL to these patients at the proposed dose for this age&#xD;
      group from day-7 to day+30 after HSCT. Once safety is determined, the investigators will&#xD;
      enroll 5 patients of ages 0-5 years and administer 2'FL at starting doses to children from&#xD;
      day-7 to day+30 after HSCT. Once safety is established in these patients we will proceed with&#xD;
      the randomized portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in each arm and randomized 1:1 to either receive 2FL or placebo (2&#xD;
      g oral glucose). After 20 patients are enrolled at the first dose level for an arm,&#xD;
      enrollment of that arm will be paused and all patients will be evaluated for safety and&#xD;
      tolerability. The randomization for the 20 patients will be unblinded and the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of 2FL doses will be compared to placebo for that arm. If 6/10 patients can take&#xD;
      80% of their planned doses, that dose level will be determined as tolerable and a dose&#xD;
      escalation will be performed. If 5/10 patients are unable to take at least 80% of planned&#xD;
      doses the dose will be determined to not be well tolerated and a dose de-escalation will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
