        Clinical Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject must voluntarily sign and date the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to&#xD;
             collection of study data or performance of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must be either a male or non-pregnant female ≥ 21 years of age with an&#xD;
             expected lifespan sufficient to allow for completion of all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must be willing to comply with the protocol requirements, including clinical&#xD;
             and telephone follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject must have an upper extremity AV fistula that has undergone at least one&#xD;
             successful dialysis session with two-needle cannulation, prior to the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject must have angiographic evidence of a stenosis ≥ 50% (by visual estimation)&#xD;
             located in the venous outflow of the AV access circuit and present with clinical or&#xD;
             hemodynamic evidence of AV fistula dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The target lesion must be ≤ 9cm in length. Note: multiple stenoses may exist within&#xD;
             the target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The reference vessel diameter of the adjacent non-stenotic vein must be between 5.0&#xD;
             and 9.0mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is dialyzing with an AV graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The target lesion has had a corresponding thrombosis treated within 7 days prior to&#xD;
             the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The hemodialysis access is located in the lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has an infected AV fistula or uncontrolled systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has a known uncontrolled blood coagulation/bleeding disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to contrast media which cannot be&#xD;
             adequately pre-medicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to nickel-titanium (Nitinol) or tantalum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may cause him/her to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data&#xD;
             interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the&#xD;
             completion of study procedures and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device&#xD;
             study that has not completed the study treatment or that clinically interferes with&#xD;
             the study endpoints. Note: Studies requiring extended follow-up visits for products&#xD;
             that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not&#xD;
             considered investigational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Additional stenotic lesions (≥ 50%) in the venous outflow that are &gt; 3cm from the edge&#xD;
             of the target lesion and are not successfully treated (defined as ≤ 30% residual&#xD;
             stenosis) prior to treating the target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. An aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm is present within the target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The location of the target lesion would require the COVERATM Vascular Covered Stent be&#xD;
             deployed across the elbow joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The target lesion is located within a stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The location of the target lesion would require that the COVERATM Vascular Covered&#xD;
             Stent be deployed at or across the segment of fistula utilized for dialysis needle&#xD;
             puncture (i.e., &quot;cannulation zone&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The location of the target lesion would require that the COVERATM Vascular Covered&#xD;
             Stent be placed in the central veins (subclavian, brachiocephalic, Superior Vena Cava&#xD;
             (SVC)) or under the clavicle at the thoracic outlet.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. There is incomplete expansion of an appropriately sized angioplasty balloon to its&#xD;
             expected profile, in the operator's judgment, during primary angioplasty at the target&#xD;
             lesion.&#xD;
