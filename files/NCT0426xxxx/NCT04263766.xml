  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the causal role of&#xD;
      different brain regions during visual perception. TMS is a well-established technique used by&#xD;
      hundreds of labs in the world. The risks associated with the technique are well understood&#xD;
      and can be minimized by strict adherence to established safety guidelines. In the proposed&#xD;
      study, the investigators will use TMS to specifically address the topic of how metacognitive&#xD;
      evaluation is supported by the two prefrontal areas: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC) and the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). The data will be collected from healthy&#xD;
      adults and will ultimately deepen the investigator's understanding of the mechanisms behind&#xD;
      the normal processes related to confidence generation and metacognition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a task on visual perception and receive TMS in order to assess&#xD;
      which regions of the brain are important for confidence generation in perceptual tasks. The&#xD;
      task will involve judging the identity of visual stimuli (oriented black-and-white gratings)&#xD;
      and providing a confidence rating on the judgment that they performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will deliver TMS to several brain regions such as the anterior prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (aPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and a control site. The researchers&#xD;
      will then investigate participants' accuracy and confidence levels depending on where TMS was&#xD;
      delivered. The researchers expect that aPFC TMS will decrease the metacognitive sensitivity&#xD;
      of the participants, whereas DLPFC TMS will decrease their average confidence level. TMS will&#xD;
      be delivered time locked to the onset of the stimulus and the researchers will investigate&#xD;
      what is the critical period of involvement of a given region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMS protocol is well within the established safety limits. Participants will be required&#xD;
      to fill out screening and demographic forms delivered at the Center for Advanced Brain&#xD;
      Imaging (CABI). In order to dose appropriately the TMS stimulation, it is necessary to&#xD;
      perform motor threshold determination. Motor threshold (MT) is defined as the minimum&#xD;
      magnetic flux needed to elicit a visual hand twitch (in the contralateral first dorsal&#xD;
      interosseus muscle). MT is the standard in the field for determining the intensity of TMS for&#xD;
      each individual to reduce seizure risk. The scalp region producing the largest hand twitch&#xD;
      will be identified. At that scalp location, the lowest TMS intensity able to elicit 5 visible&#xD;
      twitches in 10 trials at this site will be determined. Individual MT will be used to&#xD;
      determine the intensity of stimulation for each individual, as recommended by safety&#xD;
      guidelines. This procedure usually takes about 5 minutes and also serves the purpose of&#xD;
      acquainting participants to TMS stimulation. In this study, the researchers will use&#xD;
      intensities between 100 and 120% of MT, even though the safety guidelines allow for&#xD;
      stimulation intensities of at least 130% of MT.&#xD;
