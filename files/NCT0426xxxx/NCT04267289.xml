      Depression is one of the most common and debilitating conditions among older adults. At-home&#xD;
      seniors, also called homebound seniors, are older adults who are confined to a bed or chair&#xD;
      and are unable to get about outdoors. Internet-based CBT (iCBT) delivers CBT via websites or&#xD;
      dedicated apps on mobile devices or tablets. iCBT can be self-administered or guided by a&#xD;
      therapist. Its strengths include low-cost, accessibility, and ability to tailor to individual&#xD;
      needs while maintaining fidelity. Despite its potential, iCBT trials have rarely included&#xD;
      older adults. Those that included older adults showed that they tended to report more&#xD;
      technological challenges but they benefited from the intervention as much as younger adults&#xD;
      did. As far as we know, studies have not yet tested the feasibility and preliminary effects&#xD;
      of iCBT with a diverse group of at-home seniors receiving non-skilled home care. This study&#xD;
      explores the feasibility and acceptability of delivering iCBT to a sample of at-home seniors&#xD;
      who receive non-skilled home care. Home care workers who care for these seniors are recruited&#xD;
      to provide assistance for completing iCBT. We hypothesize that iCBT is an acceptable and&#xD;
      feasible intervention for treating depression among at-home seniors.&#xD;

      Depression is one of the most common and debilitating conditions among older adults. At-home&#xD;
      seniors, also called homebound seniors, are older adults who are confined to a bed or chair&#xD;
      and are unable to get about outdoors. Medical morbidity, disability, cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      pain, and social isolation are known risk factors for depression that are prevalent among&#xD;
      at-home seniors. Epidemiological and community-based studies have consistently documented a&#xD;
      high prevalence of depression among at-home seniors. However, depression treatment is often&#xD;
      inaccessible to at-home seniors. The majority of at-home seniors with depression do not&#xD;
      receive adequate treatment, with the dominant treatment modality being medication.&#xD;
      Successfully treating late-life depression requires a multi-component treatment program&#xD;
      beyond medication. Besides, medication non-adherence is common due to concerns of side&#xD;
      effects and preferences for other treatment modalities such as counseling. However,&#xD;
      office-based psychotherapy is out of reach for at-home seniors who often require assistance&#xD;
      for transportation. In addition, older adults prefer home-based treatment and counseling, and&#xD;
      consideration of their preference may lead to better treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online therapy (iCBT) is an evidence-based approach for treating depression.&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the gold standard of psychotherapy for depression in&#xD;
      both young and older adults. Internet-based CBT (iCBT) delivers CBT via d websites or&#xD;
      dedicated apps on mobile devices or tablets. iCBT can be self-administered or guided by a&#xD;
      therapist. Its strengths include low-cost, accessibility, and ability to tailor to individual&#xD;
      needs while maintaining fidelity. Meta-analyses have shown that iCBT is equivalent to&#xD;
      face-to-face CBT in its effectiveness for treating depression. Emerging evidence suggests&#xD;
      that iCBT may actually be more effective for older adults, because they are more likely to&#xD;
      adhere to treatment than their younger counterparts. Despite the benefits of iCBT, most older&#xD;
      adults do not use iCBT, possibly due to limited opportunities accessing iCBT programs and&#xD;
      technological challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project explores the feasibility of implementing iCBT in non-skilled home care. Home&#xD;
      care workers provide personal care and companionship to older adults in need of assistance&#xD;
      with daily activities, housekeeping, medication management, and transportation. Home care is&#xD;
      provided full-time, part-time, intermittently, or even around the clock to address the&#xD;
      recipient's long-term care needs. Home-based care provides a naturalized and accessible&#xD;
      setting, and frequent home visits over an extended period offer opportunities for prolonged&#xD;
      engagement and symptom monitoring. Research shows that iCBT programs with human support are&#xD;
      more effective than self-guided programs. For at-home seniors, home care workers represent an&#xD;
      untapped resource of human support and can be trained to provide technical assistance for&#xD;
      at-home seniors with limited computer literacy, addressing technological challenges&#xD;
      associated with iCBT use. Moreover, home care workers can facilitate the completion of&#xD;
      behavioral activation activities (e.g., drive a client to attend a social activity), which is&#xD;
      critical in realizing the effectiveness of CBT. In addition, participation in training and&#xD;
      intervention may also benefit the home care workers themselves by improving job satisfaction,&#xD;
      pride, and retention. However, Studies have not tested iCBT with at-home seniors receiving&#xD;
      home care. Protocols for implementing iCBT in home care also do not exist. Issues regarding&#xD;
      screening, supervision, and referrals need to be addressed and standardized. In addition, we&#xD;
      need to develop strategies to address implementation barriers at the patient, provider, and&#xD;
      organization levels to achieve sustained impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot feasibility study is a pragmatic trial of iCBT among a sample of diverse at-home&#xD;
      seniors receiving non-skilled home care. Guided by the Replicating Effective Programs&#xD;
      framework, this study aims to develop materials to package an existing, evidence-based iCBT&#xD;
      program called Beating the Blues for testing in a sample of at-home seniors receiving home&#xD;
      care. The primary aim of the study is to test whether iCBT is an acceptable treatment&#xD;
      modality for at-home seniors with varying levels of technology competency. An exploratory aim&#xD;
      is to examine whether it is feasible to train home care workers to assist seniors with iCBT&#xD;
      completion. Findings from this pilot study will gather information regarding barriers to&#xD;
      implement iCBT in non-skilled home care at the provider- (home care workers) and the patient-&#xD;
      (at-home seniors) levels. If the results from this study are promising, subsequent efforts&#xD;
      will be devoted to address implementation barriers at the organizational (home care agencies)&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single-group open trial. Study materials (measurements, participant workbook)&#xD;
      will be piloted tested with 2 subjects, who will not participate in the full trial. The&#xD;
      targeted sample size for the full trial is 28. A sample size of 23 provides a power of 0.95&#xD;
      to detect a significant effect size of d=.8 from paired-sample t-test (G*Power, 3.1 version).&#xD;
      A proposed sample size of 28 therefore has sufficient power to detect the projected effect&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be recruited from home-care agencies, meals-on-wheels, and senior&#xD;
      apartment buildings in Ann Arbor and surrounding areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being screened and consented, subjects will receive a comprehensive baseline&#xD;
      assessment. Subjects have the choice of receiving assistance from their home care worker,&#xD;
      assistance from a member of the research team, or work on the iCBT program on their own. If&#xD;
      subjects prefer to work on the iCBT program with their home care workers, their workers will&#xD;
      also been consented and receive a training. After their workers finish the required training,&#xD;
      subjects will then start treatment. Research team will supply a tablet and prepaid data&#xD;
      packages to subjects if they don't have access to a working device or internet package.&#xD;
      Subjects are told that they have 3 months to use the online program. Subjects will receive a&#xD;
      comprehensive post-test assessment once they complete the entire program or at the end of the&#xD;
      3-month period, whichever occurs first. Subjects will also be asked to participate in a short&#xD;
      individual interview during post-test. All assessments with subjects will take place at their&#xD;
      home. The structured part of the comprehensive baseline and post-test includes three parts:&#xD;
      an online self-administered survey, a clinical interview, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      (MoCA) test for cognitive impairment using the MoCA app. In addition to these scheduled&#xD;
      assessments, Beating the Blues, the iCBT program used in the study, has built-in assessments&#xD;
      (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) at the start of session 1 and the end of session 3, 5, 7, &amp; 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey data will be recorded and managed using Qualtrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment analysis will involve an intention-to-treat design where missing data are&#xD;
      addressed by carrying forward data previously collected. Primary outcomes include Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, number of sessions completed, and&#xD;
      program satisfaction/acceptability. Difference in PHQ-9 between session 1 and post-test will&#xD;
      be calculated and tested. Session 1 PHQ-9 score will be used to assure consistency in time&#xD;
      lapsed up until post-test. Secondary outcomes include Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)&#xD;
      for anxiety and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for cognitive impairment. Difference in&#xD;
      GAD-7 between session 1 and post-test will be calculated and tested. Difference in MoCA score&#xD;
      between baseline and post-test will be tested. Paired-sample t-test will be used to detect&#xD;
      statistically significant difference. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) and 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      will be calculated. Statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata 15.1 SE version.&#xD;
