  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an ongoing debate whether antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers and/or&#xD;
      angiotensin converting Enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors comprises a risk factor for more severe and&#xD;
      more frequent side-effects during venom immunotherapy (VIT). In the literature, data are&#xD;
      controversial and originate from case reports or statistically underpowered studies; the&#xD;
      number of included patients was usually high but the proportion of patients on&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment was low ranging from 2-11%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted as a prospective, observational, European multicenter study. 1425&#xD;
      patients, aged from 35 to 85 years, with a history of an anaphylactic reaction due to bee or&#xD;
      wasp stings, were included. The medical history was recorded as well as laboratory parameters&#xD;
      and data of the VIT-updosing phase. One year after reaching the maintenance dose, possible&#xD;
      side-effects during VIT as well as the outcome of field stings or sting challenges were&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;

All data concerning the index sting, laboratory parameters like immunoglobulin E (IgE) and tryptase levels and skin test results will be recorded as well as the concomitant diseases and medication. Visit 2 will be performed after VIT updosing is finished. At this Visit data concerning the immunotherapy - premedication, preparation, updosing protocol, the outcome of possible large, local reactions (LLR) and systemic reactions (SR) and changes in diseases and medication will be recorded. One year after reaching the maintenance dose, Visit 3 will be performed. At this Visit data concerning the maintenance phase like premedication and possible side effects will be recorded as well as the outcome of insect stings.</description>

A Ï‡2 test with a two-sided 5% significance level has an 80% power to detect the difference between the group without antihypertensive medication with 6% SR during VIT and the group on Î²-blockers and/or ACEI with 12.3% SR during VIT (OR = 2.2) when the sample sizes are 631 and 200, respectively.
