      A Phase 1, open label clinical study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Protein 013 (FMP013) combined with (ALF with&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label immunization with Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) study.&#xD;
      Healthy, malaria-naïve adults, aged 18-55 years old will be recruited into one of 5&#xD;
      experimental cohorts in 2 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, 2 experimental cohorts of 5 subjects each will receive a series of 3 vaccinations&#xD;
      at 0, 1, and 2 months at 2 doses (the &quot;low dose&quot; arm and the &quot;high dose&quot; arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, 3 experimental cohorts of 10 subjects will receive a series of 3 vaccinations at&#xD;
      0, 1, 6 months (called the &quot;delayed dose&quot; arm), the &quot;delayed fractional dose&quot; arm is&#xD;
      vaccinated at 0, 1, and 6 months with the 6 month dose being 1/5 the other doses, and the&#xD;
      &quot;standard&quot; arm&quot; at the 4th, 5th, and 6th month (after the first 2 vaccinations of the other 2&#xD;
      arms in Part B).&#xD;

                  [spontaneous] amenorrhea) or hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal&#xD;
                  ligation;&#xD;
&#xD;

                  or post-last vaccination (whichever is latest), using one of the following&#xD;
                  methods: condoms (male or female) with spermicide; diaphragm, or cervical cap&#xD;
                  with spermicide; intrauterine device; contraceptive pills, patch, injection,&#xD;

                  previously undergone a vasectomy; abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male subjects are encouraged but not required to practice highly effective&#xD;
             contraception to avoid pregnancy in their partner from 30 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
             through 60 days post-CHMI. This is due to the potential impact of malaria and&#xD;
             antimalarial medications on spermatogenesis.&#xD;

             rate, 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea does not completely preclude pregnancy and&#xD;
             can be a result of polycystic ovarian syndrome);&#xD;

             etc) during the period between CHMI and 28 days post-CHMI, per volunteer report;&#xD;

             discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;

             supervisor per WRAIR Policy 11-45;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Must have low (&lt; 10%) cardiac risk factors according to clinical Gaziano (NHANES I)&#xD;
             criteria assessed at screening, and a normal or normal variant ECG;&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Subject must provide 2 emergency contacts who will be made aware of the subject's&#xD;
             participation in this trial and the vital importance of being reached during the&#xD;
             challenge phase of the study. Both contacts must be verified by pone prior to subject&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Verification will be define as either speaking to the emergency contact over the phone,&#xD;
        hearing their name included in the voicemail response, or confirming the emergency contact&#xD;
        uses the number if a third party answers the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. History of malaria infection (any species) or residence in a malaria-endemic area for&#xD;
