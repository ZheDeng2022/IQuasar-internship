    <textblock>
      In this research, the main purpose is to determine the effects of Circuit Training consisting&#xD;
      of Structured Vestibular rehabilitation Program under the strict supervision of&#xD;
      Neuro-Therapist versus Medicines and General (simple) Rehabilitation (only Home-based) in&#xD;
      community-dwelling population of people diagnosed with Vestibular disorders. A booklet&#xD;
      consisting of general instructions, simple vestibular exercises which are to be made a part&#xD;
      of daily routine, specific diet plan and specific precautions to be taken by patients&#xD;
      reporting with vertigo, oscillopsia and dizziness will also be provided to all the patients.&#xD;
      This is a community service addition, added so that everyone in the society can have easy&#xD;
      access to the instructions, will be cost effective, and will reduce their visits to the&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People diagnosed with vestibular disorders often experience dizziness , oscillopsia, trouble&#xD;
      with vision, balance or mobility. The vestibular disorders that are called unilateral and&#xD;
      peripheral (UPVD) are those that affect one side of the vestibular system (unilateral)and&#xD;
      (BPVD) are those affect both sides of the vestibular system (bilateral) and only the portion&#xD;
      of the system that is outside of the brain (peripheral-part of the inner ear). Examples of&#xD;
      these disorders include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis,&#xD;
      labyrinthitis, one-sided Ménière's disease or vestibular problems following surgical&#xD;
      procedures such as labyrinthectomy or removal of an acoustic neuroma. Vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation for these disorders is becoming increasingly used and involves various&#xD;
      movement-based regimes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dizziness, oscillopsia and disequilibrium are common complaints reported by adults during&#xD;
      visits to their doctor. Dizziness, oscillopsia, vertigo and disequilibrium are not a&#xD;
      disease-they are symptoms that can result from a vestibular disorder or from difficulties&#xD;
      unrelated to the inner ear, such as cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, vision, or&#xD;
      psychological disorders. However, as many as 45% of people with dizziness symptoms have&#xD;
      problems in the vestibular system (balance organs of the inner ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is an exercise-based program for reducing the&#xD;
      symptoms of vertigo, dizziness, oscillopsia and disequilibrium with vestibular pathology&#xD;
      (disease or disorder). A common neuro-otological approach for managing such symptoms is to&#xD;
      prescribe medication that suppresses vestibular function. However, in the long term, such&#xD;
      suppressants can interfere with a person's ability to make necessary adaptations. In&#xD;
      addition, many of these medications cause drowsiness that may limit a person's ability to be&#xD;
      active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular habituation exercises have been recommended for these non-Ménière's patients.&#xD;
      Although the exercises are popular, there are only a few studies in patients with chronic&#xD;
      unilateral vestibular dysfunction. Those studies were performed with limited cases or with a&#xD;
      wide variety of diagnoses. Herdman et al.,in their review, stressed that studies were&#xD;
      retrospective, nonrandomized, consisting of groups that were not comparable, uncontrolled&#xD;
      studies and, although they offer interesting descriptions of the patient population, do not&#xD;
      provide the evidence necessary to justify the use of these exercises for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the previous study conducted a research in 2009 to find the Short-term effects of vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation in patients with chronic unilateral vestibular dysfunction, a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study. Their objective was to evaluate the short-term effects of vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation on a symptom, disability, balance, and postural stability in patients with&#xD;
      chronic unilateral vestibular dysfunction. Significant improvements were seen in symptom,&#xD;
      disability, balance, and postural stability in chronic unilateral vestibular dysfunction&#xD;
      after an exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in 2013 study was conducted on finding out the effects of Vestibular rehabilitation with&#xD;
      virtual reality in Meniere disease. Their aim was to verify the effect of a virtual&#xD;
      reality-based balance rehabilitation program for patients with Meniere disease. They&#xD;
      concluded that Virtual reality-based balance rehabilitation effectively improved dizziness,&#xD;
      quality of life, and limit of stability of patients with Meniere's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in 2006 a study was conducted to Compare between Oculomotor Rehabilitation and Vestibular&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation in Unilateral Peripheral Vestibular Deficit. The aim of their study&#xD;
      was to evaluate the effects of oculomotor rehabilitation (group 2) on static balance and a&#xD;
      dizziness handicap and to compare those with the effects to vestibular electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (group 1). Analysis of the equilibrium system subcomponents did not show any variation.&#xD;
      Oculomotor exercises, employed in most rehabilitative protocols and including head movements&#xD;
      to improve vestibular adaptation, have proved to reduce the perceived overall impairment and&#xD;
      postural sway in patients with recent unilateral vestibular disorders, even though the&#xD;
      disorders are not associated with head movements. Comparison of our two study groups did not&#xD;
      show any significant difference, revealing that both forms of therapy are effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in 2013, a study evaluated the feasibility of integrating vestibular rehabilitation and&#xD;
      cognitive behaviour therapy (VR-CBT) for people with persistent dizziness in primary care.&#xD;
      This was a prospective single-group pre- and post-test study. Participants reported that the&#xD;
      VR-CBT was relevant and led to an improvement in function.Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)&#xD;
      scores improved beyond a minimal important change in two out of five participants, and&#xD;
      preferred gait velocity increased beyond a minimal important change in two out of three&#xD;
      participants. The current tests and VR-CBT treatment protocols were feasible. Some changes&#xD;
      are suggested to optimize the protocols, before conducting a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up-till now a properly structured Circuit Training consisting of Vestibular Rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercises, in which each exercise is designed such that it specifically focus on each and&#xD;
      every symptom separately has not developed. So, in this research a Circuit Training&#xD;
      consisting of Vestibular exercises, each exercise included is focusing on a specific goal&#xD;
      separately&#xD;
