      The trial will use a two period acute double-blind cross-over design to compare the effects&#xD;
      of a serving of oatmeal containing high or low amounts of avenanthramides (AV) on&#xD;
      post-prandial blood glucose response in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial will follow a two period acute double-blind cross-over design. It will&#xD;
      take place at Richardson Centre for Functional Food and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN) at University&#xD;
      of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit healthy adult participants. Participants will consent to participate&#xD;
      in two acute feeding sessions. Participants will be randomized to either control (low&#xD;
      avenanthramides) then treatment (high avenanthramides) or treatment then control.&#xD;
      Participants will arrive at the study center fasted between 8 and 10:30 am on the session&#xD;
      days. They will be provided either the study treatment or control product based on&#xD;
      randomization sequence for their first study visit. Baseline blood glucose (0 min) will be&#xD;
      measured in duplicate via finger stick blood sample right before their first bite of the&#xD;
      treatment product, and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 mins after baseline. The timer will be&#xD;
      started when they take their first bite. During the second visit participant will consume the&#xD;
      other treatment based on the randomization (the oatmeal that they didn't receive in their&#xD;
      first visit and follow exactly the same procedure as the first visit). There will be a&#xD;
      minimum of 5 days between sessions. Female participants will be scheduled during the luteal&#xD;
      phase of their menstruation cycle. There will be a maximum of 8 weeks between the two&#xD;
      sessions, therefore, participants will finish the both sessions within an 8 week period.&#xD;
