  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with tandem occlusion or tandem lesion (TL), that is, stroke with an acute&#xD;
      intracranial anterior circulation occlusion and an ipsilateral cervical ICA (c-ICA)&#xD;
      high-grade stenosis or occlusion, constitute about 15-20% of patients undergoing endovascular&#xD;
      thrombectomy (EVT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the optimal treatment of acute stroke patients with TL remains uncertain, as&#xD;
      relatively few patients with TL were included in the major randomized controlled trials of&#xD;
      EVT and management of the c-ICA was generally not specified by protocol nor analyzed&#xD;
      post-hoc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent large multi-centre retrospective cases series suggest that acutely stented patients&#xD;
      may have more favorable outcomes than patients treated with angioplasty alone or those with&#xD;
      no acute ICA intervention, but high quality randomized trial data are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EASI-TOC, a phase 3, academic multi-centre, controlled trial (PROBE design) with embedded&#xD;
      pilot phase, will seek to determine if in patients undergoing acute intracranial thrombectomy&#xD;
      for anterior circulation stroke with concurrent ipsilateral symptomatic high-grade (≥70%)&#xD;
      atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the extracranial ICA, endovascular ICA&#xD;
      revascularization with stenting is superior to intracranial thrombectomy alone with regards&#xD;
      to functional outcome at 90 days. Patients will be randomized to Acute stenting or No acute&#xD;
      stenting (1:1 allocation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EASI-TOC is a phase III multi-centre, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint&#xD;
      (PROBE) controlled trial (1:1 allocation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will seek to determine if in patients undergoing acute intracranial thrombectomy&#xD;
      for anterior circulation stroke with concurrent ipsilateral symptomatic high-grade (≥70%)&#xD;
      atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the extracranial ICA, endovascular ICA&#xD;
      revascularization with stenting is superior to intracranial thrombectomy alone with regards&#xD;
      to functional outcome at 90 days (measured using the Modified Rankin Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EASI-TOC will be conducted at 8 high-volume comprehensive stroke centres in Canada with&#xD;
      planned expansion to 10-12 Canadian sites within 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      450 male and female adult (aged ≥ 18 years) patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized (1:1) to undergo acute ICA stenting during the thrombectomy&#xD;
      procedure (either before or after intracranial thrombectomy, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician) or to intracranial thrombectomy alone without ICA stenting. Deferred ICA&#xD;
      intervention is allowed, if indicated. Randomization will be centralized and web-based.&#xD;
      Stratification will be performed for use or not of IV alteplase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated acutely and followed up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis assumes a greater proportion of patients with 90-day mRS 0-2 in the&#xD;
      stenting group versus the no stenting group (55% versus 40%). Assuming a minimal clinically&#xD;
      important difference of 15 % between groups experiencing no crossover, a total of 173&#xD;
      patients per group would be sufficient to detect this difference, with a power of 80 % and a&#xD;
      significance level of 5 %. Taking into account a cross-over rate of 10% (5% in either&#xD;
      direction) and a loss to follow-up of 5 %, the total sample size will increase to 450&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will be by Intention-to-treat. Pre-specified as-treated and sex-specific&#xD;
      analyses will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from patients or their surrogate. Deferral of consent will&#xD;
      be allowed if permitted by local ethics committees.&#xD;

For patients having not been treated with IV thrombolysis, dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin 325mg PO or 650mg PR and Clopidogrel 300-600mg PO) is given immediately post-procedure.

    <ipd_description>Upon completion of the EASI-TOC Trial, a public use database will be prepared by stripping any and all personal identifiers. The public use database, consisting of several data files, should contain: (1) baseline and demographic characteristics; (2) outcomes assessments; (3) imaging data; (4) serious adverse events.&#xD;
These data files will be made available to researchers with validated requests only after all major manuscripts (including secondary analysis papers) of the Trial are accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.</ipd_description>
