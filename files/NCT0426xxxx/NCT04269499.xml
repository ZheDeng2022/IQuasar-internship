  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of MR imaged administration of holmium microspheres</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility is defined as successful treatment under MRI in at least 4 of 6 patients. Unsuccessful treatment is defined as having to abort the procedure for safety reasons, judged by the interventional radiologist, and having to complete the administration of microspheres under X-ray guidance as in normal practice. Possible reasons for this are uncertainty about the location of the catheter, or luxation of the catheter as a result of transport to the MRI scanner.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are followed up to 3 months after treatment, during which all adverse events are recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor/non-tumor ratio on MR based dosimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>MR based dosimetry is performed immediately after treatment, resulting in dose maps. The dose that the tumor received is divided over the dose that the rest of the liver received.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of dosimetry in Gray between MR based and SPECT based dose maps</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Voxel-based dosimetry will be performed, leading to dose-volume histograms with a dose value per voxel in Gray. Statistical testing will be done for differences between these data sets, i.e. the two different imaging modalities (MR based and SPECT based). It is expected that dose-volume histograms will be similar between the two modalities.</description>
