  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blood brain barrier (BBB) prevents some drugs from successfully reaching the target&#xD;
      source. Convection-Enhanced Delivery (CED) is a method of direct infusion of drugs under&#xD;
      controlled pressure to the tumor that may reduce systemic side effects of drugs in the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to find the maximum tolerated dose of MTX110 (a&#xD;
      water-soluble Panobinostat nanoparticle formulation) and Gadolinium that can be given safely&#xD;
      in children with newly diagnosed diffuse midline gliomas. All patients enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will receive infusion of MTX110 and Gadolinium delivered with a pump directly into the tumor&#xD;
      over 9-11 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), constitute 10% of all pediatric central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      tumors. Subjects with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) have a poor prognosis with a&#xD;
      median survival that is usually reported to be 9 months, and nearly 90% of children die&#xD;
      within 18 months from diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is radiation to the primary tumor&#xD;
      site. Surgical resection does not influence outcome and is often not feasible in this part of&#xD;
      the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many promising drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders have failed to attain&#xD;
      clinical success due to an intact blood brain barrier (BBB), limiting their access form the&#xD;
      systemic circulation into the brain. Systemic administration of high doses may increase&#xD;
      delivery to the brain, but this approach risks significant side effects and systemic&#xD;
      toxicities. Direct delivery of the drugs to the brain by injection into the parenchyma&#xD;
      bypasses the BBB, however, drug distribution form the site of injection tends to be limited.&#xD;
      The convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of drugs describes the infusion of drugs under&#xD;
      controlled pressure to the brain parenchyma via targeted microcatheter. This technique&#xD;
      facilitates and deliver higher drug concentrations in brain tissue or tumor. The BBB can now&#xD;
      operate to retain drug and to significantly reduce systemic side effects. In addition, the&#xD;
      fact that panobinostat seems to be most efficacious clinically available drug against DIPG&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
