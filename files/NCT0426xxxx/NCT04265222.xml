    <textblock>
      Accurate femoroplasty has been shown to be critical in achieving success following treatment&#xD;
      of femoroacetabular impingement (Matsuda, Schnieder, and Sehgal 2014; Mansor et al. 2018;&#xD;
      Larson et al. 2014). Nearly 75% of cases undergoing revision hip arthroscopy do so due to&#xD;
      residual femoroacetabular impingement (Ricciardi et al. 2014). Femoroplasty remains one of&#xD;
      the most challenging and time-consuming procedures in hip arthroscopy and methods to improve&#xD;
      accuracy and optimize time management are essential. The HipCheck system is a navigational&#xD;
      tool based on intraoperative fluoroscopy that aims at improving accuracy and efficiency of&#xD;
      femoroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to two-fold. (1) To prospectively compare surgical and (2)&#xD;
      radiographic outcomes of patients undergoing femoroplasty with guidance of Stryker's HipCheck&#xD;
      system to patients undergoing femoroplasty with conventional fluoroscopic methods.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare surgical and radiographic outcomes of&#xD;
      patients undergoing femoroplasty with guidance of Stryker's HipCheck system to patients&#xD;
      undergoing femoroplasty with conventional fluoroscopic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time from initiation to completion of femoroplasty Accuracy of femoroplasty as determined by:&#xD;
      alpha angle on Dunn view and AP view, femoral head offset, and area of over resection and&#xD;
      under resection Fluoroscopic exposure (microgray and seconds) Post-operative opioid&#xD;
      consumption/medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic design: Randomized Controlled Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 40 patients 20 patients will undergo femoroplasty with the conventional&#xD;
      technique 20 patients will undergo femoroplasty with the HipCheck system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate femoroplasty has been shown to be critical in achieving success following treatment&#xD;
      of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).1-3 Nearly 75% of cases undergoing revision hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy do so due to residual FAI. Matsuda et al. coined the term &quot;critical corner&quot; to&#xD;
      describe residual impingement not resected during routine anterolateral femoroplasty. These&#xD;
      residual cam lesions have been shown to lead to inferior outcomes and are commonly implicated&#xD;
      in revision hip arthroscopies. These studies and others contributed to the development of the&#xD;
      &quot;spherical femoroplasty&quot; as an attempt to minimize residual cam lesions while simultaneously,&#xD;
      avoiding over-resection. Femoroplasty remains one of the most challenging and time-consuming&#xD;
      procedures in hip arthroscopy and methods to improve accuracy and optimize time management&#xD;
      are essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Schema of Study Design Overview Patients will be randomly assigned to undergo&#xD;
      femoroplasty either with a conventional technique or a navigational method involving the&#xD;
      HipCheck system. Preoperatively, the patient will undergo a series of standard radiographs to&#xD;
      assess the degree of deformity. At this time, ROM will also be assessed. During surgery time&#xD;
      required for femoroplasty as well as total fluoroscopic exposure time, as well as total&#xD;
      exposure in microgray will be recorded. At 2 weeks postoperatively patient will undergo a&#xD;
      series of standard radiographs to assess accuracy of femoroplasty. Narcotic medication use,&#xD;
      pain levels and patient-reported outcome scores (PROs) will be assessed at 2 weeks, 3 months,&#xD;
      6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. A clinical exam will be performed postoperatively at&#xD;
      each visit, consisting of hip range of motion (internal/external rotation, flexion,&#xD;
      abduction, and adduction) with the patient in the supine position, impingement tests, and&#xD;
      gait. Radiographic measurements will be performed using the institutional PACS system as well&#xD;
      as ImageJ for surface area calculations. The patients as well as the clinician performing&#xD;
      postoperative radiographic calculations will be blinded to method of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is 1 year and 6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legal contract &amp; IRB review: 8 weeks Patients recruitment/procedure: 8 weeks Follow up&#xD;
      period: 1 year Manuscript writing/submission: 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources Research resources: Research data will be collected and recorded by study&#xD;
      personnel designated by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Operative A series of standard radiographs (Dunn, AP, False profile views) will be taken&#xD;
      to understand the severity of the cam-type impingement. A clinical exam including but not&#xD;
      limited to the following will be performed: gait (antalgic, Trendelenburg) hip range of&#xD;
      motion (internal/external rotation, flexion, abduction, and adduction) with the patient in&#xD;
      the supine position; anterior, posterior and lateral impingement tests; painful&#xD;
      internal/external snapping test, FABER's test, Modified Resisted Internal rotation test,&#xD;
      Ligamentum Teres test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative patient-reported outcome scores (PROs) and Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) will&#xD;
      be taken during screening. The PROs include: mHHS, modified Harris Hip Score; NAHS,&#xD;
      Nonarthritic Hip Score; iHOT-12, International Hip Outcome Tool; SF-12M, Short Form 12&#xD;
      Mental; SF-12P, Short Form 12-Physical; VR-12M, Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey Mental;&#xD;
      VR-12P, Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey Physical; and Patient satisfaction (out of 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-Operative During surgery - time required for femoroplasty as well as total fluoroscopic&#xD;
      exposure time, as well as total exposure in microgray will be recorded. Procedural start (at&#xD;
      initiation of femoroplasty) and finish (at completion of femoroplasty) time will be recorded&#xD;
      for comparative analysis of both groups. Fluoroscopic exposure time and total exposure in&#xD;
      microgray will be determined based on total number of shots taken and known&#xD;
      duration/microgray exposure of each fluoroscopic shot. Fluoroscopic shot duration/Microgray&#xD;
      exposure: mean total fluoroscopy time will be limited to 1.10 minutes or less (52 mGy or less&#xD;
      per patient), based on recommendations by Budd et al. 2012&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Fluoroscopic Image Acquisition Each patient will be placed in a neutral&#xD;
      position to allow for the standardization and comparison with the well-centered, preoperative&#xD;
      anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs that are typically used for structural analysis and&#xD;
      treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the fluoroscopic image most closely replicates the AP pelvis, the femoral head-neck&#xD;
      junction (FHNJ) will be assessed with fluoroscopy, with the leg in 6 different positions and&#xD;
      fluoroscopic C-arm in 3 different positions (see table below) that allow for the evaluation&#xD;
      of the medial and lateral FHNJ (extension views) and anterior and posterior FHNJ (flexion&#xD;
      views). These views will be obtained by rotating the operative distal femur,&#xD;
      flexing/extending the operative hip, and/or adducting the operative hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all six positions, the angle of rotation will be verified with a Goniometer (Prestige&#xD;
      Medical, Northridge, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of the alpha angle will be performed by a single reader on each exported&#xD;
      fluoroscopic view (corresponding to the six positions) for every control specimen with the&#xD;
      use of the HipCheck System. For the control group the surgeon will review the fluoroscopic&#xD;
      images prior to the resection procedure, but without making or reviewing any measurements or&#xD;
      analysis (The HipCheck analysis platform will have &quot;alpha angle overlay&quot; turned off, to keep&#xD;
      measurements from being displayed). For the HipCheck group the surgeon will review the&#xD;
      fluoroscopic images including the HipCheck analysis for each view prior to resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip Arthroscopy (femoroplasty):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoroplasty will be performed using a 5.5 mm bur. This will be done in combination with the&#xD;
      aid of fluoroscopic visualization and HipCheck technology or isolated fluoroscopic&#xD;
      visualization, depending on the patient group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HipCheck system will be used intraoperatively to assist with clinical decision making by&#xD;
      assessing and providing feedback on alpha angle and confirming complete bony resection and&#xD;
      absence of residual deformity for the test group only. To prevent over- or under resection,&#xD;
      HipCheck provides a resection line (spline) for the surgeon to visualize and resect the&#xD;
      desired amount, with a target alpha angle of 40 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will not receive intra-operative assistance from the HipCheck software&#xD;
      platform. Both arthroscopic and fluoroscopic imaging will be used to identify the cam and aid&#xD;
      in resection per the standard hip arthroscopy technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Postoperative&quot; Fluoroscopic Image Acquisition At the conclusion of the hip arthroscopy,&#xD;
      postoperative fluoroscopy views will be obtained with the same six leg positions. The angle&#xD;
      of rotation will be verified with a Goniometer (Prestige Medical, Northridge, CA). The&#xD;
      HipCheck tablet and software may be used to capture and later analyze the alpha angle for&#xD;
      each of these leg positions for both the control and test groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Operative At 2 weeks postoperatively patients will undergo a series of standard&#xD;
      radiographs (Dunn, AP, False profile views) to assess accuracy of femoroplasty. Measurements&#xD;
      will be performed using the institutional PACS system as well as ImageJ for surface area&#xD;
      calculations. Accuracy of femoroplasty will be determined by: alpha angle on Dunn, AP views&#xD;
      and false profile, femoral head offset, and area of over resection and under resection on AP.&#xD;
      The patients as well as the clinician performing postoperative radiographic calculations will&#xD;
      be blinded to method of treatment. A post-operative PROs and VAS Pain Score will be taken at&#xD;
      2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-operatively. Medication use will be&#xD;
      documented in post-op recovery, at 2 weeks, 3months, and 12 months post-operatively. A&#xD;
      clinical exam including range of motion assessment will be performed at 2-week, 3-, 6-, and&#xD;
      12-month follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Failure of non-conservative management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be excluded from the study if ANY of the following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unwilling to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History of prior hip conditions such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis,&#xD;
           Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, idiopathic avascular necrosis, hip joint trauma, and prior&#xD;
           hip surgeries&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The presence of a concurrent systemic inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid&#xD;
           arthritis; psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis,&#xD;
           or systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Marked osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade 2 or higher)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subject is considered a part of a vulnerable population&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pregnancy in order to avoid: x-rays and the contraindication of lying supine after 20&#xD;
           weeks secondary to pressure on the abdominal aorta&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal Criteria Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for&#xD;
      any reason. The Investigator may elect at any time to withdraw a subject from the study for&#xD;
      any reason if such a decision is in the subject's best medical interest. If a patient&#xD;
      discontinues the study or is withdrawn by the Investigator prior to surgery, the patient will&#xD;
      not be counted as a completed subject and an additional subject may be enrolled to achieve&#xD;
      the enrollment goal of 40 completed subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Use established data registry and collection methodology. All preoperative&#xD;
      and demographic data is collected and inputted into registry preoperatively. Intraoperative&#xD;
      data and measurements are collected and inputted at time of surgery. Postoperative&#xD;
      radiographic measurements to assess alpha angle and combined femoral offset are made within 3&#xD;
      months postoperatively, using a 2nd independent reader to verify inter- and intra-observer&#xD;
      reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative data and postoperative complications are collected using OBERD system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks Generalized risks to surgical procedures are present, which include but are not limited&#xD;
      to bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding structures such as blood vessels, nerves,&#xD;
      tendons, and bone. In addition, risks specific to hip arthroscopy include those related to&#xD;
      hip traction related issues such as numbness and parasthesias to the perineum or soft tissue&#xD;
      compression related complications. Lastly, risk to radiation exposure is present, however, it&#xD;
      is limited with the use of HipCheck, as continuous fluoroscopy is not needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits Enhanced verification of intraoperative cam resection via minimal fluoroscopic&#xD;
      exposure. In addition, increased accuracy of cam resection with the goals of avoiding over or&#xD;
      underresection, will thereby potentially improve patient outcomes following hip arthroscopy.&#xD;
