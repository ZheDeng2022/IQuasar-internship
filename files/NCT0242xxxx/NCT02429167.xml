    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if clinic and home training with a study device&#xD;
      will improve a balance deficit. The study device is called Portable Neuromodulation&#xD;
      Stimulator (PoNS). The study device will be placed on the tongue to deliver nerve&#xD;
      stimulation. The study is testing if use of the study device in conjunction with physical&#xD;
      therapy will improve balance and gait in patients suffering from a TBI. The effects of using&#xD;
      the device and undergoing therapy will be measured using standardized tests of movement&#xD;
      control, gait, headache and other TBI symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>The PoNS is a medical device worn around the neck. The controller contains the pulse generator and a user interface. The mouthpiece, held to the top of the tongue, contains 143 circular gold electrodes that deliver a mild, controlled electric stimulation to the subject. While the subject is receiving stimulation, they will perform increasingly difficult balance, posture, gait, and movement control tasks designed to challenge existing abilities. Each training session takes approximately one hour to complete, and is separated by an interval of 2-2.5 hours.</description>
