      PHASE: IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      TYPE OF STUDY: With direct benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTIVE: multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who failed&#xD;
      corticosteroids and immunosupressive therapy, or are intolerant to immunosuppressors. All&#xD;
      included patients will be naïve to anti-TNF therapy. Active disease at golimumab treatment&#xD;
      initiation defined as a MAYO score ≥6 and with an endoscopic sub score ≥2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients with Continuous Clinical Response (CCR)&#xD;
      and endoscopic remission after one year of golumimab at week 54.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Phase :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 0: golimumab 200mg- Week 2: golimumab 100 mg- Week 6: golimumab 50 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase I : Week 10-Week 54 Week 10-Week 54 • Patients with primary clinical&#xD;
      response*: Standard regimen with golimumab 50 mg Q4W (or 100 mg Q4W if &gt; 80 kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients without primary clinical response at week 10 or with flare between week 10-week&#xD;
           54*: Optimization to 100 mg Q4W (or combination therapy with azathioprine if &gt; 80 kg or&#xD;
           switch from azathioprine to methotrexate if already on azathioprine at golimumab&#xD;
           initiation or patient with known intolerance to thiopurines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early escape at Week 18: Primary non-responders who are still not responding at week 18&#xD;
           to dose optimization at Weeks 10 and 14 will be considered treatment failures and will&#xD;
           be followed up (call or visit) at week 54 for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score ≥30% and&#xD;
                ≥3 points, accompanied by either a rectal bleeding sub score of 0 or 1 or a&#xD;
                decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding sub score ≥1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent Phase II : Week 54-Week 108&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients with CCR and MH at week 54 and on golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks: Stop golimumab&#xD;
      and continuation of thiopurines or methotrexate if on combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients with CCR and MH at week 54 and on golimumab 100 mg every 4 weeks: De-escalation to&#xD;
      50 mg every 4 weeks and continuation of thiopurines or methotrexate if on combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Restart/Escalate golimumab on flare (defined in section 4 of the protocol) to the phase I&#xD;
      dose; 50 mg q4wk or 100mg q4wk (similar to the phase I regimen)&#xD;

      NUMBER OF PATIENTS: 200 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION PERIOD: 33 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION: 57 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN EVALUATION Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Week 10-54: proportion of patients in CCR and with MH (endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at&#xD;
      week 54&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data base lock, data analysis and display (publication) will happen when all included&#xD;
      subjects have completed the 108-week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all included patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II (week 54-108): proportion of patients in CCR with MH (endoscopic Mayo score of&#xD;
           0 or 1) at week 108, after discontinuation or dose de-escalation (from 100 to 50 mg) of&#xD;
           golimumab treatment at year 1 in the subgroup of patients in CCR and with MH (endoscopic&#xD;
           Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 54&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors associated with treatment success (see primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy of dose optimization in patients who loose response between week 10 and 54&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical remission at week 54 • Clinical remission at week 108 • Partial MAYO score at&#xD;
           week 54 and 108 • PRO2 (Partial Mayo minus PGA) at week 54 and 108 • CCR between study&#xD;
           inclusion and week 54 and 108 • Steroid-free clinical remission at week 54 and 108 • MH&#xD;
           (endoscopic score MAYO 0-1) at week 54 and 108 • Changes in faecal calprotectin levels&#xD;
           from baseline to week 54 and 108 • Colectomy between W0 and W54 and 108&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UC-related hospitalizations throughout the trial • Histological remission9 at W54 and&#xD;
           108&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PRO: Fatigue (FACIT), disability (IBD Disability index), QoL (SHS-IBD VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK data (golimumab trough levels and antibodies against golimumab)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of late responders being in Clinical Response from week 18 to week 54 and&#xD;
           with MH at week 54 following treatment intensification in Maintenance Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the subgroup of patients who are primary non-responders to golimumab at week 10, we will&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of treatment optimization, including the percentage of patients achieving&#xD;
      continuous clinical response and endoscopic remission at one year.&#xD;
