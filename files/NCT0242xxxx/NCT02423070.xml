      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people with advanced heart and lung disease have heart and lung transplants. But the&#xD;
      organs are often rejected. When this happens, the organ recipients must have repeated&#xD;
      biopsies. These are invasive and expensive. Researchers want to see if a blood test can&#xD;
      predict rejection and take the place of biopsies. The test shows how much donor DNA is in a&#xD;
      recipient s blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if a new blood test can be used instead of biopsies to diagnose rejection after&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 years and older who are on the lung or heart transplant waitlist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have about 4 teaspoons of blood drawn from the arm before having their&#xD;
           transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will collect demographic data about participants. They will also collect&#xD;
           basic medical information about their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After surgery, while still in the hospital, participants will have 2 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
           drawn twice a week until they go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each biopsy visit after the transplant, participants will have 4 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
           drawn for testing for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute rejection (AR) occurs within the first 6 months after transplantation in 20 percent of&#xD;
      heart transplant patients and in 50 percent of lung-transplant patients. Given the often&#xD;
      silent clinical presentation of AR, these patients require monitoring with repeated invasive&#xD;
      and costly endomyocardial (EMB) or transbronchial biopsies (TBBx). Since organ&#xD;
      transplantation is essentially genomic transplantation, our prior studies leveraged the use&#xD;
      of distinctive graft and recipient genotype single-nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) to barcode&#xD;
      donor DNA circulating in recipient serum. We have shown that levels of donor DNA measured as&#xD;
      the percentage of circulating cell-free donor-derived DNA (%ccfdDNA) correlates with AR&#xD;
      diagnosis and severity as detected by biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance receiver operator curve (ROC) of %ccfdDNA yielded an area under the curve&#xD;
      (AUC) of 0.83. Using this technique, we can diagnose AR by measuring elevations in %ccfdDNA&#xD;
      up to 5 months before EMB-detected pathology. While these findings suggest that monitoring&#xD;
      %ccfdDNA may offer a high-performing, non-invasive, and early diagnostic tool of AR, further&#xD;
      validation studies are required to determine its clinical utility. The ability to diagnose AR&#xD;
      earlier than is possible with a biopsy offers an opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of rejection as well as to identify potential AR biomarkers. Thus, the primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to validate the predictive accuracy and ROC characteristics of %ccfdDNA for AR&#xD;
      in a multicenter, prospective cohort study of heart- and lung-transplant patients, recruited&#xD;
      through a consortium of 5 transplant centers in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to determine the association between early graft injury caused by&#xD;
      acute rejection and infection and the development of chronic rejection, i.e., chronic lung&#xD;
      allograft dysfunction (CLAD) or chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV). The exploratory&#xD;
      objectives are: 1) to compare %ccfdDNA characteristics in AMR (antibody-mediated rejection)&#xD;
      and ACR (acute cellular rejection), 2) to study early immunological changes associated with a&#xD;
      significant rise in %ccfdDNA, and 3) to examine changes in microbiome architecture and other&#xD;
      cell-free nucleic acids in rejection.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lung and heart transplant candidates. Dual organ transplants such as that include lung&#xD;
             or heart PLUS any other organ are also considered for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone lung or heart transplants and are within 3 months of&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and willing to sign the informed consent form. Subjects undergoing&#xD;
             a double transplant will sign a single consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Retransplant candidates will be considered as a new transplant. These subjects will be&#xD;
             approached for enrollment and if they consent to participate, they will be assigned a&#xD;
             different SSPIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rationale for the Exclusion of Children: Subjects under 18 years of age will not be&#xD;
        considered for inclusion in this protocol, because there are very few heart and lung&#xD;
        transplantations performed annually on minors in the DC/MD/VA area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rationale for the Exclusion of Pregnant Women: Pregnant women are not eligible for this&#xD;
        study. Women who are pregnant or lactating will be excluded since these patients are not&#xD;
        typically considered for transplantation due to risk to the developing fetus or nursing&#xD;
        infants. For patients enrolled in the study who become pregnant, we will stop all study&#xD;
        specific tasks. When the subject is no longer pregnant we will resume the sample&#xD;
        collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of Minority Populations:According to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS),&#xD;
        about 20 percent of lungtransplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        recipients and about 40 percent of heart-transplant recipients in participating centers are&#xD;
        minorities. Also, about 40 percent of lung-transplant recipients and 37 percent of&#xD;
        heart-transplant recipients are female. In our experience, enrollment rates among minority&#xD;
        transplant recipients and female transplant recipients has been similar to the rate in our&#xD;
        general transplant population.&#xD;
