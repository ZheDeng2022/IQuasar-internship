  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain initiates a stress response that increases sympathetic output and leads to autonomic&#xD;
      imbalance. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a easy to perform, valid measure of autonomic&#xD;
      function. HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) is a novel biobehavioral procedure in which patients learn&#xD;
      to restore autonomic balance by developing 'HRV Coherence'. Patients in HRV Coherence have&#xD;
      improved mood and cognition. The investigators' pilot study showed that HRV-B alleviated&#xD;
      chronic pain and stress among Veteran Pain Clinic patients. HRV-B thus has a pivotal role in&#xD;
      managing pain. The proposed project is a randomized, sham-controlled, biobehavioral&#xD;
      intervention with HRV-B to test the hypotheses that HRV-B increases HRV coherence and reduces&#xD;
      pain, stress, fatigue, insomnia and depression and improves sleep, activity, and cognition in&#xD;
      Veterans with chronic neuromuscular pain. The investigators hypothesize that HRV-B will (1)&#xD;
      reduce self-reported pain and stress ratings, (2) improve objective measures of actigraphic&#xD;
      sleep parameters (sleep latency, duration, efficiency, fragmentation), rest/activity rhythms&#xD;
      (dichotomy index, interdaily stability) and cognitive function (reaction time, attention);&#xD;
      and (3) alleviate self-reported fatigue and depression symptoms. Patients from two groups&#xD;
      will be randomized to the investigators' previously established HRV-B or sham protocol (n=40&#xD;
      each), and will complete a baseline assessment, 6 weekly training sessions, a post-training&#xD;
      assessment, and 4-week and 8-week follow-up evaluations post-training. Portable, hand-held,&#xD;
      data-logging devices will be used to practice attaining HRV coherence at home by the active&#xD;
      HRV-B training group, while those in the sham training group will get a 'stress squeeze&#xD;
      ball'. Standard methods will quantify HRV coherence and other HRV measures, and validated&#xD;
      instruments will be used to assess pain, stress, fatigue, insomnia, depression, and cognitive&#xD;
      function. Wrist actigraphy will be used to objectively characterize insomnia via continuous&#xD;
      recordings collected 24-hrs/day over three 1-week periods (pre-training, post-training, and&#xD;
      at the 4 week follow-up assessments. Tests measuring attention and reaction time will assess&#xD;
      changes in cognitive performance. Data analyses will apply linear models for repeated&#xD;
      measures to evaluate the effect of HRV-B on study outcomes, and on treatment persistence,&#xD;
      after adjusting for confounding factors. This study will be the first to examine HRV-B for&#xD;
      pain management among Veteran chronic pain patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study fulfills the national Veterans Health Administration/Department of Defense&#xD;
      (VHA/DoD) Task Force recommendation that complementary, integrative therapies for pain&#xD;
      management be provided to Veterans. Chronic pain elicits stress which increases sympathetic&#xD;
      output fostering autonomic nervous system imbalance, an overextended stress response,&#xD;
      fatigue, depression and insomnia. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of the interplay&#xD;
      between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and thus is a useful and&#xD;
      easily-measured index of autonomic balance that has a relationship to chronic pain effects.&#xD;
      HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) is a novel, biobehavioral procedure that restores normal autonomic&#xD;
      balance. Through HRV-B, patients increase parasympathetic cardiac output and restore&#xD;
      autonomic balance via induction of 'HRV coherence'. The investigators' pilot study indicated&#xD;
      that HRV-B produced coherence and alleviated self-reported ratings of chronic pain and stress&#xD;
      among Veterans attending the investigators' Pain Clinic. The proposed clinical intervention&#xD;
      will further test hypotheses that HRV-B increases HRV coherence, reduces self-reported pain,&#xD;
      stress, depression, fatigue, and insomnia, and improves cognition among Veterans with chronic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to: (1) conduct a randomized, sham-controlled, pilot intervention trial&#xD;
      to determine whether HRV-B increases HRV coherence among chronic pain patients (n=40 each for&#xD;
      the HRV-B and sham treatment groups; total N=80 patients); (2) determine whether HRV-B&#xD;
      reduces self-reported pain and stress among chronic pain patients. The primary endpoints&#xD;
      include HRV coherence, pain (Brief Pain Inventory or BPI),and stress (Perceived Stress Scale&#xD;
      or PSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured at 4 time points. pre-training; post-training, one week after the 6&#xD;
      weekly treatments are over; at 4 weeks follow-up after post-training, and at an 8-week&#xD;
      post-training follow-up (total time of participation is 16 weeks from pre-training to 8 week&#xD;
      follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, chronic stress is associated with disrupted circadian rest/activity rhythms and&#xD;
      domains of quality of life (QoL) including fatigue, insomnia, and reduced physical and social&#xD;
      functioning. Interventions that relieve pain thus represent a novel therapeutic target for&#xD;
      normalizing dysfunctional rest/activity rhythms and these QoL domains among pain patients.&#xD;
      The investigators are also interested in assessing the effects of HRV-B on cognitive function&#xD;
      in pain patients. Thus, the investigators' secondary exploratory objectives are to determine&#xD;
      if HRV-B: (1) improves sleep and rest/activity rhythms; (2) alleviates self-reported fatigue&#xD;
      and depression; and (3) improves cognitive function (reaction time, attention). Circadian&#xD;
      endpoints will be measured as actigraphic parameters of sleep (e.g., duration, efficiency),&#xD;
      and rest/activity (e.g., dichotomy index, interdaily stability), and with the Insomnia&#xD;
      Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ); fatigue will be assessed using the Multi-Dimensional Fatigue&#xD;
      Inventory (MFI), which assesses general physical and mental fatigue and motivation.&#xD;
      Depression will be assessed via the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Cognitive function&#xD;
      will be measured with a cognitive battery comprised of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition&#xD;
      Test (PASAT), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), and the Psychomotor Vigilance&#xD;
      Test (PVT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Intervention. HRV-B training will follow a previously established, standardized&#xD;
      protocol. The primary (HRV coherence, pain, stress) and exploratory outcomes (insomnia,&#xD;
      fatigue, depression, cognition). Outcomes will be assessed at 4 time points: pre-training;&#xD;
      post-training, one week after the 6 weekly treatments are over; at 4 weeks follow-up after&#xD;
      post-training, and at an 8-week post-training follow-up (total time of participation is 16&#xD;
      weeks from pre-training to 8 week follow-up). There will be no HRV-B training at the 8 week&#xD;
      follow-up, only assessment. Standardized procedures will characterize HRV coherence and other&#xD;
      frequency- or time-domain HRV measures, and validated instruments will be used to assess pain&#xD;
      and stress. Wrist actigraphy will characterize insomnia via continuous, 24-hour/day personal&#xD;
      monitoring of rest/activity rhythms at 1-week intervals coinciding with the baseline&#xD;
      pre-training (baseline), post-training, and 8-week follow-up assessments. The investigators&#xD;
      will provide portable data-logging devices for practicing HRV-B at home. Sham intervention&#xD;
      subjects will have pulse and respiration monitored but not receive active training; instead&#xD;
      they will view a static, relaxing nature picture on a computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will control false discovery rates at 5%. Analyses will be based on intent&#xD;
      to treat with two-sided tests. The effect of HRV-B on coherence and other HRV variables will&#xD;
      be analyzed using linear mixed models for repeated measures data from sequential time&#xD;
      assessments, and a between-subjects factor to evaluate the intervention after adjusting for&#xD;
      potential confounding factors (e.g., age, standard therapy, medications, co-morbid disease).&#xD;
      Baseline relationships between HRV and endpoints will be examined using multiple regression&#xD;
      models. Few studies have examined the multivariate relationship between pain, autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction, stress, depression, sleep, rest/activity rhythms, fatigue, and cognition.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 15 (Follow-up Assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability coherence will allow for direct, quantitative assessment of participant performance and receipt of intervention. The HRV Coherence Ratio is obtained by identifying the maximum peak in the 0.04-0.26 Hz range of the fast Fourier transformation of heart rate interbeat intervals, then calculating the integral in a window 0.030 Hz wide centered on the highest peak in that region ('peak power', usually ~0.1 Hz), then calculating the total power of the entire spectrum. The HRV Coherence Ratio is then quantified as: peak power / (total power - peak power).</description>

        <title>Heart Rate Variability Coherence Ratio</title>
        <description>Heart rate variability coherence will allow for direct, quantitative assessment of participant performance and receipt of intervention. The HRV Coherence Ratio is obtained by identifying the maximum peak in the 0.04-0.26 Hz range of the fast Fourier transformation of heart rate interbeat intervals, then calculating the integral in a window 0.030 Hz wide centered on the highest peak in that region ('peak power', usually ~0.1 Hz), then calculating the total power of the entire spectrum. The HRV Coherence Ratio is then quantified as: peak power / (total power - peak power).</description>
