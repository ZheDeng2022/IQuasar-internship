    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given together&#xD;
      with vorinostat and with or without radiation therapy in treating younger patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed or progressive diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a tumor that arises from the&#xD;
      middle portion of the brain stem. Vorinostat and temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high&#xD;
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving temsirolimus and vorinostat with&#xD;
      or without radiation therapy may be a better treatment for younger patients with diffuse&#xD;
      intrinsic pontine glioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose of temsirolimus&#xD;
      in combination with vorinostat given every four weeks in patients with diffuse intrinsic&#xD;
      pontine glioma (DIPG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of the combination vorinostat and temsirolimus&#xD;
      administered on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the antitumor activity of the combination of vorinostat and temsirolimus within&#xD;
      the confines of a phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the biologic effects of vorinostat and temsirolimus on the signaling pathways&#xD;
      of interest in these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate response with advanced neuroimaging (including magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy) and correlate with fiber tract changes using tractography and fractional&#xD;
      anisotropy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY PHASE: Patients receive vorinostat once daily (QD) and undergo radiation&#xD;
      therapy QD for 30 fractions over 6-7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Four to six weeks after the completion of radiation therapy, patients&#xD;
      receive vorinostat PO QD and temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1-8.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 10 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive vorinostat PO QD and temsirolimus IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1-8.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;
