  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the acute effects of two different types of&#xD;
      muscle stretching (static and dynamic) on muscle-tendon unit of gastrocnemius muscle by&#xD;
      ultrasound and to follow how long the stretching effects are sustained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle stretching is a very common practice applied in warm-up process in order to enhance&#xD;
      performance in sports and to prevent or decrease the risk of sports injury. Muscle stretching&#xD;
      is also used for therapeutic purposes in many clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is generally performed in either static or dynamic manner. Muscle is brought to its&#xD;
      lengthened position and is held at that point for a certain period of time in static&#xD;
      stretching (SS). In dynamic stretching (DS), however, active movements of muscle take the&#xD;
      joint through the range of motion and creates a stretch, but the muscle is not held in the&#xD;
      end position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although recent studies suggest that static stretching has adverse effects on performance,&#xD;
      reduces maximal muscle force and is not successful in preventing non-contact injuries, as&#xD;
      believed so; and the dynamic type therefore gaining popularity; it is reported that&#xD;
      flexibility and range of motion can be improved by stretching as a consequence of the&#xD;
      decrement in muscle stiffness. However, the effects of stretching depend on the type,&#xD;
      duration and timing of stretching and there is still debate over which prescription provides&#xD;
      the best results in terms of flexibility, power, performance or injury protection. And what&#xD;
      happens to the viscoelastic properties of a muscle when it is stretched statically or&#xD;
      dynamically is still not well documented. Ultrasound seems to be a good option as it offers&#xD;
      an objective and a non-invasive way to expose the alteration in muscles and tendons due to&#xD;
      stretching.&#xD;
