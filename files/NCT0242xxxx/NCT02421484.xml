  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open label dose escalation trial of human allogeneic bone marrow derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the treatment of septic shock. The main purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety of MSCs in patients with septic shock.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is one of the most common and devastating health problems in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit, with a mortality rate of approximately 40% and a staggering economic burden of&#xD;
      approximately 4 billion dollars annually in Canada. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may&#xD;
      provide a promising new treatment avenue, as pre-clinical research has shown that these cells&#xD;
      can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to sepsis and greatly&#xD;
      reduce rates of organ failure and death. This dramatic effect appears to be due to the&#xD;
      ability of MSCs to modify the inflammatory cascade, augment tissue repair and enhance&#xD;
      pathogen clearance. MSCs have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials including those&#xD;
      with myocardial infarction, heart failure, neurological and metabolic disorders,&#xD;
      hematological malignancies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no serious safety&#xD;
      concerns. However, MSC therapy has not yet been evaluated in humans with septic shock. Prior&#xD;
      to a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of MSCs in septic shock, an&#xD;
      evaluation of safety is necessary. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial&#xD;
      is an open label Phase I dose escalation trial that will evaluate the safety of MSC therapy&#xD;
      in this vulnerable population.&#xD;

    <description>This is a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial that constitutes 3 dose cohorts with 3 participants per cohort who will receive intravenous doses of allogeneic bone marrow derived allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells--0.3 million cells/kg, 1.0 million cells/kg, and 3.0 million cells/kg. We will proceed from the lower dose to the next higher dose if there are no safety concerns for each cohort.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant must meet all 5 inclusion criteria to be eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Admission to the Ottawa Hospital Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Receipt of appropriate broad spectrum antibiotics for the suspected/confirmed&#xD;
             infectious source and adequate source control according to the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             critical care physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Within 24 hours of admission to the ICU, receipt of reasonable levels of fluid&#xD;
             administration and resuscitation as indicated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a central venous pressure of at least 8 mm Hg AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cardiovascular failure that is present within the first 24 hours of admission to the&#xD;
             ICU and that is present for at least 4 consecutive hours AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Deterioration or lack of improvement in at least 1 additional organ function, or organ&#xD;
             hypoperfusion, as defined by the modified Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS).&#xD;
             Criteria for organ dysfunction or organ hypoperfusion must be met within the first 24&#xD;
             hours of ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Another form of shock (cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive) that is considered by&#xD;
             the treating critical care physician as the dominant cause of shock&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of known pulmonary hypertension with a WHO functional class of III or IV&#xD;
