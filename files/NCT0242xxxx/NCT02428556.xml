      OBJECTIVE: To learn how people understand language used by the FDA to describe certain newly&#xD;
      approved medications called &quot;breakthrough&quot; drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: FDA allows drugs to be designated as breakthrough if there is preliminary&#xD;
      evidence that it may offer a substantial improvement over available therapies. But consumers&#xD;
      (and prescribers) may mistake the word - which in this context means very preliminary promise&#xD;
      and lots of uncertainty - to mean the drug is proven to be much more effective or much safer&#xD;
      than existing drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Internet survey (with colleagues from Carnegie Mellon University) using Amazon&#xD;
      Mechanical Turk - a web tool that recruits people willing to do surveys&#xD;
      (https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome). Participants will be asked to read a short scenario&#xD;
      about a new drug (facts are based on a real drug but the investigators use a fictional name)&#xD;
      and answer questions about how well they think the drug works, how safe it is, etc. People&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of 5 versions of the scenario differing in how explicitly they&#xD;
      explain what &quot;breakthrough&quot; means. The information in the scenario is drawn from FDA's own&#xD;
      press release about the drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An online sample of 600 American participants was recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk.&#xD;
      Respondents were randomly assigned to 5 conditions in which they read an excerpt from a news&#xD;
      article describing a newly FDA-approved fictionalized breakthrough therapy, Zykanta, for&#xD;
      treating metastatic lung cancer. Information on this fictionalized drug was drawn from a&#xD;
      real-life breakthrough designated drug so as to be able to provide as accurate an example as&#xD;
      possible with respect to inherent uncertainty in risk and benefit. Each condition&#xD;
      communicated information about Zykanta with a greater or lesser degree of transparency&#xD;
      regarding the contingent nature of a breakthrough approved drug. All conditions contained the&#xD;
      same factual information about the risks and benefits of the drug. In the first condition - a&#xD;
      Purely Factual condition - participants read a clear and concise technical definition of&#xD;
      breakthrough therapy designation about a drug that was approved 4 months ahead of schedule,&#xD;
      without seeing the term 'breakthrough' attached to the drug. This condition provides the&#xD;
      basic risk-benefit information made available by the FDA without loaded terminology. In the&#xD;
      second condition, the factual information was enhanced by describing the drug as &quot;Promising&quot;&#xD;
      - the language the FDA uses in press releases about breakthrough drugs. This condition&#xD;
      provides a more tempered label for this designation, but a label nonetheless. In the third&#xD;
      condition, the factual information was enhanced by describing the drug as &quot;Breakthrough.&quot; In&#xD;
      the fourth condition, factual information about the drug was enhanced by describing the drug&#xD;
      as &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, but additionally contained a Tentative Disclaimer about the possible&#xD;
      uncertainty surrounding the drug. This condition reflects the information found in the small&#xD;
      print of the labeling of some breakthrough drugs. In the fifth condition, the factual drug&#xD;
      information was enhanced by describing the drug as &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, but contained a more&#xD;
      Definitive Disclaimer about the uncertainty surrounding the drug and its need for further&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures To determine whether the term 'breakthrough' resulted in mistaken inference about&#xD;
      its safety and effectiveness, all participants were asked to make a choice between a&#xD;
      'breakthrough drug' or a drug that met the definition of breakthrough without the explicit&#xD;
      use of the word &quot;breakthrough&quot; in the description (&quot;If you had a potentially deadly medical&#xD;
      condition and could choose between 2 drugs recently approved by FDA, which would you choose?&#xD;
      (1) 'Axabex, a &quot;breakthrough&quot; drug newly approved by the FDA' or (2) 'Hypapax, a drug that&#xD;
      has shown some early promise in drug trials but which has not been shown to improve survival&#xD;
      or disease-related symptoms'). All participants were asked whether they had heard the term&#xD;
      &quot;breakthrough drug&quot; prior to being asked the question. All participants also provided a&#xD;
      written definition of a breakthrough drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reading the news excerpt on the fictional breakthrough drug in each of the 5&#xD;
      conditions, participants were surveyed on the safety and efficacy of the drug described in&#xD;
      the news excerpt (&quot;How safe is Zykanta compared to other drugs approved to treat metastatic&#xD;
      lung cancer?&quot;, &quot;How risky is Zykanta compared to other drugs approved to treat metastatic&#xD;
      lung cancer?&quot;, &quot;Has Zykanta been proven to save the lives of patients with metastatic lung&#xD;
      cancer,&quot; &quot;How effective do you think Zykanta is at treating metastatic lung cancer?&quot; &quot;If a&#xD;
      patient with metastatic lung cancer started to take Zykanta, what do you think would happen&#xD;
      to their tumor over the next 6 months?&quot; and &quot;How effective is Zykanta compared to other drugs&#xD;
      approved to treat metastatic lung cancer?&quot;) and the strength of the scientific evidence that&#xD;
      the drug helps metastatic lung cancer (&quot;How strong is the scientific evidence that Zykanta&#xD;
      helps patients with metastatic lung cancer?&quot; and &quot;If you were deciding to take Zykanta, would&#xD;
      you feel confident making that decision given your current knowledge of the drug?&quot;). We also&#xD;
      asked about the likelihood of a symptom that was explicitly stated as a common symptom in the&#xD;
      drug description (&quot;If a patient with metastatic lung cancer started to take Zykanta, how&#xD;
      likely is it that they would experience abdominal pain within 6 months?&quot;) and about their own&#xD;
      anticipated behavior with respect to the drug (&quot;If you were diagnosed with metastatic lung&#xD;
      cancer, would you want to take Zykanta?&quot; and &quot;If a close friend or family member was&#xD;
      diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, would you want them to take Zykanta?&quot;). Each response&#xD;
      was measured on a 4 or 5-point Likert scale.&#xD;
