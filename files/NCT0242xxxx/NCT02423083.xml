      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with multiple sclerosis (MS) get lesions in their brain and spinal cord. These cause&#xD;
      neurological symptoms and sometimes disability. Researchers want to see if a blood pressure&#xD;
      drug called guanabenz can repair lesions and help people with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if guanabenz is safe and well tolerated in people with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People 18 55 years old with MS who have taken glatiramer acetate for the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened in a separate protocol. For 2 months, they will be&#xD;
           examined and have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. This will decide if they are&#xD;
           in the Stable or Active MS study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last 5 months. There will be up to 11 visits, 5 overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: overnight stay at the clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bladder ultrasound scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) to measure heart electrical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be drawn through an intravenous (IV) line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have tests of strength, muscle tone, and movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will get their first dose of the study drug, a tablet taken once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the study drug at home and keep a medicine diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose will slowly increase. Each time, participants will stay overnight at the&#xD;
           clinic. They will have a physical exam, EKG, MRI, and IV blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 6: Participants will have a physical exam, MRI, and blood drawn. They will get a&#xD;
           schedule to slowly lower their drug dose and stop taking guanabenz.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 final visits. They will have a physical exam, EKG, MRI, and IV&#xD;
           blood draw.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1 clinical study will aim to determine whether therapeutically adequate dosages of&#xD;
      guanabenz are safe and well tolerated in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). It will&#xD;
      further provide pharmacokinetic data important for determination of optimal dosing schedule&#xD;
      for possible future Phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six patients, ages between 18-55 inclusive, and diagnosis of definite multiple sclerosis by&#xD;
      2010 Revised McDonald Diagnostic Criteria (Polman et al, 2010) will be enrolled. All patients&#xD;
      will have been on treatment with glatiramer acetate, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      approved disease-modifying therapy, for a minimum of year. Four of the patients will be&#xD;
      clinically stable with no clinical relapse in the preceding year and no evidence of active&#xD;
      inflammation by MRI during the 2-month screening period; 2 patients will be selected based on&#xD;
      evidence of on-going, active inflammation seen by MRI during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open-label, single site, dose escalation study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      guanabenz in MS patients will be determined. Patients will be screened for participation&#xD;
      under the existing MS natural history study 89-N-0045. Sequential patient enrollment will be&#xD;
      spaced at least 6 weeks apart. Five study drug doses will be explored: 4mg, 8mg, 16mg, 32mg&#xD;
      and 64mg. Dose escalation will ensue if the preceding dose is tolerated, defined both by&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes and objective clinical and imaging assessments. Patients will be&#xD;
      maintained on lower doses (4mg-16mg) for 14 days and on higher doses (32 and 64mg) for 28&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is MTD, defined as the maximum dose that produces dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) in at most 2 out of the 6 participants. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes, objective clinical and imaging assessments at 32mg and 64mg, and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
