      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with subacute ischemic stroke will&#xD;
      benefit from infusion of patient's own bone marrow derived stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Intravenous injection of bone marrow mononuclear cells at a dose of 30 to&#xD;
      500 million in patients with subacute ischemic stroke results in reduction of infarct volume&#xD;
      and improvement of neurological function compared to those without the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: Patients receiving more than 100 million Bone marrow derived stem cells&#xD;
      (BMSC) will have better outcome than those receiving fewer dosages of cells.&#xD;

      Background: Stroke accounts for significant disability and there is need for novel treatment&#xD;
      modality which can improve the functional outcome. In this randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      investigators proposed to examine stem cell therapy as a potential therapeutic modality. Stem&#xD;
      cells in animal stroke models have shown reduction in infarct size and improvement in&#xD;
      neurological function. Only one human clinical trial with intravenous autologous marrow&#xD;
      stromal cell therapy of five patients has shown some benefit. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      phase II study was to explore if there is favourable risk to benefit ratio for autologous&#xD;
      bone marrow derived mononuclear stem cell therapy (BMSCs) in patients with acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke to justify a larger phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods &amp; Design: The study recruited 120 men and women aged 18-70 years presenting with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke (7-29 days) and a NIHSS score of ≥ 7 and BI ≤ 50. Following baseline&#xD;
      assessment (MRI Brain, Whole Body PET scan, EEG brain, CT scan Brain and clinical examination&#xD;
      including National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), modified&#xD;
      Rankin Scale (mRS), Glasgow Come Scale (GCS), participants were randomly allocated to two&#xD;
      groups: conventional management alone (control group); or conventional management and&#xD;
      autologous intravenous BMSCs transplantation (experimental group). Bone marrow was aspirated&#xD;
      under local anaesthesia and the isolated BMSCs cells injected intravenously within 4 hours.&#xD;
      The patients were monitored with hemogram &amp; renal/liver function tests, CT scan brain at 36&#xD;
      hrs and clinical examination for a week. The patients were followed up to one year with&#xD;
      periodic MRI brain at 3 months, 6 months, EEG &amp; PET scan at 6 months and 1 year. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy outcomes were difference between the two groups in the Modified Barthel index score&#xD;
      and modified Rankin Scale score at six-month post-randomisation. The secondary efficacy&#xD;
      outcomes are: NIHSS score at six-months and 1 year post-randomisation; and the modified&#xD;
      Rankin scale score at 3 months and one year post-randomization, and functional status&#xD;
      measured by barthel index (in binary scale &lt;60 or &gt;60 ) at six months and one year&#xD;
      post-randomization. Dose response analysis were done by comparing outcomes in patients&#xD;
      receiving various doses of bone marrow mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This phase 2 study was aimed to explore if there is a favourable risk-to-benefit&#xD;
      ratio for stem cell therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Investigators also&#xD;
      planned to examine whether there is justification for phase III trial of autologous bone&#xD;
      marrow derived mononuclear stem cell therapy for acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
