      The proposed study will utilize a randomized controlled trial design to pilot-test a 4-week&#xD;
      shelter-based diet and physical activity intervention in a sample of homeless adults residing&#xD;
      in the transitional shelter at The Bridge Homeless Assistance Center in Dallas, TX (N = 50).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to a diet/physical activity intervention group (n =&#xD;
      25) or a paid assessment-only control group (n = 25). Three intervention strategies will be&#xD;
      employed: 1) computer-tailored newsletters adapted from a program supported for use in other&#xD;
      populations, 2) the distribution of fruit and vegetable snacks directly to individuals, and&#xD;
      3) the provision of pedometers and walking goals. Thus, the primary aim of the proposed study&#xD;
      is to 1) evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness (relative to an assessment-only control&#xD;
      group) of a shelter-based intervention designed to improve dietary intake and increase&#xD;
      physical activity among homeless individuals. The main study outcomes will be average daily&#xD;
      fruit and vegetable consumption and objective pedometer/ accelerometer assessment of physical&#xD;
      activity (assessed weekly) over the 4-week study period, and at a follow-up assessment 4&#xD;
      weeks after the conclusion of the intervention. Secondary aims will focus on: 2) identifying&#xD;
      intervention-related differences (relative to the control group) in indicators of physical&#xD;
      health including blood pressure, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and&#xD;
      other dietary variables (i.e., caloric intake, meals consumed outside of the shelter, daily&#xD;
      fat and fiber intake) and 3) identifying psychosocial variables associated with dietary&#xD;
      quality and physical activity.&#xD;

      Study Overview. The proposed study will take place at &quot;The Bridge&quot; homeless shelter in&#xD;
      Dallas, TX. The study intervention will use a randomized controlled trial design, and an&#xD;
      additional 50 transitional shelter residents will be recruited to participate in the proposed&#xD;
      8-week study (4-week intervention; 4-week post-intervention follow-up visit). Transitional&#xD;
      Shelter residents stay in &quot;semi-private&quot; rooms for an average of 5 months while staff works&#xD;
      to secure more permanent housing. Interested and eligible participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either 1) a 4-week shelter-based diet or physical activity intervention, or 2) standard care&#xD;
      (paid assessment only). Participants will be asked to complete weekly assessments of diet,&#xD;
      physical activity, stress, readiness to change, and other relevant variables throughout the&#xD;
      4-week intervention period, in addition to a 4-week post-intervention follow-up. Participants&#xD;
      will be compensated with gift cards for each of 6 visits. Participants assigned to the&#xD;
      control group will receive tailored newsletters and pedometers with walking goals at the&#xD;
      final follow-up visit. Laptop and tablet computers equipped with Questionnaire Development&#xD;
      System software will be transported to the shelter for all intervention and assessment&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Components Education. A series of four computer-tailored newsletters will be&#xD;
      generated for each individual participant using TailorTool, a web-based program hosted and&#xD;
      maintained at the University of North Carolina (described below; see also www.chaicore).&#xD;
      Newsletter topics include healthy eating (especially the importance of fruit/vegetable&#xD;
      consumption), physical activity, and weight management. Using information collected at&#xD;
      baseline, newsletters will be tailored to individual participants based on demographic,&#xD;
      psychosocial, behavioral, and community resource information. The program will be adapted to&#xD;
      include graphics and testimonials relevant to the sheltered homeless population. Strategies&#xD;
      for healthy food selection and community resources available to shelter residents will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newsletters will include of a set of tailored &quot;stories&quot; in the following formats designed&#xD;
      to appeal to the homeless shelter population: Testimonials (tailored to gender) by residents&#xD;
      of the shelter who have made changes in weight and lifestyle. An advice column (tailored to&#xD;
      behavior-specific barriers), that uses a &quot;Dear Abby&quot; format in which an expert (e.g.,&#xD;
      dietician) answers questions tailored to participant-selected barriers. Behavioral feedback&#xD;
      (current behavior compared to recommendations) will be provided. Stage of change-based action&#xD;
      plan (tailored to stage of change, current behavior) will offer a specific set of steps that&#xD;
      are stage-matched to participant readiness to change related to each behavior. The importance&#xD;
      of social support (tailored to behavior-specific social support/network characteristics) will&#xD;
      be discussed by providing a targeted story about how social support (tailored to type of&#xD;
      support and person most helpful to give support) has helped someone make healthy changes. The&#xD;
      values section (tailored to participant-selected core values) discusses the&#xD;
      participant-selected values and suggests possible ways that these values may be related to&#xD;
      the target behavior. Community resources will provide information and tips tailored to the&#xD;
      shelter, such as group session information, healthful choices in the cafeteria (and other&#xD;
      common food sources), maximizing SNAP food benefits for optimal nutrition, good nutrition&#xD;
      with a limited income, walking groups, contact information, and community resources.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to standard care will receive the tailored newsletters after they&#xD;
      complete the final follow-up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TailorTool is a software tool created by the UNC CHAI (Communication for Health Applications&#xD;
      and Interventions) Core that enables the creation and delivery of tailored communications in&#xD;
      a dynamically generated pdf newsletter format. The tool generates intervention material such&#xD;
      as individual feedback on targeted behavior(s) and variables such as relevant demographics,&#xD;
      psychosocial factors, and barriers. Templates of various page lay-out possibilities allow&#xD;
      individualization of the look of the newsletters. Messages are drawn from a message library&#xD;
      of text files of varying lengths depending on the needs of the research study. Graphics can&#xD;
      be imported into the various template pages. Newsletters can vary in length and can be&#xD;
      personalized with names of participants. Following completion of an online survey the&#xD;
      newsletter(s) are created in a pdf format for reading, saving, and/or printing by the&#xD;
      participant. Each subsequent newsletter can be available immediately or timed for release to&#xD;
      fit the timeline of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a technical perspective, the web application for the automated web-to-print system is&#xD;
      programmed to run under a Windows operating system, using open-source software and a MS SQL&#xD;
      database. The core of the system is a server-side application, with the website consisting of&#xD;
      ASP pages (Active Server Pages), which interface with the application using XML. The backend&#xD;
      application is heavily database-driven with everything from survey questions and skip&#xD;
      patterns (i.e. which survey answers can cause later questions to be disabled, as described&#xD;
      above; the actual disabling takes place client-side, with dynamically-generated javascript&#xD;
      code) to the newsletter content and tailoring logic stored in, and thus configurable via, XML&#xD;
      files. Participants' survey-response data are stored in the database. The dynamic generation&#xD;
      of the print newsletters in pdf format is done within the application using a dynamic-link&#xD;
      library installed on the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fruit/Vegetable Snacks. We will provide transitional shelter residents assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention group with two pieces of fruit and/or vegetables each weekday. We will offers&#xD;
      fruits/vegetables that are easy to distribute and do not require preparation other than&#xD;
      washing or packaging in a bag (e.g., apples, bananas, oranges, baby carrots, broccoli,&#xD;
      cauliflower). Foods will be purchased by study staff, stored at The Bridge in the cafeteria&#xD;
      refrigerator, and offered to participants assigned to the intervention group in the cafeteria&#xD;
      at specified times twice daily as mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks. Note that because the&#xD;
      snacks will be offered between regular mealtimes, only intervention participants will be in&#xD;
      the cafeteria to receive the fruit/vegetable snacks. In addition, snacks will be consumed in&#xD;
      the cafeteria during specified snack times because the shelter does not allow food in other&#xD;
      areas of the building. Study staff will follow all relevant shelter food safety practices. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that study participants will consume more fruit and vegetables and eat fewer&#xD;
      meals/snacks from fast food restaurants and convenience stores than individuals assigned to&#xD;
      the control group. This is a practical, simple, and direct approach to increasing&#xD;
      fruit/vegetable consumption, as shelter residents obtain most of their meals from the shelter&#xD;
      and offering snacks may discourage residents from seeking less healthful foods elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedometers. Walking is a practical way to achieve physical activity recommendations among&#xD;
      individuals experiencing homelessness, as it does not require any specific equipment and may&#xD;
      be a common activity and means of transportation in this population. Pedometers are small and&#xD;
      inexpensive devices that measure steps walked per day. All study participants will be&#xD;
      provided with a New Lifestyles NL-1000 pedometer/ accelerometer, which measures steps,&#xD;
      distance, and activity minutes and is equipped with a 7-day memory and clock. Those randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention will be instructed to aim for 10,000 steps per day, but to focus&#xD;
      on gradually increasing their steps each day (rather than achieving 10,000 steps right away)&#xD;
      if they are currently very sedentary. In addition, intervention participants will be provided&#xD;
      with information about the Back on My Feet program, which is offered at the Bridge shelter.&#xD;
      Program members meet for a group run/walk 3 times per week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday&#xD;
      mornings. Intervention participants will be instructed to wear their pedometer during waking&#xD;
      hours each day, and asked to return each week over a 4-week period (4 visits total) so that&#xD;
      study staff may record the daily step counts. We will additionally ask participants to return&#xD;
      for a 4-week post-intervention follow-up (we will remind participants to wear their pedometer&#xD;
      the week prior to the assessment). Individuals assigned to the control group will provided&#xD;
      with a pedometer and step goals after the final follow-up visit. All participants may keep&#xD;
      their pedometer after their participation in the study is completed. Note that intervention&#xD;
      and control group participants will be provided with accelerometers at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study to provide an objective measure of physical activity.&#xD;
