  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present prospective NAFLD cohort study (with biobank), of obese subjects with&#xD;
      proven NAFLD based on liver biopsy and/or MRI, is to study factors contributing to the&#xD;
      development of NASH in patients with simple steatosis and to identify and validate&#xD;
      non-invasive markers for the diagnosis of NASH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is with 20-30% the most prevalent liver disorder in&#xD;
      Western society. Most patients with NAFLD have no or few, mainly aspecific symptoms; and&#xD;
      generally there is a silent progression of simple steatosis to NASH and in the end&#xD;
      liver-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further insight in factors contributing to the initiation of NASH in patients with simple&#xD;
      steatosis and early diagnosis are essential for identifying future therapeutic options and to&#xD;
      limit the risk of complicated NASH (i.e. fibrosis, and cirrhosis with portal hypertension)&#xD;
      HCC, liver-related mortality and extrahepatic morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort study, with both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal part, will include obese&#xD;
      subjects (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, age 18-65) with proven NAFLD based on liver biopsy and/or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete several questionnaires (i.e. demographics,&#xD;
      clinical data, SF-36, GAD-7 and PHQ-9, FFQ, SQUASH, and Baecke), and to undergo&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements. Furthermore, blood, urine, faeces and exhaled air will be&#xD;
      collected and a fibroscan and DEXA-scan will be performed. Additionally, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in a multi-sugar test for intestinal permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of eligible subjects will undergo/have undergone a MRI or liver biopsy for&#xD;
      clinical reasons. It is to be expected that about 33% of subjects will be asked to undergo a&#xD;
      MRI for study purpose only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5 and 10 years, participants will be invited to undergo in the same study procedures,&#xD;
      data and sample collection to study the factors responsible for the development of NASH in&#xD;
      the group with simple steatosis at baseline, and the development of (extra)hepatic&#xD;
      complications in the group with NASH at baseline.&#xD;
