  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well elotuzumab works when given with lenalidomide as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy after transplant in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who&#xD;
      underwent transplant using their own stem cells (autologous transplant). Maintenance therapy&#xD;
      is treatment that is given to help keep cancer from coming back after it has disappeared&#xD;
      following the initial treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      elotuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may&#xD;
      stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;
      Adding elotuzumab to standard maintenance therapy with lenalidomide may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with multiple myeloma who have undergone transplant.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish activity of elotuzumab and lenalidomide in the maintenance setting post&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Progression free survival 2. II. Overall survival. III. Determine incidence of secondary&#xD;
      primary malignancy. IV. Evaluate the best response rate (stringent complete response&#xD;
      [sCR]/very good partial response [VGPR]/partial response [PR]) based on International Myeloma&#xD;
      Working Group (IMWG) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate time to progression. VI. Evaluate time to next therapy. VII. Evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability and toxicity. VIII. Perform MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-Myeloma&#xD;
      symptom evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive elotuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 21 of&#xD;
      courses 1-2 and on day 1 of each subsequent course. Patients also receive lenalidomide orally&#xD;
      (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
