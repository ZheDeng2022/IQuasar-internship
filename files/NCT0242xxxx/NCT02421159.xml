      The Brooklyn Community United (BCU) study is a supplement to the main research study titled&#xD;
      &quot;Peer Driven Intervention to Seek, Test, &amp; Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for HIV.&quot; The&#xD;
      main study's field name is Brooklyn Community Action Project (BCAP) (R01DA032083, R#:&#xD;
      11-01257). The main study is testing two approaches to seeking out undiagnosed HIV infection&#xD;
      (Venue-based Sampling (VBS) and Confidential Two-Session Testing with Navigation (CTTN-RDS)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV prevalence rates in two previous heterosexual cycles of NHBS in the local area are: 7% in&#xD;
      HET1 and 12.3% in HET2. The main study, BCAP, found lower prevalence rates of 3.45%, 35.14%&#xD;
      of which were newly diagnosed in the RDS-CTTN sample and 1.89% newly diagnosed with HIV in&#xD;
      the VBS sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the Brooklyn Community United (BCU) study is to seek out individuals with&#xD;
      undiagnosed HIV using a streamlined RDS-CTTN approach, and anonymous HIV Testing in Central&#xD;
      Brooklyn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplement study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (H1): Compared with VBS and RDS-CTTN, and controlling for potential differences on key&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics across the samples, RDS-ASTN participants will have less&#xD;
      HIV testing experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (H2) Controlling for potential differences on key socio-demographic characteristics across&#xD;
      the samples, RDS-ASTN will yield higher rates previously undiagnosed HIV compared with VBS&#xD;
      and RDS-CTTN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (H3): Most participants (&gt; 70%) found to be HIV-infected in the RDS-ASTN intervention will&#xD;
      engage in the Treat and Retain intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (H4): Most participants in the Treat and Retain phase of the RDS-ASTN intervention (&gt; 70%),&#xD;
      all of whom will be HIV infected, will be linked to care within 3 months.&#xD;

      The Brooklyn Community United (BCU) study is a supplement to the main research study to seek,&#xD;
      test, treat and retain heterosexuals at high risk for HIV. The main research study is&#xD;
      entitled &quot;Peer Driven Intervention to Seek, Test, &amp; Treat Heterosexuals at High Risk for&#xD;
      HIV.&quot; The main study's field name is Brooklyn Community Action Project or BCAP (R01DA032083,&#xD;
      R#: 11-01257). The main study is testing two approaches to seeking out undiagnosed HIV&#xD;
      infection (Venue-based Sampling and Confidential Two-Session Testing with Navigation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have studied HHR in New York City as part of the CDC's National HIV Behavioral&#xD;
      Surveillance (NHBS) studies. Building on the NHBS work, we are currently in our third year of&#xD;
      the main study (R01DA032083, R#: 11-01257), the primary aim of which is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of a peer-driven intervention that uses a respondent-driven sampling strategy&#xD;
      (&quot;RDS-CTTN&quot;) and venue-based sampling (VBS) with respect to identifying previously&#xD;
      undiagnosed HIV infection. The main study is located in central Brooklyn, a high-risk area&#xD;
      (HRA) with elevated rates of poverty, high heterosexual HIV prevalence, and where a&#xD;
      generalized HIV epidemic may be said to exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, RDS-CTTN and VBS have enrolled approximately 45% of their samples (RDS-CTTN&#xD;
      1338/3000; VBS 174/400). Participants in both samples evidence high rates of risk factors&#xD;
      (substance use, incarceration, homelessness, unemployment). As hypothesized, PDI/RDS is&#xD;
      reaching a population with higher rates of risk factors, and lower rates of HIV testing&#xD;
      compared to VBS. Almost all in RDS-CTTN and VBS had been tested at least once previously (&gt;&#xD;
      86%), but fewer than half have been tested in the past year. Among those with lifetime&#xD;
      testing, data suggest testing is infrequent with a median of 2.5 tests per ten years of&#xD;
      adulthood. Interestingly, almost all of those who enroll in RDS-CTTN and VBS elected to test&#xD;
      for HIV (&gt; 90%), with no difference in HIV testing acceptance rates between those who tested&#xD;
      previously and first-time testers. This suggests that those who enroll in the study, although&#xD;
      they have known barriers to HIV testing and a range of risk factors for adverse outcomes, are&#xD;
      open to confidential HIV testing. These findings support the promise of the RDS-CTTN&#xD;
      approach, but preliminary studies also signal the need to reach those with the greatest fears&#xD;
      of and barriers to HIV testing who will not engage in confidential testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With approximately 45% of the sample enrolled, HIV prevalence in the RDS-CTTN sample is 3.45%&#xD;
      (37/1071); 35.14% of these are newly diagnosed (13/37). Rates of newly diagnosed HIV&#xD;
      infection may continue to increase as recruitment chains reach deeper into hidden and more&#xD;
      vulnerable components of networks. In VBS, 1.89% is newly diagnosed with HIV (3/159). Yet&#xD;
      these HIV prevalence rates are lower than those found in two previous heterosexual cycles of&#xD;
      NHBS in the local area: 7% in HET1 and 12.3% in HET2 spurring our interest in additional&#xD;
      innovative strategies to seek out those with undiagnosed HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its high acceptability among enrolled participants and preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy, the two-session RDS-CTTN approach may be less successful in enrolling those in the&#xD;
      HRA who would decline confidential HIV testing in a formal setting or have poor access to&#xD;
      such testing. The RDS-CTTN intervention may not be optimal for reaching those with the&#xD;
      greatest psychosocial barriers to regular HIV testing, who may for a number of reasons have&#xD;
      high rates of undiagnosed HIV, or individuals, particularly women, with multiple job and&#xD;
      family responsibilities who may not have time for a two-session intervention. (Indeed women&#xD;
      are under-represented in both RDS-CTTN [~ 40%] and VBS [~30%].) It is possible to test&#xD;
      participants for HIV in a first encounter, aswe do in VBS and as other studies have done. In&#xD;
      the supplement study, we build on lessons learned from themain study in progress and the&#xD;
      literature to address this concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymous testing is available in state and local health departments, in cases of&#xD;
      occupational exposure, through home test/self-test technologies, and research studies&#xD;
      including our local NHBS studies with HHR. There is some evidence to suggest individuals who&#xD;
      test anonymously do so earlier in the course of their HIV disease than those who engage in&#xD;
      confidential testing. Additionally, anonymous testing may be useful for and/or preferred by&#xD;
      individuals from marginalized populations. As Kegeles and colleagues have found, many who&#xD;
      seek anonymous HIV-antibody testing would avoid it under other circumstances, and anonymous&#xD;
      testing may be preferred among those who suspect they are infected, and by bisexual&#xD;
      individuals, and those who fear stigma and discrimination. Thus, a brief, anonymous HIV&#xD;
      testing effort may appeal to and engage HHR who face barriers to confidential HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While anonymous testing may be an effective and/or efficient strategy in the 'seek' phase of&#xD;
      STTR, in the majority of studies and testing programs it does not address the vital step of&#xD;
      linkage to care. Although anonymous testing tends to yield individuals earlier in their HIV&#xD;
      disease, those who test anonymously are more likely to experience delays entering care,&#xD;
      because anonymous testing sites and programs do not typically have the resources to engage&#xD;
      individuals into linkage programs and are not co-located with medical care. For example, in a&#xD;
      study of characteristics of the HIV testing encounter and linkage to care, Reed (2009) found&#xD;
      that 36% of those testing anonymously did not enter care within three months of diagnosis,&#xD;
      compared with 26% of those testing confidentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplement study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (H1): Compared with VBS and RDS-CTTN, and controlling for potential differences on key&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics across the samples, RDS-ASTN participants will have less&#xD;
      HIV testing experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (H2) Controlling for potential differences on key socio-demographic characteristics across&#xD;
      the samples, RDS-ASTN will yield higher rates previously undiagnosed HIV compared with VBS&#xD;
      and RDS-CTTN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (H3): Most participants (&gt; 70%) found to be HIV-infected in the RDS-ASTN intervention will&#xD;
      engage in the Treat and Retain intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (H4): Most participants in the Treat and Retain phase of the RDS-ASTN intervention (&gt; 70%),&#xD;
      all of whom will be HIV infected, will be linked to care within 3 months.&#xD;
