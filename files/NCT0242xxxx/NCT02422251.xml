      The aim of the project is to compare the biomechanics of three different bearing designs used&#xD;
      in total knee replacement (TKR) implants. The bearing is the part in the middle of the knee&#xD;
      implant that allows the metal tray attached to the shin bone (tibia) to move in relation to&#xD;
      the metal part attached to the thigh bone (femur) and is usually made of plastic (high&#xD;
      density polyethylene). There will be three different bearing types in the study, which all&#xD;
      give different movements. This study will see which bearing is most like a natural knee and&#xD;
      so which design gives the best function and feeling to patients with a TKR. 90 TKR patients&#xD;
      from the Golden Jubilee National Hospital will be recruited and randomised to receive one of&#xD;
      the three study bearings (30 in each group). In addition, a control group of 30 healthy&#xD;
      individuals of similar age will be recruited for comparison. Before surgery and at 4 to 8&#xD;
      weeks and 1 year after their operation patients will attend biomechanical assessment sessions&#xD;
      at the University of Strathclyde. The control group will attend the assessment session only&#xD;
      once. In each of these sessions they will carry out a number of everyday tasks such as&#xD;
      walking, moving from sitting to standing and going up and down stairs. These tasks will be&#xD;
      measured using motion capture techniques. Reflective markers placed on each participant will&#xD;
      be tracked by cameras so that their movements can be recorded. Force plates in the floor will&#xD;
      record the forces during the tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement and force data will be analysed to see if any differences exist between the groups&#xD;
      and show which bearing gives the most natural movement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind randomised controlled trial. The aim of the study is to compare the&#xD;
      biomechanical performance of knee replacements with different bearing designs to that of a&#xD;
      native or natural knee. The hypothesis is that a mobile bearing design with a high congruency&#xD;
      bearing will allow the knee replacement to work more like the native knee and give more&#xD;
      natural movement when carrying out everyday tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current evidence on whether fixed or mobile, low or high congruency bearings give the&#xD;
      most natural movement or provide better knee function is sparse. By carrying out a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial including a cohort of healthy individuals and taking indepth functional&#xD;
      assessments of a number of different common activities of daily living it should be possible&#xD;
      to show what level of functional outcome the three bearings being used give.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ninety patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty under the care of four consultant&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital who meet the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be recruited and randomised into one of the three study groups (low congruency&#xD;
      fixed bearing, high congruency fixed bearing or high congruency mobile bearing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitation letters and participant information sheets will be sent out to suitable patients&#xD;
      prior to their preoperative consultation. They will be approached at their consultation visit&#xD;
      to seek consent to take part in the study. At this time they will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      ask questions about the study. Following written consent, the patient will be randomised&#xD;
      using sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. A nominated person, independent of the&#xD;
      approach and consent of the patient, will sign and open the envelope and inform the hospital&#xD;
      research team of the randomisation. The patient and the university research team will be&#xD;
      blinded to randomisation. For each patient arrangements will be made for their preoperative&#xD;
      movement analysis testing session. Subsequently, they will have their surgery and&#xD;
      rehabilitation prior to discharge according to standard hospital practice. Participants will&#xD;
      then return to the hospital for standard follow up appointments at six weeks and one year. At&#xD;
      the same time arrangements will be made for them to attend their follow up movement analysis&#xD;
      sessions. Clinical data recorded at preoperative assessment and postoperative follow up&#xD;
      appointments, such as range of movement, Oxford Knee Score, patient satisfaction, EQ5D and&#xD;
      radiographic measurements will be collected for study patients to compare to the functional&#xD;
      outcomes measured during the movement analysis sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend movement analysis testing sessions at the University of&#xD;
      Strathclyde in Glasgow on three separate occasions; preoperatively, at 4 to 8 weeks&#xD;
      postoperatively and at one year postoperatively. Each of these sessions will follow the same&#xD;
      procedure. Prior to data collection, participants will be asked to change into the tight&#xD;
      fitting shorts and vest tops provided (male participants will be asked to forego the vest&#xD;
      tops) in the changing rooms within the laboratory facility. Measurements of weight and body&#xD;
      dimensions will be taken (required for processing the data) and then reflective markers will&#xD;
      be attached to the legs, pelvis, torso and arms. These will be attached using toupee tape or&#xD;
      elasticated straps as required. They will be asked to wear a headband (provided) with another&#xD;
      four markers attached on their head. There will be eight activities of daily living (ADLs) in&#xD;
      the test protocol, which will be carried out in one of two laboratories; one a standard&#xD;
      motion capture laboratory (S) and the other in a laboratory with a CAREN system (Motek&#xD;
      Medical, Amsterdam, Netherlands) which consists of a virtual reality screen, moving platform&#xD;
      and treadmill (M). The ADLs will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Level walking in a straight line (S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Level walking along a curved pathway (S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sit to stand to sit (S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sit to stand to walk (S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ascending and descending stairs (S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Getting into and out of a car (S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Single leg balance (M)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Walking on an incline (M)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to perform each ADL in a fixed order several times until three&#xD;
      good sets of data have been collected. Participants will be given instructions on how to&#xD;
      perform each ADL prior to performing it and will be asked to practice them before data is&#xD;
      collected. During the demanding tasks, participants will be supported by a harness to prevent&#xD;
      falls and hand rails will be provided on the test staircase. Participants will be allowed&#xD;
      rest breaks between each ADL and during tests if required. At the end of each task the&#xD;
      participant will be asked a set of questions about how they found performing the task. On&#xD;
      completion of the test protocol, the markers will be removed, the participant will get&#xD;
      changed and will be free to leave. It is expected that each testing session will last up to 4&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three good data sets will be averaged to reduce variability. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out using an appropriate statistical package to determine if any significant&#xD;
      differences exist in the data between the three patient groups and between the patient groups&#xD;
      and the control group. All data will be tested for parametricity. Parametric data will be&#xD;
      analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests with post hoc Bonferroni correction. If the&#xD;
      data is found to be nonparametric, KruskalWallis tests will be used. For data over time&#xD;
      appropriate repeated measures analysis will be used. A 95% confidence level will be used&#xD;
      throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being funded over a three year period. The first year involves the set up and&#xD;
      development of the protocol and the recruitment of the control participants. It is hoped that&#xD;
      the recruitment of the patients will start nine months into the study period and will take 25&#xD;
      months to complete the data collection and analysis. This will allow two months for the&#xD;
      reporting of the study.&#xD;
