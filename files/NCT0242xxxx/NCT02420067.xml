    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate how best to screen for Endolymphatic sac tumors&#xD;
      (ELSTs) in von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) patients in order to diagnose the ELSTs while they are&#xD;
      still small so that hearing loss can be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 16% of vHL patients are known to develop endolymphatic sac tumors in the inner ear that&#xD;
      can cause permanent hearing loss. However, the ELSTs are often not found before hearing loss&#xD;
      has already occurred. The challenge for doctors is to diagnose the ELSTs at early stages&#xD;
      before they cause often irreversible deafness. In order to find ELSTs before they cause&#xD;
      hearing loss, it is important to screen for the tumors prophylactically, that is screen all&#xD;
      vHL patients regardless of whether or not they have symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who can join? Persons diagnosed with vHL who are at least 15 years old. The investigators&#xD;
      include patients WITH OR WITHOUT a diagnosed ELST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What does it involve? You need to have a hearing test and an MRI of the brain, where the&#xD;
      inner ear can be seen, most vHL patients have already had this done as part of their&#xD;
      surveillance program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to participate in follow up examinations (hearing test and/or MRI&#xD;
      of the brain) after 2, 5, and 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How can I join? A doctor has to be responsible for the study in each country where vHL&#xD;
      patients participates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ask the doctor who manages your vHL examinations to contact us or contact us yourself and the&#xD;
      investigators will help you find a doctor in your country who will participate in the study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) is a hereditary multi-system disease requiring life-long&#xD;
      prophylactic surveillance. Affected individuals are predisposed to development of tumors and&#xD;
      cysts in multiple organs. In recent years, it has become apparent that endolymphatic sac&#xD;
      tumors (ELSTs), aggressive tumors of the petrous bone, occur in up to 16% of vHL patients.&#xD;
      ELST can lead to severe and progressive hearing loss and vertigo as well as other&#xD;
      audio-vestibular and neurological symptoms. However, surgical excision of tumors can preserve&#xD;
      patients' pre-operative hearing level, and eliminate most other audio-vestibular symptoms. As&#xD;
      even small ELSTs have been shown to lead to sudden and irreversible deafness, timely&#xD;
      diagnosis of ELSTs is essential to prevent severe audio-vestibular morbidity in ELST&#xD;
      patients. Several recommendations of ELST surveillance in vHL patients have been proposed;&#xD;
      some suggest that diagnostic tests for ELST should be done only in vHL patients with&#xD;
      subjective audio-vestibular symptoms, while others recommend audiological examinations or MRI&#xD;
      of the inner ear in all vHL patients as a screening tool. However, there has not previously&#xD;
      been much focus on specification of screening strategies, and it is not known, which is the&#xD;
      most optimal approach. The results of a national study of ELST surveillance among Danish vHL&#xD;
      patients indicated that specific patterns of audiologic parameters in patients with ELSTs,&#xD;
      indicating that a distinct audiologic pattern may be typical in ELST development, perhaps&#xD;
      even before the ELST is detectable on MRI. However, a larger study of audiologic parameters&#xD;
      in vHL patients with and without diagnosed ELSTs is needed in order to fully investigate such&#xD;
      a model and its use in early ELST detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The overall objective of this study is to establish audiologic characteristics&#xD;
      among vHL patients with and without ELST, and investigate whether specific patterns in&#xD;
      audiometric parameters correspond to different stages in ELST development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multi-center prospective cohort study that includes adult vHL patients, who&#xD;
      are followed with clinical interviews about subjective audio-vestibular symptoms, MRI of the&#xD;
      inner ear, and audiometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of all subjects' audiological and radiologic examinations will be collected at the&#xD;
      Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Copenhagen. Results will be&#xD;
      blinded with regard to ELST history and radiologic results and evaluated by a single senior&#xD;
      ear-nose-and-throat specialist, who will look for specific patterns in audiologic parameters&#xD;
      over time. Radiologic images will be blinded with regard to symptoms and audiological&#xD;
      examination results and will be evaluated by a single radiology specialist, who will look&#xD;
      only at the inner ear and surrounding structures for presence of imaging-visible ELSTs and&#xD;
      evaluate size and pattern of growth of ELSTs if possible. Audiometric characteristics will be&#xD;
      correlated with presence of MRI visible ELSTs and patients' subjectively reported&#xD;
      audio-vestibular symptoms to determine whether specific patterns of audiological parameters&#xD;
      are distinct for ELSTs and their stages of tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A followed-up of all study participants is planned after 2, 5 and 10 years after patients'&#xD;
      last assessed audiological examinations included in the initial study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiators of the project are responsible for evaluation and analysis of data, and are&#xD;
      required to inform local project managers of any differences in their evaluation of&#xD;
      examinations compared to the local evaluations of the same examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local project managers are required to inform all of their local participants the results of&#xD;
      their examinations. If any ELSTs are found in participants, local project managers must offer&#xD;
      management of the ELSTs according to local recommendations. The initiators of the project&#xD;
      will offer help and counseling in relation to ELST management and treatment if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerations of biomedical research ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish part of the study has been approved by the Danish Regional Committees on&#xD;
      Biomedical Research, who have also approved that results from all participating institutions&#xD;
      outside of Denmark can be collected and analyzed in Denmark. Each participating institution&#xD;
      outside of Denmark must make sure that the study is also approved according to regional law.&#xD;
      Oral and written consent must be obtained from all subjects, and results must be coded before&#xD;
      data is sent to Denmark for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have approval for the study from the Danish Data Protection Agency. All&#xD;
      data analysis will take place under the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will clarify the significance of audiologic examination in ELST&#xD;
      surveillance and improve ELST screening for vHL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be published in international, scientific journals. Collaborators will be&#xD;
      included ad co-authors in any publications of the results of this study according to&#xD;
      Vancouver rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is financially supported as a subproject of a larger PhD project. Salary of the&#xD;
      PhD student, Marie Louise Mølgaard Binderup is financed by the Danish Cancer Society with&#xD;
      approximately181,000 Euros, while the expenses of operation of the PhD project is supported&#xD;
      by the Lundbeck Foundation with approximately 65,000 Euros, of which approximately 4,000&#xD;
      Euros is estimated to be used for expenses of the present subproject. The supporting&#xD;
      organisations solely provide financial support and have no influence on study design, the&#xD;
      execution of study, or publication of results. Initiators of this project will not apply for&#xD;
      further financial support for this subproject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborating institutions and participating patients will not receive any financial support&#xD;
      from the mentioned sources.&#xD;
