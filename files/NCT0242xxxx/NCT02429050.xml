  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is the most reported symptom of patients with advanced Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD) and is undertreated. Morphine is an effective treatment for dyspnea and is&#xD;
      recommended in clinical practice guidelines, but questions concerning benefits and concerns&#xD;
      about respiratory adverse effects remain. For example, the effect on health-related quality&#xD;
      of life and functional capacity is unknown. In one-third of the patients oral sustained&#xD;
      release morphine (morphine SR) doesn't relieve dyspnea and it remains unknown whether&#xD;
      severity and descriptors of breathlessness may predict a response to morphine. Finally,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of morphine SR in this patient group is unknown. Therefore, prescription&#xD;
      of morphine to patients with COPD is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this double blind randomized controlled trial are to study the effect of oral&#xD;
      administration of morphine SR on health-related quality of life, respiratory adverse effects,&#xD;
      and functional capacity; to explore whether description and severity of breathlessness are&#xD;
      related with a clinically relevant response to morphine and to analyse the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of morphine SR. The study population will consist of 124 clinically stable outpatients with&#xD;
      COPD and severe dyspnea despite optimal pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be outpatients with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD, who suffer from severe&#xD;
      dyspnea despite optimal pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited at CIRO, a center for pulmonary rehabilitation in the Netherlands after they&#xD;
      completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program. After providing informed consent, patients will&#xD;
      be randomized. Members of the research team who perform measurements will be blinded for&#xD;
      treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive regular clinical care and morphine SR 10mg,&#xD;
      administered twice daily (20mg/24h), which can be increased after one or two weeks to three&#xD;
      times per day 10mg (30mg/24h) in non-responders. Patients will be defined as non-responders&#xD;
      if the mean dyspnea numeric rating scale (NRS) score was not reduced by 1 point in comparison&#xD;
      with baseline. The control group will receive regular clinical care and placebo medication.&#xD;
      Patients will receive morphine or placebo for four weeks. In addition, both groups will&#xD;
      receive a prescription for a laxative and metoclopramide at the start of the intervention and&#xD;
      will be instructed to adjust the dose as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the intervention period has ended, participants can choose to continue morphine&#xD;
      treatment. They will be followed for twelve weeks to assess their healthcare use, use of&#xD;
      morphine and number of adverse effects and exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements at baseline will include: demographics, medical history, medication,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, exercise capacity, respiratory parameters, generic and disease-specific&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), severity of dyspnea, sensory and affective dimensions&#xD;
      of dyspnea, impact of dyspnea, cognition, level of daytime sleepiness, and functional&#xD;
      capacity. A member of the research team will visit patients after 1 and 2 weeks in their home&#xD;
      environment to assess adverse effects, compliance, exacerbations, disease-specific HRQoL,&#xD;
      mobility, severity of dyspnea, and some respiratory parameters. A member of the research team&#xD;
      will call the patient after 2 days and 3 weeks to assess adverse effects, compliance,&#xD;
      exacerbations, and severity of dyspnea. After 4 weeks the following measurements will be&#xD;
      performed: respiratory parameters, exercise capacity, general and disease-specific HRQoL,&#xD;
      sensory and affective dimensions of dyspnea, impact of dyspnea, functional capacity, and&#xD;
      adverse effects. Overnight oximetry will be performed in the home environment at baseline and&#xD;
      after four weeks. A diary for costs and healthcare use will be filled in during four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements during the twelve weeks following the intervention include: retrospective cost&#xD;
      questionnaire, generic and disease-specific quality of life severity of dyspnea and adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics will be compared between the intervention and&#xD;
      control group using descriptive statistics. Chi square tests will be used for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Independent sample T-tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests will be used for continuous&#xD;
      variables, according to the variable distribution. Change in CAT-score, respiratory&#xD;
      parameters and 6MWD between baseline and four weeks will be compared between patients in the&#xD;
      intervention and the control group. First, mean change in CAT-score, respiratory parameters&#xD;
      and 6MWD will be compared between the two groups using an independent sample T-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test, according to the variable distribution. Afterwards, multivariate&#xD;
      analyses for longitudinal data will be performed. Analyses will be done using an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat approach. The relationship between response to opioids and severity of&#xD;
      dyspnea and descriptors of breathlessness will be explored using univariate analysis,&#xD;
      followed by a binary logistic regression model. A trial-based economic evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed, based on empirical data obtained in the RCT. The economic evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed from the societal and healthcare perspective, the first including costs inside and&#xD;
      outside the health care sector, and will follow published international guidelines. The time&#xD;
      horizon of the trial-based economic evaluation will be four weeks. The outcomes of the twelve&#xD;
      weeks following the intervention will be used in the model-based economic evaluation. The&#xD;
      model will probably take the form of a Markov model; however this will be decided upon during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
