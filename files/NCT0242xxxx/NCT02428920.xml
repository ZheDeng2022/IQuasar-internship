  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Grenada Heart Project (GHP) conducted an observational study within a randomly selected&#xD;
      adult sample of Grenadians in 2008-2009. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical,&#xD;
      biological and psychosocial determinants of the cardiovascular health in Grenada, in order to&#xD;
      develop and implement a nationwide cardiovascular health promotion program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of 2,827 adults was randomly selected from the national electronic voter list. The&#xD;
      main outcome measures were self-reported cardiovascular disease and behavioral risk factors,&#xD;
      anthropometric measures, blood pressure (BP), point-of-care testing for glucose and lipids,&#xD;
      and ankle-brachial index. Analysis of the data revealed prevalence rates of obesity,&#xD;
      hypertension and diabetes significantly exceeding those seen in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the completion of this assessment, an additional effort has contributed significantly&#xD;
      to the current project. A parallel community health-promotion project was carried out in&#xD;
      Cardona, Spain called the &quot;Cardona Integral Fifty-Fifty&quot; project with 80 subjects. The&#xD;
      preliminary results of the Cardona study have a shown that peer motivation may significantly&#xD;
      improve healthy behaviors and thus modify cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GHP CHANGE community -based intervention aims to promote positive behaviors and focus&#xD;
      more on what creates health, rather than what prevents sickness. It is built on the&#xD;
      foundations of social support, assessing whether people going through similar challenges will&#xD;
      support each other, work together to identify and address barriers to success, and motivate&#xD;
      each other to move forward. In this program we test for the impact of promotion of healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors through peer motivation on blood pressure, physical activity, eating&#xD;
      behavior, weight, and smoking.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This culturally-tailored intervention program will take place over a 12-month period in the&#xD;
      following four regions on the island:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  St. David's Parish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  St. Andrew's Parish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  St. George's Parish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  St. John's/St. Mark's Parish (combined ) •The program will involve approximately 400&#xD;
           randomized participants (100 from each region). Participants, aged 18-70, from each&#xD;
           parish will be divided into one of two groups: Intervention Group arm (peer support) or&#xD;
           Control Group arm (individual study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will identify study participants previously enrolled in the Grenada Heart&#xD;
      Project, with at least one vascular risk factor, as defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III&#xD;
      guidelines which include: elevated BP, increased blood glucose level, increased waist&#xD;
      circumference, minimal reported physical activity, minimally reported fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      intake, or current smoking habits. Given a 10% refusal rate and 10% failure rate in the&#xD;
      run-in phase, 120 participants from each site will be invited randomly, from the high risk&#xD;
      group, to recruit for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants are invited to attend an informational half-day session, during&#xD;
      which a general overview of the program is presented and participants have an opportunity to&#xD;
      have any questions answered. During this session, eligible and interested individuals&#xD;
      complete the written consent forms. Upon consenting, participants are informed of their&#xD;
      randomization arm (education intervention or group intervention) and entered into a run-in&#xD;
      phase. All participants receive a notebook, as well as certain health literate materials,&#xD;
      provided by the American Heart Association. The educational materials will promote management&#xD;
      of risk factors and the notebook will provide an avenue for recording of lifestyle behaviors,&#xD;
      such as health goals, BP values, and eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Participants enrolled in the run-in phase will complete the following assessments at three&#xD;
      time points (baseline, 6-months, and 12-months):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GHP data collection form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International physical activity questionnaire (iPAQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lifestyle Assessment [modified SF-36 questionnaire tailored to the Grenadian population]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Point-of-care testing using an LDX analyzer (solely for the 12 month assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a &quot;GHP Health outcomes Score&quot; which captures a person's&#xD;
      health profile on a 0-to-3 point scale related to smoking habits, overweight, sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle, and hypertension During the run-in phase, participants will attend a series of&#xD;
      core lifestyle and risk factor education workshops related to motivation for change,&#xD;
      nutrition (two sessions), smoking cessation, physical education and BP control. Only those&#xD;
      participants who attend 4 of the 6 sessions will be eligible for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to the intervention arm or to the control arm,&#xD;
      stratified by parish. In the group intervention arm a group leader will be selected&#xD;
      internally within the support groups, who will receive additional training from the research&#xD;
      team in regards to group motivation and facilitation. Those randomized into the Intervention&#xD;
      arm will be organized into peer groups of approximately 10 persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Hypothesis: Individuals will show an improvement of health-related behaviors&#xD;
      through directed peer education groups (intervention group), compared to the individuals not&#xD;
      receiving such peer support (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Hypothesis: Individuals will show an improvement in their quality of life&#xD;
      through directed peer education groups (intervention group), compared to the individuals not&#xD;
      receiving such peer support (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Hypothesis: Individuals will show an improvement in cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors through directed peer education groups (intervention group), compared to the&#xD;
      individuals not receiving such peer support (control group).&#xD;
