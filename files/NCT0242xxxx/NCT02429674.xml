      The focus of this study is on identifying how Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents&#xD;
      (IPT-A) with depression works to change sleep and related biological markers found in saliva,&#xD;
      namely cortisol and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. The long-term goal of this project is&#xD;
      to understand the biological mechanisms of recovery from depression in order to assist in&#xD;
      selecting and guiding personalized psychotherapeutic interventions with the highest&#xD;
      likelihood of success for individual adolescents with depression.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this project is to examine whether adolescent depression and the&#xD;
      associated symptoms of sleep disturbance are best treated using an empirically supported&#xD;
      psychotherapy that is augmented with a sleep improvement module. Twenty adolescents (ages&#xD;
      12-17) who meet criteria for major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive&#xD;
      disorder not otherwise specified, or adjustment disorder with depressed mood and also report&#xD;
      elevated levels of sleep disturbance will receive Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed&#xD;
      Adolescents (IPT-A) with an adjunctive sleep module that is integrated throughout the&#xD;
      treatment. Identifying the best approach to treating both the adolescent's depression and the&#xD;
      commonly associated symptom of sleep disturbance will have significant implications for the&#xD;
      long-term outcomes of depressed adolescents. Moreover, identifying unique symptom and&#xD;
      biological profiles at the outset of treatment may enable doctors to predict treatment&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

    <description>The goal of IPT-A is to decrease depressive symptoms by focusing on current interpersonal difficulties and helping the adolescent improve his or her relationships and interpersonal interactions. This is accomplished through psychoeducation about the adolescent's depression and its link to interpersonal relationships, review of the adolescent's significant relationships, identification of interpersonal problem areas on which to focus the treatment, development of interpersonal problem solving and communication skills, and role-playing. The sleep disturbances intervention will include several modules selected because they are successful treatments for insomnia, and/or may help promote adherence to some of the recommendations related to sleep.</description>
