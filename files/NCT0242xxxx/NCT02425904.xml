  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called clofarabine as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) and and other histiocytic disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational intervention, to learn whether the drug works in treating&#xD;
      a specific disease, in this case, clofarabine to treat LCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is still being studied. It also means that the&#xD;
      FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved clofarabine for your&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clofarabine is a chemotherapy drug that has been used and is approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of leukemia in children and adults. Information from other research studies&#xD;
      suggests that this drug may also be effective in participants with LCH and other histiocytic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior diagnosis of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (stratum 1) or LCH-related disorder&#xD;
             (stratum 2) established by standard diagnostic criteria and confirmed histologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active disease (histological confirmation of reactivation or progression&#xD;
             is not required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance Score &gt; 70% (use Lansky score for age &lt; 16 and Karnofsky score for age =&#xD;
             &gt;16).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of all ages will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide signed written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In stratum 1, patients must have failed one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen. In&#xD;
             stratum 2, RDD patients must have failed treatment with corticosteroid. ECD patients&#xD;
             who have confirmed BRAF V600E mutation must have failed treatment with a BRAF&#xD;
             inhibitor or are not considered to be eligible for such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no limitation of amount or the type of prior therapy or drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to enrollment. Male and female patients must use an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method during the study and for a minimum of 6 months after study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of&#xD;
             the study, and able to provide valid informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate marrow functions as defined below, except those with&#xD;
             involvement of hematopoietic system for whom these criteria can be waived:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750 cells/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥75,000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ functions as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal unless it is&#xD;
                  related to involvement by LCH&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate renal function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pediatric Population (patients &lt; 18 years): Creatinine within normal limits or&#xD;
                  calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 as&#xD;
                  calculated by the Schwartz formula for estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&#xD;
                  where GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) = k x Height (cm)/serum creatinine (mg/dl). k is a&#xD;
                  proportionality constant which varies with age and is a function of urinary&#xD;
                  creatinine excretion per unit of body size; 0.45 up to 12 months of age; 0.55&#xD;
                  children and adolescent girls; and 0.70 adolescent boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adult Population (patients &gt;= 18 years): Serum creatinine less than or equal to&#xD;
                  1.0 mg/dL; if serum creatinine &gt;1.0 mg/dL, then the estimated glomerular&#xD;
                  filtration rate (GFR) must be &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by the&#xD;
                  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation where Predicted GFR (ml/min/1.73&#xD;
                  m2) = 186 x (Serum Creatinine)-1.154 x (age in years)-0.203 x (0.742 if patient&#xD;
                  is female) x (1.212 if patient is black), where serum creatinine is measured in&#xD;
                  mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.&#xD;
             Corticosteroid treatment is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents targeting&#xD;
             Histiocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clofarabine is excreted primarily by the kidneys. Therefore, drugs with known renal&#xD;
             toxicity (e.g.vancomycin, amphotericin B, acyclovir, cyclosporin, methotrexate,&#xD;
             tacrolimus) should be avoided to the extent possible during the 5 days of clofarabine&#xD;
             treatment in each cycle or, if required, administered cautiously and with close&#xD;
             monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of alternative medications (e.g., herbal or botanical that could interfere with&#xD;
             clofarabine) is not permitted during the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because clofarabine is a nucleoside analog&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment&#xD;
             of the mother with clofarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with clofarabine. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),&#xD;
             elevated conjugated serum bilirubin at study entry, uncontrolled systemic fungal,&#xD;
             bacterial, or other infection, a history of hepatitis B or C infection or a history of&#xD;
             cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy are&#xD;
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with clofarabine.&#xD;
             In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated&#xD;
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
