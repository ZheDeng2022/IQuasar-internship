      Nab-paclitaxel (interchangeable with ABRAXANE and ABI-007) is a unique protein formulation of&#xD;
      a noncrystalline, amorphous form of paclitaxel in an insoluble particle state. Nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      was designed to improve the chemotherapeutic effects of paclitaxel by exploiting endogenous&#xD;
      transport pathways to deliver higher doses of paclitaxel to the tumor and to reduce the&#xD;
      solvent-related hypersensitivity and other toxicities associated with TaxolÂ® (paclitaxel)&#xD;
      injections, the solvent Cremophor EL, and ethanol vehicle. Nab-paclitaxel provides more rapid&#xD;
      tissue distribution and increased tumor accumulation compared to cremophor-EL paclitaxel.&#xD;
      Mechanistically, albumin receptor-mediated transport across the endothelium, binding to&#xD;
      interstitial proteins, and macropinocytic or receptor-mediated uptake into tumor cells as&#xD;
      well as sequestration of paclitaxel by cremophor-EL may contribute to the observed&#xD;
      differences. Furthermore, nab-paclitaxel synergizes with gemcitabine in preclinical models.&#xD;
      The Cremophor EL-free medium enables nab-paclitaxel to be given at a higher dose and in a&#xD;
      shorter duration without the need for premedication to prevent solvent-related&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions. As of March 2014, nab-paclitaxel is approved under the trade name&#xD;
      of ABRAXANE in over 45 countries/regions, including the US, Canada, India, European&#xD;
      Union/European Economic Area, South Korea, China, Australia, Bhutan, United Arab Emirates,&#xD;
      Nepal, New Zealand, Japan, Russia, Sri Lanka, Argentina, Hong Kong, and Lebanon for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. ABRAXANE is also approved for the&#xD;
      first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in&#xD;
      the US, Japan, Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand, for treatment of advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer in Japan, and for first-line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in&#xD;
      the US, EU/EEA, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina.&#xD;

      Preclinical studies have demonstrated that nab-paclitaxel may play a role in sensitizing the&#xD;
      tumor to chemotherapeutic agents and specifically increases the antitumor efficacy when&#xD;
      combined with gemcitabine. While the mechanism of action for the synergy is unclear,&#xD;
      preclinical studies have generated hypothetical models. One hypothesis is a remodeling and&#xD;
      weakening of the stroma barrier, allowing the chemotherapeutic agents to have better access&#xD;
      to the tumor cells. Weakening the tumor-stroma barrier is particularly important in cancer&#xD;
      that is characterized by dense stroma, such as pancreatic cancer. In mice with primary&#xD;
      patient derived pancreatic tumor xenografts, nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus&#xD;
      gemcitabine alone resulted in increased tumor regression and depleted the desmoplastic stroma&#xD;
      as observed by the less dense, disorganized, wisps of collagen type1 fibers after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. In this study, the intratumoral concentration of gemcitabine was increased by&#xD;
      2.8-fold after 5 days of treatment when nab-paclitaxel was added to gemcitabine. It was&#xD;
      hypothesized that nab-paclitaxel may play a role in reducing the dense stroma and may have&#xD;
      contributed to the increased intratumoral gemcitabine uptake. Additional preclinical studies&#xD;
      in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, coadministration of&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine also demonstrated tumor regression and increased intratumoral&#xD;
      gemcitabine levels after 8 days of treatment. Apoptosis of tumor epithelial cells were&#xD;
      observed; however, there were no changes in stromal components or collagen density in this&#xD;
      short term treatment model. The increased intratumoral gemcitabine levels were attributed to&#xD;
      a marked decrease in the primary gemcitabine metabolizing enzyme, cytidine deaminase, by&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel. Finally, a recent clinical study in subjects with resectable pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer treated with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine showed reduction in fibrotic&#xD;
      collagenous stroma, further supporting a stroma active mechanism for nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a clinical Phase 1/2 dose ranging study (CA040, NCT003980860), nab-paclitaxel plus&#xD;
      gemcitabine (CA040, NCT003980860) antitumor activity and tolerability were established in&#xD;
      patients who had no prior treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer. The maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose and recommended dose for further studies was determined to be 125 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      in combination with 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the subsequent randomized international Phase 3 study (MPACT, CA046, NCT00394251) that&#xD;
      enrolled 861 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, nab-paclitaxel in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine exhibited a clinically meaningful, statistically significant improvement in OS&#xD;
      and progression-free survival (PFS). The median OS (primary endpoint) in the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      population was 8.5 months (95% CI = 7.89-9.53) with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine compared with&#xD;
      6.7 months (95 % CI = 6.01-7.23) with gemcitabine, p &lt; 0.0001, HR = 0.72 (95% CI =&#xD;
      0.617-0.835). Long-term survival was improved in the nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine arm versus&#xD;
      gemcitabine alone, with a 59% increase at 1 year (35% versus 22%) and doubling at 2 years (9%&#xD;
      versus 4%). The secondary (PFS, overall response rate [ORR]) and all other efficacy endpoints&#xD;
      showed consistent, statistically significant improvements with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine,&#xD;
      supporting the results from the primary analysis of OS. Specifically, PFS (by independent&#xD;
      review) was 5.5 months (95% CI = 4.47-5.95) versus 3.7 months (95% CI = 3.61-4.04) in the&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine arm versus gemcitabine alone arms, respectively p &lt; 0.0001; HR =0&#xD;
      .69; 95% CI = 0.581-0.821). The improvement in PFS corresponded to a 31% reduction in the&#xD;
      risk of progression or death with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine. Furthermore, in this study of&#xD;
      metastatic unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, subjects in the combination arm were&#xD;
      on therapy longer than those receiving single agent gemcitabine, indicating disease&#xD;
      improvement and tolerable treatment. The suitability of the dosing regimen was confirmed by&#xD;
      the observation that the majority of patients did not require a dose reduction, and that 71%&#xD;
      of nab-paclitaxel doses were delivered at the starting dose of 125 mg/m2. The safety profile&#xD;
      for both regimens was consistent with previous reports. Serious life threatening toxicities&#xD;
      were not increased; AEs were acceptable and manageable. The most notable differences in&#xD;
      toxicity between the 2 treatment arms was peripheral neuropathy, which was cumulative and&#xD;
      rapidly reversible with dose delay and reduction, and neutropenia, which was manageable with&#xD;
      dose delays and dose reductions. The incremental risks of sepsis and pneumonitis were managed&#xD;
      by protocol amendments to increase awareness, and for early diagnosis and treatment to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of fatal outcomes. Since the above described initial analysis of the MPACT study,&#xD;
      the updated OS with a cutoff of May 2013 showed that the benefit continued to improve with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, with 8.7 versus 6.6 median months,&#xD;
      respectively. The updated survival rates also significantly favored nab-paclitaxel plus&#xD;
      gemcitabine at year 1 (35% versus 22%), year 2 (10% versus 5%), and year 3 (4% versus 0%) as&#xD;
      compared with gemcitabine alone.&#xD;
