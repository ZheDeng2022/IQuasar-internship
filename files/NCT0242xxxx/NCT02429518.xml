      This study is a Phase 4, open-label, single group study in which at least 40 adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing miltefosine treatment for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis will be assessed by digital&#xD;
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval.&#xD;
      Potential subjects diagnosed with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis who are planning to undergo&#xD;
      miltefosine treatment will be informed about the study and undergo the informed consent&#xD;
      process. After obtaining informed consent, subjects will be screened over a 14-day period for&#xD;
      eligibility by medical history including leishmaniasis diagnostics, physical examination,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory measurements [chemistries: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total&#xD;
      bilirubin, creatinine, magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium; hematology: white blood cell&#xD;
      (WBC) count, hemoglobin, platelet count; and a pregnancy test if female], ECG, and medication&#xD;
      use in the 28-day period before starting treatment. If eligible for the study, the subject&#xD;
      will receive miltefosine for 28 days at a target dose of approximately 2.5 mg/kg/day.&#xD;
      Screening and enrollment into the study will continue until at least 10 females and up to 30&#xD;
      males complete the study and are considered evaluable (provide Day 28 ECGs and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) samples and complete at least 25 of 28 days of miltefosine treatment).&#xD;
      Vital signs will be collected weekly during treatment. Chemistries and hematology will be&#xD;
      repeated at study Days 14 (mid-treatment) and 28 (end of treatment). A pregnancy test (if&#xD;
      applicable) will be repeated at Day 28. ECGs (12-lead) will be repeated at Days 14 and 28.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for PK assessments on Days 14 and 28 within 15 minutes of the final ECG.&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication use will be collected during treatment. If on&#xD;
      Day 28, clinically significant abnormalities are observed by ECG, then a repeat ECG and PK&#xD;
      blood draw will be performed at Day 42 (2 weeks after completing treatment). AEs and&#xD;
      concomitant medication use will also be collected in any subject coming back for the Day 42&#xD;
      visit. Digital ECGs (12-lead) will be collected in triplicate at each time point over a&#xD;
      period not to exceed 1 hour. During treatment, ECGs will be collected 4 hours after a dose&#xD;
      (approximate Tmax).&#xD;
