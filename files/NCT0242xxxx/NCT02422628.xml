    <textblock>
      EGFR tyrosine kinase mutation is frequently seen in our NSCLC, especially adenocarcinoma.1&#xD;
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of receptor tyrosine kinases (TKs) regulate many&#xD;
      developmental, metabolic and physiological processes. In tumor cells, the TK activity of EGFR&#xD;
      may be dysregulated by several mechanisms, including EGFR gene mutation, increased gene copy&#xD;
      number and EGFR protein overexpression.1 Improper activation of EGFR TK results in increased&#xD;
      malignant cell survival, proliferation, invasion and metastasis. EGFR overexpression is&#xD;
      observed in tumors from more than 60% of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) and is correlated with poor prognosis.2 Treatment with the reversible EGFR TK&#xD;
      inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib, results in dramatic antitumor activity in a&#xD;
      subset of patients with NSCLC. Sequencing of the EGFR gene revealed that a majority of tumors&#xD;
      responding to EGFR TKIs harbored mutations in the TK domain of EGFR. For patients whose&#xD;
      tumors exhibit EGFR mutations, the response rate to gefitinib and erlotinib is approximately&#xD;
      75%, suggesting that these mutations, at least in part, drive malignant transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the disease-free time to progression was still less than 1 year in most study.3-5&#xD;
      More than half of patients acquired resistant by new EGFR T790M resistance mutation. A second&#xD;
      biopsy at the time of progression is becoming an issue. However, Only around 30% of NSCLC&#xD;
      patients can receive gene testing to predict target therapy response because of the risk and&#xD;
      difficulty in obtaining adequate tissues from the primary lung tumors by biopsy. Serial&#xD;
      monitoring the emergence of resistant mutations is almost not possible. Recently, circulating&#xD;
      free DNAs (cfDNAs) become a promising topic in cancer research. cfDNA can be used as a liquid&#xD;
      biopsy, allowing repeated blood samples to be taken and changes in mutation status to be&#xD;
      tracked throughout a cancer treatment, paving the way for a potential use in following up of&#xD;
      treatment response, gauging prognosis, or monitoring of recurrence.6 It has been known for&#xD;
      over a hundred years that disseminated tumor cells can be found in the circulation of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic cancer and it has been hypothesized that these circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells (CTCs) may represent cancer stem cells or a high metastatic potential cellular&#xD;
      population.7 The major challenge since as few as one CTC may be found in the background of&#xD;
      105-106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells.8 CTCs are an attractive alternative to tumor&#xD;
      tissue for biomarker analysis including EGFR mutation. CTCs can be obtained from a routine&#xD;
      blood draw with minimal risk and inconvenience to the patient compared to a fresh biopsy.&#xD;
      Another appealing facet of CTCs as a surrogate diagnostic tissue is the idea that CTCs could&#xD;
      also constitute a &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; like cfDNA and provide real-time information about the&#xD;
      patient's current disease state.9,10 Analysis of biomarker status in CTCs collected prior to&#xD;
      treatment could potentially be used to select an appropriate targeted therapy, while repeated&#xD;
      longitudinal sampling during treatment could be used to detect appearance of resistance&#xD;
      markers and potentially enable switching to a more appropriate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A side-by-side comparison of EGFR mutation analysis in DNA extracted from circulating tumour&#xD;
      cells (CTCs) versus cfDNA from plasma suggested that mutational analysis of CTCs captured on&#xD;
      the CellSearch platform was low by comparison with the frequency of EGFR mutations identified&#xD;
      in plasma.11 However, this limitation might be related to the CellSearch platform used,11&#xD;
      because other CTC platforms (eg, CTC biochip) have greater sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      EGFR mutational analyses.12 New technologies, such as next generation sequencing and digital&#xD;
      PCR (Figure 1), which can permit more precise quantification of cfDNA and also the CTCs,&#xD;
      offer opportunities to design more appropriate treatments. Longitudinal analyses of EGFR and&#xD;
      other mutations in cfDNA and CTCs might well prove to be an ideal non-invasive technique to&#xD;
      be included in the oncologist's repertoire at the time of assigning or monitoring treatment&#xD;
      in patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will collect blood from NSCLC patients who harbor EGFR&#xD;
      mutation in biopsy specimens. Buffy coat and serum/plasma will be separated and DNA will be&#xD;
      extracted. The investigators will check the EGFR mutation by next generation sequencing or&#xD;
      digital PCR. Blood from volunteers without lung cancer patient will be also collected as&#xD;
      standard. Serial follow-up the change of EGFR mutation every month in cancer patient will be&#xD;
      correlated with clinical course. The Investigators hope the detection of EGFR mutation and&#xD;
      serial change in the patient blood could offer as a marker for early diagnosis and early&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
