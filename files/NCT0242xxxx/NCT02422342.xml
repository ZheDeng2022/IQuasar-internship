      The objectives of the clinical trial is to validate hemodynamic parameters (Blood pressure&#xD;
      and Cardiac Output) generated by an application coupled with an off-the-shelf pulse oximeter.&#xD;
      The validation will be done by comparing the generated information to data gathered while&#xD;
      performing Stress Echocardiography. The first phase of the study will be done on 10 patients&#xD;
      undergoing a Stress Echocardiography test at the cardiology department at Meir Hospital&#xD;

      The HeartBeat system combines an FDA/CE approved watch-like Pulse Oximeter for acquiring the&#xD;
      data and an android software application that serves as the Hemodynamic calculator. The&#xD;
      application performs POST-PROCESSING of the PhotoPlethismoGraphic (PPG) signal (Normally the&#xD;
      PPG signal in Pulse Oximeters is used only to compute heart rate and SpO2). The raw data is&#xD;
      transferred from the watch oximeter to the smartphone using a standard Bluetooth protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Post-processing uses wavelet signal processing to estimate and display certain&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters like Blood Pressure (BP) and Cardiac Output (CO) in a continuous and&#xD;
      graphical way on a standard Android device. In addition to the standard heart rate and SpO2,&#xD;
      the application displays the measured PPG signal and estimated continues BP and CO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeartBeat is the only device that can non-invasively estimate Continuous BP and its Cardiac&#xD;
      Output component and the resistance component in a mobile wearable device. Differentiating&#xD;
      between these 2 components can play a major role in helping the doctor to understand the&#xD;
      effect of cardiovascular medications and Lifestyle interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will compare blood pressure and cardiac output parameters measured during Stress&#xD;
      Echocardiography using an echo cardiograph and standard sphygmomanometer to the parameters&#xD;
      generated by the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility tests for the HeartBeat application as a tool for monitoring BP and CO&#xD;
           changes over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare BP and CO parameters generated by the applications to the ones measured by&#xD;
           standard non-invasive equipment during a Stress Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculate additional parameters such as stroke volume, systematic vascular resistance&#xD;
           and cardiac index&#xD;
