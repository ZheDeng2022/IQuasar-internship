  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent focus groups at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) revealed several&#xD;
      limitations in our understanding of how parents' relationships with care staff help and&#xD;
      hinder their grief experience. Additionally, there is a gap in the bereavement literature&#xD;
      regarding the psychological effects professional caregiver relationships have on parents&#xD;
      whose children died of cancer. To bolster our knowledge base and benefit Bereavement Care&#xD;
      Services at SJCRH, as well as benefit other professionals by filling the gap in the&#xD;
      literature, we have designed a qualitative study that will conduct individual interviews with&#xD;
      bereaved parents whose children died at SJCRH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of the preliminary analyses of the initial 30 interviews will occur through new&#xD;
      focus groups involving two separate sets of bereaved parents who will validate the findings&#xD;
      and/or suggest additional avenues of inquiry needed to gain a more complete understanding of&#xD;
      parental grief/bereavement experience. Additionally, focus groups with hematology/oncology&#xD;
      fellows will obtain provider feedback on the value of these findings in their training and&#xD;
      future role as physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial focus group portion of this study is complete and more than 30 interviews have&#xD;
      been conducted with bereaved parent participants. Review of those interviews revealed that&#xD;
      very few parent participants had children who received bone marrow transplants. For this&#xD;
      reason, we will now specifically be recruiting bereaved parent participants whose children&#xD;
      received bone marrow transplants at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We will be&#xD;
      recruiting parents of children who received haploidentical and non-haploidentical bone marrow&#xD;
      transplants because we believe the parents of deceased children who received haploidentical&#xD;
      bone marrow transplants may have unique bereavement experiences related to their possible&#xD;
      roles as donors. The act of donating or not being selected to donate to a child who goes on&#xD;
      to die from cancer and its related complications may have unique impacts on the grieving&#xD;
      process and warrants specific investigation. We also hope to better understand how legacy&#xD;
      building interventions are perceived and utilized by caregivers following the death of a&#xD;
      child from cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who consent will engage with the principal investigator in a one-time&#xD;
      voice-recorded interview consisting of demographic and open-ended questions. Participants can&#xD;
      choose to conduct the interview face-to-face or over-the-phone. Completion of the interview&#xD;
      is expected to take between 30-90 minutes. Validation focus groups are expected to take&#xD;
      between 30-90 minutes, as well. For the legacy-building cohort, the Child Life Department&#xD;
      will provide additional information to specify which bereaved families received legacy items,&#xD;
      and parents will be recruited to participate in an interview centered on the legacy item&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct qualitative interviews in order to understand what helps and what hinders&#xD;
      bereavement processes among St. Jude parents, with particular attention to how relationships&#xD;
      with St. Jude professional care staff affect parental bereavement processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualitatively explore the unique bereavement experiences and challenges of parents of&#xD;
      children who have received bone marrow transplantation, and compare these experiences with&#xD;
      those participants whose children did not receive bone marrow transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess for qualitative similarities among parents with similar responses on questionnaires&#xD;
      and/or to identify between-group differences on questionnaires among parents with&#xD;
      qualitatively similar experiences.&#xD;

    <description>Qualitative data will be collected using a standardized semi-structured interview technique. Researchers will analyze transcripts for content to gain a better understanding of the bereavement experience. Thematic saturation will occur when a minimum of 3 consecutive interviews fail to produce novel information in each of the therapeutic categories (haploidentical transplant, non-haploidentical transplant).Transcripts will be analyzed as they are obtained and the principal investigator and study team will iteratively and collaboratively develop a coding dictionary. Each transcript will be reviewed by at least 2 coders. When there is disagreement on a code, coders will meet in person to discuss until consensus is reached. Codes will be grouped into broader themes and used to summarize and describe the bereavement experience as told by parents.</description>

    <description>We will use the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) to assess for symptoms of depression, the parental grief disorder questionnaire (PG-13) to assess for atypical or disordered grief, and the Integration of Stressful Life Experiences Scales (ISLES-SF) to measure the extent to which the child's loss has been integrated into the parent's worldview. We will identify different groups based on these questionnaires (ex: those with elevated scores on the BDI-II) and look to see if the thematic content of their interviews differs from other participants. Additionally, we may identify participants who expressed certain themes and assess for differences in their qualitative responses.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective study with a semi-structured in-depth qualitative interview. Interviews will be conducted by the study PI or designee. However, in order to ensure that the interviews are conducted sensitively, the first 10 interviews will be observed and supervised by a clinically credentialed St. Jude faculty member, and an additional 10% of the interviews will be observed after that.&#xD;
In order to ensure that the interviewer does not lead the participant, or in turn, that the participant does not feel limited in regards to what they believe is an appropriate or desired response, the semi-structured interview questions are general and intended to produce broad responses in regards to participant experiences.</description>
