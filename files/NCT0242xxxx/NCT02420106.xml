      The purpose of the proposed research is to determine if Osteopathic manipulative medicine&#xD;
      (OMM) used alone or in combination with the standard treatment of botulinum toxin&#xD;
      intramuscular injections improves motor function and quality of life amongst people with&#xD;
      cervical (neck) dystonia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a type of neurological disorder&#xD;
      characterized by spastic muscles in the neck that is largely underdiagnosed despite its&#xD;
      progression to disability during midlife. Cervical dystonia occurs in at least 0.390% of the&#xD;
      United States population in 2007 (390 per 100,000). Symptoms commonly include stiffness,&#xD;
      pain, headaches, difficulty swallowing, fatigue, and difficulty walking. The current standard&#xD;
      treatment is intramuscular botulinum toxin injection every 90 days. The effect of the&#xD;
      botulinum toxin increases gradually, and then it decreases until there is little to no effect&#xD;
      at 90 days post-injection. The purpose of the proposed research is to determine if&#xD;
      Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) used in combination with the standard treatment of&#xD;
      botulinum toxin intramuscular injections improves motor function and quality of life amongst&#xD;
      people with cervical dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use Vicon 3-dimensional gait and posture analysis to determine&#xD;
      the biomechanics of subjects with primary cervical dystonia to compare with full body&#xD;
      complaints from a standard spasmodic torticollis/cervical dystonia questionnaire as well as&#xD;
      the osteopathic structural exam. These measures will be assessed before and after four OMM&#xD;
      treatments. In addition, the investigators propose to use osteopathic manual medicine along&#xD;
      with botulinum toxin injection to improve the subjects' pain and motor function as evaluated&#xD;
      by Vicon 3-dimensional gait and posture analysis and questionnaire regarding quality of life.&#xD;
      Preliminary case reports suggest that Osteopathic manipulative medicine without botulinum&#xD;
      toxin injections improved pain, posture, gait, and quality of life in four adult subjects as&#xD;
      well as improved head tilt in two children (two- and five-years old). The central hypothesis&#xD;
      is that osteopathic manual medicine will significantly improve the range of motion, motor&#xD;
      function, and quality of life of subjects with primary cervical dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I. To determine 3-Dimensional gait and posture biomechanics of subjects with untreated&#xD;
      primary cervical dystonia while walking, and to investigate the effectiveness of OMM in&#xD;
      treating abnormal biomechanics in these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis I: People with cervical dystonia have similar abnormalities in posture and&#xD;
      structural exam that significantly alters their gait and full body motor function that can be&#xD;
      significantly improved with OMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental approach: Motor function will be assessed by Vicon 3-Dimensional analysis using&#xD;
      34 of the subjects while walking will depict stride length and arm swing on each side of the&#xD;
      body as well as the posture of the shoulder and pelvic girdle with reference to the coronal,&#xD;
      transverse, and sagittal planes. Quality of life will be assessed by the Cervical Dystonia&#xD;
      Impact Profile (CDIP)-58 questionaire. Four weekly OMM diagnosis and treatment will be done,&#xD;
      and then, motor function and quality of life will be reassessed. Total participation in the&#xD;
      study is expected to last for 5-7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: The spasticity in the neck will affect motor function of the whole body.&#xD;
      There will be decreased stride length and arm swing on the side of the body with the neck&#xD;
      muscle spasm. The shoulder girdle and pelvis will be continuously rotated around a vertical&#xD;
      axis the same direction as the head in reference to the feet and direction of walking. The&#xD;
      shoulder and pelvic girdles will be tilted such that they are closer together on one side&#xD;
      than the other side due to side-bending of the torso. We also expect that there will be an&#xD;
      indirect relationship between age and motor function. OMM is expected to significantly&#xD;
      improve motor function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The impact of the neck muscle spasticity on full body biomechanics of subjects&#xD;
      with primary cervical dystonia is not well understood, and the results can be used to improve&#xD;
      assessment of function as well as management of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II. To determine whether osteopathic manual medicine used during the first four weeks&#xD;
      following botulinum toxin intramuscular injection will significantly improve the joint range&#xD;
      of motion, motor function, and quality of life of subjects with primary cervical dystonia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis II: Osteopathic manual medicine will improve the range of motion of the neck,&#xD;
      symmetry of posture and gait, and quality of life of subjects with primary cervical dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental approach: Subjects being treated with botulinum toxin injections will be&#xD;
      evaluated with a standard spasmodic torticollis form (to be filled out by physician),&#xD;
      cervical dystonia questionnaire regarding quality of life, and Vicon 3-Dimensional gait and&#xD;
      posture analysis before and after four weekly treatments with OMM (n≥8) for comparison with&#xD;
      subjects in a no-OMM control condition (n≥ 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: Subjects will have improved quality of life in regard to head and neck&#xD;
      symptoms, pain and discomfort, upper limb activities, walking, sleep, annoyance, mood, and&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning. Subjects will have improved joint range of motion and motor&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Although physicians specializing in osteopathic manual medicine treat patients&#xD;
      with various types of dystonia, the effectiveness of osteopathic manual medicine in treating&#xD;
      primary cervical dystonia is not established, and thus, osteopathic manual medicine is not&#xD;
      recognized or recommended as adjunctive therapy. The botulinum toxin is injected into spastic&#xD;
      neck muscles. However, there is no adjunctive procedure recommended for treating the rest of&#xD;
      the symptoms associated with the illness. 3-dimensional characterization of motor function&#xD;
      has been used in children with cerebral palsy and generalized dystonia before and after&#xD;
      surgical intervention, and using a similar method may demonstrate how OMM can prevent people&#xD;
      from becoming disabled.&#xD;
