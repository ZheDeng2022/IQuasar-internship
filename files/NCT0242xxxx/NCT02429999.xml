  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility in not a health problem and that infertile couples are not really ill. However,&#xD;
      this narrow interpretation of the problem is refuted by the world community. The WHO defines&#xD;
      health as a &quot;state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the&#xD;
      absence of disease or infirmity&quot;. It has also been argued that overpopulation is the main&#xD;
      problem in the developing countries and that helping infertile couples contradicts the&#xD;
      interests of the countries and the world at large. However, this narrow approach contradicts&#xD;
      human rights in general and reproductive rights in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1994, the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo&#xD;
      mentioned issues on future actions on 'prevention and appropriate treatment of infertility&#xD;
      where feasible'. However, no guidelines or concrete actions and programmes were given for&#xD;
      developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, more than 80 million couples suffer from infertility; the majority of this&#xD;
      population are residents of developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In September 2001, a meeting on 'Medical, Ethical and Social Aspects of Assisted&#xD;
      Reproduction' was organized by the WHO. For the first time, major attention was paid to&#xD;
      ongoing developments in assisted reproduction technology together with their social and&#xD;
      ethical implications in developing countries . It was the first time that the WHO highlighted&#xD;
      the issue of assisted reproduction in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART in developed countries is highly expensive one of steps is ovulation induction the most&#xD;
      common protocol for induction is the long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist&#xD;
      pituitary suppression regimen combined with relatively high doses of exogenous&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) remains the most frequently used stimulation protocol&#xD;
      which is expensive. in our study we will use a mild ovarian stimulating protocol letrozole&#xD;
      adjuvant to gonadotrophins which is less expensive&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of aromatase inhibitor have only recently been introduced in infertility treatment,&#xD;
      especially for ovulation induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An aromatase inhibitor blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovarian&#xD;
      follicles, peripheral tissues, and in the brain. This result in two things: (a) Fall in&#xD;
      circulating and local estrogens and (b) Rise in intraovarian androgens. Fall in estrogen&#xD;
      levels, releases the hypothalamopituitary axis from the negative feedback of estrogens. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a surge in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) release, which results in follicular&#xD;
      growth. Since, the feedback mechanism is intact; normal follicular growth, selection of&#xD;
      dominant follicle, and atresia of smaller growing follicle occurs; and thereby facilitating&#xD;
      monofollicular growth and ovulation.Another mechanism of action of the aromatase inhibitors&#xD;
      is by the increasing intraovarian androgens. This increases the follicular sensitivity to&#xD;
      FSH. Recent data shows the role of androgens in early follicular developments. by augmenting&#xD;
      FSH receptors and stimulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I; FSH and IGF-I act&#xD;
      synergistically to promote follicular growth. This pharmacodynamics of letrozole ensures&#xD;
      improved endometrial thickness, cervical mucus, monofollicular, and better folliculogenesis.&#xD;
      So , these factors may lead to higher pregnancy rates and greater likelihood of singleton&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole has been tried for ovarian stimulation for assisted reproduction. With the concept&#xD;
      of mild stimulation in IVF to improve implantation rate, letrozole is a potential agent.&#xD;
      Letrozole has two potential uses in IVF: First, where it is used in the follicular phase&#xD;
      usually with FSH/human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) for ovulation induction; second, it has&#xD;
      also been used in luteal phase of stimulated IVF cycle and to reduce circulating E2 levels;&#xD;
      thus, potentially reducing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant reduction in the total dose of gonadotrophins was found when aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor was added in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies evaluated the addition of letrozole in patients with normal ovarian response&#xD;
      undergoing IVF or Intracytoplasmic sperm injection( ICSI). They showed higher implantation&#xD;
      and ongoing pregnancy rates in the letrozole cotreatment group.&#xD;
