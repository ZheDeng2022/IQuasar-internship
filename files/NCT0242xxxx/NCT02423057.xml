      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Genes are made up of DNA and are the instruction book for cells. When people have cancer,&#xD;
      some of the genes that might have slowed the growth of tumor cells were turned off.&#xD;
      Researchers think a drug called TdCyd might help to turn these genes back on. This may slow&#xD;
      the growth of tumors in people with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety of TdCyd and to find out how it works. Also, to find out the dose of the&#xD;
      drug that can be safely given to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 years and older who have advanced cancer that has progressed after standard&#xD;
      treatment, or for which no effective therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take TdCyd by mouth. The drug is given in 21-day cycles. TdCyd is&#xD;
           taken once a day during week 1 for 5 days. Then for 2 days participants do not take the&#xD;
           drug. Then they take it for 5 days during week 2. No TdCyd is taken during week 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a diary of their study drug doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have tests about every 3 weeks to see how the study drugs are&#xD;
           affecting their body. They will have blood and urine tests, a medical history, and&#xD;
           physical exams. They may have computed tomography (CT) scans to measure their tumors.&#xD;
           They may have an electrocardiogram, which measures the heart electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants develop any side effects, they may be asked to visit more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stay in the study as long as they are tolerating TdCyd and their&#xD;
           tumors are either stable or getting better. One month after stopping the drug, they will&#xD;
           have a follow-up phone call.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methylation-mediated silencing of genes is an epigenetic mechanism implicated in&#xD;
           carcinogenesis; agents that inhibit this mechanism are of clinical interest because of&#xD;
           their potential to re-activate silenced tumor suppressor genes. Two DNA hypomethylating&#xD;
           nucleosides, 5-azacytidine (azacytidine) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) have&#xD;
           been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes&#xD;
           and certain leukemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The nucleoside analog 4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine (TdCyd) is incorporated into DNA where it&#xD;
           engages the active site of DNA methyltransferase I (DNMT1), a maintenance&#xD;
           methyltransferase that contributes to the hypermethylation and silencing of tumor&#xD;
           suppressor genes. DNMT1 can become trapped in a covalent complex with DNA, thus&#xD;
           depleting free enzyme and inhibiting the normal maintenance methylation of CpG sites,&#xD;
           resulting in reactivation of tumor suppressor genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data generated at Southern Research Institute and the NCI suggest a correlation between&#xD;
           TdCyd activity in solid tumor xenograft models and decreased levels of DNMT1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TdCyd offers an improvement over current DNA methyltransferase inhibitors by virtue of a&#xD;
           higher incorporation rate into DNA at lower levels of cytotoxicity; treatment with TdCyd&#xD;
           is anticipated to result in the inhibition of tumor growth due to DNMT1 depletion at&#xD;
           oral doses that are well tolerated in extended dosing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two patients on dose levels 6 and 7 developed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) so&#xD;
           all patients will be administered PJP prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To establish the safety, tolerability, and MTD of oral TdCyd administered daily for 5 days a&#xD;
      week for 2 weeks, with one week off, q 21-day cycles, to patients with refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of oral TdCyd&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document preliminary evidence of TdCyd activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine effect of study treatment on re-expression of select genes silenced by&#xD;
           methylation in circulating tumor cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients must have histologically documented solid tumors whose disease has progressed on&#xD;
      standard therapy or for which there is no available standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TdCyd will be administered orally once a day for 5 days of each week for 2 weeks, with&#xD;
           one week off, in 21-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial will follow an accelerated titration design, changing to a traditional 3+3&#xD;
           dose escalation design (3-6 patients per cohort) once specified toxicity criteria are&#xD;
           met. Intrapatient dose escalation will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis and to isolate circulating&#xD;
           tumor cells to assess re-expression of genes silenced by methylation.&#xD;
