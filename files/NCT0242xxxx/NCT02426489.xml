  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether the addition of positron emission mammography&#xD;
      will add diagnostic value to magnetic resonance imaging of the breast, in patients with&#xD;
      lesions of the breast that are suspicious enough to warrant biopsy, or which have been&#xD;
      confirmed as containing cancer cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      70 eligible subjects will be asked to undergo contrast-enhanced MRI studies of the breast&#xD;
      containing the lesion. Subjects will be asked to fast for 6 hours prior to the imaging&#xD;
      session. Each subject will be tested for glucose, and if the glucose is not too high, the&#xD;
      subject will be injected with a dose of radioactive sugar (fluoro-deoxyglucose) which has&#xD;
      been shown in other studies to accumulate in breast cancers. The subject will be asked to sit&#xD;
      quietly for 30 minutes and to empty the bladder. The subject will then be asked to be&#xD;
      re-examined in the MRI scanner with MRI contrast injection. The examination bed will be moved&#xD;
      out of the MRI scanner and detectors of the radioactive sugar will be placed near the breast&#xD;
      in order to obtain a positron emission mammogram for a 10-minute period. The subject will&#xD;
      then leave the MRI suite.&#xD;
