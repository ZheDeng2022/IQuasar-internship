  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Smoking is considered a global public health problem. For this reason, the&#xD;
      smoking dependence was called by experts as a global epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past three years, this electronic devices (Tobacco Free Cigarettes, or TFC) has been&#xD;
      an important expansion in many countries. Nevertheless, there is poor evidence that TFC are&#xD;
      beneficial for smoking cessation. In particular, even though it has been proved that the&#xD;
      nicotine replacement devices helps many individuals to give up smoking and to tolerate the&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, it is still unclear their long-term effect. Hence, it must be tested its&#xD;
      contribution in tobacco reduction. This protocol in particularly innovative, since it aims to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of electronic devices in a screening program (the lung cancer prevention&#xD;
      program COSMOS II at the IEO), where tobacco reduction is strictly needed in order to lower&#xD;
      individual's risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Design. This experimental protocol has been designed with the main aim to&#xD;
      investigate the role of Tobacco Free Cigarettes (TFC), also called e-cigarettes, in helping&#xD;
      smokers to improve their lung health and to quit or reduce tobacco consuming. In particular,&#xD;
      the investigators aim at investigating clinical (physical symptoms, with particular focus on&#xD;
      breathing quality and difficulties), the behavioral (number of tobacco cigarettes smoked),&#xD;
      and psychological (wellbeing, mood and quality of life) effects of shifting to TFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also analyze, as a secondary aim, the psychological and lifestyle&#xD;
      component of smokers involved in order to fine correlation data that might be used to compute&#xD;
      a predictor index able to suggest the probability of success, with respect to the reduction&#xD;
      of tobacco consuming, of the use of a TFC and to maintain the abstinence. The study will be&#xD;
      organized as a nested randomized controlled study with two arms: one experimental group and&#xD;
      one control group. The study will be nested in the screening program for lung cancer, where&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be entered in a psycho-cognitive low-intensity counseling program (6&#xD;
      months), but in the experimental group a TFC (with or without nicotine) will be used as&#xD;
      replacement device for three months, while in the control group only low-intensity counseling&#xD;
      will be provided. Furthermore, a low-cost non-invasive electronic device (the FitBit activity&#xD;
      tracker) will be used in order to monitor behavioral (lifestyle), sleep quality and physical&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization has been estimated that cigarette smoking will claim the lives&#xD;
      of 500 million people alive today and as many as one billion people in the 21st century. Even&#xD;
      though clinical therapy for smoking cessation have showed efficacy, long-time abstinence rate&#xD;
      is low yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tobacco Free Cigarettes (TFC, also known as electronic cigarettes) are battery-operated&#xD;
      devices designed to vaporize a liquid solution of propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin&#xD;
      in which nicotine or other aromas may be dissolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The worth of these tools is that it reduces the risk for smoking related diseases. If the use&#xD;
      of the TFC in heavy smokers favor a reduction of the cancers' risk, the role in antismoking&#xD;
      program has not completed cleared yet. the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) have promoted the launch of research on this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective 6-month study, TFCs were shown to substantially decrease tobacco cigarettes&#xD;
      consumption without causing significant side effects. The study showed that declines in&#xD;
      cig/day use and expired carbon monoxide (CO) levels were observed at each study visits in all&#xD;
      three study groups, with no consistent differences among study groups. Furthermore, rapid&#xD;
      improvement of breathing symptoms were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, tobacco cigarettes consumption after 1 year were reported only in about 10% of&#xD;
      participants. This is probably due to the fact that the research was targeted to smokers non&#xD;
      intended to quit. We argue that in motivated smokers much better result might be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a physiological point of view TFCs appears to contrast craving for tobacco, in the same&#xD;
      manner of a nicotine replacement therapy. In an overview of the Cochrane Library studies on&#xD;
      35.000 patients were assessed showing that the NRT utilization in antismoking treatment helps&#xD;
      smokers in short-time (three months), but not in the long-time (six months). This is probably&#xD;
      due to an exclusively focus on physiological issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol provides the opportunity to test the efficacy of TFC tools in clinically&#xD;
      controlled setting, in order to reduce tobacco consumption and improving clinical.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the protocol is nested in the lung cancer screening program COSMOS II, that will&#xD;
      allow subject recruitment and continuous monitoring. The Cosmos II (Continuous Observation of&#xD;
      SMOking Subjects) aims to improve early diagnosis of lung cancer considered today as the most&#xD;
      important life-saving tool. This is a Italian study, coordinated by IEO created to identify&#xD;
      an optimal personalized protocol for early diagnosis in people subject to high risk of lung&#xD;
      cancer. The COSMOS II will enroll 10,000 heavy smokers or former smokers throughout Italy.&#xD;
      COSMOS II derives from the previous successful screening project COSMOS I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of a three months TFC program to reduce smoking-related respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms (dry cough, breath shortness, mouth irritation and catarrh) as consequence of a&#xD;
      reduced tobacco cigarettes consumption among a CT screening population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess the success rate of smoking cessation attempts in the three groups 2 To monitor&#xD;
      safety and toxicity during the study 3. To evaluate psychological and behavioral (lifestyle)&#xD;
      effect of TFC 4. To assess the TFC use impact on quality of life .&#xD;
&#xD;
      More in details, the main aim of the project refers to the efficacy of TFCs in tobacco in&#xD;
      improving the lung health of heavy smokers involved in the COSMOS II program. If proved safe&#xD;
      and efficacy, TFC should be included in lung cancer screening programs as a standard tool to&#xD;
      reduce the smoking-related risks for lung diseases. Naturally, this aim requires a scientific&#xD;
      approach, since TFC should not increase the nicotine dependence. Another fundamental aim of&#xD;
      the project refers to the efficacy of TFCs in tobacco consuming reduction. In particular,&#xD;
      none study have already test the feasibility and the efficacy of these tools in limiting risk&#xD;
      behaviors (tobacco smoking) among heavy smokers enrolled in a lung cancer screening program.&#xD;
      Consequently, we want to analyze if providing TFC to participant in a controlled protocol&#xD;
      will reduce tobacco consumption and related health problems and breathing problems. We also&#xD;
      aim to analyse the psychological characteristics and needs of subjects enrolled in the COSMOS&#xD;
      II program, in order to evaluate how risk perception (the premise of risk behaviour adoption)&#xD;
      is associated with a psycho-cognitive profile. We argue that an important and successful&#xD;
      screening project, as the COSMOS, should incorporate a comprehensive approach to the&#xD;
      individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, thanks to the use of a continuous data tracking system and the concomitant uses of&#xD;
      questionnaire based anamnestic assessment of lifestyle and behavior habits, it will be&#xD;
      possible to collect data in order to find consistency and discrepancies between the two&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DURATION AND STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will last 24 months and is designed as a 6-months Nested Randomized Control Study&#xD;
      and will be conducted in European Institute of Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol addresses physical and clinical characteristics, in order to find out the&#xD;
      effects of smokers' behavior, and psychological parameters, to test if some individual&#xD;
      feature may hinder behavioral changes and the related positive effects on health. Indeed,&#xD;
      heavy smokers are characterized by specific psycho-cognitive traits. In particulars, they&#xD;
      generally present high level of impulsivity than non-smokers. At the same time, smoker tends&#xD;
      to have an high level of activity in the behavioral approach system (BAS). It has been&#xD;
      suggested that high BAS sensitivity is involved in addictive behaviors, for instance smoking.&#xD;
      Individuals with high level of BAS are more incline to enact approaching behaviors and&#xD;
      experience positive affect when they receive positive rewards. Furthermore, Dovratek and&#xD;
      colleagues (2011) have demonstrated that smokers with high rumination attitude show a greater&#xD;
      risk of relapse during the abstinence, especially, in those smokers characterized by high&#xD;
      levels of impulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design, the timeline and nicotine doses were derived from previous research&#xD;
      protocol that have demonstrated to be suited to achieve similar objectives. With respect to&#xD;
      group 1 and group 2, a double blind randomization will be used, in order to avoid and&#xD;
      confound effects. Consequently, participants using TFC won't know if the will &quot;vape&quot;&#xD;
      nicotine-containing or nicotine-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting by this framework and In order to achieve the objectives described above we designed&#xD;
      the protocol as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To all subjects a physical, psychological, cognitive and behavioral (lifestyle)&#xD;
           screening based on battery of fast and validated tools, will be administered. It will&#xD;
           allow the assessment of the personality traits, the awareness's degree and the openness&#xD;
           to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each subject recruited will be involved in a behavioral support program (low-intensity&#xD;
           counseling), in order to support subjects to track their data and to gather fast&#xD;
           information when needed about the research activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The protocols will be organized in three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. In the first arm subject will receive a 3-months TFC (with nicotine) program and a&#xD;
                further 3-months monitoring program; they will undergo to a basal and final&#xD;
                evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In the second arm subject will receive a 3-months TFC (nicotine-free) program; they&#xD;
                will undergo to a basal and final evaluation; they will be monitored for 6 month&#xD;
                (data tracking);&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. In the third arm, only baseline/final evaluation, data tracking and behavioral&#xD;
                support will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to each group after the first assessment point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, participants will follow a 6 month program (3 months of active program plus 3&#xD;
      months of monitoring). All participant will be monitored over the time for sleep quantity and&#xD;
      quality of sleep and lifestyle, either through traditional instruments, and through the use&#xD;
      of an electronic bracelet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be trained to the use of the electronic bracelet and data will be collected&#xD;
      through a cloud system allowing to compute statistical correlations between lifestyle,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, desire to smoke, recurrences, and so on. From this point of view, the&#xD;
      research project will collect data currently not available. An e-messaging based helpline&#xD;
      will be activated in order to offer full assistance to participants for the use of bracelets&#xD;
      and research related activities.&#xD;
