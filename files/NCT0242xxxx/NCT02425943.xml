      Study is designed to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the long-term safety of Sculptra Aesthetic in immune-competent subjects as a&#xD;
           single regimen for correction of wrinkle assessment score (WAS) 2 to 4 nasolabial fold&#xD;
           (NLF) contour deficiencies and other facial wrinkles in which deep dermal grid pattern&#xD;
           (cross-hatch) injection technique is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the time to onset, duration, severity, relationship to Sculptra Aesthetic&#xD;
           and/or injection procedure, and outcome of all adverse events during the course of the&#xD;
           study, by Fitzpatrick skin type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the change in the WAS from baseline to post-treatment follow-up time points&#xD;
           at Months 6, 13, and Years 2, 3, 4, and 5 in NLFs and other facial wrinkles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to evaluate Investigator/subject global assessments at Months 6, 13, and Years 2, 3, 4,&#xD;
           and 5.&#xD;

&#xD;
             - Subjects may also have other facial wrinkles (ie, cheek lines, marionette lines, and&#xD;

             deep dermal grid pattern (cross-hatch) injection technique is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must sign a statement of informed consent; initial and date &quot;A Patient's&#xD;
