  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Genomic Sequencing for Childhood Risk and Newborn Illness (the BabySeq Project) is a&#xD;
      research study exploring the use of genomic sequencing in newborns. The National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health is funding this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 240 healthy infants and their parents from the Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital (BWH) Well Newborn Nursery and 240 sick infants and their parents at Boston&#xD;
      Children's Hospital (BCH) or the BWH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). A small blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected from each infant and genome sequencing may be performed. Six weeks&#xD;
      later, results are returned and explained. Over 12 months the investigators are studying the&#xD;
      experiences of parents and pediatricians of infants who receive sequencing to help understand&#xD;
      how best to use genomics in pediatric care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research protocol is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess&#xD;
      the benefits and risks of adding the information from a genomic sequencing report to&#xD;
      physician-mediated medical care of newborns during their pediatric years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 240 healthy infants and their parents from the Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital (BWH) Well Newborn Nursery and 240 sick infants and their parents at Boston&#xD;
      Children's Hospital (BCH) or the BWH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small blood sample will be obtained from each enrolled infant. Samples will be collected&#xD;
      from all infants enrolled, regardless of the arm to which they are assigned, in order to&#xD;
      follow the same protocol for all subjects prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants within each cohort will be randomized (1:1) to either standard-of-care (family&#xD;
      history and standard newborn screening report) or to standard-of-care plus genomic&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study physician and genetic counselor will disclose the infant's randomization assignment&#xD;
      and study results during an in-person consultation with each family. The study physician and&#xD;
      genetic counselor will provide the consultation to families utilizing all available medical&#xD;
      information. In the sequencing arm of the study, this will include the medical history,&#xD;
      physical exam, family history, standard newborn screening (NBS) report and sequencing&#xD;
      report(s). In the non-sequencing arm of the study, this will include the medical history,&#xD;
      physical exam, family history and standard NBS report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be surveyed at four points over the 12 months after enrollment: baseline,&#xD;
      immediately post-disclosure (approximately 6 weeks after enrollment), 3 months&#xD;
      post-disclosure, and at 10 months post-disclosure.&#xD;

    <description>Parent-Child Relationship was assessed using validated scales measuring parents' perceptions of parenting stress (General parenting stress per the Parenting Stress Indexâ„¢, 4th Edition Short Form (10 months); scores range from 36 to 180), how vulnerable they perceive their child to be (Parents' perception of baby's vulnerability per the Vulnerable Baby Scale (baseline, postdisclosure, 3 months, 10 months); scores range from 4 to 20), and how they are bonding with their child (Parent-child bonding per the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (baseline, postdisclosure, 3 months, 10 months); scores range from 0 to 24). Lower bonding scores indicate more problems with bonding. For other measures, higher scores indicate higher stress and perceptions of vulnerability.</description>

        <title>Parent-Child Relationship</title>
        <description>Parent-Child Relationship was assessed using validated scales measuring parents' perceptions of parenting stress (General parenting stress per the Parenting Stress Indexâ„¢, 4th Edition Short Form (10 months); scores range from 36 to 180), how vulnerable they perceive their child to be (Parents' perception of baby's vulnerability per the Vulnerable Baby Scale (baseline, postdisclosure, 3 months, 10 months); scores range from 4 to 20), and how they are bonding with their child (Parent-child bonding per the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (baseline, postdisclosure, 3 months, 10 months); scores range from 0 to 24). Lower bonding scores indicate more problems with bonding. For other measures, higher scores indicate higher stress and perceptions of vulnerability.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline through 10 post-disclosure, with time points varying by measure. (Post-disclosure approx. 5 months after baseline; 3-months approx. 8 months after baseline; 10-months approx. 15 months after baseline)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included parents of infants enrolled in the BabySeq project. Data was not available for all participants due to withdrawal or non-responsiveness to follow up surveys.</population>

Genomic sequencing: Both sick and healthy infants randomized to receive genomic sequencing receive a 'Genomic Newborn Sequencing Report' (GNSR) which includes pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in genes associated with childhood-onset disease.&#xD;
Family history report: Participants from all arms of the study have a family history taken by a study genetic counselor. Information collected through the family history is summarized in a family history report that is reviewed with all participants.</description>
