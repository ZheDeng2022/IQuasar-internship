  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glutathione is an important nutrient for brain function and loss of glutathione has been&#xD;
      implicated in Parkinson's disease. Glutathione is an antioxidant made in the body out of&#xD;
      three amino acids, the nutrients that make up protein. This study will determine whether&#xD;
      administration of either dose of glutathione, as a nasal spray, improves PD symptoms over&#xD;
      time in a population of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;

      The study begins with a pre-screening telephone interview. During this conversation&#xD;
      participants will be asked a series of questions that will help us identify whether they are&#xD;
      eligible for participation in this study. The pre-screening interview process will take&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes and will include all screening criteria that does not require&#xD;
      clinical or laboratory examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      All routine research visits will take place at Bastyr University Campus (Kenmore, WA).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to schedule visits at approximately the same time of day each&#xD;
      visit .If they are on medications, we would like them to take their medications as they&#xD;
      normally would on the day of the visit. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      three different study groups- a low dose group, a high dose group, or a placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will invited to volunteer for two magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) scans&#xD;
      as part of this study, an optional part of study participation. For those who volunteer and&#xD;
      qualify, MRIs will be performed at the University of Washington Radiology Department early in&#xD;
      the morning. One scan will be taken at baseline before taking glutathione and the second upon&#xD;
      completion of the study medication. There will be a separate consent form for those who&#xD;
      participate in the imaging portion of this study. Among the participants who volunteer, the&#xD;
      first 15 to qualify for an MRI scan will be scheduled according to MRI availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are enrolled in the study, they will be asked to keep a daily log of actual&#xD;
      frequency of administration of study medication, if any, as well as any changes in their PD&#xD;
      symptoms, any adverse events they might experience, and their general well-being. We are&#xD;
      giving participants enough medication to last four weeks, until the date of their next&#xD;
      appointment. The medication should be taken three times a day (morning, afternoon, and&#xD;
      evening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1- Baseline: (Approximately 1 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venipuncture (blood draw, (40 mL / ~3 Tbsp) to assess blood antioxidant status..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment of PD severity: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS),&#xD;
           which involves assessing degree of tremor, ability to walk across the room, questions&#xD;
           about ability to function independently (i.e. button your own shirt, feed yourself), and&#xD;
           questions about mental health, including depression and intellectual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will be taught how and when to administer the study medication and be given&#xD;
           a 1-month supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2- Week 4 follow-up: (Approximately 1 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venipuncture (blood draw, (40 mL / ~3 Tbsp) to assess blood antioxidant status..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment of PD severity: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and&#xD;
           Webster-Step Second test involve assessing degree of tremor, ability to walk across the&#xD;
           room, questions about ability to function independently (i.e. button your own shirt,&#xD;
           feed yourself), and questions about mental health, including depression and intellectual&#xD;
           impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will be asked to return any unused study medication and applicator tips from&#xD;
           the first month of the study and be given the next 1-month supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will inquire about medication changes and collect medication use logs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3- Week 8 follow-up: (Approximately 1/2 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will be asked to return any unused study medication from the second month of&#xD;
           the study and be given the next 1-month supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will inquire about medication changes and collect medication use logs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4- Week 12 follow-up: (Approximately 1 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venipuncture (blood draw, (40 mL / ~3 Tbsp) to assess blood antioxidant status..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment of PD severity: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to&#xD;
           assess degree of tremor, ability to walk across the room, questions about ability to&#xD;
           function independently (i.e. button your own shirt, feed yourself), and questions about&#xD;
           mental health, including depression and intellectual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to return any unused study medication from the third month of&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will inquire about medication changes and collect medication use logs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5- Week 16 follow-up: (Approximately 1 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit is included to determine whether there are any lasting effects of the study&#xD;
      medication one month following discontinuation of use. The visit will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venipuncture (blood draw, (40 mL / ~3 Tbsp) to assess blood antioxidant status..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment of PD severity: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)&#xD;
           which involves assessing degree of tremor, ability to walk across the room, questions&#xD;
           about ability to function independently (i.e. button your own shirt, feed yourself), and&#xD;
           questions about mental health, including depression and intellectual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, approximately 5 hours will be required for study participation. Blood draws will&#xD;
      occur at most, but not all visits, and will not exceed 4 Tbsp per month.&#xD;
