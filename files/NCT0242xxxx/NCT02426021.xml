      The objective of the study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effect of a single dose of MLN1202 in healthy Japanese male adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, phase 1 study in healthy Japanese and Caucasian male adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Japanese subjects will be assigned to Cohort J1 (at a dose of 75 mg), Cohort J2 (105 mg),&#xD;
      Cohort J3 (150 mg), or Cohort J4 (450 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      manner, while Caucasian subjects to Cohort C1 (at a dose of 75 mg) or Cohort C2 (150 mg) in&#xD;
      an open-label manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Takeda has made a business decision to terminate this study due to portfolio&#xD;
      re-prioritization. There were no safety or efficacy concerns.&#xD;
