  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most frequent complication in patients that undergo&#xD;
      abdominal surgery. A previous prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective open abdominal procedures showed that case-relevant communication protects from&#xD;
      organ/space SSI whereas case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the&#xD;
      procedure is a risk factor for incisional SSI. Therefore, the introduction of a clinical&#xD;
      applicable intervention &quot;structured briefing using the StOP protocol&quot; has been developed and&#xD;
      was tested in pilot experiments. This intervention aims at improving case-relevant&#xD;
      communication during the procedure and to reduce excess case-irrelevant communication at the&#xD;
      end of an operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is: structured briefings during an operation reduce the incidence of SSI after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of publications has shown a relatively high rate of complications that are related&#xD;
      to the treatment and not to the disease. Such iatrogenic incidents are an important influence&#xD;
      on patient morbidity and increase healthcare costs. Therefore, patient safety and minimizing&#xD;
      the risk of iatrogenic harm has become a major concern in healthcare. Surgical site infection&#xD;
      (SSI) is one of the most frequent complication in patients that undergo surgery, leading to&#xD;
      considerable costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, the investigators established an empirical relationship between&#xD;
      communication during surgery and SSI was shown in a prospective observational study in 167&#xD;
      patients undergoing major elective open abdominal procedures. An analysis of 11383&#xD;
      communication events observed by a team of trained work psychologists showed a relationship&#xD;
      between intraoperative communication and SSI. Adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed&#xD;
      that more case-relevant communication during the entire procedure was associated with a&#xD;
      significant reduction in organ/space SSI (odds ratio 0.861, 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      0.750-0.987; P=0.034). Interestingly, case-irrelevant communication during the last 20&#xD;
      minutes of the procedure was associated with a significant increase of incisional SSI (odds&#xD;
      ratio 1.1153, 95% confidence interval 1.040-1.196; P=0.002). Distractors such as noise and&#xD;
      traffic were also assessed but had no effect on SSI. The current study is based on these&#xD;
      observations, which reveal that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI and&#xD;
      case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor&#xD;
      for SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings can be interpreted in light of previous studies assessing communication in&#xD;
      surgery and similar collaborative tasks which showed that explicit task-relevant&#xD;
      communication fosters the development of a shared mental model of the task within the team.&#xD;
      This facilitates coordination, because all team members are informed about the state of task&#xD;
      progress, and can better anticipate their contribution. This is particularly important in&#xD;
      critical phases of the procedure, as well as in OR teams composed of members with different&#xD;
      levels of knowledge and expertise. Explicit task-related communication may be particularly&#xD;
      useful to inform non-sterile team members (anesthetists, scrub nurses) that do not have full&#xD;
      sight of the operative field at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although case-irrelevant communication in surgical teams has been found to foster a positive&#xD;
      team-climate, it can be seen as a distractor if it diverts the attention away from the main&#xD;
      task. This is more likely during the closing phase (last 20 minutes), because for most of the&#xD;
      team members, the central task is already finished, and clearing and cleaning are routine&#xD;
      tasks. If during routine tasks the team engages in too much non-patient relevant&#xD;
      communication, attention to the closure may be diverted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the previously found results, the introduction of a clinically applicable intervention&#xD;
      (described below) has been tested in pilot studies. This intervention aims to assure a short&#xD;
      discussion of case-relevant aspects at specific moments of the procedure, draw the attention&#xD;
      of the on case-relevant communication during the main phase and to prevent a high increase in&#xD;
      case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform a prospective clinical trial to test the impact of structured intraoperative&#xD;
      briefings on SSI. The incidence of SSIs will be compared before and after the introduction of&#xD;
      this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Intraoperative briefings: First briefing: after exposure of the organ of interest, Second&#xD;
      briefing: Intraoperative briefing before closure of the operative field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trainings and Retrainings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional Interventions: Transparent drape between anesthesia and sterile team;&#xD;
           Controlling noise and potential distractors during wound closure; Nutritional support&#xD;
           during the operation&#xD;
