  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Safe, Healthy, Adolescent Relationships and Peers study seeks to understand some of the&#xD;
      factors that contribute to the behaviors and health of teen girls, such as girl's&#xD;
      friendships, their dating behaviors, their risk-taking behaviors, and their knowledge about&#xD;
      how to make healthy choices. This study will inform us on ways to help teen girls engage in&#xD;
      safe and healthy relationships and adjustment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initiation of drug use and participation in sexual-risk behaviors such as having multiple&#xD;
      sexual partners, unprotected sexual intercourse, and intercourse with drug users are all too&#xD;
      common among girls with at-risk histories, such as those who have experienced poverty, abuse,&#xD;
      neglect, or been in the juvenile justice system. Studies consistently find that these girls&#xD;
      have disproportionately high rates of these problems that, in addition to increasing risk for&#xD;
      negative outcomes, have other costly sequelae such as drug addiction, early pregnancy,&#xD;
      sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV contraction, delinquency, and early mortality&#xD;
      (e.g., Santelli et al., 2001; Stueve et al., 2005). In our prior work, the investigators&#xD;
      showed that the investigators could prevent early onset sexual intercourse and tobacco and&#xD;
      marijuana initiation in pre-teen girls in foster care. Although this intervention, delivered&#xD;
      to girls who were 11-years old and had not yet entered middle school, demonstrated efficacy,&#xD;
      the investigators know very little about how to prevent the more serious and costly&#xD;
      sexual-risk and illicit drug use behaviors in at-risk girls during the high school years, a&#xD;
      period of risk for engagement in such behaviors. This study builds from this prior work to&#xD;
      develop a new intervention for teenage girls with early adversity.&#xD;
