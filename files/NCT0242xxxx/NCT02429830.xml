  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the LINX device in patients who have previously&#xD;
      undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) for obesity and have chronic gastroesophageal&#xD;
      reflux disease (GERD). The study will monitor safety and changes in reflux symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to confirm safety and efficacy after laparoscopic sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy (LSG) in subjects indicated for LINX is similar to the outcomes that formed the&#xD;
      basis for the LINX Premarket Approval to support modification of the current labeling.&#xD;
      Presently, there is a precautionary statement that safety and effectiveness of the LINX has&#xD;
      not been established for prior esophageal or gastric surgery or endoscopic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with GERD that have undergone a LSG procedure have limited surgical treatment&#xD;
      options if they are looking for an alternative to continuous acid suppression therapy (i.e.&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors or equivalent). One procedure, fundoplication, is extremely difficult&#xD;
      to perform as LSG patients have a limited amount of fundus tissue remaining after sleeve&#xD;
      surgery. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may be chosen as a conversion procedure but is more&#xD;
      invasive with the potential for serious complications. LINX may be considered as an&#xD;
      alternative and less invasive option that may potentially have few complications compared to&#xD;
      RYGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an observational, multicenter, single-arm study with prospective enrollment.&#xD;
      Based on the observational status of the study, no formal statistical hypothesis tests will&#xD;
      be conducted. Up to 30 patients meeting the eligibility requirements will be implanted with&#xD;
      LINX and followed through 12-months after implant. Up to twelve (12) clinical sites will&#xD;
      enroll subjects. Safety evaluations will be ongoing throughout the duration of the study,&#xD;
      starting at the implant procedure. Efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at the 12-month&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated based on the rate of serious device and procedure related adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs). Safety will also be evaluated by endoscopy to assess the mucosa and x-rays to&#xD;
      verify device location at 12 months post implant. Efficacy will be measured at 12 months&#xD;
      (compared to baseline) by examining 3 variables: normalization of total distal acid exposure&#xD;
      or at least a 50% reduction, at least a 50% reduction in total GERD-HRQL scores and at least&#xD;
      a 50% reduction in average daily PPI dosage.&#xD;
