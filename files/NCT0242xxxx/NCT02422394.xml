    <textblock>
      Inherited thrombocytopenias (ITs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a&#xD;
      reduced number of blood platelets and a consequent bleeding tendency that ranges from mild to&#xD;
      life-threatening. Thrombocytopenia is caused by genetic mutations and therefore is present&#xD;
      throughout life and can be transmitted to the progeny. Some patients with severely reduced&#xD;
      platelet count present spontaneous bleeding, which represents a major clinical problem: in&#xD;
      fact, bleeding diathesis exposes these subjects to the risk of severe hemorrhages, affects&#xD;
      their quality of life and often requires hospitalization and/or transfusions. Conversely,&#xD;
      other patients with ITs have absent or mild spontaneous bleeding tendency. However, even&#xD;
      these patients are at risk of major bleeding on the occasion of surgery or other invasive&#xD;
      procedures. Therefore, the potential for hemorrhages on the occasion of invasive procedures&#xD;
      represent a clinical problem for all patients affected by ITs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag is a drug, available in tablets, which stimulates the production of platelets by&#xD;
      the bone marrow. A previous study demonstrated that a short course of eltrombopag was&#xD;
      effective in increasing platelet count in most patients with the MYH9-related disease&#xD;
      (MYH9-RD), the most frequent form of IT. Eltrombopag was given for 3 to 6 weeks to 12&#xD;
      patients with MYH9-RD and platelet counts lower than 50 x10e9/L. Eleven patients responded to&#xD;
      the drug and 8 of them obtained platelet counts higher than 100 x10e9/L or three times the&#xD;
      baseline value. Remission of spontaneous bleeding was achieved by 8 of 10 patients and&#xD;
      treatment was well tolerated in all the cases. Based on these findings, short-term&#xD;
      eltrombopag courses have been successfully used for preparing for major surgery two patients&#xD;
      with MYH9-RD and less than 20 x10e9 platelets/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study has two main objectives. - To verify if eltrombopag is effective in&#xD;
      transiently increasing platelet count over 100 x 10e9/L and abolishing bleeding tendency in&#xD;
      patients with different forms of IT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, eltrombopag will be given for 3-6 weeks to patients with different forms of IT.&#xD;
      Eltrombopag will be administered at the dose of 50 mg/day for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, the patients who will obtain a platelet count higher than 100 x10e9/L and complete&#xD;
      remission of bleeding tendency will stop therapy. In the other cases, patients will be&#xD;
      treated with eltrombopag at a higher dose (75 mg/day) for 3 additional weeks. This treatment&#xD;
      schedule is called &quot;Phase 1&quot; of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study will achieve this goal, short-term eltrombopag could be potentially used in the&#xD;
      future to prepare these patients for surgery or other invasive procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To verify if eltrombopag can be used to stably reduce spontaneous bleeding tendency for&#xD;
      long periods of time in patients with clinically significant spontaneous hemorrhages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, patients with clinically significant spontaneous bleedings at baseline and who&#xD;
      had their bleeding tendency reduced during the Phase 1 of the study without severe side&#xD;
      effects, will be admitted to the &quot;Phase 2&quot; of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Phase 2, patients will be treated with eltrombopag for 16 weeks. In order to&#xD;
      determine the lowest dose of eltrombopag that is able to reduce or abolish their bleeding&#xD;
      tendency, patients will start treatment with eltrombopag 25 mg/day for 4 weeks. Then, every 4&#xD;
      weeks, patients will be re-evaluated and the dosage of eltrombopag will be adjusted according&#xD;
      to bleeding tendency and platelet count. The dosages of eltrombopag that can be used in the&#xD;
      Phase 2 range from 12.5 to 75 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate safety and tolerability of Eltrombopag in patients affected with ITs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify the dosages of Eltrombopag required for achieving the primary endpoints of&#xD;
           Phases 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study the effects of Phase 2 treatment on patients' health-related quality of life&#xD;
           (HR-QoL);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study the effects of treatment on some laboratory parameters related to platelet&#xD;
           production and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be undergo a follow-up visit 30 days after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated as outpatients. The evaluation of patients at enrollment and at each&#xD;
      subsequent on-treatment and post-treatment visits includes: medical history; physical&#xD;
      examination; evaluation of bleeding tendency according to WHO bleeding scale; CBC and&#xD;
      differential; platelet count by phase-contrast microscopy; peripheral blood smear&#xD;
      examination; plasma transaminases, bilirubin, and creatinine; urine analysis; ophthalmic&#xD;
      assessment (only at some visits); measurement of serum thrombopoietin level; evaluation of&#xD;
      HR-QoL (only at baseline and during Phase 2); evaluation of in vitro platelet aggregation in&#xD;
      response to ADP, collagen and ristocetin whenever platelet count is over 100 x 10e9/L.&#xD;
