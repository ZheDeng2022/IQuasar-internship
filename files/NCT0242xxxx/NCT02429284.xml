      The U.S. CTEPH Registry is a multicenter, observational, U.S.-based study of the clinical&#xD;
      course and treatment of patients diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (CTEPH), WHO Group IV Classification for Pulmonary Hypertension. The mission of the Registry&#xD;
      will be to promote a greater understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, evaluation,&#xD;
      and treatment of patients with CTEPH through shared information, education, and collaborative&#xD;
      investigation among pulmonary hypertension (PH) centers of excellence throughout the U.S.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a subset of pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (PH) characterized by the obstruction of pulmonary arteries with fibrotic material and&#xD;
      vascular remodeling that leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and right ventricular&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A United States CTEPH Registry has been established under the guidance of a Steering&#xD;
      Committee consisting of recognized physicians and scientists with expertise in CTEPH and&#xD;
      related diseases. The mission of the Registry will be to promote a greater understanding of&#xD;
      the prevalence, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of patients with CTEPH through&#xD;
      shared information, education, and collaborative investigation among PH centers of excellence&#xD;
      throughout the U.S. The development of a national CTEPH registry will be an important element&#xD;
      in the advancement of the understanding of CTEPH and improvement in the care of patients who&#xD;
      suffer from this debilitating disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive consenting patients recently diagnosed (&lt; 6 months) with CTEPH at&#xD;
      participating study sites will be enrolled. At the time of study entry, data on prior history&#xD;
      and evaluation will be obtained from patient interview and review of medical records.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed biannually after enrollment until the conclusion of the study&#xD;
      (minimum of 1 year follow-up for final patients enrolled).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the data gathered by the Registry will be presented as descriptive statistics. The&#xD;
      Registry will seek the assistance of a biostatistician to develop a statistical plan for&#xD;
      within patient and between patient cohort analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 750 patients with newly diagnosed (&lt; 6 months) CTEPH will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME FRAME:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed from the time of their enrollment until 1 year after the final&#xD;
      patient is enrolled. Short term outcome measures and medical history will be collected during&#xD;
      the initial visit, and clinical data will be collected from the initial clinic visits,&#xD;
      hospital says, or procedures (if applicable). Patients will then be followed every 6 months&#xD;
      after their enrollment for long term outcome measures on quality of life, functional status,&#xD;
      and medical treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics and Clinical Course:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics, risk factors, time to appropriate testing and diagnosis, PAH targeted&#xD;
      medication use, functional status, and hemodynamics at the time of enrollment will be&#xD;
      provided annually as aggregate data to all investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating Outcomes of PTE Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics of the peri-operative data collected will be provided as aggregate&#xD;
      data to all investigators annually. Immediate post-operative and longitudinal follow-up of&#xD;
      all patients undergoing PTE surgery will also be provided as aggregate data annually to all&#xD;
      sites. Comparisons of hemodynamics, functional status, medication and supplemental oxygen use&#xD;
      and healthcare utilization will be made between the pre-operative data and longitudinal&#xD;
      post-operative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating Predictors of Successful PTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using longitudinal data collected on post-operative PTE patients, a definition of &quot;successful&#xD;
      PTE&quot; will be established based upon hemodynamics, functional status and QoL. Retrospective&#xD;
      analysis of pre-, peri-, and post-operative data can then be analyzed to identify factors&#xD;
      that predict a &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;unsuccessful&quot; PTE surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating Outcomes of Nonsurgical Therapy of CTEPH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predominantly descriptive statistics will be used to describe why patients are not operative&#xD;
      candidates and the nonsurgical therapies (medication, balloon pulmonary angioplasty) used for&#xD;
      treatment. Changes in hemodynamics, functional status, QoL and healthcare utilization on&#xD;
      therapy will be provided as aggregate data annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evolving Research Needs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adapt to the evolving science and research needs of the CTEPH community, separate analysis&#xD;
      plans will be developed for new objectives identified and minor changes in the eCRF may occur&#xD;
      in response to new diagnostics and treatments, if approved by the Steering Committee. Ongoing&#xD;
      assessment of enrollment and data captured will also be performed by the Steering Committee&#xD;
      to be certain the goals of the Registry are being met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMMITTEES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Steering Committee, chaired by Dr. Kim Kerr, is comprised of thought leaders in the areas&#xD;
      of cardiology, pulmonology, and cardiothoracic surgery with expertise in CTEPH. The committee&#xD;
      will have the following responsibilities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide advice and guidance on the U.S. CTEPH Registry study design and protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide advice and guidance on the variables to be captured by the eCRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide guidance on study sites selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review data results and provide insights into interpretation of the data annually&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide input on the planning and organization of abstracts and manuscripts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review abstracts and papers for submission to scientific journals or conferences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Present data at conferences&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Adjudication Committee, consisting of physicians with expertise in the diagnosis of CTEPH,&#xD;
      will review all patients felt by Investigators to be eligible for the Registry. The&#xD;
      adjudication committee members must confirm the diagnosis of CTEPH before the subject can be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Registry.&#xD;

        All consecutive consenting patients recently diagnosed (&lt; 6 months) with CTEPH at&#xD;
        participating study sites will be enrolled. Patients must meet inclusion criteria and have&#xD;
        the diagnosis of CTEPH confirmed by the Adjudication Committee (AC) to be enrolled. Adult&#xD;
        and pediatric patients may be enrolled and prior medical therapy will not exclude patients&#xD;
        from enrollment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be a permanent resident of the United States&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of the following hemodynamic parameters by right heart catheterization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm) ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest and,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤ 15 mm Hg (or &gt; 15 mmHg if justified)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiologic confirmation that chronic thromboembolic disease is the cause of the&#xD;
             pulmonary hypertension by&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One or more mismatched perfusion defect(s) by lung ventilation/perfusion scan,&#xD;
                  and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Confirmation of chronic thromboembolic disease by evidence of bands/webs, vessel&#xD;
