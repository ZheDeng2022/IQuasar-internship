    <textblock>
      Home dialysis patients must be seen in a face to face visit on a monthly basis. For patients&#xD;
      who live remotely these visits may impact their quality of life due to the amount of time&#xD;
      needed to attend these visits. The central hypothesis is that implementation of telemedicine&#xD;
      visits as a substitute for the 2 out of 3 monthly face-to-face visits over a 6 month period&#xD;
      will improve quality of life as judged by the quality of life (QoL) indices Kidney Disease&#xD;
      Quality of Life - Short Form and the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale when compared to QoL&#xD;
      scales taken during a time period when the patient is on standard of care.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritoneal Dialysis is used by over 100,000 patients worldwide but only about 7% of patients&#xD;
      in the United States. 1 As it is much less expensive than its in-center hemodialysis&#xD;
      counterpart and provides improved quality of life, strategies are needed to increase its&#xD;
      utilization. One potential barrier to peritoneal dialysis is the geographic barriers to care&#xD;
      which exist in geographically diverse and large countries such as Canada, India, Australia,&#xD;
      and the United States. 2,3 Access to an experienced home dialysis unit is limited in many&#xD;
      parts of the United States and can contribute to low utilization rates by physician&#xD;
      discomfort with the therapy as well as increased technique failure rates with inexperienced&#xD;
      centers. 4-7 Prakash et al recently have shown that only 55% of dialysis units are certified&#xD;
      to provide home dialysis. 8 In more rural networks such as network 8 (Alabama, Mississippi,&#xD;
      and Tennessee), this number drops to 38% thus increasing the geographic barriers to the&#xD;
      provision of home dialysis care. Patients currently living in rural areas and on a home&#xD;
      therapy are faced with long commutes and time commitments adding up to significant financial&#xD;
      hardships for the patients. Furthermore, these commutes impact quality of life. Telemedicine&#xD;
      and telemonitoring may provide a means to bridge these geographic barrier thus improving&#xD;
      access to home dialysis care and improving patient quality of life on the therapy and thus&#xD;
      increasing its utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of telemedicine in the provision of home dialysis care has received very limited&#xD;
      attention worldwide and even less in the United States. Early studies using telemedicine in&#xD;
      remote care suffered from high costs of implementing secure T1 lines and limited technology.9&#xD;
      Gallar et al in Spain published 2 years of experience using alternating videoconferencing&#xD;
      visits and standard hospitalized visits, showing cost savings, ability to evaluate the&#xD;
      patient for edema and exit site evaluation, as well as decreased time associated with each&#xD;
      visit. 10 Nakamoto et al. in Japan published on their tool to transmit blood pressures,&#xD;
      glucose readings remotely etc. 11 Since these initial studies and conceptualization of&#xD;
      telemedicine, technology has increased at a very fast pace. Videoconferencing technology has&#xD;
      become much smaller, more sophisticated, easier to use, and more inexpensive making it a&#xD;
      mainstay in daily life including applications such as face time and skype. Technology&#xD;
      literacy as well has continued to increase since early 2000. A recent survey among peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis patients showed that 88% owned a computer and 94% knew how to use a computer. 12&#xD;
      Furthermore, 83% of patients wished to participate in telemedicine. 12 It is within this&#xD;
      environment that telemedicine and the application to home dialysis may begin to transform the&#xD;
      delivery of care in home dialysis thus increasing peritoneal dialysis utilization by&#xD;
      improving convenience of the therapy and improving the quality of life. Such interventions&#xD;
      are already gaining popularity in countries such as India. 3 Studies are needed to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility of telemedicine in the provision of home dialysis care in the United States&#xD;
      and if quality of life of patients using this mechanism are improved. Furthermore, studies&#xD;
      showing outcomes are similar if not improved using telemedicine are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this project is to improve access to peritoneal dialysis care and the&#xD;
      quality of lives of patients on dialysis by evaluating ways to eliminate the geographic&#xD;
      barrier. The objective here is to determine if specifically telemedicine has this capacity.&#xD;
      By evaluating and establishing a framework by which home dialysis care could be provided via&#xD;
      telemedicine and determining the impact on quality of life for these patients, policy could&#xD;
      be informed as to coverage of telemedicine as a substitute for the current face-to-face&#xD;
      requirement by Medicare. Furthermore, this intervention has the possibility of improving&#xD;
      quality of life and if effective possibly increasing the utilization of peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
      both by patients rural and urban due to increased convenience of the therapy with respect to&#xD;
      in-center hemodialysis. The central hypothesis is that implementation of telemedicine visits&#xD;
      as a substitute for the 2 out of 3 monthly face-to-face visits over a 6 month period will&#xD;
      improve quality of life as judged by the quality of life (QoL) indices Kidney Disease Quality&#xD;
      of Life - Short Form and the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale when compared to QoL scales&#xD;
      taken during a time period when the patient is on standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the impact of telemedicine on quality of life as indicated two quality of life&#xD;
           surveys: 1) The KDQOL- SF and the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale .&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators postulate that patients, during the telemedicine intervention will&#xD;
           improve the quality of life scores on the KDQOL-SF form by the minimum clinically&#xD;
           significant change of 3 points, as compared to themselves during a time period of&#xD;
           standard of care visits (Not telemedicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the feasibility of the use of telemedicine and remote monitoring in the&#xD;
           provision of care for peritoneal dialysis patients as a substitute for two out of 3&#xD;
           monthly face-to-face visits over a 6 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on the work by Nayak et al. in India, the investigators feel that telemedicine&#xD;
           visits as a substitute for the face-to-face visit will be both feasible and&#xD;
           advantageous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obtain preliminary data on efficacy of the intervention with regards to outcomes with a&#xD;
           composite endpoint of episodes of peritonitis and hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators postulate that there will be either no difference in outcomes or an&#xD;
      improvement in outcomes in the telemedicine intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Peritoneal Dialysis&#xD;
      Unit. All patient's addresses are known and will be screened in order to determine inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Upon enrollment, patients will be administered the KDQOL-SF and the IIRS. Patient&#xD;
      will all start in the standard of care arm. During this time period the patients will receive&#xD;
      6 months of visits as per the usual standard of care. Data will be collected during this time&#xD;
      regarding hospitalizations, peritonitis, technique failures, and access procedures. Monthly&#xD;
      labwork including hemoglobin, phosphorus, parathyroid level, iron, total iron binding&#xD;
      capacity, and ferritin will also be collected. At the end of 6 months the KDQOL-SF and IIRS&#xD;
      will again be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then transition to the telemedicine arm of the study for the duration of 6&#xD;
      months. During this time, the patient will come to the dialysis unit on a quarterly basis for&#xD;
      a standard visit with labs being drawn in-center and for an in-center Kt/V. For the 2 months&#xD;
      following the visit ,however, the patient will not be required to come to the dialysis unit.&#xD;
      The monthly face to face and labs will be achieved remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do this, the investigators have partnered with the Alabama Department of Public&#xD;
      Health. During the telemedicine visits, the patient will present to their county health&#xD;
      department which are now outfitted with the capability to provide interactive telemedicine&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exam: The patient will be examined during this telemedicine encounter using blue-tooth&#xD;
      stethoscopes, placed on the patients chest by personnel in the county health department. The&#xD;
      exit site will be examined using the remote camera. Fluid status will be monitored by both&#xD;
      lung exam, weights which the patient does on a routine basis, and the examination of pitting&#xD;
      edema as done over a telemedicine interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labs- On the quarterly &quot;standard&quot; visit during the telemedicine intervention, the patient&#xD;
      will be given 2 preaddressed and prestamped containers with all vials needed to collect their&#xD;
      monthly labs. The patient during their telemedicine visits will bring this container with&#xD;
      blood collection tubes to the county health department. There, personnel a the health&#xD;
      department will perform phlebotomy, using the predetermined blood collection tubes. Once&#xD;
      filled, these tubes will be sent in the prestamped container to the Davita Central Lab for&#xD;
      further processing. In this way, no additional cost for labs will be incurred, and lab&#xD;
      results will be standardized in one central lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow sheets: Patients records of therapy will be obtained using the Baxter ProCard. The&#xD;
      patient will be trained on these cards prior to going to the telemedicine arm of the study.&#xD;
      The patients will then be given 2 cards. Patients will use 1 procard for the month, and prior&#xD;
      to their telemedicine visit will send this card in for download. Patients will then begin to&#xD;
      use thesecond card, the previous card will be sent back to the patient via mail prior to&#xD;
      their second visit such that it is had for their 3rd month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote QoL Surveys: Patients will be administered either over the phone or on a paper form&#xD;
      depending on literacy the KDQOL-SF and the IIRS survey on Visit 3, and Visit 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of telemedicine arm, patients will return to Standard of Care and after 2&#xD;
      months of being back on standard of care, KDQOL-SF and IIRS again will be administered.&#xD;
