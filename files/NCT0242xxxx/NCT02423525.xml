    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try to determine the maximum safe dose of afatinib that can&#xD;
      be administered to people with brain cancer. Other purposes of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  find out what effects (good and bad) afatinib has;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  see how much drug gets into the body by collecting blood and cerebrospinal fluid for use&#xD;
           in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  learn more about how afatinib might affect the growth of cancer cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  look at biomarkers (biochemical features that can be used to measure the progress of&#xD;
           disease or the effects of a drug).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single institution, Phase I 3+3 dose escalation study to describe the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of afatinib in patients with brain cancer having failed prior therapy&#xD;
      and to determine the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive afatinib in treatment cycles of 28 days that will consist of&#xD;
      afatinib administered orally by mouth once every four days. Patients will be assigned to the&#xD;
      dose level open at the time of their enrollment. Patients will continue dosing of afatinib&#xD;
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or treating&#xD;
      physician determines it is in their best interest to stop. Guidelines for modifying study&#xD;
      drug doses is provided for the management of adverse treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have regular evaluations for assessment of safety parameters as detailed in&#xD;
      the study flow chart. Lumbar puncture and blood draw for assessing afatinib levels will occur&#xD;
      as detailed in the study flow chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological imaging and assessment for response will be performed approximately every eight&#xD;
      weeks. Tumor response will be assessed according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
      (RANO) Working Group criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end of treatment evaluation will occur when a patient permanently discontinues study drug,&#xD;
      as detailed in the study flow chart. Patients will then be followed every four months for&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
