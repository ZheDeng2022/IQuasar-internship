  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with gastroparesis, gastric emptying will&#xD;
      improve with celiac plexus block. By improving gastric emptying, symptoms related to&#xD;
      gastroparesis including nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and weight loss, will&#xD;
      also improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study this hypothesis, the investigators will enroll patients with gastroparesis&#xD;
      who are non-responsive to the current treatments available. Patients will fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire to assess the severity of their symptoms then undergo Ansar testing (a&#xD;
      non-invasive test) to measure their autonomic function respectively. Then, patients will&#xD;
      undergo a celiac plexus block which is performed via an upper endoscopy. One week after the&#xD;
      procedure, patients will be asked to undergo a gastric emptying study as well as repeat the&#xD;
      Ansar testing to evaluate for any improvement in the gastric emptying and autonomic function&#xD;
      respectively. Patient will be asked to repeat the questionnaire, one, two, three, and eight&#xD;
      weeks after their procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will identify patients with gastroparesis due to idiopathic causes&#xD;
      (including post-viral) and diabetes who have undergone a 4 hour gastric emptying study&#xD;
      showing delayed gastric emptying. Patients enrolled must have clinical symptoms due to&#xD;
      gastroparesis including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, early satiety, bloating, reflux,&#xD;
      postprandial fullness or weight loss. Patients included in the study may be refractory to&#xD;
      treatment or ineligible for current standard of care with metoclopramide, domperidone,&#xD;
      macrolide antibiotics, or pyloric injections with botulinum toxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to enroll in the study will sign an informed consent which will explain&#xD;
      study purpose along with the risks of the procedures involved in the study. One of the team&#xD;
      members will also explain the study to the patient either over the phone or in person and&#xD;
      answer any questions they may have in regards to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are enrolled in the study will fill out a questionnaire comprised of the&#xD;
      gastroparesis cardinal symptom index daily diary (GCSI-DD) and visual analog scale (VAS) to&#xD;
      assess severity of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloating. Then, patients will&#xD;
      undergo autonomic function measurements using the Ansar system which is a non-invasive&#xD;
      measurement of the autonomic system using blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate&#xD;
      monitoring. Ansar testing takes approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, patients will undergo a celiac plexus block, performed endoscopically with EUS-&#xD;
      guidance by Ann Chen. Injections will be performed using 0.75% bupivicaine and 40mg/ml of&#xD;
      triamcinolone, ideally 1ml each directly into the celiac ganglia. If no ganglia is&#xD;
      identifiable, then the injection will be performed into the celiac space, located at the take&#xD;
      off of the celiac artery from the aorta. One week after their block, a gastric emptying study&#xD;
      and Ansar testing will be performed. The GCSI-DD/VAS questionnaire will be repeated 1 week, 2&#xD;
      weeks, 3 weeks, and 2 months after the procedure.&#xD;
