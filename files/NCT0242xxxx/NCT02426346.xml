      Community-based programs are needed to improve dissemination of efficacious treatment for&#xD;
      adolescent obesity. The current study aims to modify a community-based program, delivered&#xD;
      through the YMCA, to increase its effectiveness with adolescents. Adolescents will be&#xD;
      randomized to either a 16-week standard program (JOIN) or a targeted intervention tailored&#xD;
      for adolescents (TEEN JOIN). Primary outcomes include changes in BMI, objectively measured&#xD;
      physical activity, and self-efficacy, assessed at 4 months and 10 months following&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provided a Grade recommendation B&#xD;
      (i.e. the service is recommended with moderate/high certainty of benefit) for clinicians to&#xD;
      screen children ages 6-17 years for obesity and refer identified youth to comprehensive&#xD;
      behavioral programs. The challenge in meeting this objective is the lack of community-based&#xD;
      obesity treatments to which to refer, particularly for adolescents. The JOIN program,&#xD;
      developed as a collaboration between United HealthGroup and Y-USA is a pediatric weight&#xD;
      control intervention targeted toward a broad age range of youth from 6-17 years that is: 1)&#xD;
      based on well established and evidence based principles; 2) delivered by YMCA facilitators&#xD;
      within a community setting: and 3) potentially scalable nationally. Findings from a 6-month&#xD;
      pilot study examining the effectiveness of JOIN demonstrated impressive changes in weight&#xD;
      status for school age children, but more modest results for adolescents. The primary aim of&#xD;
      this study is to modify the JOIN program to increase its effectiveness with adolescents while&#xD;
      retaining its potential for scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 120 adolescents (ages 13-17) with BMI &gt; 85th% and &lt; 50 will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to a 16-week targeted program (TEEN JOIN), or the traditional JOIN intervention, followed by&#xD;
      biweekly and monthly maintenance sessions. Evaluation of adolescent height, weight, objective&#xD;
      physical activity and psychosocial outcomes will be obtained at baseline, 4 months, and 10&#xD;
      months. Additional outcomes will include treatment feasibility, including attendance,&#xD;
      completion of diet and physical activity monitoring logs, and exit interviews with&#xD;
      adolescents and parents regarding the intervention. The investigators will also obtain&#xD;
      preliminary indicators of cost effectiveness. It is hypothesized that adolescents who are&#xD;
      randomized to TEEN JOIN will demonstrate greater decrease in BMI at 4 and 10 months than&#xD;
      those randomized to JOIN. It is further hypothesized that adolescents randomized to TEEN JOIN&#xD;
      will demonstrate greater increases in participation in moderate-vigorous physical activity&#xD;
      and greater improvements in self-concept, self-efficacy related to physical activity, and&#xD;
      group cohesion than adolescents who receive the standard JOIN condition.&#xD;
