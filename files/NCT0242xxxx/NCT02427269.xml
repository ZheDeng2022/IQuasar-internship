    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To develop a prospective tissue and blood biorepository from patients with a history&#xD;
      of Barrett's Esophagus (BE) or esophageal cancer (ECA) presenting to UNC hospitals for&#xD;
      routine care upper endoscopy for their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To collect clinical data from patients with a history of Barrett's Esophagus (BE) or&#xD;
      esophageal cancer (ECA) that includes demographic data, endoscopic procedure data, and&#xD;
      pathology data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To integrate Aim 1 and 2 in a manner that will provide an efficient bi-directional&#xD;
      flow of clinical information and specimens between laboratory and clinical scientists in&#xD;
      order to foster innovative translational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To create a biorepository for future Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved studies&#xD;
      that have tissue and/or blood specimen component.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be identified during GI clinic visits or procedure visits with Dr. Nicholas&#xD;
      Shaheen or his colleagues at UNC. Patients may also be identified by research personnel&#xD;
      during review of the endoscopy schedule and medical records. If eligible, interested&#xD;
      participants will be provided with a consent form during their clinic or procedure visit.&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be assigned a unique identification (ID) number for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by Dr. Nicholas Shaheen and his colleagues or by other study&#xD;
      personnel prior to their routine care endoscopy at UNC. An investigator, study coordinator,&#xD;
      or other personnel trained in the protocol and referenced in the IRB application will obtain&#xD;
      consent during the patient's visit in the GI clinic or prior to an upper endoscopy. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will have an opportunity to carefully review the consent form, the details of the&#xD;
      study will be reviewed verbally, and all questions will be answered to the satisfaction of&#xD;
      the patient. Only English-speaking adults with the ability to consent will be eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment in this study. After the subject signs the consent, a copy of the signed consent&#xD;
      will be provided to the subject and the coordinator will collect demographic and historical&#xD;
      information from the patient pertaining to illnesses, medication and other relevant&#xD;
      information. The consent process will be documented in the subject's research file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, blood will be obtained and subjects will proceed with their&#xD;
      routine care upper endoscopy. The endoscopist, as per routine practice, will note findings in&#xD;
      the procedure report and photograph or record video to confirm and document key findings, as&#xD;
      well as take biopsies as indicated for routine care. During the procedure up to 10 research&#xD;
      biopsies will be collected as part of this study. Research biopsies will be collected in&#xD;
      addition to routine care biopsies and will be obtained with a standardized biopsy protocol&#xD;
      (below). The total number of research biopsies may vary based on presence/absence of&#xD;
      nodularity but will not exceed 10 research-specific biopsies. This number of esophageal&#xD;
      biopsies is within the standard of care for biopsying the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies for clinical care are taken prior to any consideration of research biopsies.&#xD;
      Research biopsies are taken only if the additional biopsies do not significantly increase the&#xD;
      patient's risk or interfere with routine care procedures. The research biopsy protocol may be&#xD;
      modified by the physician performing the procedure if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to research blood and biopsies, up to 4 cytology brushings for research purposes&#xD;
      may also be obtained during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens collected for this research study will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 10mL red tube and 1 8.5mL yellow tube for serum, plasma, and buffy collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 10 research-specific biopsies obtained from the esophagus during the routine care&#xD;
           esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Four biopsies will be taken from the midpoint of the current Barrett's Esophagus&#xD;
                (BE) (or midpoint of previous Barrett's Esophagus (BE) if the patient has already&#xD;
                received ablation for previous Barrett's Esophagus (BE)),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Two biopsies from normal squamous epithelium, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One biopsy from each area of esophageal nodularity seen during the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathology slides from routine care biopsies taken during the procedure as well as&#xD;
           retrospective pathology slides from routine care biopsies taken prior to enrollment on&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 4 cytology brushes during the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will be immediately frozen on liquid nitrogen then transferred to the -80&#xD;
      biorepository freezer for long term storage. Blood will be immediately processed and&#xD;
      transferred to the -80 biorepository freezer for long-term storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational pathology lab (TPL) maintains formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)&#xD;
      blocks from biopsies taken for routine care. Slides will be cut from these blocks for this&#xD;
      study. Slide requests for this research study will not exhaust the archived tissue and will&#xD;
      leave a substantial amount of the formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block for potential&#xD;
      future clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects return for additional esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) as part of routine&#xD;
      care, then all study procedures will be repeated as part of this registry as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects receiving routine care surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for current&#xD;
      or previous Barrett's Esophagus (BE) or current or previous esophageal cancer (ECA):&#xD;
      Specimens and data will be collected at each routine care surveillance EGD as part of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects receiving routine care treatment EGD for current BE/ECA: Specimens and data will&#xD;
      be collected at the initial treatment EGD, but not during subsequent treatment EGDs. Once&#xD;
      treatment is complete and BE or ECA is clear, this group will begin surveillance EGDs as part&#xD;
      of routine care for their condition. Specimens and data will be collected during subsequent&#xD;
      follow-up surveillance EGDs after treatment is complete.&#xD;
