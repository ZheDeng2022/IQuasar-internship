      The purpose of this study is to determine whether taking daily, dietary supplements of cocoa&#xD;
      extract (containing cocoa flavanols and theobromine from the cocoa bean) and/or a standard&#xD;
      multivitamin reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (including heart attack,&#xD;
      stroke, coronary revascularization, unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS)&#xD;
      requiring hospitalization, carotid artery surgery, and peripheral artery surgery or&#xD;
      angioplasty, and cardiovascular mortality) and cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) is a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      of cocoa extract supplement (containing a total of 600 mg/d cocoa flavanols, including 80 mg.&#xD;
      (-)-epicatechins), and a standard multivitamin supplement to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and cancer among women aged 65 years and older and men aged 60 years&#xD;
      and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the COSMOS trial began, an advanced method to analyze cocoa flavanols was accredited by&#xD;
      AOAC International as a First Action Official Method of Analysis&#xD;
      (https://doi.org/10.1093/jaoacint/qsaa132). This updated method relies on a reference&#xD;
      material (RM8403) recently standardized and made commercially available by the U.S. National&#xD;
      Institute of Standards and Technology. While the actual cocoa flavanol content of the COSMOS&#xD;
      intervention remained unchanged throughout the trial, the application of this new analytical&#xD;
      method led to expected changes in how the total cocoa flavanol content is now reported.&#xD;
      Applying AOAC 2020.05/RM8403 to the COSMOS intervention, the total cocoa flavanol content of&#xD;
      the COSMOS intervention is now 500 mg/day. Reporting of (-)-epicatechin content remained&#xD;
      unaffected. Going forward, we will therefore apply AOAC 2020.05/RM8403 and report that the&#xD;
      COSMOS intervention tested 500 mg/day of cocoa flavanols, including 80 mg of (-)-epicatechin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in COSMOS were recruited from among Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Extension&#xD;
      Study cohort members; non-randomized respondents to mailings for the VITamin D and OmegA-3&#xD;
      TriaL (VITAL); respondents to nationwide invitational mailings to age-eligible adults; and&#xD;
      volunteers who learned about the trial through the media or through ResearchMatch.org, an&#xD;
      electronic recruitment website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several small randomized trials have demonstrated benefits for cocoa flavanols on&#xD;
      intermediate outcomes, including blood pressure, lipids, insulin sensitivity, and&#xD;
      flow-mediated vasodilation. For multivitamins, a prior large-scale randomized trial in&#xD;
      middle-aged and older men showed a significant reduction in cancer, but comparable trial data&#xD;
      in women are lacking. For both interventions, a large-scale clinical trial such as COSMOS&#xD;
      could have major clinical and public health implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants have been assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to one of four groups:&#xD;
      (1) daily cocoa extract and multivitamin; (2) daily cocoa extract and multivitamin placebo;&#xD;
      (3) daily cocoa extract placebo and multivitamin; or (4) daily cocoa extract placebo and&#xD;
      multivitamin placebo. Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to any of these&#xD;
      four groups and a 3 out of 4 chance of receiving at least one active agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in all groups take three pills each day: two capsules that contain either cocoa&#xD;
      extract or cocoa extract placebo, and one tablet that contains either multivitamin or&#xD;
      multivitamin placebo. Participants receive their study pills in convenient calendar packs via&#xD;
      U.S. mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to complete mailed questionnaires each year. The questionnaires ask&#xD;
      about health; lifestyle habits, such as diet, physical activity, and smoking; use of&#xD;
      medications and dietary supplements; family history of illness and new medical diagnoses.&#xD;
      Occasionally, participants may receive a phone call from study staff to collect information&#xD;
      or clarify responses on the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected rates for our original primary composite cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoint&#xD;
      were based on the projected age and sex distribution of the trial cohort and CVD event rates&#xD;
      from our previously conducted trials. However, we determined that the observed rates of CVD&#xD;
      endpoints among COSMOS participants were lower than expected due to a younger population of&#xD;
      women, increasing use of statins and other pharmacotherapies as seen in other recently&#xD;
      published clinical trials, and the impact of COVID-19 on fewer reports of CVD diagnoses,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and procedures. As a result, the COSMOS Data and Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      (DSMB) approved a proposal to add three new outcomes to our primary composite CVD endpoint:&#xD;
      (1) unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization, (2) carotid artery&#xD;
      surgery, and (3) peripheral artery surgery or angioplasty. These additional CVD outcomes are&#xD;
      consistent with the atherosclerotic mechanisms underlying the postulated effects for the&#xD;
      randomized interventions. COSMOS participants have already provided self-reports of these&#xD;
      diagnoses since the start of the COSMOS trial that will be adjudicated via medical records.&#xD;
      The original primary composite CVD endpoint will still be evaluated as a secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, approximately 7,000 COSMOS participants provided optional blood and urine&#xD;
      samples, which will be used to determine whether the study agents significantly change&#xD;
      biomarkers and other risk factors related to cardiovascular disease and cancer. Selected&#xD;
      participants either have specimens collected through mailed specimen collection kits that are&#xD;
      returned by the participant, or have blood, urine, blood pressure, and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements collected by technicians from Examination Management Services, Inc. (EMSI), a&#xD;
      national clinical services provider. A subgroup of those who provide baseline specimens and&#xD;
      measurements are asked to provide follow-up samples and measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and year 2 of the trial, approximately 600 participants living within driving&#xD;
      distance of Boston, Massachusetts provide additional measurements from in-clinic study visits&#xD;
      at the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) of Brigham and Women's Hospital.&#xD;
      These visits include cognitive function assessments, anthropometrics, physical function&#xD;
      assessments, blood pressure and other measurements. The trial will assess whether the study&#xD;
      agents significantly affect changes in these variables over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A cocoa extract supplement will reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, defined&#xD;
           as a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality,&#xD;
           coronary revascularization, unstable angina or ACS requiring hospitalization, carotid&#xD;
           artery surgery, and peripheral artery surgery or angioplasty;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of invasive cancer (excluding non-melanoma&#xD;
           skin cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cocoa extract will reduce the risk of a composite endpoint of MI, stroke, cardiovascular&#xD;
           mortality, and coronary revascularization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cocoa extract will reduce the risk of invasive cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin&#xD;
           cancer);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cocoa extract and/or a daily multivitamin will reduce the combined endpoint of major&#xD;
           cardiovascular events plus all-cause mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cocoa extract and/or a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of individual&#xD;
           cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular&#xD;
           mortality, coronary revascularization, unstable angina or ACS requiring hospitalization,&#xD;
           carotid artery surgery, and peripheral artery surgery or angioplasty, and total&#xD;
           mortality; plus site-specific cancers, including breast, colorectal, and lung cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of cancer among women and men with a history&#xD;
           of cancer at baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. In a subset of equal numbers of female and male COSMOS respondents who provide baseline&#xD;
           bloods, cocoa extract and/or a daily multivitamin will significantly change levels of&#xD;
           blood flavonoids from baseline to 2 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether the cocoa extract and/or a daily multivitamin exhibit synergistic effects&#xD;
      on risk of major cardiovascular events or cancer, and if the effects vary by nutritional&#xD;
      status or medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) Component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether the cocoa extract and/or a daily multivitamin has beneficial effects on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central blood pressure indices as measured by pulse wave&#xD;
           analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cognitive function and memory;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical performance as assessed by balance tests, grip strength, timed chair stands,&#xD;
           and walking speed,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bone loss in the spine, hip and total body as assessed by bone-mineral density (BMD) and&#xD;
           changes in body composition as assessed by dual x-ray absorpiometry (DXA);&#xD;
