  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of ceritinib on&#xD;
      the CYP3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of the probe drugs midazolam and warfarin,&#xD;
      respectively, when administered simultaneously as a cocktail. The results obtained from this&#xD;
      drug interaction study would provide guidance that would enable an update to the ceritinib&#xD;
      labeling and ouldl help guide recommendations for administration of co-medications in future&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB (and is not a candidate&#xD;
        for definitive multimodality therapy) or stage IV NSCLC demonstrated ALK-positive or an&#xD;
        advanced tumor, other than NSCLC, that carries an ALK genetic alteration (mutation,&#xD;
        translocation or amplification) and/or ALK overexpression that has progressed despite&#xD;
        standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy exists.&#xD;
