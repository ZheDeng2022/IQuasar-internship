    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to compare 2 different types of residential&#xD;
      group programs to help researchers learn if and how well these groups may help to improve&#xD;
      physical and emotional well-being in patients with stage IV breast cancer.&#xD;

      Baseline Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signing this consent form does not mean that you will be able to take part in this study. The&#xD;
      following baseline tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 7 questionnaires about your mood, sleep, fatigue, how you have been&#xD;
           feeling, and your general quality of life. The questionnaires should take about 60-80&#xD;
           minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electroencephalogram (EEG) to check your brain's electrical activity.&#xD;
           During the EEG, a snug cap with small electrodes will be placed on your head to measure&#xD;
           the electrical patterns coming from the brain. This is like the way a doctor listens to&#xD;
           your heart from the surface of your skin. During the EEG, you will complete 3 tests to&#xD;
           check your attention, short-term memory, and levels of emotions on the computer. The&#xD;
           study staff will discuss each test in more detail with you. The EEG and tests will take&#xD;
           about 45-60 minutes total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have not had a computed tomography (CT) scan in the last 2 months, you will have&#xD;
           one performed to check the status of the disease. If you have had one in the last 2&#xD;
           months, the results will be collected from your medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for tests to measure hormones and your immune&#xD;
           system responses. You will need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for 12&#xD;
           hours before this blood draw. You will be provided with healthy snacks after your blood&#xD;
           draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after your baseline visit, saliva will be collected to measure the level of cortisol&#xD;
      (a type of stress hormone) in your body. These saliva samples will be collected 4 times each&#xD;
      day for 3 days in a row. You will collect these samples at home when you first wake up, about&#xD;
      45 minutes later, about 10 hours after waking up, and then at bedtime. To collect each saliva&#xD;
      sample, you will chew on a cotton ball for a few seconds and then put the cotton in a small&#xD;
      plastic tube. You will write down the times you took these samples. You will mail these&#xD;
      samples back to MD Anderson in postage-paid envelopes that will be provided to you. The tubes&#xD;
      will also be provided at no cost to you. These saliva samples will be destroyed after being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day for the next 7 days after your baseline visit, you will fill out a diary about your&#xD;
      sleeping habits. You will also wear a special type of wrist watch for these 7 days. The watch&#xD;
      will collect data about your physical activity and sleeping habits. After you have worn it&#xD;
      for 7 days, you will mail the watch and the sleep diary back to MD Anderson in postage-paid&#xD;
      envelopes that will be provided to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to complete and provide all the same measures again 1 month after the first&#xD;
      baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and you agree, you will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no&#xD;
      one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Groups 1 or 2, you will take part in 1 of 2 types of residential&#xD;
           group programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Group 3, you will receive standard cancer care without any&#xD;
           participation in a residential group program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to Groups 1 or 2, neither you nor the study staff will know what kind of&#xD;
      residential group program you are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residential Support Program Sessions (Groups 1 and 2 only):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take part in a 7-day offsite, residential support program in groups of about 10&#xD;
      participants each. On Day 5 of the retreat, you will be joined by your spouse or caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 7 days, you will take part in group activities, learn relaxation skills, do&#xD;
      different cognitive activities (for example, reading, watching movies, and having group&#xD;
      discussions), and learn about mind-body connections. You will spend 7 days and 6 nights at&#xD;
      the residential retreat. Activities at the retreat will last about 12 hours per day with&#xD;
      breaks, group meals, and free time to rest in the morning, afternoon and evening, or as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 1 week before the retreat, you will be given a detailed agenda and schedule of all&#xD;
      activities that will occur during the retreat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Sessions (All Groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete the same tests/procedures that were performed at the baseline visit within&#xD;
      7 days after the residential program ends and then again about 3 months later. If you are in&#xD;
      Group 3, you will complete the same tests/procedures on the same schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will be over after you complete the follow-up sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on which study group you were assigned to, you may be able to take part in a&#xD;
      residential program that you did NOT previously take part in. The study chair or research&#xD;
      staff will discuss this option with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants and their caregivers will take part in this multicenter study. Up to&#xD;
      74 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
