      It is not universal that terminally ill patients choose surrogate in the event of&#xD;
      disagreement between the treating physician and the surrogate at the end of their lives.&#xD;
      There are several factors that influence the terminally ill patient's decision to choose a&#xD;
      decision maker at the end of his / life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The right of the patient to exercise autonomy, whether to accept the recommendation of&#xD;
      physician is not lost when the patient is unable to make health related decision. This is the&#xD;
      basis of substituted judgment. Without written advance directives, a surrogate has to be&#xD;
      assigned using relevant state relationship hierarchy, and usually a family member serves as a&#xD;
      surrogate when the patient no longer has capacity to make medical decisions. Several studies&#xD;
      showed that surrogates do not predict the patients preference accurately when both are asked&#xD;
      to respond to hypothetical questions. Patient designated hierarchy predicted the patient&#xD;
      treatment preferences with 69% accuracy whereas legally assigned proxy was accurate in 68%.&#xD;
      Even the prior discussion of the treatment preferences did not seem to improve the surrogate&#xD;
      accuracy. Surrogates make errors predicting patient's preferences in different directions, as&#xD;
      was found in several studies. Three studies have found that surrogates err by providing&#xD;
      intervention that patients do not want, while others found no specific trends. Other studies&#xD;
      showed physicians to be less accurate than surrogates in predicting the patient's wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have shown that patients want their surrogates to make decision for them when&#xD;
      there is disagreement between the patient's wishes and his or her surrogate. No studies have&#xD;
      looked at patients preferences when there is conflict between the surrogate and the&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To choose the right surrogate is a paramount. One way to do this is to analyze the patient's&#xD;
      trends as to 'how' and 'why' patients choose his or her surrogates. Little is known about&#xD;
      what factors influence the patients' decisions to choose the surrogate and what would be&#xD;
      their decision in the event of disagreement between the treating physician and the surrogate.&#xD;
      Factors such as patient's culture, ethnic or religious background may play an important role&#xD;
      in patients' preferences at the end of their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to assess terminally ill patients' decision making preferences at the&#xD;
      end of life and identify specific factors that determine their preferences.&#xD;
