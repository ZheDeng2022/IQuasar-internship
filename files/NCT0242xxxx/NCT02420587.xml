      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will take capsules of&#xD;
      AMG208 by mouth 1 time every day while they are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant should fast (not have anything except water) for 2 hours before and 1 hour after&#xD;
      they take the AMG208 capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be asked to keep a diary to help them keep track of when they take each dose&#xD;
      of the study drug. Participant should record any missed or vomited doses in the diary. If&#xD;
      participant vomits their dose, they should not re-take their dose. Participant should wait&#xD;
      until their next scheduled dose. Participant should bring the diary with them to each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks is considered a cycle. Participant should return all unused study drug and/or&#xD;
      empty pill bottles at the end of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 (+/ - 3 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease and for biomarker testing. To collect a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, an area of&#xD;
           the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is&#xD;
           withdrawn through a large needle. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be&#xD;
           related to participant's reaction to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 22 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG. Participant will have 2 more EKGs if the study doctor&#xD;
           thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check participant's PSA level, to measure CTCs, and for biomarker&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will fill out the questionnaire about pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and every 6 weeks after that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check participant's PSA and testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will fill out the questionnaire about pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, and every 12 weeks after that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a bone scan and a CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis,&#xD;
           and any other area the study doctor thinks is needed to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG. Participant will have 2 more EKGs if the study doctor&#xD;
           thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn to check participant's thyroid function, and&#xD;
           for CTC and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have either an ECHO or a MUGA scan. (Cycles 2 and 5 only and every 12&#xD;
           weeks after that)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 participant will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 22 of Cycle 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check participant's PSA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will fill out the questionnaire about pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 5, participant will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease&#xD;
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they have not been done within the last week, within 5 days after participant's last dose&#xD;
      of study drug, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check participant's PSA levels, thyroid function, for biomarker&#xD;
           testing, and to measure CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a bone scan and a CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis,&#xD;
           and any other area the study doctor thinks is needed to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will fill out the questionnaire about pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after participant stops taking the study drug, the following procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood&#xD;
           will also be used to check participant's PSA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. AMG208 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is&#xD;
      being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of metastatic disease to the bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a castrate level of testosterone (&lt;/= 50 ng/dL) at the screening&#xD;
             visit, medical or surgically induced. For patients who are medically castrated,&#xD;
             gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist or analog must continue to maintain&#xD;
             testicular suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of progressive disease prior to enrolment based on AT LEAST one of the&#xD;
             following criteria: a) Rising PSA: PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising&#xD;
             PSA levels with an interval of &gt;/= 1 week between each determination. The PSA value at&#xD;
             the Screening visit should be &gt;/= 2 ng/mL; b) Non-measurable (evaluable) disease: 2&#xD;
             (two) or more new metastatic bone lesions by radionuclide bone scan or plain bone&#xD;
             films (x-rays); c) Measurable disease (RECIST 1.1) by transaxial imaging: patients&#xD;
             must show evidence of new or progressive disease on CT or MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For patients who received combined androgen blockade (a GnRH antagonist, analog or&#xD;
             orchiectomy in combination with continuous antiandrogen not including enzalutamide),&#xD;
             disease progression must have been determined after antiandrogen discontinuation as&#xD;
             defined below: a) For patients receiving flutamide: at least one of the PSA values&#xD;
             must be obtained 4 weeks or more after flutamide discontinuation.; b) For patients&#xD;
             receiving bicalutamide or nilutamide: at least one of the PSA values must be obtained&#xD;
             6 weeks or more after antiandrogen discontinuation.; However, in patients who did not&#xD;
             respond to combined androgen blockade or who showed a decline in PSA for 3 months or&#xD;
             less after an antiandrogen was administered as a second-line or later intervention, no&#xD;
             withdrawal response will be expected and therefore disease progression will be&#xD;
             determined provided at least one rising PSA value is obtained 2 weeks or more after&#xD;
             antiandrogen discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who received any other hormonal therapy, including megestrol acetate,&#xD;
             finasteride, ketoconazole, abiraterone, enzalutamide, diethylstilbestrol or any&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids, must have discontinued such agent for at least 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to enrollment. Progressive disease must be documented after discontinuation of such&#xD;
