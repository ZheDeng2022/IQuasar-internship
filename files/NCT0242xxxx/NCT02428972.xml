  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary brain tumors are highly associated with neurocognitive deficit and poor quality of&#xD;
      life. There are number of studies indicating that brain tumors and their treatment modalities&#xD;
      are often related to cognitive dysfunction. Apart from primary brain lesions, deficit can&#xD;
      also occur because of Surgery, Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, Antiepileptic and Corticosteroid&#xD;
      treatment.Anaesthesia can also add to cognitive deficit in these patients. According to Ali&#xD;
      et al. propofol provides better cognition scores compared to sevoflurane than isoflurane. The&#xD;
      primary aim of their study was to compare the effects of 3 anesthetic regimens on&#xD;
      hemodynamics and recovery characteristics of the patients. However in another study by Magni&#xD;
      et al., the authors found that there is no difference in early cognitive function between&#xD;
      sevoflurane and propofol. The aim of this prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial&#xD;
      was to compare clinical properties of sevoflurane-fentanyl with propofol-remifentanil&#xD;
      anesthesia in patients undergoing supratentorial intracranial surgery. However both these&#xD;
      studies evaluated the early cognitive function. The primary endpoint was to compare early&#xD;
      postoperative recovery and cognitive functions within the two groups. They also evaluated&#xD;
      hemodynamic events, vomiting, shivering, and pain. The literature is scarce on the severity,&#xD;
      incidence and effect of anaesthetics on cognition and quality of life of these patients.&#xD;
      Since most of the patients of brain tumor cannot be cured with surgery alone, improvement of&#xD;
      quality of life and palliative care of the symptoms and cognitive function are important part&#xD;
      of the treatment. Now the cognitive function has also been considered as an independent&#xD;
      prognostic factor in the survival of patients of brain tumor. Cognitive function can also be&#xD;
      related to tumor laterality. Patients with tumors in left hemisphere will have lower scores&#xD;
      on verbal tests, whereas tumor in right hemisphere will have lower scores on facial&#xD;
      recognition tests. Patients with tumors in the left hemisphere report more difficulty&#xD;
      concentrating and those with right-hemisphere lesions,report more tension. Patients with&#xD;
      primary brain tumors also experience serious challenges to their quality of life (QOL). These&#xD;
      patients may face motor deficits, personality changes, cognitive deficits, aphasia, or visual&#xD;
      field defects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive dysfunction is a common complication in primary or metastatic brain tumors and can&#xD;
      be correlated to disease itself or various treatment modalities. The symptoms of cognitive&#xD;
      deficits may include problems with memory, attention and information processing. There is a&#xD;
      study which suggest that psychological distress is an important factor in reducing health&#xD;
      related QOL in patients with brain tumors. However in some studies, depression was found to&#xD;
      be another important independent predictor of QOL and has strong impact on survival. QOL is a&#xD;
      extensive term that comprises physical or functional status, emotional well-being, and social&#xD;
      well-being. It has been studied that QOL in patients with high-grade tumors do not differ&#xD;
      those with grade III and grade IV tumors. Compared to patients with non-CNS cancers, brain&#xD;
      tumor patients report more fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and altered mood states. However,&#xD;
      different levels of impairments have been observed in patients with brain tumors. To spread&#xD;
      awareness of the illness, psychiatric interventions may be useful in these patients.&#xD;
      Cognitive dysfunction may affect basic functions including attention or behavior or advanced&#xD;
      functions like taking decisions or making plans. According to Yoshii Y et.al, Cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction before or after the surgery may not correlate with stage of tumor malignancy and&#xD;
      degree of tumor resection. Cognitive function has been correlated to increased fatigue and&#xD;
      depression in newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval from Institute Ethics Committee and consent from the patient or guardian, we&#xD;
      will include all adult patients between 18 - 65 years, of either gender scheduled for&#xD;
      craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumors. We will exclude patients with a history of&#xD;
      previous surgery for brain tumor, emergency surgery and non-consenting patients. To calculate&#xD;
      the sample size we will first conduct a pilot study enrolling 30 patients, 15 in each group.&#xD;
      Block randomization will be followed with blocks size of 10 patients. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized using the computer generated program. Demographic details will be noted. Patients&#xD;
      will be adequately fasted prior to elective surgery. A standard anaesthesia protocol will be&#xD;
      followed for all patients. Patients will be randomized in to two groups, Group S&#xD;
      (Inhalational) and Group P (Intravenous). .Allocation of the group will be performed using an&#xD;
      opaque sealed envelope method. General anaesthesia will be induced with Propofol 1.5 - 2&#xD;
      mg/kg.Anaesthesia will be maintained with either propofol (Group P) or Sevoflurane (Group S)&#xD;
      along with mixture of oxygen and air [1:1] at flow rate of 2 liters per minute..The Minimum&#xD;
      Alveolar Concentration (MAC) of Sevoflurane would be maintained between 0.8 - 1.2. In Group&#xD;
      P, depth of anaesthesia will be guided by clinical signs such as tachycardia and&#xD;
      hypertension. Intra-operative analgesia and muscle relaxation will be provided by boluses of&#xD;
      fentanyl 1 mcg/kg and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. Intra-operative monitoring will&#xD;
      include ECG, heart rate, invasive and non-invasive blood pressure, gases, end-tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide, pulse oximetry, temperature and fluid input and output. Mannitol 1 gm/kg would be&#xD;
      administered over a period of 20 minutes at the time of skin incision. Immediately after&#xD;
      craniotomy, brain relaxation would be assessed using Brain Relaxation Score (BRS) in which&#xD;
      the blinded surgeon will assess the condition of the brain as 1 = perfectly relaxed, 2 =&#xD;
      satisfactorily relaxed, 3 = firm (leveled) brain, 4 = bulging brain.(27)At the end of&#xD;
      surgery, propofol would be discontinued at the beginning of skin closure and Sevoflurane at&#xD;
      the end of the skin closure. Neuromuscular block will be reversed with neostigmine 0.1 mg/kg&#xD;
      and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. If patients are planned for elective mechanical ventilation in&#xD;
      the post-operative period, neuromuscular block will not be reversed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergence and extubation times will be noted. Emergence time is defined as time from&#xD;
      discontinuation of anaesthetic to time to follow verbal commands and eye opening. Extubation&#xD;
      time is defined as time from anesthetic discontinuation to tracheal extubation. Recovery of&#xD;
      the patient will be assessed using the modified Aldrete score. Intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative complications, if any, will be noted. Various complications (tachycardia,&#xD;
      bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension) will be treated with fentanyl, atropine,&#xD;
      mephentramine and labetalol. All patients will be shifted to the ICU for supportive care and&#xD;
      further management. Cognitive functions would be assessed preoperatively (baseline), between&#xD;
      2 to 3 hours postoperative, 24 hours post-operative, three months and six month. Quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) will be assessed at three month, six month and one year. Cognitive function will&#xD;
      be assessed for memory, learning, executive functioning, sustained attention and verbal&#xD;
      fluency and QOL by neuro-psychologist as shown in Appendix below. The difference of brain&#xD;
      relaxation by two grades between the two study groups will be considered clinically&#xD;
      significant and sample size calculated on this basis.&#xD;
