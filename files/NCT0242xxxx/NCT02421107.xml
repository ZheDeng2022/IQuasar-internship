  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The company who have developed the GlySure product have previously carried out a study to be&#xD;
      able to show that the GlySure system is accurate in measuring blood sugar (glucose) levels.&#xD;
      This was done with patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) after heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The company now want to confirm that the GlySure product is accurate at measuring blood&#xD;
      glucose levels on all patients who stay in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study requires 40 patients and is to check the safety of a continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System (GlySure) and it's performance in comparison to separate individual blood&#xD;
      glucose testing using a hand held blood tester called i-STAT. Each patient must be in the&#xD;
      study for at least 36 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main benefit of continuous blood glucose monitoring is that it gives a true picture of&#xD;
      the glucose status of a patient and this can potentially help avoid the glucose level&#xD;
      dropping too low (hypoglycaemic) or staying too high (hyperglycaemia) as clinicians can&#xD;
      intervene based on 'real-time' data on the glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patient treatment is not dictated by the data measured during the study.&#xD;
      Clinicians are blind to the results on the GlySure monitor.&#xD;
