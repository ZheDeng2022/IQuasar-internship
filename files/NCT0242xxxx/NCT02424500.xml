  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hygieia Research seeks to conduct a prospective randomized clinical study involving adult&#xD;
      subjects with uncontrolled Type-2 diabetes requiring insulin. The study seeks to demonstrate&#xD;
      that the clinical application of the d-Nav will achieve metabolic control in a safe and&#xD;
      effective manner.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the use of d-Nav (d-Nav group) is superior&#xD;
      to titration of insulin dosage relying on data from glucose meters with health care provider&#xD;
      support (Control) in the management of insulin treated diabetes, by randomizing 200 insulin&#xD;
      treated subjects with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To demonstrate a greater reduction in HbA1c at 6-months for d-Nav users&#xD;
      compared to control patients in the primary cohort.&#xD;
