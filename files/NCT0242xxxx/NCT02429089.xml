  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators would like to investigate the activity of LEE011 associated&#xD;
      with cetuximab (standard of care for the SCCHN patients at this stade of the disease).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the mammalian cell cycle, entry into S phase is achieved by cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and&#xD;
      6 (CDK4/6), which activate a family of E2F transcription factors by phosphorylating and&#xD;
      deactivating the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). LEE011 is an orally, highly selective small&#xD;
      molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 that potently induces G1 arrest with sub-micromolar IC50's in a&#xD;
      variety of pRb-positive cancer cells. A recent study showed that an inhibitor of the&#xD;
      CDK4-CCND1 complex showed promising results in SCCHN pre-clinical models. There is a strong&#xD;
      rationale to investigate CDK inhibitors in this disease. In phase Ib/II study as a single&#xD;
      agent, the major toxicities observed were Grade 3 and 4 fatigue (53.8%), nausea (50.8%),&#xD;
      neutropenia (47.7%), anemia (37.1%), leukopenia (46.2%), thrombocytopenia (34.1%), diarrhea&#xD;
      (32.6%), vomiting (34.8%), lymphocytes count decreased (30.3%), anorexia (21.2%),&#xD;
      hyperglycemia (21.2%), constipation (19.7%), hypoalbuminemia (18.9%), dyspnea (18.2%) and&#xD;
      cough (16.7%).&#xD;

             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly&#xD;
             effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;

                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or&#xD;
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure&#xD;
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone&#xD;
                       contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been&#xD;
                       stable on the same pill before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier&#xD;
             method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.]&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the&#xD;
             drug and for 30 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this&#xD;
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent&#xD;
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Patient has a history of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
