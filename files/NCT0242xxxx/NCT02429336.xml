      The purpose of this study is to collect data that will be generated during an office visit.&#xD;
      The data will be gathered and analyzed in research studies that will help with the&#xD;
      investigators understanding of various medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 200 subjects will be participating in this study. Participation in this study will not&#xD;
      require a patient's time or presence. The medical information contained in a patient's chart&#xD;
      from the office visit, including the results of any tests that were ordered at that time,&#xD;
      will be transferred to an anonymous database and analyzed together with data from other&#xD;
      patients who have similar condition/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No follow-up information will be collected. The following information will be collected from&#xD;
      a patient's medical record: the medical history and a list of the current medications.&#xD;
