  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if postoperative chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      high-grade appendix cancer after surgery improves outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative chemotherapy will consist of 5-FU (with leucovorin) or capecitabine with&#xD;
      bevacizumab. These drugs are approved for use in people with colon cancer, and they are used&#xD;
      at UCSD for some patients with appendix cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of the postoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment on cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an observational, single-cohort, prospective study of systemic chemotherapy after&#xD;
      CRS/HIPEC. Subjects will be given twelve months of 5-FU or capecitabine with bevacizumab&#xD;
      starting 4-16 weeks after surgery. CTRI Biostatistics Core personnel will assist in&#xD;
      conducting analyses using the latest version of R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria. http://www.R-project.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No therapy is included in this study. Subjects have already previously undergone surgery for&#xD;
      their cancer. This study will observe the outcomes of the postoperative chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment the doctor chooses to treat the subject's cancer.&#xD;
