      The investigators compared the results of sono-guided interscalene brachial plexus block&#xD;
      (ISB) combined with arthroscopy-guided suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) with those of ISB&#xD;
      alone within the first 48 h after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-eight patients with rotator cuff tears who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair were enrolled. The 24 patients randomly allocated to group 1 received ISB and SSNB;&#xD;
      the remaining 24 patients in group 2 underwent ISB alone. VAS pain score, patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction (SAT) were checked postoperative 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours. VAS pain&#xD;
      score was selected from 0 to 10 was no pain and 10 was severe pain that the patient had ever&#xD;
      experienced. SAT was also selected from 0 to 10 was unsatisfactory and 10 was very&#xD;
      satisfactory. Rebound of postoperative pain was confirmed if there had been an increase of&#xD;
      VAS pain score after postoperative 1 hour.&#xD;

    <description>At the end of the surgery, SSNB was performed under arthroscopic guidance by one shoulder arthroscopist. The suprascapular ligament was found using the lateral portal for visualization. The supraclavicular ligament was visualized at the end of the conoid ligament when the arthroscope was advanced following the coracoclavicular ligament. A 23-gauge spinal needle was introduced in a posteroanterior direction at a 20Â° angle percutaneously and 7 cm medial to the lateral margin of the acromion. Then, the needle was placed at the upper margin of the suprascapular ligament and advanced slightly under arthroscopy-guidance. After suctioning the saline from the portal, the injection material was administered according to the random assignment.</description>

Ultrasound-guided ISB: ISB was performed by one anesthesiologist under ultrasound-guidance. The superior, middle, and inferior trunks of the brachial plexus were identified approximately 2 cm above the clavicle. A 50 mm 22-gauge needle was introduced percutaneously using an out-of-plane technique. The needle was placed beside each trunk in succession, and 2.5 mL ropivacaine was injected into each site. The total volume of ropivacaine used for ISB was 7.5 mL.&#xD;
