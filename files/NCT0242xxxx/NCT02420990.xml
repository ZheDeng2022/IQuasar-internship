  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) exists in 20-50% of the 3 million adolescents&#xD;
      annually enrolled in outpatient mental health and substance use treatment. Adolescents with&#xD;
      ADHD present deficits in attention, self-regulation, and social competence that significantly&#xD;
      impede achievement of developmental and educational milestones. Currently there are only two&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment options for this age group: academic training and stimulant&#xD;
      medications. Both options remain vastly underutilized. Academic training is not available in&#xD;
      most school settings and rarely implemented in clinical care. Similarly, ADHD medications are&#xD;
      rarely utilized with adolescents in primary or specialty care for a host of reasons related&#xD;
      to stigma, misinformation about effects and side effects, and adolescent autonomy issues.&#xD;
      Moreover, the widespread fragmentation of pharmacological versus behavioral services prevents&#xD;
      families from making informed treatment selections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this randomized parametric trial is to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      behavioral only versus integrated (behavioral plus medication decision-making) interventions&#xD;
      for adolescents with ADHD in outpatient behavioral services. The behavioral intervention,&#xD;
      Changing Academic Support in the Home for Adolescents with ADHD (CASH-AA), contains three&#xD;
      components: ADHD psychoeducation, family-based motivational interventions, and academic&#xD;
      training. The medication decision-making intervention, Medication Integration Protocol (MIP),&#xD;
      contain three components: psychoeducation about ADHD medication, family decision-making, and&#xD;
      medication management. The study will compare the effects of two legitimate treatment options&#xD;
      for adolescents with ADHD on service utilization, behavioral symptoms, and quality of life.&#xD;
      It will generate new evidence on patient-centered treatment selection that aligns with&#xD;
      family-specific principles and treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This parametric comparative trial will randomly assign 140 inner-city adolescents with ADHD&#xD;
      to (1) CASH-AA Only or (2) CASH-AA + MIP. Treatment will occur in community behavioral health&#xD;
      clinics. All participants will receive behavioral interventions (CASH-AA): family&#xD;
      psychoeducation in ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, and developmental impacts;&#xD;
      family-based motivation and ADHD accommodation interventions; and academic training focused&#xD;
      on home environment support and organizational skills. Half of the participants will also&#xD;
      receive medication decision-making interventions (MIP): ADHD medication psychoeducation,&#xD;
      family decision-making interventions, and (for those who elect to start medication)&#xD;
      coordinated medication management. Half of the sample will have comorbid substance use&#xD;
      problems. Treatment will occur in three community clinics; therapists will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to study condition. Caregivers and adolescents will complete assessments at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up. Multilevel modeling will compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      each condition on key patient and service use outcomes. Patient-centered analyses will&#xD;
      explore differential treatment effects based on (a) Medication decision (yes/no); (b)&#xD;
      Substance use comorbidity (yes/no); (c) Race/Ethnicity (Hispanic, African American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative outcome analyses will test for service use effects, symptom reduction, and&#xD;
      quality of life improvements that are primary reasons for seeking clinical services.&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will document family-specific rationale for decisions about&#xD;
      medication, compliance with behavioral and medication interventions, and suggestions for&#xD;
      improving services and service integration. Note that families assigned to CASH-AA Only will&#xD;
      retain the option of pursuing ADHD medication through treatment-as-usual procedures at their&#xD;
      respective clinic. Similarly, families assigned to CASH-AA + MIP will not be required to&#xD;
      start ADHD medication. Instead, they will receive informed-choice interventions and can&#xD;
      choose when and if to start medication; the study will assess the impact of these decisions&#xD;
      on clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If proven efficacious, the CASH-AA and MIP protocols could be rapidly disseminated&#xD;
      individually or as an integrated protocol into routine behavioral healthcare settings. The&#xD;
      protocols can also be readily combined with other behavioral treatments to form a&#xD;
      multicomponent treatment package for adolescents with co-occurring behavior problems. In&#xD;
      addition, the family-based, patient-centered CASH-AA and MIP protocols could be delivered in&#xD;
      conjunction with other family-based treatments or with individual approaches that flexibly&#xD;
      include caregivers in multiple treatment sessions. This makes CASH-AA and MIP highly&#xD;
      efficient clinical resources for addressing ADHD-related problems in any outpatient setting&#xD;
      that serves adolescents and their families.&#xD;
