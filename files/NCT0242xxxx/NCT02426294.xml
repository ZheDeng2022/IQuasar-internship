      The purpose of this study is to compare the treatment effect at week 26 between the two&#xD;
      groups, sulfonylurea (SU, glimepiride) administration and thiazolidinedione (TZD,&#xD;
      Pioglitazone) administration, as the third-order drug among patients whose treatment is not&#xD;
      sufficient after the combined administration of Metformin and Alogliptin.&#xD;

      1. Background Complications of diabetes could cause death from stroke and myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, and it is the chronic disease that leads to foot amputation, blindness and&#xD;
           renal failure. According to the data of Statistics Korea, the prevalence rate of&#xD;
           diabetes for people over 30 years old (standardization) has gradually increased from&#xD;
           8.6% in 2001 to 9.7% in 2010. Although diabetes is not the direct cause of death or&#xD;
           disability, it is becoming a significant health problem across the world as it is a&#xD;
           major illness causing complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diabetic complications are very common; the patients of end-stage renal failure with&#xD;
           diabetes were 56.7% and patients who begin renal replacement therapy with diabetes were&#xD;
           70.5% in 2003. The prevalence rate of eye problems including cataract, retinopathies and&#xD;
           glaucoma in diabetic patients is 1.9 times higher than that in non-diabetic patients. In&#xD;
           addition, it is estimated that the incidence rate of acute stroke, which is a&#xD;
           complication of the great vessels of diabetic patients, is also 5.2 times higher than&#xD;
           that of the general population. As diabetes could cause various complications and be&#xD;
           dangerous, the regulation of blood glucose level is essential in order to prevent these&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the Korea National Health &amp; Nutrition Examination Survey in 2008~2010, the&#xD;
           rate of patients with well-controlled glycated hemoglobin of below 6.5% among diabetic&#xD;
           patients over 30 years old is only 25%. Thus, many studies are being conducted to lower&#xD;
           the glycated hemoglobin by administering various line drugs, alone or in combination,&#xD;
           because the regulation of blood glucose is difficult for many diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When the regulation of blood glucose ends in failure with a single dose of a drug, the&#xD;
           combination treatment is recommended. Metformin is mainly used as the first-order&#xD;
           treatment drug, and the second and third drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)&#xD;
           inhibitor and sulphonylurea, are recommended to use if the first one is not sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DPP-4 inhibitor is a new line of hypoglycemic agent based on incretin. It has&#xD;
           statistically significant results for the regulation of glycated hemoglobin compared to&#xD;
           existing oral hypoglycemic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, many clinicians use Metformin as the first-order drug, and DPP-4 inhibitor as&#xD;
           the second-order drug. Alogliptin, which was recently proved to have no side effects of&#xD;
           the cardiovascular system, is effective in the regulation of blood glucose as well as&#xD;
           the weight control and the prevention of hypoglycemia. Moreover, it is effective when&#xD;
           administered alone, and also effective when coadministered with Metformin, Glibenclamide&#xD;
           and Pioglitazone. In particular, the reduction degree of glycated hemoglobin was&#xD;
           significantly larger when it was administered with Pioglitazone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sulphonylurea, the most well-known hypoglycemic agent, is helpful in the regulation of&#xD;
           blood glucose and reduces the occurrence frequency of hypoglycemia when combined with&#xD;
           Metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale This study examines the related factors of the Pioglitazone group, which is a&#xD;
           TZDs line, and the Glimepiride group, which is a sulphonylurea line, as the third-order&#xD;
           drugs for patients who are coadministered Metformin and Alogliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypothesis When the SU and TZDs drugs administered as third-order drugs in the patients&#xD;
           who administered second-order drugs, the treatment effect is different between the two&#xD;
           drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Primary Aim/Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective is to compare the mean changes of HbA1c at week 26 between the two&#xD;
           groups, SU (glimepiride) administration and TZDs (Pioglitazone) administration, as the&#xD;
           third-order drug among patients whose treatment is not sufficient after the combined&#xD;
           administration of Metformin and Alogliptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Primary Endpoint(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean changes of HbA1c at week 26 from baseline&#xD;
