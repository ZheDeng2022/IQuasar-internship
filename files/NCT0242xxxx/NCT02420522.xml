  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS) on cognitive improvement in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to investigate the ability of rTMS to produce cognitive&#xD;
      improvement in individuals with MCI. A secondary objective is to determine whether&#xD;
      individuals with MCI following mild brain trauma respond differently to rTMS treatment&#xD;
      compared to individuals with non-trauma related MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo both active and sham (placebo) rTMS treatment. Cognitive and&#xD;
      psychological assessments will be administered before and after each week of rTMS therapy,&#xD;
      for both active and sham conditions. Cognitive testing will include verbal, semantic, logic,&#xD;
      visual, conceptual, and memory tasks.&#xD;

      This is an open-label pilot study to test the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) on cognitive improvement in individuals with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI). 16 patients with trauma-related MCI and 16 patients with non-trauma-related MCI will&#xD;
      be recruited. All patients will undergo one week of active rTMS stimulation and one week of&#xD;
      sham stimulation, separated by at least one week. Each treatment week will consist of five&#xD;
      consecutive daily stimulation sessions. The order of active versus sham treatment sessions&#xD;
      will be counterbalanced across subjects within each group (i.e., half of the subjects in each&#xD;
      group will receive active stimulation first and half will receive sham first). Cognitive and&#xD;
      psychological assessments will be administered before and after each week of rTMS therapy,&#xD;
      for both active and sham conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional participants (n=32; 16 without TBI) will be recruited who are receiving a full&#xD;
      course (30 sessions) of active rTMS treatment (without a sham intervention). These&#xD;
      participants will complete the same cognitive testing as the sham-crossover group at three&#xD;
      time-points: pre-treatment, mid-treatment (after session 16), and post-treatment (after&#xD;
      session 30).&#xD;
