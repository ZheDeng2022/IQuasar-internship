  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers constitute an increasing health problem in Denmark concurrent with an&#xD;
      ageing population and an increase in diabetes prevalence. Diabetic foot ulcers belong to the&#xD;
      most serious and costly complications. Several studies have found that the size and depth of&#xD;
      the ulcer is one of the major etiologic factors for delayed healing. Wound measurement is&#xD;
      important in the monitoring of the wound healing process. For the last decade different 3D&#xD;
      (three-dimensional) techniques for measuring wounds have been proposed in order to measure&#xD;
      wound volume, but none of the technologies have been widely used. A 3D Wound Assessment&#xD;
      Monitor (WAM) camera has been developed, which is able to measure wound size in 3D and to&#xD;
      assess wound characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that three-dimensional measurements of diabetic foot ulcers are&#xD;
      feasible in the assessment of wound healing. A prospective cohort study is conducted in which&#xD;
      newly admitted patients with a diabetic foot ulcer are included at the first visit at the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary clinic. The patients are followed for one year or until complete wound&#xD;
      healing, amputation or death. The four wound measurements: 2D area, 3D area, perimeter and&#xD;
      volume are measured using the 3D-WAM camera with frequent intervals. Patient anthropometrics&#xD;
      and wound data are collected during the study and correlated to the wound healing.&#xD;

      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly admitted patients with a diabetic foot ulcer are included at the first visit in the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary clinic. The data mentioned below are collected at the first visit and the&#xD;
      following examinations are performed including 3D photos. The wound size (2D area, 3D area,&#xD;
      perimeter and volume) are estimated from the photos using the 3D-WAM camera. The wound&#xD;
      examination is repeated after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks or until healing of the wound.&#xD;
      The wound healing is estimated using changes in wound size per time unit. Patients are&#xD;
      treated by standard ulcer treatment methods and are unaffected by the project per se. During&#xD;
      the trial the different methods of treatment are noted including changes from initial&#xD;
      treatment. The variables will be quantified after one year depending on time to heal,&#xD;
      establishment of a chronic ulcer (non-healing after one year) or an amputation has been&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline the following patient data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data: gender, age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking habits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time period between onset of wound to first visit in the multidisciplinary clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidity using Charlson Comorbidity Index score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of diabetes, duration of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetic complications including retinopathy, albuminuria, coronary heart diseases and&#xD;
           neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following examinations will be performed at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination for neuropathy using monofilament&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples from patients with a diabetic foot ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical examination of the ulcer are performed at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36&#xD;
      and 52 weeks or until wound healing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Size of wound (2D area, 3D area, perimeter, volume) measured using the 3D-WAM camera&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Size of wound in 2D area using the digital imaging method with the software ImageJ&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of the ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Classification of ulcer: granulation, necrosis, epithelialisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secretory potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foot deformity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone affection - if osteitis is suspected an x-ray is taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different types of ulcer treatment is registered for every ulcer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of bandage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibiotics (local, systemic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Revision (method, frequency),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound 2D area, 3D area, perimeter and volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variation in 2D and 3D area measurements during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage change in wound size after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amputations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic wound (non-healing after 1 year)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project seeks to clarify whether 3D photos of wounds will provide accurate structural&#xD;
      measures to illuminate the background for delayed ulcer healing, and thereby to create&#xD;
      platform for a more evidence based treatment algorithm.&#xD;
