      A pilot study that will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of procedures to inform&#xD;
      the design and delivery of a definitive RCT of ReTrain (which would assess the clinical and&#xD;
      cost effectiveness of ReTrain for stroke survivors).&#xD;

      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual physical disability is common following discharge from stroke rehabilitation&#xD;
      services. A third of first-time stroke survivors remain physically disabled five years after&#xD;
      their stroke, equivalent to more than 300,000 people in the UK. Stroke services are&#xD;
      traditionally &quot;front loaded&quot; with provision tailing off a few months after stroke. However,&#xD;
      people with stroke report a variety of unmet long-term needs and a sense of being abandoned&#xD;
      by NHS services. The UK National Stroke Strategy recommends that stroke be regarded as a Long&#xD;
      Term Condition and that continuing support is provided for those who need it. This includes&#xD;
      community-based rehabilitation, with an emphasis on personalisation, re-ablement and&#xD;
      self-management of the consequences of stroke. There is good evidence that exercise can&#xD;
      promote functional recovery, enhance adjustment and coping, improve psychological wellbeing,&#xD;
      and reduce the risk of recurrence. Hence stroke guidelines recommend that people with stroke&#xD;
      should regularly engage in specific forms of exercise, however many do not meet these&#xD;
      recommendations. Various personal and environmental factors may account for this:&#xD;
      stroke-related impairments, lack of confidence or knowledge regarding exercise and its&#xD;
      benefits, and inadequate provision of support programmes and facilities. In response,&#xD;
      community-based programmes are being offered. However, these programmes often focus on&#xD;
      fitness rather than function, giving little attention to self-management or to sustaining&#xD;
      behaviour (to ensure benefits are maintained after structured programmes have ended).&#xD;
      National stroke guidelines recommend interventions address functional improvement and&#xD;
      self-management strategies even though a recently updated Cochrane review notes the gap in&#xD;
      evidence regarding these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An approach called ARNI (Action for Rehabilitation from Neurological Injury) attempts to&#xD;
      address these concerns; it was created specifically for people with stroke and acquired brain&#xD;
      injury who wish to continue their functional recovery.ARNI is not a rigidly-defined programme&#xD;
      but a set of principles and strategies tailored to individual circumstances and contexts. It&#xD;
      is led by registered exercise professionals who have been additionally trained and accredited&#xD;
      by the ARNI institute (http://www.arni.uk.com). In the UK, the NHS, Local Authorities and&#xD;
      other organisations are using ARNI trainers to provide community-based training for stroke&#xD;
      survivors. Our survey of this training included Northeast England, Lancashire, Luton and&#xD;
      Bedfordshire, Milton Keynes, Hillingdon and Cornwall. The survey found that training has been&#xD;
      very positively received by stroke survivors, their families and clinicians but it varied in&#xD;
      content and delivery. Reports of benefits by the broadcaster Andrew Marr have also increased&#xD;
      public awareness of ARNI. However the evidence for ARNI remains largely anecdotal, it may&#xD;
      only work for a selected few and the approach is difficult to replicate. There is a need for&#xD;
      a more detailed cohesive specification of ARNI that could be rigorously evaluated and&#xD;
      replicated. Furthermore a stroke survivor participating in our Institution's research&#xD;
      question generation process asked if ARNI worked but as yet there have been no randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs) of this intervention. Thus we have followed the Medical Research&#xD;
      Council's framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions and&#xD;
      undertaken five linked preliminary studies: 1) a survey of current ARNI provision in the UK;&#xD;
      2) a comparison of the ARNI approach with relevant stroke practice guidelines, 3)&#xD;
      before-and-after studies of both group-based and 4) one-to-one training and 5) focus groups&#xD;
      conducted with our participants. From this work we have designed a programme called ReTrain&#xD;
      (Rehabilitation Training) which is based on core ARNI principles and informed by best&#xD;
      practice guidelines for stroke. Before undertaking a large definitive RCT of ReTrain a pilot&#xD;
      study is needed to address issues of feasibility and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      ReTrain aims to improve (i) functional mobility, (ii) adherence to national guidelines on&#xD;
      post-stroke exercise levels, and (iii) health-related quality of life, for people after&#xD;
      stroke who have been discharged from clinical rehabilitation. A definitive RCT is required to&#xD;
      assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of the ReTrain intervention. The purpose of this&#xD;
      pilot study is to assess to feasibility of such a trial and to evaluate trial procedures to&#xD;
      inform the design of a definitive trial.&#xD;
