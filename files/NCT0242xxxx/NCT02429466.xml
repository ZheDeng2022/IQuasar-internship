  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, Phase I dose escalation study in subjects with refractory&#xD;
      germ cell tumor (rGCT). This phase I will evaluate the safety and efficacy of SGI-110 in&#xD;
      combination with cisplatin in subjects with rGCT. The primary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SGI-110 to be used prior to cisplatin. A total of 15 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and toxicity of guadecitabine (SGI-110) plus cisplatin including the&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and to determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of guadecitabine (SGI-110) to resume sensitivity to cisplatin in&#xD;
      refractory GCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the pharmacodynamic activity of guadecitabine (SGI-110) Evaluate miRNA biomarkers&#xD;
      in serum on day 1 of cycles 1-6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Mode of Delivery: Guadecitabine (SGI-110) will be given subcutaneously,&#xD;
      daily, 30 mg/m2 on days (1-5) followed by cisplatin 100mg/m2 on day 8 every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Intervention and Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be continued for a maximum of 6 cycles or until disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity whichever occurs first. Subjects who are responding to therapy without&#xD;
      major toxicty would be allowed to continue on single agent guadecitabine (SGI-110) at the MTD&#xD;
      after 4-6 cycles of the combination therapy until disease progression. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed after the last cycle every 2 months for the 1st year, and every 4 months thereafter&#xD;
      until death (expected overall survival less than 12 months).&#xD;

             information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with the protocol and study procedures&#xD;
             including willingness to undergo tumor biopsy for tumor cells before therapy at Cycle&#xD;
             1, Day 1, and Day 8 (before cisplatin dose) if this is clinically and safely feasible&#xD;
             to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with histologically or serologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent germ&#xD;
             cell tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who have platinum-resistant disease. There is no limit on the number of prior&#xD;
             treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have had prior high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) treatment when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or elevated Tumor markers (hCG or AFP).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: patients without measurable disease are allowed on the study as long as they&#xD;
             have clearly rising tumor markers and they will be exempt from biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with ECOG performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects must be at least 3 weeks from last chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. Male and&#xD;
             female patients of reproductive potential must agree to use two forms of highly&#xD;
             effective contraception from the screening visit through 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of study drug. Acceptable forms of effective contraception include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the&#xD;
                  absence of sperm in the ejaculate).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.] Pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential are&#xD;
                  required; must be serum at screening and the post treatment safety assessment&#xD;
                  visit. A positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy&#xD;
                  test and a pelvic US since some NSGCT may secrete beta-hCG and cause a false&#xD;
                  positive pregnancy. A pelvic US does not need to be repeated with each cycle&#xD;
                  unless the treating physician thinks it is necessary to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The following laboratory values must be obtained within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
             for protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 8 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets count ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine levels ≤ 1.5 mg/dl and calculated (by Cockcroft-Gault formula)&#xD;
                  or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) ≤ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects with neurological symptoms&#xD;
             should undergo a head CT scan or brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: A subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed&#xD;
             their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and are&#xD;
             asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to registration for&#xD;
             protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent participation in a clinical trial which involves another investigational&#xD;
             agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with Grade 2 or greater neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with a life-threatening illness, medical condition or organ system&#xD;
             dysfunction, or other reasons which, in the Investigator's opinion, could compromise&#xD;
             the subject's safety, interfere with or compromise the integrity of the study outcomes&#xD;
             including incomplete recovery from the acute effects from any prior anti-neoplastic&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.&#xD;
