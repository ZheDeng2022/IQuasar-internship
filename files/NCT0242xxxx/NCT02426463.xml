  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children differ from adults with respect to growth and development but also immaturity of&#xD;
      various pharmacological mechanisms. Dosing schemes in children are usually derived in an&#xD;
      empirical manner from clinical trials in adult patient groups. All this poses neonates to an&#xD;
      increased risk for therapeutic failure and adverse drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicinal products studied during this project are among the ones with the highest needs for&#xD;
      research in the pediatric intensive care. This project focuses on the necessity to integrate&#xD;
      subject's individual characteristics to assist clinical decision-making in drug therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators explore the mechanisms defining the dose response in pediatric populations. The&#xD;
      results obtained with these studies will help to find safer drug dosing regimens in this&#xD;
      delicate patient population.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient is more than 24 weeks old and has a body weight more than 500 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient needs intensive care treatment based on a clinical decision by a neonatologist&#xD;
             and receives propofol or oxycodone on their therapy. Attending neonatologist makes the&#xD;
             decision to prescribe propofol for scheduled short procedural sedation or oxycodone&#xD;
             for analgesia as well as all other treatment related decisions.&#xD;
