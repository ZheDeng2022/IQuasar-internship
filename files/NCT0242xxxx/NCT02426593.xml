  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to collect anatomical data in an ambulatory healthy population&#xD;
      to aid in the development of a novel non-invasive technology to assess changes in lung&#xD;
      hydration status. It will also help in developing reference ranges of lung hydration status&#xD;
      in healthy subjects and their associated changes with time.&#xD;

        Subjects will be recruited from the general population using various media advertising as&#xD;
        well as through a site database. Potential subjects aged older than 30 will be recruited&#xD;
        for a telephone interview. If they qualify based on a very brief screening interview&#xD;
        regarding their suitability as a participant, and they are interested in participating,&#xD;
        they will be scheduled to visit the Intersection Medical, Inc., corporate office. If they&#xD;
        decline to participate, no further contact will be initiated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects &gt; 30 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are ambulatory not requiring assistance for ambulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been informed of the nature of the study and agree to its provisions&#xD;
             and have provided written informed consent as approved by the IRB&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an active implantable medical device not cleared for use with the IMED-4&#xD;
             in the IMED- 4 Investigators Brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating or who have been pregnant within the past three&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a measured temperature of &gt;38Â° C at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have tattoos and/or non-intact skin on the back in the electrode patch&#xD;
             placement region&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had a past serious allergic reaction to adhesives&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who decline to have their backs photographed with the IMED-4 device in&#xD;
             position&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate (i.e. other&#xD;
             disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse, incarceration, shortened life&#xD;
             expectance, etc.)&#xD;
