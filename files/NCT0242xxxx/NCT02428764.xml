    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is studying induction nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine and carboplatin&#xD;
      followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating patients with unresectable stage III&#xD;
      squamous cell lung carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the recommended therapeutic approach for patients with&#xD;
      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance&#xD;
      of cure. With combined-modality therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the&#xD;
      prognosis of stage III NSCLC remains poor. Nimotuzumab, a human anti-EGFR monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, has shown its efficacy in the treatment of head/neck squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma as well as lung cancer. This study is studying neoadjuvant&#xD;
      nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in&#xD;
      treating patients with unresectable stage III squamous cell lung carcinoma.&#xD;
