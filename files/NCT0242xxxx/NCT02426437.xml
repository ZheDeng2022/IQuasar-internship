  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease primarily caused by&#xD;
      smoking. COPD creates a tremendous burden to the healthcare system, as disease exacerbations&#xD;
      result in frequent, prolonged hospitalizations. While originally considered a disease&#xD;
      specific to the lung, data has shown that COPD is associated with substantial cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) morbidity and mortality. Exacerbations of COPD requiring hospitalization result in&#xD;
      marked patient deterioration, and heightened CV risk. The cause of the increased CV risk with&#xD;
      stable COPD, and the exaggerated CV risk during exacerbations of the disease are unknown;&#xD;
      however, it may be due to chronic inflammation which is exacerbated with a flare-up of the&#xD;
      disease, and/or chronic inactivity which is similarly worsened with bed-rest during a&#xD;
      hospitalization. Despite the impact of COPD on healthcare, there are relatively few studies&#xD;
      examining how COPD inpatient care impacts on patient outcomes, inflammation and CV risk.&#xD;
      Disease management programs, such as pulmonary rehabilitation and patient self-management&#xD;
      education, are part of guideline therapy for COPD; however, these are not regularly&#xD;
      implemented following a hospitalization, and how these interventions affect patient outcomes,&#xD;
      behavior, physical activity, inflammation and CV risk have not been well studied. The&#xD;
      proposed long-term project will examine how early referral to chronic disease management&#xD;
      programs after hospital discharge, affect patient outcomes. This study will provide&#xD;
      invaluable information about outpatient management for a disease which has a tremendous&#xD;
      impact on healthcare.&#xD;

      Purpose: To examine the impact of early pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) following hospital&#xD;
      discharge on QoL, pulmonary/CV outcomes and AECOPD hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: In addition to typical improvements in QoL and exercise tolerance, studies have&#xD;
      shown that PR increases self-efficacy and physical activity while reducing CV risk in stable&#xD;
      COPD patients. Patients recently discharge from hospital following AECOPD represent the&#xD;
      sickest patients with greatly reduced QoL, exercise tolerance, self-efficacy and physical&#xD;
      activity. Exactly how these improve with PR following a hospitalization requires examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients who receive early PR will have improved QoL, pulmonary/CV outcomes and&#xD;
      less hospitalizations for COPD in the 6 months following hospital discharge. PR will improve&#xD;
      self efficacy, physical activity and QoL while reducing CV risk as compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Subject Recruitment: All patients admitted to the pulmonary ward for an&#xD;
      AECOPD, will be offered participation into the study. Patients found to have an acute cardiac&#xD;
      injury during admission, mobility issues or residence outside the greater Edmonton area will&#xD;
      be excluded. Consenting patients will be subsequently randomized into one of three groups:&#xD;
      early PR versus late PR versus usual care. Patients randomized to PR will be enrolled within&#xD;
      1 (Early PR; EPR) or 3 months (Late PR; LPR) of discharge into a PR program. Usual care&#xD;
      patients will be followed-up by their most responsible physician as determined by the&#xD;
      admitting team. The PR group will be enrolled in the Breathe Easy Program at the Center for&#xD;
      Lung Health, and will proceed through the program in a typical fashion. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed up 6 months after discharge and will be interviewed to assess disease status,&#xD;
      management review and if there has been a history of recurrence or relapse of the AECOPD.&#xD;
      Hospital admissions and length of stay data will be obtained through electronic medical&#xD;
      records. Patient assessments will include: quality of life, 6min walk, dyspnea,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, physical activity, pulse wave velocity, vascular function, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation (TNFα, MMP-2, IL-6 and CRP) and FeNO. All data will be collected before,&#xD;
      immediately after and 6 months after PR. The control group will have the same data collected&#xD;
      at the same scheduled time. See above for descriptions of methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling: Data will be entered onto a secure anonymized database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: The influence of PR on QoL, 6min walk, dyspnea, self-efficacy, physical&#xD;
      activity, pulse wave velocity, vascular function, systemic inflammation and eNO will be&#xD;
      analyzed using a multivariate mixed-model MANOVA with treatment (Early-PR vs. Late-PR vs.&#xD;
      usual care) being a fixed between-group variable and time (pre, immediate post, 6months post)&#xD;
      as a repeated variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Based on previous work, a sample size of 50 in each group (150 total) will be&#xD;
      sufficient to detect a between-group differences in QoL, 6min walk, PWV, dyspnea and hospital&#xD;
      readmission rates following PR (α=0.05, β=0.8). Based on the investigators recent work, this&#xD;
      sample could detect a 10% difference in physical activity following PR (α=0.05, β=0.8). One&#xD;
      hundred fifty patients will also allow for stratification of physiological and psychological&#xD;
      responses with PR.&#xD;
