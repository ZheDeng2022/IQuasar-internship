    <measure>Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of First Study Treatment to Measured Progressive Disease or Death (Up to 35 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to the first evidence of disease progression as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause. Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. If a participant does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time was censored at the date of randomization, regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death has been observed for the participant. If a participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time was censored at the last adequate tumor assessment date.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response or Partial Response: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease (Up to 35 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response Rate was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to Date of Objective Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 35 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was measured from the date of documented response to the date of first progression of disease or the date of death due to any cause, whichever is earlier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Time to Response</measure>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Phase 1b, must have advanced refractory solid tumors in any line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Phase 2, must have one of the following tumor types: recurrent or refractory NSCLC&#xD;
             (any histology), or HCC with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥200 nanogram/milliliter&#xD;
             (ng/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Phase 2 only, have had disease progression or be refractory or intolerant to 1&#xD;
             prior line of therapy (first line therapy) for recurrent or refractory for NSCLC or&#xD;
             HCC and have refused currently approved second-line therapy. First line therapy is&#xD;
             defined as therapy used to treat advanced disease. This may include multiple&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic, targeted or immunotherapeutic agents with or without radiation&#xD;
             therapy and/or surgery. Each subsequent line of therapy is preceded by disease&#xD;
             progression. A switch of an agent within the same drug class (eg, cisplatinum to&#xD;
             carboplatinum) within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the start&#xD;
             of a new line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For NSCLC:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior lines of therapy must include a platinum-based therapy. Investigational&#xD;
                  agents used in combination with standard therapies are allowed. Participants who&#xD;
                  received platinum-based neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and subsequently received&#xD;
                  platinum-based therapy as first-line therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who have completed neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy with a platinum&#xD;
                  doublet and have experienced disease recurrence within 6 months of completing the&#xD;
                  platinum doublet are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tumors with driver mutations (epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive&#xD;
                  or anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene positive) treated with a tyrosine&#xD;
                  kinase inhibitor or crizotinib are eligible. For participants who have progressed&#xD;
                  on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or crizotinib or are intolerant to this targeted&#xD;
                  therapy, that participant must receive platinum-based therapy prior to enrollment&#xD;
                  in this study. Documentation of such mutations must be available and entered into&#xD;
                  the electronic case report form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Maintenance or switch maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy will be&#xD;
                  considered part of the first-line regimen and is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who completed and progressed on a platinum-containing regimen as adjuvant,&#xD;
        neoadjuvant, or part of a course of chemoradiation therapy given from locally advanced&#xD;
        disease and developed recurrent (local or metastatic) disease within the 6 months before&#xD;
        screening would be counted as having received 1 prior platinum-containing regimen and&#xD;
        therefore would not require re-treatment with a platinum-containing regimen for Stage IIIB,&#xD;
        IV, or recurrent disease and are eligible. However, participants must have received at&#xD;
        least 2 cycles of a platinum doublet based chemotherapy before discontinuation for&#xD;
        toxicity. If participants received only one cycle of a platinum doublet and discontinue due&#xD;
        to clear progression, that regimen should be counted as a prior line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For HCC:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One prior line of therapy which must include sorafenib or participant must have&#xD;
                  progressed or been intolerant to sorafenib for participants not eligible for&#xD;
                  transarterial chemoembolization. Participants who had sorafenib for locally&#xD;
                  advanced disease or are intolerant to sorafenib are eligible. Participants may&#xD;
                  have had clinical progression only following sorafenib or local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have Child-Pugh A only. Participants may have any viral status (hepatitis B,&#xD;
                  hepatitis C, or none).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have a viral load &lt;100 international units/milliliter (IU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For hepatitis B participants, must be on a nucleoside analog reverse&#xD;
                  transcriptase inhibitor (lamivudine, telbivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, or&#xD;
                  entecavir).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
             scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use an approved contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Phase 2 only, more than 1 prior line of therapy for their tumor type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have moderate or severe cardiovascular disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have the presence of cardiac disease, including a myocardial infarction within 6&#xD;
                  months prior to study entry, unstable angina pectoris, New York Heart Association&#xD;
                  Class III/IV congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have documented major electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities which are clinically&#xD;
                  significant at the investigator's discretion (for example, symptomatic or&#xD;
                  sustained atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, second- or third-degree&#xD;
                  atrioventricular block, bundle-branch blocks, ventricular hypertrophy, or recent&#xD;
                  myocardial infarction).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have major abnormalities documented by ECHO with Doppler:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Moderate or severe heart valve function defect including moderate or severe valve&#xD;
                  stenosis or regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction &lt;50%, evaluation based on the&#xD;
                  institutional lower limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have septal aneurysm or other heart aneurysm.&#xD;

        <title>Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to the first evidence of disease progression as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause. Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. If a participant does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time was censored at the date of randomization, regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death has been observed for the participant. If a participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time was censored at the last adequate tumor assessment date.</description>

        <title>Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response or Partial Response: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>Objective Response Rate was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.</description>
