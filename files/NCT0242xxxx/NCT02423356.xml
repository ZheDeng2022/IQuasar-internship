      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Determine if a 20% reduction in global longitudinal strain by echocardiography can predict&#xD;
      subsequent composite cardiotoxicity in a collection of patients with either HER2(-) breast&#xD;
      cancer, sarcoma, or lymphoma receiving modern chemotherapy regimens containing&#xD;
      anthracyclines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if a troponin I level of at least 0.08 ng/mL using high-sensitivity cardiac&#xD;
           troponin I assay (Hs-cTn-I) can predict composite cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if a serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of at least 200 pg/mL can&#xD;
           predict composite cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine independent predictors of cardiotoxicity among clinical parameters, serial&#xD;
           echocardiography strain measurements, and biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if various pharmacogenomic factors can predict composite cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine independent predictors of cardiotoxicity among clinical parameters, serial&#xD;
           echocardiography strain measurements, biomarkers, and pharmacogenomics markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will not begin until all regulatory approvals have been obtained. Potential&#xD;
      patients will be identified by the treating oncologist. Eligibility criteria must be&#xD;
      confirmed by the site staff. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be registered&#xD;
      with the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center Clinical Trials Office (IUSCC-CTO) prior to&#xD;
      first dose of planned chemotherapy. Applicable regulatory documents and registration must be&#xD;
      completed and on file prior to the registration of any patient. A signed informed consent,&#xD;
      completed eligibility checklist, and supporting source documentation will be sent to&#xD;
      IUSCC-CTO for eligibility verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before initiation of any&#xD;
      study-specific procedures. Procedures performed as part of the subject's routine clinical&#xD;
      management and obtained prior to signing the informed consent may be utilized for screening&#xD;
      or baseline purposes provided the procedure was performed within the timeframe specified in&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiograms with strain will be performed to determine cardiac structure and mechanical&#xD;
      function during the course of treatment. All echocardiograms will include the addition of a&#xD;
      new signal (sound wave) processing method, called strain echocardiography. This technology&#xD;
      allows precise analysis of the individual regions of the heart to determine cardiac function.&#xD;
      Echocardiograms with strain will be done on four visits using GE strain-capable technology.&#xD;
      Echocardiograms will be performed in a manner compatible with strain calculation by either GE&#xD;
      or Tomtec software depending on which software the echocardiography lab has experience using.&#xD;
      The baseline echocardiogram will be within a window of 28 days prior to starting&#xD;
      doxorubicin-based chemotherapy regimen. The second will be obtained between 1-4 weeks after&#xD;
      receiving a cumulative dose of at least 240mg/m2 and before another dose is given. The third&#xD;
      echocardiogram is obtained 6 months (+/-4 weeks) after the start of C1D1. The final&#xD;
      echocardiogram will be obtained 12 months (+/-4 weeks) after the start of C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first and last echocardiogram will be complete studies with strain calculation and 3D&#xD;
      volumes. The middle two studies (after receiving at least a cumulative 240mg/m2 of&#xD;
      doxorubicin and at 6 months after the start of treatment) will be limited studies consisting&#xD;
      of seven 2D images (PLAX, APLAX, 4CH, 2CH, SAX-base, SAX-mid, SAX-apex) with strain&#xD;
      calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressures will be recorded by the sonographers at the time of every exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strain analysis at IUH facilities will be done online (i.e. on-cart) by the sonographer at&#xD;
      the conclusion of each echocardiogram. Strain analyses at other institutions may be done&#xD;
      off-line if the institution has the necessary software. As is standard for strain studies,&#xD;
      intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of strain measurements will be each be&#xD;
      performed on a portion of the test population. 20-25% of the patients' will have&#xD;
      reproducibility studies performed on their initial echocardiograms. For IUH studies,&#xD;
      following the initial examination sonographers will recalculate strain on the same images or&#xD;
      they will have another strain sonographer recalculate strain on the same images. Efforts will&#xD;
      be made to blind the 2nd measurer to the results of the previous strain calculations. For&#xD;
      non-IUH facilities, this same process may be performed offline using either sonographers or&#xD;
      staff echo readers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 11 mL of blood will be drawn for biomarkers at visits up to 28 days prior to&#xD;
      beginning chemotherapy, after receiving at least a cumulative 240 mg/m2 of doxorubicin, 6&#xD;
      months (+/-) 4 weeks after starting chemotherapy, and 12 months (+/-) 4 weeks following&#xD;
      starting chemotherapy. Serum Troponin I and BNP levels will be drawn at the same intervals as&#xD;
      the echocardiograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will also be obtained from patients for pharmacogenomics. Preferably these&#xD;
      samples will be drawn at approximately the same time as the second echocardiogram/second set&#xD;
      of blood draws, but can be obtained at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenomic studies will be largely exploratory and will consist of TaqMan SNP genotype&#xD;
      assays for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) annotated in UGT1A6, ABCB4,&#xD;
      ABCC1, HNMT, SLC28A3, FMO2, SPG7, SLC10A2, SLC28A3 using germline DNA samples from the&#xD;
      patients. In addition, we will employ next generation sequencing (NGS) approach using the&#xD;
      TruSight One Sequencing Panel based on the Nextera Enrichment DNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina,&#xD;
      San Diego, CA) which targets 4,813 genes at a 100X average coverage, and at 20X minimum&#xD;
      coverage of 95% regions in the panel. This targeted enrichment approach will focus on genes&#xD;
      such as, but not limited to HAS3, CBR1, CBR2, involved in cardiotoxicity, as well genes&#xD;
      coding for proteins involved in heart cytoskeleton and metabolism. Other high-throughput&#xD;
      approaches may also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic medical record review will be done by a research staff member for each patient&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. The following information will be collected from the medical record&#xD;
      prior to enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographics including age, sex, race and ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diagnosis including stage of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous treatments including radiation therapy to the mediastinum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previous medical and concomitant medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  planned (or previous) chemotherapeutic regimen including dose (mg/m2) of doxorubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  extent of previous radiation therapy including site of radiation and dose delivered&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the final echo, interim information will be collected by chart review of&#xD;
      subsequent visits and will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total amounts of all chemotherapy drugs given&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG or Karnofsky Performance Status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New radiation therapy (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of new medical conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or tachycardia&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete physical exam including vital signs, weight, and a measure of activity level will&#xD;
      be completed at all visits. Height will be collected at the pre-treatment visit only. Body&#xD;
      surface area will be calculated at each visit by the PI or his co-investigator to ensure a&#xD;
      consistent equation is used. All concomitant medications will be recorded at each visit&#xD;
      except the annual follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be obtained by the investigator and/or study staff each year beginning at 12&#xD;
      months (+/- 2 months) after C1D1 for up to 5 years. Follow-up information will be obtained&#xD;
      from the patient's electronic medical record, by calling the patient's treating or primary&#xD;
      care physician, or by contacting the patient directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to show that change of strain echocardiography parameters (between&#xD;
      &quot;after 240mg/m2&quot; and baseline) is associated with the 1-year event rate of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. Based on existing literature, the overall 1-year event rate is about 8% in the&#xD;
      targeted cancer population. We projected that 30% of the population will experience&#xD;
      deteriorated echocardiography parameters (the risk group) and the rest 70% (the normal group)&#xD;
      will have stable values on these parameters. Previous studies have shown that the normal&#xD;
      group very close to zero event rate. Assuming that the event rate for normal group is 3% and&#xD;
      thus the event rate for the risk group is 20%, a total of 128 subjects allows us to have 85%&#xD;
      power to detect the difference with type I error rate (one-sided) is controlled at 0.05.&#xD;
      Alternatively, if the overall event rate is as low as 5 % with 1% in the normal group and 15%&#xD;
      in the risk group, using χ2 test we will still have 85% power to detect the difference. With&#xD;
      15% attrition rate, we will recruit 128/0.85=150 patients. With a projected enrollment of 6&#xD;
      patients per month, we anticipate the recruitment period to be 25 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous baseline variables will be summarized by typical parameters such as mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation and range and compared using two-sample T test on the at-risk and non-risk groups&#xD;
      (if the normality assumption holds) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (if the normality assumption&#xD;
      does not hold). Normality of distribution will be determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      goodness-of-fit test. Categorical data will be summarized by frequency and percentage and&#xD;
      analyzed using the Chi-square or Fishers exact test, as appropriate. Logistic regression will&#xD;
      be used to analyze the association of change (between &quot;after 240 mg/m2&quot; and baseline) of&#xD;
      echocardiography parameters, biomarkers (BNP and troponin) and pharmacogenomics markers with&#xD;
      the primary endpoint, separately. Pharmacogenomics measures will be considered exploratory.&#xD;
      Logistic regression will be used to study dosage effect on the primary endpoint.&#xD;
      Multi-variable logistic regression will be used to identify independent predictors among&#xD;
      echocardiography parameters, biomarkers and pharmacogenomics markers. If the event rate is&#xD;
      only 8%, we will not be able to perform a multivariate analysis. However, this event rate is&#xD;
      highly variable, and a substantially higher event rate (from 16-20%) has been noted in more&#xD;
      recent studies. If the event rate is only 8%, we will not be able to perform a multivariate&#xD;
      analysis, but if it is 16-20%, we should be able to fit some multivariable models without&#xD;
      overfitting. Hence, we will only consider performing a multivariate analysis if the event&#xD;
      rate is at least 16-20%. All analysis will be performed in SAS and SPSS. Strain cut-off&#xD;
      levels defining risk vs. non-risk will be a 20% relative decrease in global longitudinal&#xD;
      strain. For the secondary objectives, the cutoff value for troponin will be ≥ 0.08 ng/mL at&#xD;
      any time. For BNP the cutoff value will be ≥ 200 pg/mL at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and patient safety. Quarterly review&#xD;
      meetings for low risk trials are required and will include the PI and other members per PI's&#xD;
      discretion. Quarterly meeting summaries will be reviewed by the full IUSCC Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee at the time of study review.&#xD;
