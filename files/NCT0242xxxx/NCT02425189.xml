  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NLQTS Research Network team aims to build a Canadian collaboration of dedicated&#xD;
      investigators that will create a new paradigm in the modern investigation of patients with&#xD;
      LQTS and in the description of a new disease modifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to describe the natural history of familial Long QT Syndrome to identify:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low risk patients that do not require protective beta-blocker therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High-risk patients that require protective beta-blocker therapy and may benefit from a&#xD;
           primary prevention ICD. This cohort would contain treated pre-symptomatic individuals&#xD;
           effectively protected from harm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Methods Patients with positive LQTS diagnosis and their family members reviewed in&#xD;
      collaborating Canadian Inherited Arrhythmia Clinics will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional bio bank donation will be offered. Consenting participants will have blood work&#xD;
      drawn in their local outpatient laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio banking at other collaborating centres will be done only at centres that have their own&#xD;
      bio banking facility at the site investigator's discretion. There will be no central bio&#xD;
      banking on a national basis at this time for this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Post Mortem Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next of kin (NOK) may provide consent to include the healthcare information of the&#xD;
      deceased family member into the data registry. The NOK may also consent to the storage of any&#xD;
      post mortem tissue not required for clinical testing to be stored in the bio bank for future&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collected Clinical data will be collected from willing/consented registry participants.&#xD;
      Their healthcare information will be coded in compliance with Tri Council Policy Statement&#xD;
      criteria: direct identifiers will be removed and replaced with a unique study code that does&#xD;
      not use personal information such as the participant's birth day (month and year will be&#xD;
      included), health number, social insurance number or name/initials. The coded data will be&#xD;
      transferred into the research database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The master list of registry participants with their study identifiers will be kept separately&#xD;
      from the research database. This master list will be stored in an encrypted file within the&#xD;
      research office of each site investigators under their supervision. Only the site&#xD;
      investigators and their local research staff will have access to this list. The inherited&#xD;
      nature of these conditions makes the master list an important and very sensitive document. It&#xD;
      will be very important that this list is maintained so that participants may be contacted and&#xD;
      informed of any new findings the research may reveal that may affect themselves and their&#xD;
      family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All medical information pertaining to the cardiac history of inherited arrhythmia patients&#xD;
      will be collected. This may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All diagnostic test results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic screening results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pedigree&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to have their data collected for the research database throughout&#xD;
      the entirety of the study. Participants will be able to decline further participation in the&#xD;
      registry at any time. The Research Steering Committee will review the data registry annually&#xD;
      to assess the integrity of the data and the usefulness of continued data collection. They&#xD;
      will also review related research projects that the data may be useful for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will not contain stored images graphics, test results or reports that would&#xD;
      permit identification of individual subjects. The registry may contain procedural images but&#xD;
      these will be coded per TCPS criteria as previously described for the participants' data and&#xD;
      biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients will be followed based on severity of presentation (previous cardiac&#xD;
      arrest or arrhythmic syncope, or family cascade screening). Vital status(cadiac events) will&#xD;
      be determined in person or by telephone annually in all patients enrolled. As per standard&#xD;
      care, participants with previous cardiac arrest or arrhythmic syncope on beta-blockers will&#xD;
      be followed in person every 12 months (Group 1), and asymptomatic patients, those free of&#xD;
      syncope on beta blocker, or gene negative unaffected family members (Group 2) every 2 years&#xD;
      (or at the discretion of the site investigator). An annual resting ECG is possible for all&#xD;
      participants, and exercise testing will be repeated every 2 years in Group 1, and every 3-4&#xD;
      years in Group 2 based on the clinical practice of the enrolling centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Database The database will be hosted on the University of British Columbia Research&#xD;
      Server. This research institute is in compliance with National Canadian/Provincial PIPEDA&#xD;
      privacy guidelines. Data will be entered directly into the e-CRFs for electronic submission&#xD;
      to a password protected internet-based server located at the University of British Columbia&#xD;
      Research DNS: cio.ciahealth.org IP Address: 142.103.184.100 Server: UBCIT Virtual Server&#xD;
      Location: UBC University Data Center (UDC) Pharmaceutical Sciences Building 2405 Wesbrook&#xD;
      Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T1Z3 Institute, housed on the Kelowna BC campus and will not collect&#xD;
      any personal identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subject medical information obtained as a result of this registry is considered&#xD;
      confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited except for the following reason:&#xD;
      relevant medical information may be given to the subject's personal physician or to other&#xD;
      appropriate medical personnel responsible for the participant's welfare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio Bank Biological samples will be coded in compliance with Tri Council Policy Statement&#xD;
      criteria: direct identifiers will be removed and replaced with a unique study code that does&#xD;
      not use personal information such as the participant's birth date, health number, social&#xD;
      insurance number or name/initials. The coded biological samples will be stored in the James&#xD;
      Hogg Research Centre at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia. The coded samples&#xD;
      will be linked to the master list kept securely in the research office of the collaborating&#xD;
      site investigators. Only site investigators and their local research staff will have access&#xD;
      to the master list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples drawn:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 X 9 ml EDTA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples for bio banking will be stored long-term in the James Hogg Research Centre (JHRC) Bio&#xD;
      Bank at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver for future research. Specimens will be stored in -20&#xD;
      and -80 degree freezers located in a secure area within the JHRC. The freezers are in a&#xD;
      dedicated, electronically monitored room managed by JHRC. Inventory management will include&#xD;
      retrieving samples, reporting inventory and sample history, and tracking samples with&#xD;
      FreezerWorks Unlimited software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post mortem samples not required for clinical purposes may be stored in the Bio Bank for&#xD;
      future research. In these cases, the sample will be used for research only if the NOK is in&#xD;
      agreement to the use of the sample. The investigators will be responsible for notifying the&#xD;
      NOK if the sample is to be relocated and for what purpose this is proposed. Written&#xD;
      documentation of the notification and consent to proceed from NOK will be required. The NOK&#xD;
      will be responsible for keeping the enrolling centre up to date with their contact&#xD;
      information so that contact for future use of the sample is feasible. The investigators will&#xD;
      be diligent in their attempt to notify the NOK but this may not be feasible in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database/bio bank access and Oversight Dr. Andrew Krahn will have ultimate responsibility for&#xD;
      the database/bio bank. Investigators wishing to access and use certain data/specimens from&#xD;
      the registry/bio bank will submit requests to Dr. Krahn and the Steering Committee for review&#xD;
      and approval. Institutional ethics review and approval will be required for new projects.&#xD;
      Projects other than retrospective data review will need to seek informed consent from the&#xD;
      participant before the data can be extracted from the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Long QT Syndrome Registry and Bio bank Research Steering Committee The Steering&#xD;
      Committee (SC) will be responsible for the design, execution, analysis, and reporting of the&#xD;
      study, and will assign appropriate responsibilities to the other study committees. The SC&#xD;
      will monitor study progress, execution and management. The SC will be comprised of the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (Chair), who will be the Data/Bio Specimen Steward, and all co&#xD;
      applicants. The team is composed of adult electrophysiologists (EPs) that oversee inherited&#xD;
      arrhythmia clinics (Drs. Martin Gardner, Hank Duff, Jeff Healey, Jason Roberts, Andrew Krahn,&#xD;
      Zach Laksman, Collette Seifer, Mario Talajic, Rafik Tadros, Paul Angaran, Christian&#xD;
      Steinberg, Martin Green, Richard Leather, Shane Kimber), and 4 counterpart pediatric EPs&#xD;
      (Robert Hamilton, Shubhayan Sanatani, Joseph Atallah, Anne Fournier). The SC will generate an&#xD;
      annual report outlining the study's contributions to the scientific community and usefulness&#xD;
      of the data . A formal Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will not be created because this&#xD;
      is a registry without planned therapeutic comparative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Requests for future use and sharing of the data/specimens will be evaluated according to the&#xD;
      following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objectives and hypothesis of the proposed research in relation to established and&#xD;
           emerging basic and clinical science&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proposed research's scientific, clinical and medical importance and translational&#xD;
           potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Commitment to provide a publication or presentation copy of the primary research data to&#xD;
           supplement or complement the registry information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proposed test's or research's unique nature and the importance of its validation in&#xD;
           LQTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proposed research's duration, demographics, patient population, health economic&#xD;
           situation, and probability of success&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the potential benefits and application are local or international in scope&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quantity of study data required and the commitment to reimburse the full cost&#xD;
           associated with delivery of study data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The contribution that the applicant has made to the registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data/Specimen Sharing In addition to the research carried out by the Study Team, some&#xD;
      data/specimens may be shared with researchers at other universities; only aggregate coded&#xD;
      data would be released for these purposes. These data/specimens may be used by a variety of&#xD;
      sources. Prior to data/specimen release, the SC will review written request for access. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that there may be requests to pool de-identified data/specimens with&#xD;
      data/specimens from other Canadian or international registries/banks in order to answer&#xD;
      investigator initiated questions about patient selection, rare events, and long term&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis At this phase there is no planned statistical analysis. Descriptive&#xD;
      analysis will be performed on the entire cohort, and standard statistical approaches will be&#xD;
      used. The current REB application is focused on the permission to prospectively collect&#xD;
      data/specimens from the participants and to store it in a coded repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations Participants in this project will be aware that they may not hear any&#xD;
      individual results about their own (or deceased NOK's) research data or bio specimen.&#xD;
      However, it is possible that there may be future research findings that the investigators may&#xD;
      be obliged to inform the individual participants about. These would include findings&#xD;
      affecting the heart health of the participant and/or their first-degree family members.&#xD;
      Participants will be aware that they may be contacted in the future if there are findings&#xD;
      that may affect their heart health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future Research This national approach to case finding and management represents a step&#xD;
      towards a population-based approach to studying a &quot;rare&quot; disease (1:2500). The knowledge&#xD;
      translation strategy aims to enhance public and health care professional awareness of warning&#xD;
      signs, deliver structured histories to assess risk, and improve ECG interpretation skills.&#xD;
      This will be imperative to begin a health system approach to recognition of LQTS.&#xD;
