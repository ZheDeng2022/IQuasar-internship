    <textblock>
      This study, for patients who have Stage IIIC colorectal cancer and who underwent&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy after surgery, will test to&#xD;
      see if regorafenib given after the completion of FOLFOX improves treatment, compared to&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC), which is no further treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Stage IIIC colon cancer have a 5-year survival rate of 28%. Stage III colon&#xD;
      cancer indicates that lymph nodes are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant FOLFOX only reduces the risk of recurrence of colorectal cancer by 40%, so almost&#xD;
      50% of patients still die from the disease. It is estimated that 50% of the patients relapse&#xD;
      within 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the prognosis of colorectal cancer is dependent on disease stage and because&#xD;
      metastatic disease is incurable, the concept of adding regorafenib to adjuvant FOLFOX has&#xD;
      been developed to allow patients with high-risk colorectal cancer the best chance of cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to treat high-risk colorectal patients (Stage IIIC [T4a, N2a, M0] or&#xD;
      [T3-4a,N2b, M0], or [T4b, N1-N2, M0] per American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 7th ed.)&#xD;
      selected from the iKnowMed (iKM) electronic health records database who have completed&#xD;
      adjuvant FOLFOX. This feasibility study is to find the starting dose of regorafenib and&#xD;
      estimates that at least 75% of the patients will be able to tolerate the full dose of&#xD;
      regorafenib after receiving adjuvant FOLFOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to regorafenib or to SOC (no treatment). In order to test&#xD;
      the best tolerated starting dose, the first 50 patients will receive regorafenib and will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to either 120 mg by mouth (PO) or 160 mg PO. If the 120 mg dose is well&#xD;
      tolerated and the toxicities are not severe (Grade 2 or less) upon the completion of cycle 2,&#xD;
      the dose will be increased to 160 mg starting with Cycle 3. Registration and randomization of&#xD;
      patients will resume after the 26th then after the 50th patient completes 3 cycles of study&#xD;
      treatment. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet after the 26th patient completes&#xD;
      3 cycles of treatment and the second meeting will take place after the 50th patient completes&#xD;
      3 cycles. If needed, a third DSMB meeting will be scheduled. The remaining 214 patients will&#xD;
      be randomized 2:3 to the decided starting dose versus SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, evaluating the Texture (spatial variations in pixel intensity) in computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans might help predict the risk of recurrence. Therefore, CT disks will be&#xD;
      sent to Imaging Endpoints Core Lab, Scottsdale, AZ, where the TexRAD platform (a software&#xD;
      algorithm) will be used for analysis.&#xD;
