      RCT to compare two radiation schemes for palliative HeadNeck cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial proportion of patients with head and neck (HNC) are not suitable for curative&#xD;
      treatment with surgery and/or (chemo)radiotherapy (CRT) because of very advanced stage,&#xD;
      significant comorbidities, bad general condition, distant metastasis, or a combination of&#xD;
      these factors. Although radiotherapy (RT) is a commonly used option to achieve durable&#xD;
      disease control and to alleviate troublesome symptoms, the data about the optimal radiation&#xD;
      scheme and the impact of these schedules on quality of life (QoL) of these vulnerable&#xD;
      patients is extremely scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although different radiation schemes are used worldwide (in the Netherlands, at least 15&#xD;
      different radiation schedules are used), it is currently not possible to identify the best RT&#xD;
      scheme, based only on retrospective studies because of the major differences between these&#xD;
      studies with regard to patient's demographics, radiation schedules given, the radiation&#xD;
      technique used etc. Furthermore, no any information is available on the impact of these&#xD;
      schemes on treatment-related toxicity and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This illustrates the urgent need for a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      identify the most optimal schemes of RT for this group of patients. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators intend to initiate a prospective RCT comparing the survival, loco-regional&#xD;
      control, toxicity, and QoL of two commonly used schemes. This study will be the first of his&#xD;
      kind for palliative patients with HNC and will compare a short-course (6 fractions) with a&#xD;
      long-course of radiotherapy (16 fractions). Because most of patients with incurable HNC have&#xD;
      a poor performance status and major comorbidity and prefer limited number of visits to the&#xD;
      hospital, it is quite reasonable to investigate whether a short scheme of radiotherapy with&#xD;
      limited number of visits to the clinic as good as a relatively long-course of radiotherapy in&#xD;
      terms of outcome, toxicity and QoL. This delicate balance between outcomes, possible toxicity&#xD;
      and patient's comfort would justify the initiation of such randomized trial. The results of&#xD;
      this study will in the nearby future enable us to indicate the radiation scheme best suits&#xD;
      which patient category&#xD;
