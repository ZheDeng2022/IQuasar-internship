      The receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) system is considered important for bone&#xD;
      homeostasis and comprises three important factors. RANKL exist in three isoforms but the&#xD;
      predominant function is mediated by the transmembrane ligand that binds to a specific&#xD;
      receptor (receptor activator of NF-KB (RANK)) on a neighbour cell that subsequently activates&#xD;
      NFKB and regulates cell cycle OPG is an endogenous secreted protein that binds RANKL and&#xD;
      inhibits its signalling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the RANK/RANKL system is vital for activation of the bone resorbing cells&#xD;
      (osteoclasts). In bone the bone synthesizing cells (osteoblasts) express RANKL that signals&#xD;
      to RANK on the immature osteoclasts. This induces proliferation and activation of the cells&#xD;
      they start to proliferate and resorp bone. OPG is produced by somatic cells in the bone and&#xD;
      this production is regulated by sex hormones, TGF-B and various other substances. Today a&#xD;
      human made recombinant antibody against RANKL, Denosumab is used to treat osteoporosis as it&#xD;
      inhibits RANKL signalling and thus causes less bone resorption in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANKL, RANK and OPG are expressed in the testis and this pathway appears to be a novel&#xD;
      regulator of germ cell proliferation. Decreased semen quality is a major factor of male&#xD;
      infertility. Semen quality is a measure of the ability of the sperm to accomplish&#xD;
      fertilization. Evaluation of male fertility potential is today basically conducted through&#xD;
      semen analysis. There is no treatment for men with no sperm in the ejaculate and there exist&#xD;
      no drug that can increase sperm counts.Therefore, drugs that can lower RANKL&#xD;
      expression/activity for instance an antibody against RANKL such as Denosumab may be used for&#xD;
      this new indication: A new treatment option of infertile men with impaired semen quality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) system is considered important for bone&#xD;
      homeostasis . RANKL exist in three isoforms and the effects of all isoforms are mediated&#xD;
      through binding to a specific receptor (receptor activator of NF-KB (RANK)). RANKL is&#xD;
      predominantly found as a transmembrane protein and signalling is therefore dependent on&#xD;
      cell-cell interaction to a neighbouring cell expressing RANK that subsequently activates NFKB&#xD;
      and regulates cellular activation through regulation of cell cycle i.e proliferation,&#xD;
      differentiation and apoptosis. RANKL-RANK interaction is modified by osteoprotegerin (OPG),&#xD;
      which is an endogenous secreted protein that binds RANKL and inhibits its signalling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANK/RANKL triggers a network of TRAF-mediated kinase cascades that promote osteoclast&#xD;
      differentiation. RANKL is expressed on osteoblast cells and its receptor, Rank, on pre-&#xD;
      osteoclastic cells. RANKL expression is stimulated by a number of factors, such as IL-1 ,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-11 , IL-17, TNF- α, vitamin D, Ca2+, parathyroid, glucocorticoids, prostaglandin E2,&#xD;
      and immunosuppressive drugs, and is down-regulated by TGF-α. The RANK/RANKL interaction&#xD;
      induces differentiation and formation of multinucleated mature osteoclasts, causing bone&#xD;
      resorption. The third protein agonist, osteoprotegerin (OPG), is also produced by osteoblasts&#xD;
      and is known to exert an inhibitory effect on the pre-osteoclastic differentiation process.&#xD;
      By binding to RANKL also known as osteoprotegerin binding protein (OPGbp), OPG inhibits the&#xD;
      RANK/RANKL interaction and subsequent osteoclastogenesis. OPG is thus a very efficient&#xD;
      anti-resorptive agent. It also serves as a decoy receptor for the tumour necrosis&#xD;
      factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and increases cell survival by blocking the&#xD;
      apoptotic effects of this ligand. The fact that the overexpression of OPG in mice results in&#xD;
      severe osteopetrosis and that OPG-null mice are osteoporotic is testimony to the&#xD;
      physiological importance of OPG. The lack of RANK or RANKL induces osteopetrosis in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the RANK/RANKL system is vital for activation of the bone resorping cells&#xD;
      (osteoclasts). In the skeleton the bone synthesizing cells (osteoblasts) express RANKL that&#xD;
      signals to RANK on the immature osteoclasts. This induces proliferation and activation of the&#xD;
      cells they start to proliferate and resorp bone. OPG is produced by somatic cells in the bone&#xD;
      and this production is regulated by sex hormones, TGF-B and various other substances. Today a&#xD;
      human made recombinant antibody against RANKL, Denosumab is used to treat osteoporosis as it&#xD;
      inhibits RANKL signalling and causes less bone resorption in humans. RANKL signalling has&#xD;
      only two other known additional functions in healthy humans where it is involved in lactation&#xD;
      and the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have data showing that RANKL, RANK and OPG are expressed at both RNA and&#xD;
      protein level in the human testis. The Sertoli cells express RANKL, while the germ cells&#xD;
      express RANK and the peritubular cells express OPG. Normally, RANKL activates NFKB and&#xD;
      activation of this pathway in the male gonad appears to regulate whether the testicular cells&#xD;
      proliferate or undergo apoptosis in the testis. The investigators' in vitro, ex vivo and in&#xD;
      vivo data from functional models support this suggestion and this pathway appears therefore&#xD;
      to be a novel regulator of germ cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased semen quality is a major factor of male infertility. Semen quality is an indirect&#xD;
      measure of the ability of the sperm to accomplish fertilization. Evaluation of male fertility&#xD;
      potential is evaluated by semen analysis. Semen analysis evaluates certain characteristics&#xD;
      and the most common variables measured to evaluate sperm quality are: sperm count, motility&#xD;
      and morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no treatment for men with no spermatozoa in the ejaculate or even a drug that can&#xD;
      increase sperm number in infertile men.Therefore, we suggest that antibodies against RANKL&#xD;
      such as Denosumab, may be used as a novel treatment option for male infertility , which&#xD;
      highlights a new indication for Denosumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore test whether inhibition of RANKL by Denosumab in humans&#xD;
      increases sperm production and semen quality in this small prospective intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will invite 15 infertile men for detailed screening to secure inclusion and study&#xD;
      completion of anticipated 12 infertile men&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the analyses will be performed according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the&#xD;
      primary analyses in the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who&#xD;
      received the first dose of medicine on day 1. We will analyze the data in two ways. The&#xD;
      primary analysis will proceed according to baseline values compared with outcomes variables&#xD;
      after intervention. The secondary analysis will be based on stratifying the men according to&#xD;
      subgroup analyses in relation to the predefined primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and quality The primary end points for this protocol will be changes in sperm&#xD;
      production evaluated by total sperm number, sperm concentration followed by number of&#xD;
      progressive and motile sperm, morphologically normal sperm, sperm motility, progressive&#xD;
      motility and morfology which will be compared by paired t-test. Multiple secondary endpoints&#xD;
      exist but for the initial investigation focus will be on changes of the following secondary&#xD;
      endpoints: Sperm DFI, FSH, Inhibin B, serum OPG, RANKL, OPG, vitamin D and calcium&#xD;
      homeostasis. Subjects who terminate participation after visit day 1 but before visit day 180&#xD;
      will be included for data analysis up to the last day they provided semen and bloodsample.&#xD;
      Men that only deliver semen samples occasionally or have missing data at any visit will still&#xD;
      be included in the analysis. Men that do not meet the criteria in the protocol will be&#xD;
      excluded from the analysis. Men with fever above 38.5 degrees Celsius will not be included in&#xD;
      the analyses up to 3 months after the fever episode. Semen samples obtained with an&#xD;
      abstinence period less than 24 hours or with a semen volume &lt; 1.5 ml will not be included in&#xD;
      the analyses. Those values will then be carried forward for analyses. A significance level of&#xD;
      5% is used. For the primary analyses Bonferronu-Holm p-value correction is calculated&#xD;
      additionally. For the secondary analysis no multiple test correction are used. Instead&#xD;
      results are discussed in view of the multiple testing situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyses between baseline versus different timepoints The first step will be to compare&#xD;
           the changes in primary outcomes between baseline versus the different timepoints.&#xD;
           Spermatogenesis normally takes up to 70 days in men and we will therefore determine the&#xD;
           difference to all the individual timepoints and calculate average for days 80, 120 and&#xD;
           180 and compare with baseline values to determine the effect of RANKL inhibition on the&#xD;
           whole length of spermatogenesis. This analysis will show if there is a significant&#xD;
           difference between groups. For outcomes measured repeatedly, this will entail comparing&#xD;
           the estimated slopes, or rates of change, of each outcome between the groups. Mixed&#xD;
           models allow for the correlation between the repeated observations baseline-day 1-day&#xD;
           80- day 180 from each man to be suitably incorporated into parameter estimation. For all&#xD;
           endpoints measured at baseline and day 180, paired t-tests will be used to assess there&#xD;
           is a significant difference between the groups and determine whether the mean change&#xD;
           within each group differs significantly from zero. In both cases, data will be&#xD;
           transformed as necessary to meet model assumptions. Afterwards, the same analysis will&#xD;
           be conducted by using multiple regression with relevant confounders such as season, BMI,&#xD;
           smoking, duration of abstinence, time from ejaculation to motility assessment, fever&#xD;
           etc. to see if this changes the results For outcomes measured that cannot be compared&#xD;
           with t-test or other parametric tests at day 1, day 80 and day 180, groups will be&#xD;
           compared using non-parametric tests such as Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. For Binary&#xD;
           outcome the data will be compared between the two groups by means of conditional&#xD;
           logistic-regression analysis with adjustment for relevant confounders (defined as being&#xD;
           significantly p&lt;0.05 associated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyses after stratification into subgroups Subjects will be grouped according to their&#xD;
           BMI, semen quality, serum RANKL, OPG, calcium, PTH, osteocalcin or other bonefactors&#xD;
           evaluated at the day of screening. The subgroup analyses will in accordance with normal&#xD;
           clinical practice and stratification in appropriate groups according to the clinical&#xD;
           (BMI &lt;25, 25-30, &gt;30 etc.), tertiles or highest/lowest versus remaining at baseline.&#xD;
           Analyses will be performed on each timpeoint compared with baseline in addition to&#xD;
           mean/median of visit day 80, 120, 180 with baseline and mean/median of all visits after&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
