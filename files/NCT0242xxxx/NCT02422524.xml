  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single dose (200 mg), open-label, sequential group study comparing the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety of Pretomanid in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic&#xD;
      impairment to matched, non-hepatically impaired subjects. There will be approximately 36&#xD;
      total subjects, adult males and females, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at 2 sites, study duration is approximately 24 months, and subject participation&#xD;
      duration is approximately 5 weeks (including screening). Primary objective: To evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of Pretomanid in subjects with mild, moderate, and&#xD;
      severe hepatic impairment (as assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to matched&#xD;
      non-hepatically impaired subjects. Secondary objective: To evaluate the safety of a single&#xD;
      oral dose of Pretomanid in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (as&#xD;
      assessed by Child-Pugh score), relative to matched non-hepatically impaired subjects.&#xD;

      pharmacokinetics and safety of Pretomanid in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic&#xD;
      impairment to matched, non-hepatically impaired subjects. This study will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 6 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), approximately 6&#xD;
      subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), approximately 6 subjects with&#xD;
      severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), and approximately 18 matched non-hepatically&#xD;
      impaired subjects. Non-hepatically impaired subjects in the control group will be matched to&#xD;
      subjects with hepatic impairment based on age (+/- 10 years) and body weight (+/- 20 percent)&#xD;
      as measured at screening (Visit 00A). There will be approximately 36 total subjects, adult&#xD;
      males and females, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive. The study will be conducted at 2 sites,&#xD;
      study duration is approximately 24 months, and subject participation duration is&#xD;
      approximately 5 weeks (including screening). Primary objective: To evaluate the&#xD;
