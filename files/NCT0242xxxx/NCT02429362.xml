  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are being asked to donate blood, urine, vaginal secretions and/or tissue to a&#xD;
      repository for research.This repository will store donated specimens for future research. The&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center,&#xD;
      under the direction of Dr. Giancarlo Mari, Professor and Chair, is responsible for the&#xD;
      operation of the repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, in the case of a stillborn child, the mother will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      donate samples from her stillborn baby's autopsy to a repository for research.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stored samples will be used in studies to help researchers understand normal events in&#xD;
      pregnancy, as well as events that occur when women and/or their babies have a disease or&#xD;
      condition during pregnancy. Additionally, the samples may be used in future studies to&#xD;
      develop cell lines for research, create tests to diagnose disease, or develop treatments. A&#xD;
      cell line is the result of cells grown outside the body in a laboratory. This process will&#xD;
      allow those cells to grow continuously when given the appropriate nutrients and conditions&#xD;
      for growth, and will result in a permanent cell culture which is the collection of cells that&#xD;
      are grown outside the body in a laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stored samples will also be used in future studies to help researchers identify genetic&#xD;
      influences during pregnancy. Genes are like blueprints in each of your cells that determine&#xD;
      traits that you inherit, like eye color and hair color. Genes may also influence what&#xD;
      diseases you get and how you respond to treatment. DNA is the substance that makes up your&#xD;
      genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will sign an informed consent for her participation (Primary Informed Consent).&#xD;
      In the situation of a stillbirth occurring, the mother of the stillborn baby will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent regarding the tissue samples to be obtained during the hospital's routinely&#xD;
      performed autopsy. (Secondary Informed Consent).&#xD;
