  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects about 30% of the United Kingdom population and is causally implicated in&#xD;
      the aetiology of renal disease, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Ageing, obesity, a poor&#xD;
      diet and low levels of physical activity are all risk factors. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      adherence to a Mediterranean diet is protective against hypertension and its associated&#xD;
      morbidities; olive oil is believed to be a key beneficially bioactive component of that diet.&#xD;
      As a source of lipids olive oil is an unremarkable blend of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated&#xD;
      and saturated fatty acids; it is however rich in phenolic compounds, principally oleuropein&#xD;
      and hydroxytyrosol, which may be of benefit to health. A recent randomised intervention trial&#xD;
      in predominantly hypertensive volunteers showed that adherence to a Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, reduced blood pressure and other measures of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk. Olive phenolics can be extracted cheaply from the waste products&#xD;
      of olive oil manufacture, such as the plant leaf and these are used as dietary supplements.&#xD;
      In intervention studies in hypertensive or borderline hypertensive patients, olive leaf&#xD;
      extract consumption has been shown to reduce blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another intervention with established efficacy for improving blood pressure is to increase&#xD;
      physical activity. The 'Start Active, Stay Active', Chief Medical Officers report on physical&#xD;
      activity recommends that adults achieve 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity&#xD;
      per week, while data in that report suggest that fewer than 40% of adult men and 30% of adult&#xD;
      women achieve these targets. Adherence to the physical activity guidelines may in fact be&#xD;
      much worse in sub-sections of the population at higher risk of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a public health perspective, holistic guidelines for the prevention of hypertension, or&#xD;
      its early diagnosis and management, based around a healthy diet and lifestyle are preferable&#xD;
      to pharmaceutical intervention. Lifestyle interventions are economically favourable and they&#xD;
      come with fewer side effects and perhaps wider health benefits than antihypertensive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evidence the synergistic benefits of consuming plant (and&#xD;
      specifically olive) phenolics alongside achieving the recommended guidelines for physical&#xD;
      activity in individuals with elevated blood pressure.&#xD;
