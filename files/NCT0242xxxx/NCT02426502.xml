      Patient failure to take medications as prescribed (medication non-adherence) is now&#xD;
      identified as an important cause of kidney transplant failure. The availability of new drugs&#xD;
      that are taken once daily may improve patient adherence compared to older drugs that had to&#xD;
      be taken twice per day. In this study, patients will be converted to a medication schedule&#xD;
      where all medications are taken once daily with the goal of improving patient adherence and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;

      The current pilot study will first demonstrate the safety and feasibility of converting&#xD;
      maintenance transplant recipients to a once daily regimen, while measure of patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and adherence are secondary outcomes. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the safety and feasibility of converting maintenance kidney transplant recipients (i.e. those&#xD;
      more than one year post transplantation) to a once daily drug regimen (including&#xD;
      immunosuppressant and non-immunosuppressant drugs). We believe that conversion to a once&#xD;
      daily (O.D.) medication regimen for both immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications will be associated with increased patient adherence and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppressant non-adherence is considered the leading potentially avoidable cause of&#xD;
      allograft failure, with non-adherent patients having a seven fold higher odds of graft&#xD;
      failure than adherent patients. Although medication non-adherence is multi-factorial,&#xD;
      simplification of medication requirements has been associated with improved adherence in the&#xD;
      non-transplant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few prospective studies examining strategies to improve immunosuppressant&#xD;
      adherence. The proposed study has significant potential to improve medication adherence and&#xD;
      satisfaction in kidney transplant recipients which may ultimately lead to an improvement in&#xD;
      long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major barrier to establishing a once daily medication regimen in maintenance kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients (i.e. patients ≥ 12 months post transplantation) was related to the&#xD;
      requirement to prescribe calcineurin inhibitors twice daily. The development of Advagraf&#xD;
      (tacrolimus extended release capsules), which is approved for prevention of rejection in&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients, now provides an opportunity to convert patients to a once daily&#xD;
      immunosuppressant medication regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other maintenance immunosuppressant medications used in kidney transplantation are&#xD;
      Mycophenolic acid (MPA), azathioprine and prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycophenolic acid (MPA) was first made available for use in kidney transplantation in 1995 in&#xD;
      the form of the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); this was later followed by the&#xD;
      introduction of mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended dose of MMF and Myfortic are 2g/day and 1440 mg/day respectively in de novo&#xD;
      transplant recipients. In clinical practice, maintenance patients (i.e. those who are more&#xD;
      than 1 year post transplantation) are often not maintained on the recommended initial (see&#xD;
      below). In studies involving patients prescribed the recommended initial daily dose, MPA&#xD;
      exposure is highly variable: The 12 hour area under the curve (AUC) ranges anywhere between&#xD;
      15 and 115 mg*h/L. In the first post transplant year, a 12 hour AUC of 30 -60 mg*h/l is&#xD;
      recommended based on studies showing an increased incidence of rejection when the AUC &lt; 30&#xD;
      mg*h/l, and no additional efficacy benefit with AUC &gt; 60 mg*h/l in cyclosporine treated&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relationship between MPA exposure and acute rejection beyond 3 months has not been&#xD;
      demonstrated. There is a paucity of studies examining the concentration-effect relationship&#xD;
      beyond the first post transplant year and thus there are no established recommendations for&#xD;
      MPA exposure after the first post-transplant year. In clinical practice a significant&#xD;
      proportion of long-term (≥ 1 year post transplant) MPA treated patients will be prescribed&#xD;
      less than the recommended dose of MPA due to a variety of reasons including patient&#xD;
      intolerance (usually gastrointestinal or hematological). Most reductions in MPA dose are&#xD;
      undertaken in the first few months after transplantation when renal allograft dysfunction or&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia may have increased free MPA exposure and possibly increased drug related side&#xD;
      effects. Importantly recent controlled studies in both de novo and maintenance transplant&#xD;
      patients have demonstrated the safety of once daily MPA dosing using less than the initial&#xD;
      recommended daily dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone may or may not be prescribed in maintenance transplant recipients. Maintenance&#xD;
      prednisone dose varies between 5 -10 mg once daily or every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azathioprine is an established once daily medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant criticism of one daily immunosuppressant regimens has been that patients will&#xD;
      still be required to take other medications multiple times per day. Uniquely the proposed&#xD;
      study will convert all medications (immunosuppressant and non-immunosuppressants) to a once&#xD;
      daily regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, advances in immunosuppressant drugs now make it possible to consider a once daily&#xD;
      immunosuppressant regimen in maintenance kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be screened and consented at the hospital by the study team. The&#xD;
      conversion to a once daily dosing regimen will be accomplished in three phases: 1) conversion&#xD;
      to Advagraf; 2) conversion of non-immunosuppressant drugs and; 3) conversion of patients&#xD;
      taking twice daily MPA to once daily MPA.&#xD;
