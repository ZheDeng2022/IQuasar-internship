      The aim of this project is to investigate the potential benefits of combining a new protein&#xD;
      meat hydrolysates extract with a regular resistance training programme on (a) body&#xD;
      composition (b) performance (c) muscle structure (d) general markers health and immunity in&#xD;
      athletes. As a second objective the investigators will analyse potential differences obtained&#xD;
      from the ingestion of the new hydrolysates meat protein extract compared to the ingestion of&#xD;
      others commercially available protein sources such as whey or casein.&#xD;

      This investigation involves a 8 weeks randomised, balanced, double blind parallel group&#xD;
      between-subjects design aimed to analyse the effects of combining exercise and a post&#xD;
      exercise nutrition strategy (hydrolysates meat protein, whey protein or a isocaloric only&#xD;
      carbohydrate placebo) on training outcomes, markers of immunity and health after a period of&#xD;
      regular training and feeding intervention. Participants will be divided in three-treatment&#xD;
      groups 1) Hydrolysed meat-protein (MEAT); 2) Whey (W) and 3) non-protein iso-energetic&#xD;
      placebo (CHO). Once considered eligible for the study, and after an initial familiarisation&#xD;
      period and baseline tests, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the intervention&#xD;
      groups: MEAT; W and CHO. Each group will follow a 8-week periodised resistance training&#xD;
      intervention combined with one of the three specific supplementation treatments (MEAT, W or&#xD;
      CHO). Measurements of general markers of health, immunity, body composition, muscle structure&#xD;
      and performance will be determined before and after the training intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent and health history have been obtained, after the baseline Assessment&#xD;
      (t1), participants will divided into three similar profile groups, matched by body mass, age,&#xD;
      sex and performance. 1) The meat protein group (MEAT n=10) that will take 250 ml of orange&#xD;
      juice mixed with 20g of hydrolysates meat protein powder and water 2) The whey group (n=10)&#xD;
      will take 20 g of whey intact isolate powder mixed with 250 ml of orange juice and water 3)&#xD;
      the contrast group (P n=10) that will take an iso-energetic non-protein, only carbohydrate&#xD;
      (maltodextrin) placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Thirty participants, recruited from the University Campus, will take part in&#xD;
      the project. After being informed of all risk, discomforts, and benefits involved,&#xD;
      participants will sign a written informed consent regarding their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Familiarization period: Participants will undertake 3 sessions of&#xD;
      familiarization (1 weeks). A qualified strength and conditioning coach will control and&#xD;
      assists participants in order to guarantee a correct execution of the selected exercise. All&#xD;
      participants will be instructed about the appropriate use of the Rate of Perceived Exertion&#xD;
      (0-10) scale to control the load and training intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance Training: The resistance-training program will be designed to increase strength&#xD;
      and mass of all major muscle groups. The program will be undertaken on three non-consecutive&#xD;
      days per week, under the supervision of strength and conditioning coaches, preferable&#xD;
      Strength and Conditioning master students. Training workout will be performed during the&#xD;
      afternoon (between 3pm and 6pm) with at least 48 hours between sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will begin with individualized warm-up (5-minute warm-up stretches, followed by&#xD;
      one set of eight repetitions of six resistance training exercises without any additional&#xD;
      weight). Workout will involve 8 resistance exercises per 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions at 70%&#xD;
      to 85% of an individual 1RM. Exercises will be performed using free-weights, elastic bands,&#xD;
      sticks and machines selected to stress the major muscle groups. Resting periods of around 2&#xD;
      min will be allowed sets. Participants will be instructed to maintain the proper execution&#xD;
      along the entire training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodization strategy: The intervention will consist of 8-week periodised resistance&#xD;
      training programme that will be divided in 3 blocks: First block (1st to 3th week) using a&#xD;
      moderate load intensity of around 70%1RM; Second block (4th to 6th week) where the intensity&#xD;
      will increase to &gt;75% to 80% 1RM and the third block (7th to 8th week) where the highest&#xD;
      loads (&gt;80 to 85% 1RM) will be used. The Rate of Perceive Exertion (0-10) scale (RPE) will be&#xD;
      used to appropriately select the load along the training intervention. Resistance training&#xD;
      intervention will be appropriately integrated with the regular sport activity performed by&#xD;
      the University athletes along the academic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation protocol: Training days: Immediately (&lt;10 min) after com Non-training days:&#xD;
      before breakfast. Supplements and placebo will be provided in powder form and should be mixed&#xD;
      with an standardised orange juice and water at the moment of consumption. Supplements and&#xD;
      placebo will looks and tastes identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a total of one 20g doses will be administered on daily bases. Participants should&#xD;
      ingest a total of 56 doses for a total of 8 weeks of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement will be provided in 14 days based by a blind researcher after Participants should&#xD;
      return back the empty bag of the supplement/placebo consumed during the previous 14 days&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
