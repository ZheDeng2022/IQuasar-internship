  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over one-third of children and adolescents are overweight and nearly 1 in 5 of them are&#xD;
      obese. Metabolic syndrome, a strong predictor of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD), occurs in up to 44% of obese youth, foreshadowing greater prevalence and&#xD;
      earlier onset of T2D. Without effective interventions, &quot;diabesity&quot; will worsen, T2D&#xD;
      prevalence will increase, and adults will face its consequences at younger ages. Given the&#xD;
      strong association between obesity and chronic disease risk factors in youth, the&#xD;
      investigators contend T2D prevention (and CVD prevention) is akin to weight control and&#xD;
      obesity prevention. The objective of the proposed project is to develop a family-centered,&#xD;
      community-based program for T2D prevention in peripubertal (9- to 12-year-old) youth. Using&#xD;
      participatory methods, the investigators intend to adapt the successful adult-focused YMCA&#xD;
      Diabetes Prevention Program (YDPP) for youth and families and assess the feasibility,&#xD;
      participant acceptance of and adherence to the YFDPP using two delivery formats: a 12-week&#xD;
      YMCA-based face-to-face program and a 12-week combined face-to-face plus mobile device-based&#xD;
      program. The proposed study will test the investigators premise that delivery with technology&#xD;
      can reduce participant perceived burden, improve adherence, and lead to improved&#xD;
      anthropometric (height, weight and BMI and waist circumference), behavioral (diet and&#xD;
      physical activity) and physiological outcomes (fasting insulin, glucose, lipid, blood&#xD;
      pressure). The investigators will use the resulting data to design an appropriately powered&#xD;
      full-scale trial. The importance of the proposed study is underscored both by the statistics&#xD;
      cited above and the recent call for proposals to translate efficacious clinical interventions&#xD;
      into effective community programs for youth. The potential impact of the proposed&#xD;
      intervention is great in that the program will be delivered by paraprofessionals from the&#xD;
      community without university researchers; significant in that it targets a major public&#xD;
      health challenge in children and includes assessment of objective behavioral and clinical&#xD;
      data; and innovative in that it focuses on an at-risk population, takes place at a popular,&#xD;
      accessible community venue, and uses mobile technologies to extend reach and increase&#xD;
      engagement of youth and families with intervention content. The long-term goal is to create a&#xD;
      scalable, replicable, and sustainable program that overcomes existing barriers to&#xD;
      implementation and dissemination of evidence-based, research-proven diabetes prevention&#xD;
      programs to youth and families, thereby improving population health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators objective is to develop a family-centered, community-based program for T2D&#xD;
      prevention in peripubertal (9-12-year-old) youth. Efficacious community programs for youth&#xD;
      are not available (although promising components exist), and thus the investigators propose&#xD;
      to adapt the successful adult-focused YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program (YDPP) for youth and&#xD;
      families, and assess its impact on anthropometric, behavioral and physiological outcomes in&#xD;
      support of the design (power calculation) of a full-scale trial. The proposed study will&#xD;
      evaluate the adapted program using two formats (with and without mobile technologies).&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will include participant perceived burden, adherence, and program costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Adapt an efficacious diabetes prevention program in adults (the YMCA Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Program, or YDPP) for delivery to overweight peripubertal youth and their&#xD;
      families, thereby establishing a YMCA Family Diabetes Prevention Program (YFDPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the feasibility, participant acceptance (child and parent) and retention rates of&#xD;
      the YFDPP using two formats, a 12-week YMCA-based face-to-face program and a 12-week program&#xD;
      with content delivered through a combination of face-to-face and mobile devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test the impact of the new YFDPP using two formats on anthropometric (height, weight,&#xD;
      BMI and waist circumference), behavioral (diet and physical activity), and physiological&#xD;
      (fasting insulin, glucose, lipid) outcomes, using the resulting data to design an&#xD;
      appropriately powered full-scale trial.&#xD;
