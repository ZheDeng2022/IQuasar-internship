  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-income children and children of obese parents are at high risk of obesity. Effective&#xD;
      interventions are needed to target these families to improve the health of the parents and&#xD;
      prevent obesity in the children. The hypothesis is that an intervention that combines&#xD;
      engagement of community organizations, motivational interviewing (MI, a technique proven to&#xD;
      help people set goals that are personally meaningful), and resource mobilization will change&#xD;
      diet and physical activity habits among disadvantaged families. This proposal grew from an&#xD;
      established community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership between the research&#xD;
      team and community organizations that serve high minority (45-55%), low-income populations.&#xD;
      Partners include a community health center, a food pantry network, a work-force training&#xD;
      program, and other agencies. These partners designed and implemented a successful pilot&#xD;
      project on which this proposal is based. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) To&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of a family-targeted obesity intervention based on MI and&#xD;
      resource-mobilization. Hypotheses: In comparison to control families, families participating&#xD;
      in the intervention will demonstrate a) a reduction in BMI for adults, b) an increase in&#xD;
      minutes of moderate physical activity and decreased sedentary time for both adults and&#xD;
      children accelerometer), and c) a reduction in the number of obesity risk behaviors and an&#xD;
      increase in obesity prevention behaviors among children. 2) To examine the mediators of&#xD;
      intervention effects. 3) Identify the types of resources needed most often by intervention&#xD;
      families to support lifestyle change. This randomized controlled trial includes 260&#xD;
      low-income families that contain at least one obese adult and one normal or overweight child&#xD;
      between 6 and 12. The 12-month intervention has two elements. 1) A health coach will use MI&#xD;
      to help families explore ambivalence toward and motivations for change and set goals for&#xD;
      improving diet and physical activity. 2) To support goals, families will be connected with&#xD;
      community agencies that can assist with general (e.g., financial) and goal specific resources&#xD;
      (e.g., food, physical activity opportunities). Collaboration between organizations will&#xD;
      streamline referrals, maximize resources, and facilitate access. Control families will get a&#xD;
      basic screen for needs and information about available community resources. Outcomes are&#xD;
      measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. This intervention is innovative in that it 1)&#xD;
      focuses on lifestyle changes for the entire family and measures outcomes in adults and&#xD;
      children, 2) combines MI focused on the entire family and community resource referrals&#xD;
      specific to family needs and goals for change, 3) partners community organizations to&#xD;
      coordinate resources for families, and 4) involves partners in all research phases via a CBPR&#xD;
      approach. This contribution will be significant because the proposed intervention, if&#xD;
      successful, can be replicated elsewhere and adapted to the local resource environment to&#xD;
      address adult obesity and prevent childhood obesity in a high-risk population. The study will&#xD;
      also identify the types of resources low-income families need to change diet and physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  one parent must have a BMI of 30 or above, and be parent or guardian of at least one&#xD;
             child&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  between the ages of 6 and 12. Children this age are targeted because they benefit most&#xD;
             from parental involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are old enough to participate in family goal setting and activities, but young enough&#xD;
             to be heavily influenced by family environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a child must live with the obese parent at least 80% of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  obese adults or index children with a medical condition or medication that&#xD;
             significantly alters their&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ability to follow the dietary recommendations (e.g., renal diet, severe food&#xD;
                  allergy, celiac disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. mobility (e.g. bed bound or unable to participate in any sort of physical&#xD;
                  activity even with assistive devices), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. weight&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  additionally we will exclude those who have a significant psychiatric disease,&#xD;
             substance abuse disorder or cognitive impairment that would interfere with their&#xD;
             ability to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  those with controlled or mild depression would not be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adults with hypertension, type II diabetes, or glucose intolerance will not be&#xD;
             excluded, as advocated changes are consistent with their needs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no data will be collected from nonindex children who meet the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  obese adults who are currently pregnant at baseline will be excluded because of their&#xD;
             altered weight and dietary patterns. If the obese adult becomes pregnant during the&#xD;
             intervention their family will be allowed to continue in the intervention but the&#xD;
             pregnant adults' anthropometric data will not be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the intervention will intentionally target low-income families through recruitment&#xD;
             site choices but will not exclude or include families based on income requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant women will not be targeted but may be included if not the obese adult (see&#xD;
             above).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  weight, height, waist circumference and bioelectrical impedance will not be collected&#xD;
             on pregnant women.&#xD;
