  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the issues that have greatest impact on QOL for&#xD;
      patients with Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) Disease. Patients who have -registered in the&#xD;
      Inherited Neuropathies Consortium Contact Registry will be invited to participate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol consists of two anonymous surveys. The first large scale survey is designed to&#xD;
      identify items that best reflect the issues and symptoms with high impact upon QOL in CMT. A&#xD;
      second brief survey focuses on the frequency and impact of muscle cramps on QOL in adult CMT.&#xD;
      The surveys will be distributed via an online link to all adult CMT patients self-registered&#xD;
      with the RDCRN contact registry. Those who complete the first two surveys will be requested&#xD;
      to complete only the second brief survey on muscle cramps again 3 weeks after completing it&#xD;
      the first time. Those who complete the brief muscle cramps survey a second time will be&#xD;
      requested to complete it again 5 weeks later to assess variability in occurrence of muscle&#xD;
      cramps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first large scale survey to identify items that best reflect the issues and symptoms with&#xD;
      high impact upon QOL in CMT will be sent out in a second wave. This second wave will only&#xD;
      contain the QOL survey and not the muscle cramp survey. The QOL survey will be distributed&#xD;
      via an online link to three populations: adult CMT patients self-registered with the INC&#xD;
      (RDCRN) Contact Registry who had not been registered at the time of the first enrollment&#xD;
      period, adult patients who had been registered at the time of the first enrollment period and&#xD;
      had received the survey, but had not returned it, and patients who were registered, but were&#xD;
      under age 18 at the time of the first enrollment period and have turned 18 by the time of the&#xD;
      second enrollment period.&#xD;
