      The aim of this study is to examine the clinical effects of supporting the human pelvis in a&#xD;
      neutral sitting position in subjects with Low Back Pain over a 3-week period. The neutral&#xD;
      sitting posture will be supported by a portable and adjustable &quot;pelvic support device&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;pelvic support assembly&quot; per US Patent number US 8,857,906 B2 that is used in the seat of&#xD;
      the user's desk chair.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control trial with repeated measures. It will include 34 subjects&#xD;
      with low back pain who sit 25 hours a week or more at a desk / computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 groups: control and experimental, each with 17 subjects. All subjects will be&#xD;
      measured on the same 2 dates (3 weeks apart - pre and post intervention) with the same&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will use a pelvic support device, that aids in supporting the user's&#xD;
      pelvis in a neutral position, in their desk chairs at home or work as tolerated during this 3&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will continue in their current sitting arrangement during the same 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For control of conflict of interest, the Sponsor-Investigator will not perform any of the&#xD;
      measures and data will be coded for subject group assignment until all data analysis is&#xD;
      finalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sessions of 3-week intervals of data collection may be performed as needed to&#xD;
      achieve desired subject number in the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire measures the impact subject's low back pain on functional tolerance levels. Scale range is 0-100 with the lower score indicating a higher functional / activity level as it relates to Low Back Pain.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals with a history of 1 or more episodes of low back pain (LBP) in the last&#xD;
             calendar year or who currently has LBP without radiation of pain from the low back&#xD;
             into the legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Males or Females who are 20-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals who engage in work that requires sitting at a desk or computer 25 or more&#xD;
             hours a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals who plan to work full time for each of the 3 weeks of the trial (April. 22&#xD;
             - May. 14, 2015), with no planned business travel or time off.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Individuals who can commit to attending two 1-1.5 hours data collection events&#xD;
             (appointments times from 4:30-8:30 pm): Either on: Wed. April 22, 2015 and Wed May 13,&#xD;
             2015 or Thurs. April 23, 2015 and Thurs. May 14, 2015 at a location on the west side&#xD;
             of Ann Arbor, MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Individuals who can read, write and understand English fluently. (Questionnaires are&#xD;
             in English)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Individuals who, while maintaining upright sitting, can lift their knee approximately&#xD;
             3-6 inches off the chair (as in marching), one at a time, on both sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Individuals who are willing to wear non-binding or flexible clothing around their hips&#xD;
             and pelvis at work during the three weeks of the trial if chosen to be in the&#xD;
             experimental group. Note: Because the posture device being studied tilts the user's&#xD;
             pelvis more upright, compared to the common slump / backward pelvic tilt that occurs&#xD;
             in sitting, some find, especially males , that this binds them in the front of their&#xD;
             pelvis and groin area when their clothing is tight or restrictive. Looser or flexible&#xD;
             clothing has significantly aided in tolerance of this positioning and will be&#xD;
             recommended if subject is chosen to be in the experimental group, assigned to use the&#xD;
             device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals who currently have pain radiating from low back into the legs below hips.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals with a history of low back surgery that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Spinal Fusion at any level&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of any plates or screws in the low back (Note: those with a history of&#xD;
                  back surgery &gt; 1 year ago that did not involve plates or screws and are not under&#xD;
                  medical restrictions associated with their back will be accepted.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals who have had any kind of lumbar surgery within the last calendar year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals with a currently painful coccyx area or a history of broken coccyx (or&#xD;
             tailbone) less than 1 year ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Individuals with a history of total hip replacement in the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Individuals with significantly limited and painful back backward bending.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Anyone with known lumbar anterolisthesis (or forward slippage of 1 vertebra on&#xD;
             another) &gt; grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Anyone believing they may be more than 2 months pregnant at the time of the study.&#xD;
