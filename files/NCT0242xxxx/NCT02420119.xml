    <textblock>
      Intravenous iron therapy is common and effective, with few side effects. Two formulations are&#xD;
      used, venofer or iron sucrose and ferrlecit, or ferric gluconate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between intravenous iron use and decrease in serum phosphorus and vitamin D&#xD;
      levels, with increased fractional excretion of phosphorus, has been observed with older iron&#xD;
      preparations, such as saccharated ferric oxide. However, hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia&#xD;
      have been reported with iron carboxymaltose, a newer iron formulation. There is no&#xD;
      information in the literature about phosphorus and vitamin D levels after treatment with&#xD;
      venofer or ferrlecit. We intend to check phosphorus and vitamin D serum levels in our&#xD;
      patients prior to and after treatment with these iron formulations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous iron replacement has become quite common in cases where oral iron therapy is&#xD;
      insufficient or poorly tolerated. Various intravenous iron preparations have been used in&#xD;
      patients on dialysis and with chronic kidney disease for many years, however, these patients&#xD;
      have severely reduced glomerular filtration rate and are generally hyperphosphatemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although generally safe, certain iron preparations have been associated with severe&#xD;
      phosphorus and calcitriol deficiency, caused by elevation in serum levels of fgf23, a&#xD;
      phosphaturic humoral factor derived from osteocytes. Fractional excretion of phosphorus is&#xD;
      indeed raised in these patients. In some cases phosphorus deficiency, or high fgf23 levels,&#xD;
      are so severe that osteomalacia can result . This phenomenon has been observed with&#xD;
      saccharated ferric oxide , a preparation commonly used in Japan, and in iron polymaltose . It&#xD;
      has also been observed with iron carboxymaltose , a newer iron preparation, now available in&#xD;
      Israel. These reports propose that iron causes elevated fgf23 levels, which in turn decreases&#xD;
      phosphorus absorption and inhibits 1Î±-hydroxylase activity. Patients with deficient vitamin D&#xD;
      have greater tendency to develop hypophosphatemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phenomenon of phosphorus deficiency has not been documented in the commonly used&#xD;
      preparations of iron sucrose (venofer) and ferric gluconate (ferrlecit). These non-dextran&#xD;
      iron preparations have a very low rate of allergic reactions and adverse events. They are&#xD;
      used in various cases of iron deficiency anemia with normal renal function, such as patients&#xD;
      with Inflammatory bowel disease , diabetics or in people who cannot tolerate oral iron&#xD;
      therapy. Moreover, certain oral iron preparations are under investigation at present for&#xD;
      their role as phosphorus binders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to measure phosphorus, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels&#xD;
      in patients prior to and after intravenous iron therapy in patients with iron deficiency&#xD;
      anemia with normal and reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate . We hypothesize that iron therapy&#xD;
      with ferric gluconate and iron sucrose will induce hypophosphatemia and low levels of 1,25&#xD;
      hydroxide Vit D. We will try to ascertain whether the hypophosphatemia is clinically&#xD;
      significant or merely a low laboratory value, and whether patients with vitamin 25 hydroxide&#xD;
      -D deficiency have a greater propensity to develop it.&#xD;
