  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since there is no cure for HIV, therefore antiretroviral therapy must be taken life-long.&#xD;
      Some of the HIV medications can negatively impact the health of the bone and is even more&#xD;
      exacerbated in perinatally HIV-injected children and adolescents because this is the period&#xD;
      when the bone peaks. Bone loss during this period can be devastating and increase the risk&#xD;
      for developing weak bones later in life. Supplementation of calcium and vitamin D have not&#xD;
      been well studied in HIV-infected children and adolescents in developing countries. Therefore&#xD;
      it is not clear whether higher doses of these supplementations can thwart the damages or not.&#xD;

      Adverse bone health is one of the major long-term complications among perinatally&#xD;
      HIV-infected children and adolescents receiving ART. Since a great deal of bone mineral&#xD;
      accrual occurs during the adolescent years and the peak attainment is usually seen at age 18&#xD;
      years, the loss of bone deposition during this period could lead to serious consequences,&#xD;
      particularly increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fragility in later of life. A previous&#xD;
      study demonstrated that prevalence of low BMD among perinatally HIV-infected Thai children&#xD;
      and adolescents was high (25%). However, the prevention strategies such as calcium and&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation which are widely recommended by many guidelines for preventing of&#xD;
      osteoporosis and bone fracture have not been well studied to prove their effectiveness among&#xD;
      HIV-infected children and adolescents, especially in resource-limited countries. This is&#xD;
      considered as the critical research question in pediatric HIV/AIDS field which are urgently&#xD;
      required robust and in-depth investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial study will provide important information about the effect of&#xD;
      calcium and high dose (comparing to normal dose) vitamin D supplementation on BMD among&#xD;
      ART-experienced, perinatally acquired HIV-infected children and adolescents to best&#xD;
      understand the relative contributions of the supplementation to improve bone health status.&#xD;
      This study will address research questions, fill gaps in knowledge, and draw clinician&#xD;
      attentions to the important long-term medical complications in children and adolescents who&#xD;
      are growing up with HIV. Moreover, this study will inform healthcare providers and policy&#xD;
      makers about the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation as one of the&#xD;
      measurement to prevent long-term deterioration of bone mass and the mean to promote bone&#xD;
      health among these populations.&#xD;

      The funding for this study is the National Research University, Chiang Mai University.&#xD;
