  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a clinical trial to determine whether more efficient medical and operational&#xD;
      outcomes can be achieved with using the new SpHb monitoring during triage in the emergency&#xD;
      room setting. The investigators also evaluate the accuracy of the measurements of the SpHb&#xD;
      device by Maximo versus the gold standard of central hospital laboratory value. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators will assess patient satisfaction with the tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major issue faced by emergency departments all over the world is overcrowding, resulting&#xD;
      from limited resources (i.e. staff, space, equipment) attending to a large of patients that&#xD;
      exceeds the physical and/or staffing capacity of the ED. To manage the issue of overcrowding,&#xD;
      the system of triage was created to help prioritize each patient's case, based on set&#xD;
      criteria to determine time to treatment and/or which treatment is indicated. Our study will&#xD;
      contribute to the discovery of more efficient ways of triaging patients based on objective&#xD;
      and subjective criteria for decision-making about treatment and disposition, while&#xD;
      simultaneously maintaining patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators achieve this aim by evaluating the efficiency of a noninvasive and&#xD;
      continuous total hemoglobin (SpHb) monitor provided by Masimo Corporation (Irvine USA).&#xD;
      Standard hemoglobin measurements via central laboratory testing are invasive, painful,&#xD;
      time-consuming, have increased lag time for analysis, potentially expose health care workers&#xD;
      to blood-borne illness, and delay treatment onset because they require direct blood sampling.&#xD;
      The new SpHb monitor potentially offers a new way to evaluate objective criteria about&#xD;
      patients to maximize treatment outcomes and appropriate dispositions. The SpHb monitor has&#xD;
      the potential to trend hemoglobin monitoring, quicken the detection of acute anemia, and&#xD;
      avoid the complications, anxiety, expense, and patient discomfort associated with invasive&#xD;
      blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ED setting, there is a need to efficiently triage a patient and designate a&#xD;
      disposition for appropriate treatment management and outcomes. Hemoglobin level is an&#xD;
      accurate indicator that helps distinguish patients who need early blood transfusion and meet&#xD;
      criteria for admission. Noninvasive technology, such as the SpHb device by Masimo, will&#xD;
      assist with common goals in emergency medicine: to efficiently and accurately decrease wait&#xD;
      times to treatment and disposition, screening patients who have difficult venous access,&#xD;
      providing repeated sampling without causing iatrogenic blood loss linked to anemia, and&#xD;
      offering an approach that may be used to develop an organized coherent therapeutic plan based&#xD;
      on physiologic criteria for the emergency patient as he/she proceeds from the ED to the OR,&#xD;
      the hospital general floor, and the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed at the University of Chicago Medical Center in the main adult&#xD;
      emergency room. Patients will be examined and enrolled into our study initially by the triage&#xD;
      nurse after each person has given his/her written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization process will be carried out based on days of the week. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in one group every two days. For example, starting on the week when we begin the&#xD;
      trial, we will assign Monday patients to the control group, Tuesday patients to the&#xD;
      experimental group, Wednesday patients to the control groupâ€¦ Two groups are similar in&#xD;
      characteristics. Depending on whether the subject has been randomized into the control or&#xD;
      experimental group, we will not use or use the SpHb monitor to obtain measurements. To obtain&#xD;
      measurements, we place the probe of the device on the patient's finger and record the&#xD;
      hemoglobin level determined by the Masimo Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect patient satisfaction data 2 minutes after the placement of the SpHb device&#xD;
      and 2 minutes after the blood sampling. The collection of blood is considered standard of&#xD;
      care. Along with recording hemoglobin measurements, we will record triage chief complaint,&#xD;
      final physician diagnosis, time to blood products transfusion, time to disposition (i.e.&#xD;
      discharge home or Hospital admission via intensive care unit or general floor), time to&#xD;
      procedure (i.e. procedure via operating room, endoscopy with interventional gastroenterology,&#xD;
      interventional pulmonology, or ENT, or interventional radiology), and hemodynamics (i.e.&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate).&#xD;
