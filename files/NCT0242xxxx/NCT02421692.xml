  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year Medicare spends approximately $31.3 billion on 2.4 million skilled nursing facility&#xD;
      (SNF) episodes of care. SNFs rely on interdisciplinary approaches to patient care to maximize&#xD;
      rehabilitation potential for return to prior level of function and reduce the risk of adverse&#xD;
      events in older adults. However despite a substantial increase in spending on SNF services&#xD;
      and minimal change in complexity of the caseload, 68% of patients are below their&#xD;
      pre-hospitalization level of function at discharge, 25% return to the community, and 18% are&#xD;
      hospitalized. This may be partially explained by current SNF approaches to patient care which&#xD;
      foster inactivity and participation in low intensity rehabilitation interventions&#xD;
      (preliminary data). Both inactivity and low-intensity interventions may perpetuate further&#xD;
      functional decline or impede maximal recovery. The serious implication of risk with&#xD;
      functional decline is exemplified by studies which have shown declines in physical function&#xD;
      can increase the risk of being re-hospitalized six-fold and may infer other long term effects&#xD;
      such as increased risk for mortality, morbidity, and institutionalization. Muscle weakness,&#xD;
      reduced cardiorespiratory reserve, and neuromuscular deficits have been attributed to this&#xD;
      acute decline in function. However current rehabilitation strategies in SNFs do not promote&#xD;
      adequate dose and mode of interventions to induce beneficial systemic adaptations, perhaps&#xD;
      due to the lack of evidence on effective rehabilitation protocols for this medically-complex&#xD;
      population. Therefore, the investigators have designed an rehabilitation program, which&#xD;
      uniquely integrates principles of physiologic tissue overload with strengthening and&#xD;
      functional interventions for greater gains in physical function. Data will be collected on&#xD;
      the first cohort of patients who cycle through a SNF during Stage 1, in which usual care&#xD;
      occurs (5 months). Then, staff training on progressive rehabilitation interventions will&#xD;
      occur over 2 months. Finally, data will be collected on a second cohort of patients who cycle&#xD;
      through a SNF during Stage 2, in which progressive rehabilitation is implemented by SNF staff&#xD;
      (5 months). Given the high turnover of patients in SNFs (average length of stay ~21 days), 2&#xD;
      different cohorts of patients will be studied and the analysis will consist of independent&#xD;
      2-sample t-tests. During Stage 1 and 2, measures of physical function will be assessed on all&#xD;
      eligible patients at admission and discharge from SNF. Therapists will be assessed on&#xD;
      adherence to the protocol through documentation audits and use of on-site observational&#xD;
      checklist. Acceptability of the intervention by the patients will be assessed by a patient&#xD;
      satisfaction survey. Any adverse events will be obtained from the medical record and&#xD;
      documented. The discharge location of all patients will be documented.&#xD;
