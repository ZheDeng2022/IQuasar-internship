      The Social ABCs is an innovative parent-mediated intervention for toddlers with confirmed or&#xD;
      suspected Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The intervention draws on what is known about core,&#xD;
      early emerging impairments in ASD, and on evidence-based Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) and&#xD;
      associated parent training programs for enhancing development in children with ASD.&#xD;
      Completion of a comprehensive pilot study set the stage for a randomized control trial (RCT)&#xD;
      of the Social ABCs. The purpose of this RCT is to evaluate the efficacy of the Social ABCs&#xD;
      intervention program on improving spoken language skills and positive parent-child emotion&#xD;
      sharing in toddlers with signs of or a diagnosis of ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With funding from Autism Speaks (2007-10), the investigators have developed and conducted a&#xD;
      pilot evaluation of an autism-specific intervention for toddlers with ASD. The Social ABCs,&#xD;
      developed by the investigators, is an innovative parent-mediated intervention for toddlers&#xD;
      with confirmed or suspected ASD. The Social ABCs draws on what is known about core, early&#xD;
      emerging impairments in ASD, on evidence-based Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) and&#xD;
      associated parent training programs for enhancing development in children with ASD, and on&#xD;
      the literature on effective parent training programs for at risk infants. The investigators&#xD;
      also draw on their demonstrated success implementing a province-wide PRT-based early&#xD;
      intervention program for preschoolers with ASD, and developing effective brief training in&#xD;
      PRT for parents of newly diagnosed children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social ABCs intervention incorporates the principles and procedures of Applied Behaviour&#xD;
      Analysis (ABA), represented in the natural language paradigm of PRT, supplemented by those of&#xD;
      Responsive Parenting. Targets of intervention focus on two areas of early impairment in ASD -&#xD;
      functional spoken language and positive parent-child emotion sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are collected from both parents and children. Measures of key targeted child behaviours&#xD;
      (i.e., vocal responsivity and initiations) and shared positive emotion are coded from videos&#xD;
      of child-parent play interactions recorded in the family home on 3 separate days at each of 3&#xD;
      time points: (1) study entry (Baseline/ pre-Training), (2) Post-Training (Week 12) and (3)&#xD;
      Follow-up (Week 24). For each time point, data coded from the videos of child-parent&#xD;
      interactions are averaged across 2 days to increase the probability that they are&#xD;
      representative of the key child targets and parent variables under study (i.e., that they do&#xD;
      not represent either a particularly &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide a strong test of generalization of child learning, the same measures of functional&#xD;
      behaviours are coded from videos of child-examiner play interactions recorded in the family&#xD;
      home on 2 separate days at Follow-up; this examiner is blind to treatment group, not trained&#xD;
      in PRT, and is unfamiliar to the child. Standardized child measures are collected at study&#xD;
      entry and Week 24. These include the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Autism&#xD;
      Observation Scale for Infants, Mullen Scales of Early Learning - AGS Edition, Preschool&#xD;
      Language Scale-4, and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2nd ed. Child and parent&#xD;
      questionnaires are also completed at these time points. For both the Treatment group and the&#xD;
      Control group, a Service Log is completed to record the services and interventions in which&#xD;
      the child is currently participating. This Service Log is updated throughout the duration of&#xD;
      the family's participation in our trial. A child and family's data is considered &quot;useable&quot; as&#xD;
      long as the child is enrolled in the study up to and including week 4. If a child and family&#xD;
      drop out of the study for any reason prior to their completion of week 4, we will not&#xD;
      consider their data to be useable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6-month Social ABCs parent-mediated intervention consists of 3 months of in-home live&#xD;
      parent coaching and a 3-month period during which the parent implements the strategies with&#xD;
      no further coaching. Parents implement the procedures in vivo, as they play with and follow&#xD;
      routines of daily life with their toddlers. Research Trainers train parents using positive&#xD;
      teaching procedures in which feedback and suggestions focus on parents' strengths (i.e.,&#xD;
      correct or close-to-correct implementation of the intervention procedures). The 3-month&#xD;
      parent training program consists of 8 consecutive weeks of &quot;Active Training&quot; followed by 4&#xD;
      consecutive weeks of &quot;Consultation and Refresher&quot;. During the 8-week &quot;Active Training&quot; phase,&#xD;
      individual 1.5-hour sessions are provided three times on separate days in Week 1, twice on&#xD;
      separate days in Week 2 and once in each of Weeks 3-8, for a total of 11 training sessions.&#xD;
      Parents are provided with written modules that form the Social ABC's Intervention Manual,&#xD;
      through which they are led by their Research Trainer. Each visit begins with a discussion of&#xD;
      the module and intervention targets. For the remainder of the session, parents implement the&#xD;
      procedures with their child, while receiving feedback (in vivo coaching) from their Trainer.&#xD;
      During the 4-week &quot;Consultation and Refresher&quot; phase (Weeks 9-12), parents are contacted&#xD;
      weekly by their Trainer via telephone/ email to trouble-shoot specific issues as needed, and&#xD;
      the Trainer makes 2 home visits (Weeks 10 and 12) in which additional video recordings of in&#xD;
      vivo coaching are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group, treatment is that typically provided by local services (e.g., visits&#xD;
      from a community early interventionist/speech and language pathologist; see Eligibility&#xD;
      Criteria). Upon completion of Week 24, the control group is offered the same intervention&#xD;
      received by the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) It is predicted that, relative to controls, toddlers in the Social ABC's (experimental)&#xD;
      treatment group will show greater post-training and follow-up changes in functional speech&#xD;
      (i.e., responsivity and initiations) and positive emotion sharing with their caregiver.&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: It is predicted that (1) parents in the treatment group will achieve fidelity&#xD;
      of implementation, and (2) the experimental group will also show greater gains than the&#xD;
      control group on standardized measures of receptive and expressive language. Exploratory&#xD;
      Aims: Investigators predict that (1) post-training and follow-up child gains in shared&#xD;
      positive emotion will be related to high levels of parental (facial) positive emotion, (2)&#xD;
      post-training and follow-up child gains in functional vocalizations will be a) moderated by&#xD;
      better receptive language at baseline, and b) related, in the experimental group, to parents'&#xD;
      fidelity of PRT implementation post-training.&#xD;

    <description>The 6-month Social ABCs parent-mediated intervention consists of 12 weeks of parent training and a 12 week implementation phase. 15 training (parent coaching) sessions are provided by a Research Trainer. Each session with the trainer includes a review of the program manual, practice of the techniques in the child's home, and a 15 min video of the parent-child dyad practicing the intervention. Week 9 and 11 are phone consultations. After the active training is complete, the parent enters the 12-week implementation phase, which includes practicing the techniques on their own, with no trainer instruction or contact. The trainer re-visits the parent and child at Week 24 to collect three 15 min videos; 2 generalization videos are also taken with an untrained examiner.</description>
