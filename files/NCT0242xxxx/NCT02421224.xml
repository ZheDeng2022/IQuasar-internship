    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial of several behavioral&#xD;
      interventions for smoking cessation among a sample of employees at large workplaces in the&#xD;
      Bangkok metropolitan area. The study aims to test the impacts of different incentive&#xD;
      structures for smoking cessation on take-up, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. The&#xD;
      interventions are designed to elucidate certain principles from the field of behavioral&#xD;
      economics.&#xD;
