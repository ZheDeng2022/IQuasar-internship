      The main objective of the study is to compare the clinical effects of the innovative&#xD;
      telerehabilitation approach (TELE group) compared to face-to-face visits to a clinic (CLINIC&#xD;
      group) for patients treated for a proximal humerus fracture.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Every year, one out of three elderly people make at least one fall, and 10% of them cause a&#xD;
      fracture. Of these fractures, those of the proximal humerus, the forearm and the wrist count&#xD;
      for approximately one third of total osteoporotic fractures in elderly people. Proximal&#xD;
      humerus fractures can be treated surgically (eg: pinning, plate and screws, etc..) or&#xD;
      conventionally by wearing a splint or a cast. Whether either of these approaches, the&#xD;
      individual requires rehabilitation to prevent function limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the possible reasons for the low use of rehabilitation services, there are 1) poor&#xD;
      availability of rehabilitation services for fractures of the humerus; or 2) the difficulty of&#xD;
      the elderly to travel to receive these services because of their precarious status.&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation is a promising alternative approach that can help improve access to&#xD;
      rehabilitation services once patients are discharged from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies demonstrate that physiotherapy is a significant factor in the process of healing&#xD;
      and functional recovery of a proximal humerus fracture, and that, for conservative or&#xD;
      surgical treatment. This is showed by the good recovery of patients and by their satisfaction&#xD;
      with the physiotherapy. In addition, since the majority of patients with a proximal humerus&#xD;
      fracture are elderly, it becomes relevant to find a new way to offer quick service&#xD;
      physiotherapy and simple and suitable to their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare the clinical effects of the innovative&#xD;
      telerehabilitation approach (TELE group) compared to face-to-face visits to a clinic (CLINIC&#xD;
      group) for patients treated for a proximal humerus fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TELE intervention will be as effective as CLINIC intervention to improve upper extremity&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TELE intervention will be as effective as CLINIC intervention to improve deficiencies of&#xD;
           the shoulder (increase range of motion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants who received the TELE intervention will be as satisfied of their care as&#xD;
           participants who received the CLINICL intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. TELE intervention will be less costly compared to the CLINIC intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study has a randomized control trial design. The study population of&#xD;
      interest is individuals who have had proximal humerus fracture and who receive a conservative&#xD;
      treatment at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) and who are returning&#xD;
      at home. Participants will be recruited during their visit at the emergency or outpatient&#xD;
      clinic by the medical team or research nurse assistant. The investigators expect to recruit&#xD;
      52 participants, that is to say 26 per group. All evaluations will be completed in the&#xD;
      research center/hospital and will be approximately 1.5 hour in duration. The first evaluation&#xD;
      will be conducted when medical team will ask for rehabilitation (T1) to allow participant&#xD;
      base measures to be collected. The other evaluation will be conducted immediately after the&#xD;
      2-month intervention (T2). The independent variable is conventional physiotherapy and&#xD;
      experimental intervention by telerehabilitation. The dependant variables are 1) upper&#xD;
      extremity function; 2) range of motion; 3) user satisfaction; 4) cost of services according&#xD;
      to the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platform used: In this study, a platform based on a technological infrastructure that was&#xD;
      developed and tested in previous telerehabilitation studies will be used. The infrastructure&#xD;
      combines a clinical information system with videoconference components (Tandberg 550 MXP, H&#xD;
      264) and uses cameras that are controlled by the clinician using computer software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between the two groups will then be compared using a t-test or a chi-square&#xD;
      test. The economic analysis will be a type of cost-effectiveness. The cost per unit of change&#xD;
      in the main dependent variable (Constant Score) will be determined for the two groups (TELE&#xD;
      and CONTROL) and the cost differential will be established.&#xD;

    <description>The training program will be carried out twice a day, and at every day during the eight-week program, either by telerehabilitation or in the clinic or by autonomous unsupervised way. During weeks 1, 3 and 5, the patient will perform his/her exercises twice a week by telerehabilitation/clinic and the other without supervision. During the other weeks (2, 4, 6, 7, 8), the patient will benefit from one exercise session by telerehabilitation/clinic per week and will perform all other without supervision. Supervised sessions allow the therapist and the patient to adjust the program in case of problems and to ensure a smooth implementation of the program.</description>
