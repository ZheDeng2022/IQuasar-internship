    <textblock>
      The INSPYRE implant is a new range of shoulder hemi-arthroplasty device. It consists of a&#xD;
      Pyrocarbon spherical interpositional implant and is indicated in primary surgery to relieve&#xD;
      severe pain or significant disability caused by degenerative pathologies. The rotator cuff&#xD;
      must be functional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively collect data from consecutive series to implement a&#xD;
      Post Marketing Surveillance plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative shoulder pathologies associated with a functional rotator cuff are currently&#xD;
      treated by hemi-arthroplasty or total prosthesis replacement. The choice of surgery process&#xD;
      is mainly made according to the status of the glenoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning hemi-arthroplasty, two types of humeral prosthesis are usually used: anatomical&#xD;
      stems or resurfacing head implants. Both provide good results. Nevertheless with these&#xD;
      prostheses, patient can present with post-operative pains due to glenoid erosion, linked to&#xD;
      the metallic compounds used in such a prostheses. To face this issue, it was decided to&#xD;
      modify the metallic compounds, and in order to mimic the tribological properties of the&#xD;
      cartilage, Pyrocarbon (PyC) was found to be the best material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First application of PyC in a medical device was for cardiac valves in 1969. Currently more&#xD;
      than 2 million people live with PyC cardiac valves. Mechanical and physical properties of PyC&#xD;
      are in favor of its use in orthopedic surgery; furthermore, its biocompatibility plays an&#xD;
      important role in its good acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As very good results were observed when used in hand and wrist, interposition PyC implant was&#xD;
      suggested for shoulder. Another advantage was that such interposition device allowed&#xD;
      performing less invasive surgery, a particularly important criteria for young patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSPYRE shoulder prosthesis was then designed as a shoulder interposition implant intended&#xD;
      for partial replacement of the gleno-humeral joint. This implant is inserted between the&#xD;
      glenoid cartilage and the humeral metaphyseal cavity. It is indicated in primary surgery to&#xD;
      relieve severe pain or significant disability caused by degenerative pathologies, e.g.,&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, primary and secondary&#xD;
      necrosis of the humeral head. The rotator cuff must be functional.&#xD;
