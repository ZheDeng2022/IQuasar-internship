  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For over ten years, the French group ASUR (ASthme aux URgences) has studied the asthmatic&#xD;
      disease. The first epidemiological study enrolling 3.772 patients, in 37 emergency services,&#xD;
      showed that the treatment protocols during the acute asthma attacks were not homogeneous and&#xD;
      that oral corticosteroids were prescribed in only 50% of the cases. The second major French&#xD;
      study in the emergency department by the same group enrolled 3.049 patients. The results&#xD;
      showed that 38% of patients have a new acute asthma relapse in the month following their&#xD;
      consultation in the emergency department. In the same study, a multivariate analysis of&#xD;
      predictors of relapse showed that there are controllable factors (absence of written&#xD;
      recommendations at discharge, only 50% of prescriptions for oral corticosteroids at discharge&#xD;
      from the emergency department, limited follow-up by a general practitioner (GP) or&#xD;
      pneumologist ...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergency physician has a responsibility in educating the patient during the period&#xD;
      between an acute asthma attack and return to the stability of long term therapy. To date, the&#xD;
      impact of patient education on the rate of further consultations in the emergency department&#xD;
      has not been proven, although it seems to be a positive trend on its effect. In France, half&#xD;
      of the patients coming to the emergency department for asthma attack will not be&#xD;
      hospitalized. More than a third will return to the ED within the first 30 days for a new&#xD;
      attack. The impact of post-interventional education on relapse should be explored. A first&#xD;
      major study on a strict formalized protocol designed to reduce the relapse rate is essential&#xD;
      and could allow a major improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to assess the impact of a strict formalized protocol of care of&#xD;
      asthmatic patients discharged from the Emergency Department on the recurrence rate of asthma&#xD;
      attacks, one month after an asthma attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefit for the patient is the short-term reduction of relapse after asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations, thus avoiding the problems of readmission. The strict formalized discharge&#xD;
      protocol would also improve education in terms of self-medication in this gray zone of&#xD;
      post-therapeutic monitoring. The benefit is even more important in terms of public health due&#xD;
      to the important prevalence of asthma in the world and in our country. The advantage of this&#xD;
      protocol is to strengthen the links between the hospital and the GPs. Education of asthmatic&#xD;
      patients is essential in reducing morbidity. Thus, the potential benefits of this protocol&#xD;
      are: reducing the cost of health and re-hospitalization, improved education of asthma&#xD;
      patients, strengthening their link with the required GP, decreased absenteeism usually&#xD;
      frequent in this type of disease in the workplace.&#xD;

      Main objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of a strict formalized protocol of care of asthmatic patients discharged&#xD;
      from the Emergency Department on the recurrence rate of asthma attacks, one month after an&#xD;
      asthma attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the impact of a strict formalized protocol on the rate of hospitalization one month&#xD;
      after discharge from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the rate of early recurrence of asthma attacks within the first 15 days after&#xD;
      discharge from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the control of the asthmatic disease at one month after discharge from the ED, by&#xD;
      using a recognized tool, the Asthma Control Test (ACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the compliance rate of the patients to the recommended therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence rate of any asthma attacks diagnosed by the GP or the ED doctor, one month after&#xD;
      discharge from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence rate of asthma attacks at 15 days +/-2 after discharge from the ED. Rate of&#xD;
      hospitalization within 30 days +/-2 after discharge from the ED Score to the asthma control&#xD;
      test (ACT) 30 days +/-2 after discharge from the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of patient's adherence to protocol: we will count the number of GINA (6) discharge&#xD;
      recommendations followed in both groups Percentage of patients having purchased a peak&#xD;
      expiratory flow meter at D30 +/-2 First day of contact with the general practitioner after&#xD;
      leaving the Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage of patients' follow-up by the general practitioner at D30 +/-2 Percentage of&#xD;
      patients using their peak expiratory flow meter at D30 +/-2. We will classify four categories&#xD;
      of use of PEF: daily, weekly, less than once a week, never.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage of patients self-medicating before calling the doctor Experimental plan&#xD;
      Multicenter, prospective, cluster-randomized, open study, enrolling a cohort of patients who&#xD;
      were managed in the emergency department for an acute asthma attack and who have no admission&#xD;
      criteria at the end of treatment. Forty-six Emergency Departments will be selected on the&#xD;
      national territory, randomized by cluster (centers A [control=standard group], centers B&#xD;
      [treatment group= strict formalized protocol] and stratified by size (number of patients per&#xD;
      year) and types [CHU, CHG, CHR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups of patients will be contacted by telephone at Day 15 +/-2, and Day 30 +/-2 of&#xD;
      discharge in order to identify a possible relapse, to collect the various elements of the&#xD;
      evolution of their disease as well as a to answer a formalized questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse is defined as a respiratory discomfort due to asthma and requiring medical assistance&#xD;
      (in the emergency department or with the GP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients needed: A sample size of N= 466 patients/group allow 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      30% relative difference in recurrences (i.e. from 25% to 17.5%) with a chi-square test and a&#xD;
      two-sided 5% significance level. Considering an attrition rate around 5% and that the study&#xD;
      is a cluster- randomized design, we applied a variance inflation factor equal to 1.5 (based&#xD;
      on previous studies) .&#xD;
