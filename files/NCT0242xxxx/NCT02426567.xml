  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence suggests that the gut microbiota and dietary influences are as important as&#xD;
      genetics in the aetiology of Crohn's disease (CD). We have recently shown that disease&#xD;
      improvement, following treatment with Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN), coincided with&#xD;
      changes in the gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purposes of this study are: a) to explore whether the gut microbiota changes we&#xD;
      observed in this previous study in children with CD during EEN are disease specific or not,&#xD;
      and b) to develop a novel food-based diet (Crohn's Disease TReatment-with-EATing/CD-TREAT&#xD;
      diet) which will induce changes to the metabolic activity and bacterial composition of the&#xD;
      gut microbiota of healthy people, similar to those seen on EEN, the first-line treatment for&#xD;
      active paediatric CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will produce high quality scientific evidence to move the CD-TREAT diet towards a&#xD;
      preliminary clinical trial in patients with CD which is currently inappropriate and unethical&#xD;
      to carry out in people with active CD undertaking contemporary medical treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, cross-over, dietary intervention trial. Healthy adult (&gt;18 y)&#xD;
      participants from the community will be recruited by means of an advertisement leaflet and&#xD;
      word of mouth. Eligible participants will be enrolled in the study. We will thank those&#xD;
      subjects who have expressed an interest about the study but are not suitable to participate&#xD;
      and we will explain to them why they need to be excluded. Those who are eligible and willing&#xD;
      to participate will be asked to undertake two different experimental diets, for seven days&#xD;
      each:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) which is the exclusive consumption of a milk-based&#xD;
           proprietary dietary supplement (Modulen®, Nestle). This is a liquid based diet used for&#xD;
           the management of children with active CD. Although this diet is used primary for&#xD;
           clinical reasons it is food based and does not contain any drugs or non-food based&#xD;
           pharmaceutical ingredients. It is available online and without prescription from&#xD;
           pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Crohn's Disease TReatment-with-EATing diet (CD-TREAT diet), an elimination customized&#xD;
           diet which will consist of ordinary food and which will resemble the food/nutrient&#xD;
           composition of EEN (e.g. fibre content, fatty acid composition) and considering evidence&#xD;
           that implicates certain nutrients, and food ingredients (e.g. meat, sugar) in the&#xD;
           aetiology and risk of relapse of CD. Diet will be created using the food group exchange&#xD;
           methodology and will be analysed using Windiets® 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both diets will have the same energy content and will be isocaloric aiming to keep&#xD;
      participants' weight stable during the study period. Their energy content will be tailored to&#xD;
      participants' total energy expenditure and physical activity level calculated by the WHO set&#xD;
      of equations. The order of the diets will be randomly allocated using an MS Excel command. In&#xD;
      order to minimize fatigue with the diet but also to ensure that we will be able to detect&#xD;
      changes in gut microbiota, experimental diets will be given for 7 days. This is based on&#xD;
      recent evidence suggesting that dietary changes for 5 days induce reproducible alterations in&#xD;
      gut microbiota composition and metabolism. Prior to the first diet intervention, participants&#xD;
      will also record their dietary intake using a 7-day estimated food diary. Between the two&#xD;
      interventions the participants will have to eat their habitual diet for two weeks and this&#xD;
      will be a wash out period which aims to drive the gut microbiota back to baseline levels. The&#xD;
      week prior to the initiation of the second intervention the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      keep the same dietary pattern as they had the week prior to the first trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Health Check: Participants will undertake a short health questionnaire including&#xD;
      basic health information, age or any medication on the day of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: All participants will have height and weight measured at baseline and only&#xD;
      weight measured in each sample collection timepoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet compliance: Over the course of the two experimental diets we will monitor compliance by&#xD;
      asking participants to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire will ask if they felt the&#xD;
      need to supplement the diets at any time with other foods or drinks. An interval call 2 days&#xD;
      after each diet's initiation will also be used to increase participants' motivation and&#xD;
      compliance on the diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection &amp; analysis: Fresh faecal and urine samples will be collected before and&#xD;
      after each dietary intervention (4 times in total) to assess and compare the impact of these&#xD;
      diets on gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab Assays:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The gut bacterial diversity and composition from stool samples will be measured using&#xD;
           molecular techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from bacterial&#xD;
           ribosomal DNA and next generation sequencing (metagenomics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A large number of different products from bacterial metabolism, such as short chain&#xD;
           fatty acids, sulphide, and ammonia will be measured using a range of techniques&#xD;
           including gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry&#xD;
           (GCMS)(metabolomics). Faecal pH, a marker of bacterial fermentation, will also be&#xD;
           measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: Fresh faecal and urine samples will be collected from 38 healthy&#xD;
      participants at 4 time points. Based on our previous in vivo work in children with CD this&#xD;
      would give us a power of 80% (p=0.05) to detect a mean concentration difference of 1.0 log&#xD;
      (SD:1.5) in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii between their habitual diet and EEN diet or the&#xD;
      CD-TREAT diet.&#xD;
