  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The large-scale phase IV study aims to verify the safety and efficacy of apatinib in patients&#xD;
      with advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma after failure of two&#xD;
      lines of chemotherapy. Apatinib initiated at a recommended dose of 850mg. However, the&#xD;
      starting dose was decided by investigator's choice based on patients' condition. Dose&#xD;
      interruption and dose reduction were allowed according to the product label. Treatment&#xD;
      continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or&#xD;
      at investigators' discretion. The primary endpoint was safety, which was assessed by&#xD;
      recording the incidence and severity of adverse events.&#xD;
