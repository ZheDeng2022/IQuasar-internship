    <textblock>
      A limited number of relatively contradictory studies have suggested that the development of&#xD;
      serious ototoxicity in children treated with cisplatin or, more rarely, carboplatin could be&#xD;
      partly related to genetic risk factors affecting detoxification enzymes and membrane&#xD;
      transporters of platinum derivatives. The objective of this study is therefore to identify&#xD;
      genetic variants associated with the development of platinum ototoxicity in patients treated&#xD;
      with cisplatin or carboplatin (minimum follow-up of 3 years) for one of the following&#xD;
      diseases: neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, retinoblastoma, malignant germ cell tumour,&#xD;
      osteosarcoma, high-risk or recurrent Wilms' tumour, non-parameningealrhabdomyosarcoma. A&#xD;
      total of 180 patients, corresponding to 60 cases with grade 3 or 4 ototoxicity and 120&#xD;
      controls with no signs of ototoxicity (separate complete audiograms for each ear) will be&#xD;
      included. A saliva sample will be used to obtain DNA for pharmacogenetic studies. The value&#xD;
      of this study will be to define a population at high risk of developing ototoxicity in order&#xD;
      to adapt treatment, or even develop preventive treatment of ototoxicity based on antioxidant&#xD;
      medications&#xD;

      -  Platinum derivatives and their toxicity Cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin are&#xD;
           major cytotoxic agents used in the treatment of many types of cancer. They exert their&#xD;
           cytotoxic action by forming DNA adducts. However, their structural differences confer&#xD;
           different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and especially different&#xD;
           toxicity profiles. Cisplatin induces a risk of nephrotoxicity at all ages, peripheral&#xD;
           neuropathy of the extremities in young adults and a risk of ototoxicity in children.&#xD;
           Carboplatin is essentially haematotoxic and sometimes ototoxic (especially at high&#xD;
           doses), while oxaliplatin is essentially neurotoxic. Ototoxicity is measured by&#xD;
           pure-tone audiometry and is scored from grade 0 to grade 4, where grades 3 and 4&#xD;
           correspond to severe ototoxicity, according to the Brock grading system, the reference&#xD;
           system for measuring ototoxicity at the time of treatment of these children and up until&#xD;
           the present time (Brock et al., 1991) (Peters et al., 2000). Ototoxicity limits the&#xD;
           cumulative dose of platinum derivatives in children. Cisplatin remains a major drug in&#xD;
           paediatric oncology (osteosarcoma, high-risk neuroblastoma, malignant germ cell tumours,&#xD;
           hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, other brain tumours). Cisplatin ototoxicity is fairly&#xD;
           frequent and can be very severe (more than 50% of grade 1 or higher ototoxicity; 15% of&#xD;
           grade 3 or 4 ototoxicity) (Bertolini et al., 2004). Carboplatin, an important component&#xD;
           of the treatment of many embryonal tumours (neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma,&#xD;
           retinoblastoma) is less frequently responsible for ototoxicity (between 1 and 5% of&#xD;
           grade 1 or higher ototoxicity), but can nevertheless occasionally cause serious&#xD;
           ototoxicity (1% of grade 4) (Jehanne et al., 2009). Ototoxicity can also appear and&#xD;
           deteriorate for several years after treatment (median time to discovery of carboplatin&#xD;
           ototoxicity: 3.7 years), while no cases of recovery of high-grade hearing loss have been&#xD;
           reported (Bertolini et al., 2004; Jehanne et al., 2009). These ototoxicity phenomena can&#xD;
           have very harmful consequences for the child's social development and schooling.&#xD;
           Oxaliplatin will be excluded from this study, as few children are currently treated with&#xD;
           this molecule, which is generally not ototoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detoxification of platinum derivatives The glutathione (GSH) conjugation pathway is&#xD;
           involved in detoxification of platinum derivatives and decreases their cytotoxicity by&#xD;
           inhibiting the formation of DNA adducts. Conjugation to GSH is ensured by&#xD;
           glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), which constitute a multigenic family of enzymes&#xD;
           involved in phase II metabolism that inactivate electrophilic molecules by conjugating&#xD;
           them to glutathione, thereby promoting their elimination. GSTP1 is particularly involved&#xD;
           in the conjugation of platinum derivatives. Elimination of glutathione conjugates then&#xD;
           involves membrane transporters. These conjugates can be expelled from target tumour&#xD;
           cells and then eliminated, essentially in the urine, by efflux membrane transporters,&#xD;
           particularly MRP2 (Sun et al., 2009). Two other enzymes, thiopurine S-methyltransferase&#xD;
           (TPMT) and catechol O-methyltransferase, have been reported to be associated with&#xD;
           increased toxicity of cisplatin when their activity is decreased (Ross et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic factors predisposing to or protecting against the toxicity of platinum&#xD;
           derivatives Several GST isoenzymes present polymorphisms modifying their activity. This&#xD;
           is the case for the GSTM1 and GSTT1 isoenzymes, which can undergo deletions responsible&#xD;
           for loss of activity of the enzyme, and GSTM3, for which the GSTM3*B allele has been&#xD;
           associated with induction of enzyme activity by cisplatin (Peters et al., 2000). An A/G&#xD;
           polymorphism situated in the substrate binding domain of the GSTP1 isoenzyme in position&#xD;
           +313 of exon 5 (A313G) induces substitution of a isoleucine by a valine (Ile105Val).&#xD;
           This polymorphism is relatively frequent (about 10% of homozygous mutants in Caucasian&#xD;
           populations). It influences the activity of the enzyme and has been associated with&#xD;
           better survival of patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy (Goekkurt et al.,&#xD;
           2006; Stoehlmacher et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2009). This polymorphism has also been&#xD;
           shown to influence the toxicity of platinum-based treatments. For example, one study&#xD;
           showed that the neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin was more frequent in subjects homozygous&#xD;
           for GSTP1 105Ile allele than in heterozygous subjects or subjects homozygous for the&#xD;
           GSTP1 105Val allele (odds ratio = 5.75). (Lecomte et al., 2006). This protective effect&#xD;
           of the mutant allele has also been demonstrated for docetaxel peripheral neuropathies&#xD;
           (odds ratio = 6.11) and cisplatin ototoxicity in testicular cancers in young men (Mir et&#xD;
           al., 2009; Oldenburg et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study conducted in children demonstrated an association between GSTM1 and GSTT1&#xD;
      polymorphisms (presence of at least one null genotype) and the development of grade 3 or&#xD;
      higher toxicity related to treatment of medulloblastoma. However, this study, based on a&#xD;
      small sample of children (42 children, 19 of whom experienced severe ototoxicity) and&#xD;
      comprising patients receiving very different treatments, was unable to determine the&#xD;
      proportion of toxicity specifically related to platinum derivatives, as some patients also&#xD;
      received brain irradiation. Furthermore, this association between GST polymorphisms and&#xD;
      toxicity was not observed when the analysis was specifically confined to grade 3 or higher&#xD;
      ototoxicity. Finally, the role of GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism has not been evaluated in&#xD;
      children (Barahmani et al., 2009). To our knowledge, only one study has specifically&#xD;
      evaluated the potential impact of GST polymorphism on cisplatin ototoxicity in children. This&#xD;
      study showed a protective effect of the GSTM3*B variant, but did not observe a protective&#xD;
      effect of the GSTP1 105Val allele with respect to ototoxicity, as demonstrated in adults for&#xD;
      neurotoxicity. However, these findings were based on small sample sizes (20 patients with&#xD;
      ototoxicity versus 19 patients without ototoxicity) and the ototoxicity experienced by these&#xD;
      patients was grade 2 (8 patients) or 3 (12 patients) with no cases of grade 4 ototoxicity&#xD;
      (Peters et al., 2000). The results of this study therefore need to be confirmed by a study&#xD;
      comprising a greater number of patients, cases and controls, including patients with more&#xD;
      severe ototoxicity. Ross et al., studying drug metabolism enzymes, demonstrated a highly&#xD;
      significant association between cisplatin ototoxicity in children and genetic variants of&#xD;
      TPMT (rs12201199, p = 0.00022, OR = 17.0) and COMT (rs9332377, p = 0.00018, OR = 5.5).&#xD;
      However, as the role of these enzymes in detoxification of platinum derivatives has not been&#xD;
      previously reported, these results need to be confirmed by other studies with, in particular,&#xD;
      matching for age, exclusion of cases of grade 2 ototoxicity from the group of severe&#xD;
      ototoxicity, and a greater number of control patients (Ross et al., 2009). Finally, no study&#xD;
      has investigated the genetic factors involved in carboplatin ototoxicity in children. One&#xD;
      study concerning membrane transporters showed that a common polymorphism situated in the&#xD;
      promoter region of the MRP2 (-24C&gt;T) transporter gene was associated with a better response&#xD;
      to platinum-based chemotherapy (allelic frequency: 18% of Caucasian) (Cascorbi, 2006; Sun et&#xD;
      al., 2009). It would be interesting to determine whether polymorphisms affecting this gene&#xD;
      can also modulate the toxicity of these treatments. A polymorphism of the gene coding for the&#xD;
      influx transporter OCT2 (c.808G&gt;T; p.270Ala&gt;Ser) has also been shown to be associated in vivo&#xD;
      and in vitro in mice with a protective effect in relation to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and&#xD;
      ototoxicity (Ciarimboli et al.; Filipski et al., 2009), but the potential influence of this&#xD;
      polymorphism on platinum ototoxicity has never been demonstrated in man. It therefore appears&#xD;
      very interesting to study the potential impact of this polymorphism in the context of our&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, all of these studies clearly confirm the hypothesis that genetic factors are&#xD;
      involved in the predisposition of some children to experience harmful ototoxic effects of&#xD;
      platinum derivatives, particularly cisplatin and carboplatin. These studies also suggest the&#xD;
      existence of good candidate gene variants likely to be associated with the development of&#xD;
      this ototoxicity. However, the results of most these studies have either not been reproduced&#xD;
      or remain controversial, indicating the need for confirmation studies based on larger sample&#xD;
      sizes and more homogeneous patient groups in terms of treatment, as in the Otoplat study.&#xD;
