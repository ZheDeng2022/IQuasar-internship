    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine whether digital games are effective and&#xD;
      acceptable in the treatment for patients with traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study using a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial with three arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted within the Turku University Hospital, Division of Clinical&#xD;
      Neurosciences (Operational Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Department of Rehabilitation&#xD;
      and Brain Trauma in collaboration with former neurology outpatient clinic and rehabilitation&#xD;
      units of the university hospital). The Division is specialized in demanding neurological and&#xD;
      psychiatric inpatient rehabilitation, inter-professional neurological education,&#xD;
      rehabilitative examinations, and the inpatient and outpatient care of traumatic brain&#xD;
      injuries. In each year, about 500 patients are admitted in the Division services units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment will be focused on patients who have been discharged from the Turku&#xD;
      University Hospital, Division of Clinical Neurosciences at least one year before the starting&#xD;
      day of the recruitment process. Based on the previous literature, using games in longer&#xD;
      interventions will be facilitated if training is provided in the persons' home, due to easier&#xD;
      access and reduced impact on school or work activities (Burbea et al. 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation and patient allocation will be fully centralized; we will use a central&#xD;
      randomization service by the University of Turku. The randomization will be targeted on&#xD;
      patients who have been hospitalized in Turku University Hospital and who are registered in&#xD;
      the Hospital electronic medical records. The study will be individually randomized.&#xD;
      Allocation will be computer generated. The participants will be randomly assigned in numbers&#xD;
      via computerized assignment developed by the independent Trial Statistician and implemented&#xD;
      by the Research Assistant who are trained for patient randomization and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and the investigators enrolling the patient recruitment and randomization will&#xD;
      not foresee assignment. Allocation will be masked to participants in two intervention groups;&#xD;
      participants will be aware about the gaming intervention, but not which one is the&#xD;
      experimental and which is the comparator. Investigators will not be masked to group&#xD;
      allocation, while data analysts (outcome assessor) will be kept blinded to the allocation. As&#xD;
      far as we are aware, there will be no contact between participants in different groups;&#xD;
      participants are living in wide geographic area in the catchment area of Southwest Hospital&#xD;
      District.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To capture a representative sample of patients, the Turku University Hospital electronic&#xD;
      medical records will be used. The medical records will be accessed by the authority of the&#xD;
      Chief medical doctor of the Hospital and screened by the Research Assistant. All patients&#xD;
      with TBI diagnosis will be screened to find out patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      for the study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be contacted with the telephone call&#xD;
      by the Research Assistant. A preliminary description of the study will be offered and the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for the study will be described to them. The participants are able to&#xD;
      answer whether they fulfill the specific inclusion criteria and their preliminary interest&#xD;
      toward the study will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who fulfill the inclusion criteria and are willing to participate in the study, will&#xD;
      receive postal information of the study, two items of informed consent forms, questionnaires&#xD;
      to be filled at home (baseline data), and a short description of eight entertainment games to&#xD;
      be used (if allocated into the control group). Further, possible participants are aware that&#xD;
      after 1-2 weeks they will receive another call from the Research Assistant. This will ensure&#xD;
      that possible participants have enough time to read all material, ask questions, and make&#xD;
      their decision whether to participate in the study or not (and what type of game they would&#xD;
      like to play if allocated into the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second telephone call, those who are willing to participate in the study will get&#xD;
      information about practical arrangement of the study and the place of the data collection.&#xD;
      They are also informed that all travel costs will be covered and that the time for&#xD;
      face-to-face meeting may take totally 1-1.5 hours. Participants are also aware that they are&#xD;
      free to withdraw from the study at any time. At the end of the telephone call, a specific&#xD;
      time for the face-to-face meeting with the Research Assistant will be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the face-to-face meeting at the University of Turku, it will be ensured that&#xD;
      participants will fulfill the inclusion criteria. If a patient fulfills the criteria, a&#xD;
      signed written informed consent will be returned/obtained. Should a person consent, their&#xD;
      pre-filled baseline data will be gathered. The Research Assistant will receive this&#xD;
      information by email, text message or telephone call. Cognitive measurement will be also&#xD;
      conducted by the psychologist. After that eligible patients will be informed to Trial Manager&#xD;
      who allocates patients in one of the three arms of the trial based on computer generated&#xD;
      randomization list (intervention vs. control group vs. &quot;As-usual&quot;). Recruitment will continue&#xD;
      until the required data has been received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to participate 80 % (refusal rate 20 %)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will expect that more than 75% of the prescheduled measurements would be performed&#xD;
           (adherence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less than 25 % of participants would drop out due to any reason (adherence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The acceptability of the game use would be at least 95% (in intervention and control&#xD;
           groups) (adherence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usability evaluation for the gaming system would be at least 80% (1 item; dichotomous&#xD;
           scale yes/no) (usability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More than 80% will be satisfied with the games (1 item; dichotomous scale, yes/no)&#xD;
           (satisfaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will expect that 60% are willing to use the games later as part of their recovery&#xD;
           process (use in the future)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculations for sample size needed in each group are preliminary estimations to guide&#xD;
      our data collection. This has been performed with two outcome variables used in this study:&#xD;
      a) TMT version A (Lezak et al. 2004) and b) depression (PHQ-9, Kroenke et al. 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Let's assume that the average level of the TMT version A score is about 71 and the mean&#xD;
           change in the scores during the follow-up is 30. Let's assume that the standard&#xD;
           deviation of the TMT scores is 53. This difference could be expected to be significant&#xD;
           (with power 85% on significant level 0.05) if the sample size in each group is 30&#xD;
           subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Let's assume that the average level of the PHQ-9 score is about 10 and the mean change&#xD;
           in the scores during the follow-up is 3. Let's assume that the standard deviation of&#xD;
           PHQ-9 scores is 5. This difference could be expected to be significant (with power 85%&#xD;
           on significant level 0.05) if the sample size in each group is 27 subjects. Conclusion:&#xD;
           Based on these preliminary power calculations, sample size to be used in this study&#xD;
           (30/a group) will be quite sufficient to detect significant within-group changes between&#xD;
           baseline and follow-up in the outcome measures. However, this means that the attrition&#xD;
           rate of the study should be near 0 %. The outcomes of this feasibility study can be used&#xD;
           as a guide to estimate a sample size for our future study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative monitoring data during the 8-week period regarding gaming for the total number&#xD;
      of received parameters (frequency, timing, time) will be calculated. Information available&#xD;
      for each patient will also be calculated (participation/refusal rate, measurement instrument&#xD;
      filled, drop-outs, acceptability, usability, satisfaction, willingness) and compared to the&#xD;
      highest possible representative numbers (100 % of participation rate; measurement instrument&#xD;
      filled, drop-out rate 0 %, acceptability 100 %, usability 100%, satisfaction 100%,&#xD;
      willingness to use games in the future 100 %).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary outcomes, all the participants will be analysed at the baseline, after 8&#xD;
      weeks when the intervention has been finalised, and 2 months, on all the scales as described&#xD;
      earlier. Paired t-tests or Chi square tests will be performed to detect significant&#xD;
      differences before and following treatment in one group. Significant differences between&#xD;
      groups will be evaluated applying the unpaired Student's t-test using the conventional 95 %&#xD;
      level of confidence. In all tests, p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.&#xD;
