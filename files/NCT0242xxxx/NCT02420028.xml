  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to assess the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the OptiVein IV Catheter in an oncology population. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that OptiVein IV Catheter use will be superior to the control in successful venous access&#xD;
      after first attempt.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OptiVein IV Catheter is a sterile single use disposable intravascular cannulation device&#xD;
      that is modified from CE certified Vasofix Certo Catheter from B.Braun with the additional&#xD;
      features of an optical fiber and modified flashplug. The OptiVein System also includes an&#xD;
      electronic unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study control and predicate device is the Vasofix Certo IV Catheter from B. Braun Medical&#xD;
      Inc. This device is the base device for the OptiVein IV Catheter to which is added the&#xD;
      optical fiber and electronic unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OptiVein Catheter shares a similar intended use and the same catheter components as the&#xD;
      Vasofix Certo IV Catheter. Clinical data will be obtained to assess if there is a change to&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy profile due to the laser component of the OptiVein IV Catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population consists of Oncologic patients who have either difficult to access veins&#xD;
      or who have experienced an unsuccessful IV start during their previous visit to the hospital,&#xD;
      requiring short-term use of an IV catheter to administer chemotherapy medications&#xD;
      intravenously. Subjects may be enrolled multiple times, with each patient-visit being the&#xD;
      unit of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint is successful IV insertion on the first attempt, defined as&#xD;
      placement of the catheter inside the vein allowing for fluid or drug delivery or blood&#xD;
      withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      167 and 167 patient-visits will be included in OptiVein or Vasofix Certo respectively (1:1&#xD;
      randomization), resulting in a total sample size of 334 visits. This sample size will provide&#xD;
      80% power to demonstrate the superiority of the OptiVein Catheter to the Vasifix Certo&#xD;
      Catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total number of attempts required for successful IV insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time to successful IV insertion, defined as time from the first skin puncture to&#xD;
           placement of the catheter inside the vein allowing for fluid or drug delivery or blood&#xD;
           withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of blood extravasation resulting in a hematoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of fluid extravasation delivered through catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Incidence of infection (phlebitis, dermatitis and induration) at insertion site through&#xD;
           72 hours or at the time of catheter removal, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Unplanned withdrawal of IV catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Overall complication rate composed from #3-6 above&#xD;
