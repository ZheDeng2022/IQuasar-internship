  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 dose regimens of&#xD;
      imetelstat in participants with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) whose disease&#xD;
      is relapsed after or is refractory to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment. Key secondary&#xD;
      endpoint includes overall survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), multicenter (more&#xD;
      than one hospital, medical school team or medical clinic work on a medical research study)&#xD;
      study of 2 dosing regimens (treatment arms) of single-agent imetelstat in participants with&#xD;
      intermediate-2 or high risk myelofibrosis (MF) whose disease is relapsed after or refractory&#xD;
      to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment. The main study consists of 3 parts: Screening&#xD;
      Phase (21 days before randomization); Treatment Phase (from randomization until study drug&#xD;
      discontinuation); and Follow up Phase (until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent&#xD;
      or study end, whichever occurs first). Participants received imetelstat 9.4 milligram&#xD;
      (mg)/kilogram (kg) intravenously (IV) for every 3 weeks until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or study end OR imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg IV for every 3 weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. Initially, all participants were&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment. After the first interim analysis, treatment for all participants&#xD;
      was unblinded and participants assigned to the imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg arm could continue with&#xD;
      their same imetelstat dose or have it increased to 9.4 mg/kg at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion. The percentage of spleen response and symptom response were evaluated as&#xD;
      co-primary endpoints. Following completion of the primary analysis, participants benefiting&#xD;
      from study treatment could continue to receive imetelstat in Extension phase for up to 2&#xD;
      years or until loss of benefit or unacceptable toxicity. Participants who had already stopped&#xD;
      study treatment could enter the Extension phase to continue follow up for safety via serious&#xD;
      adverse event collection and for survival status.&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized health-related quality of life questionnaire developed by EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and VAS. EQ-5D health state profile comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. The 5D-5L systems are converted into a single index utility score between 0 to 1, where higher score indicates a better health state. EQ-5D-5L- VAS is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at 55 investigative sites in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Korea, Spain, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States from August 28, 2015, to 25 October 2016. Data analyses include all data through the data cut-off date February 07, 2020.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 107 participants with Intermediate-2 or High-Risk Myelofibrosis (MF) Relapsed/Refractory to Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitor were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms into 1:1 ratio to imetelstat 4.7 or imetelstat 9.4 mg/kg of body weight. Eligible participants were stratified based on a) spleen size ≥ 15 cm below the left costal margin by palpation (yes vs. no) and b) platelet count at study entry (platelets ≥75 x 10^9/L [Per Liter] and &lt;150 x 10^9L vs. ≥150 x 10^9L).</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg</title>
          <description>Participants received imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg of body weight as intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. After the first interim analysis, treatment for all participants was unblinded and participants assigned to the imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg arm could continue with their same imetelstat dose or have it increased to 9.4 mg/kg at the investigator's discretion. After the end of main study, participants who were receiving benefit from study treatment opted to continue to receive imetelstat during the Extension Phase until there is loss of benefit or unacceptable toxicity. (Maximum duration on study was approximately 2.3 years and Maximum duration on extension phase was approximately 1.8 years).</description>

          <description>Participants received imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg of body weight as intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. After the first interim analysis, treatment for all participants was unblinded and participants assigned to the imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg arm could continue with their same imetelstat dose or have it increased to 9.4 mg/kg at the investigator's discretion. After the end of main study, participants who were receiving benefit from study treatment opted to continue to receive imetelstat during the Extension Phase until there is loss of benefit or unacceptable toxicity. (Maximum duration on study was approximately 2.3 years and Maximum duration on extension phase was approximately 1.8 years).</description>

Spleen response: a baseline splenomegaly that is palpable at 5-10 cm, below the left costal margin (LCM), becomes not palpable or a baseline splenomegaly that is palpable at &gt;10 cm, below the LCM, decreases by ≥50%; A spleen response requires confirmation by MRI showing &gt;35% spleen volume reduction (SVR). For response categories, benefit must last for &gt;12 weeks to qualify as a response. Participants who achieved CI per modified IWG-MRT criteria considered as response with clinical improvement. Participants who met criteria for spleen response but had worsening cytopenias (and therefore did not meet criteria for clinical improvement) were considered to have a response without clinical improvement.

        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized health-related quality of life questionnaire developed by EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and VAS. EQ-5D health state profile comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. The 5D-5L systems are converted into a single index utility score between 0 to 1, where higher score indicates a better health state. EQ-5D-5L- VAS is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state.</description>

          <description>The BPI rates the intensity of pain on 4 items (right now, worst, least, and average), and the interference in 7 areas (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations, sleep, enjoyment of life). Minimum value = 0; maximum value = 10. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity/worse outcomes. Clinically meaningful improvement in BPI defined as change greater than half of the standard deviation at baseline.</description>
          <population>Treated analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Here, &quot;overall number of participants analyzed&quot; signifies participants who had data at both baseline and end of treatment and &quot;Number analyzed&quot; signifies the number of participants with data available for each specified category.</population>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participants administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs were AEs with onset during or after the first dose of study drug, and within 30 days following the last dose of study drug.</description>

            <description>Participants received imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg of body weight as intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. After the first interim analysis, treatment for all participants was unblinded and participants assigned to the imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg arm could continue with their same imetelstat dose or have it increased to 9.4 mg/kg at the investigator's discretion. After the end of main study, participants who were receiving benefit from study treatment opted to continue to receive imetelstat during the Extension Phase until there is loss of benefit or unacceptable toxicity. (Maximum duration on study was approximately 2.3 years and Maximum duration on extension phase was approximately 1.8 years).</description>

After the first interim analysis, treatment for all participants was unblinded and participants assigned to the imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg arm could continue with their same imetelstat dose. After the end of main study, participants who were receiving benefit from study treatment opted to continue to receive imetelstat during the Extension Phase until there is loss of benefit or unacceptable toxicity.
