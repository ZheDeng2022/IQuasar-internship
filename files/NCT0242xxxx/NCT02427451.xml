    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the best dose and safety of Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 in&#xD;
      combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has returned (relapsed), does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory), or is previously untreated. Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 and ibrutinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by&#xD;
      targeting certain cells. Giving Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 together with obinutuzumab and&#xD;
      ibrutinib may be a better treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the dose of venetoclax (Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199) that can be safely&#xD;
      administered in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib for the treatment of&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of venetoclax in combination with&#xD;
      obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response (CR) rate&#xD;
      after 12 cycles of treatment with venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CR) of venetoclax&#xD;
      in combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or&#xD;
      previously untreated patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) after treatment with venetoclax in&#xD;
      combination with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or&#xD;
      previously untreated patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To conduct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of venetoclax in combination with&#xD;
      obinutuzumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated&#xD;
      patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine pre-treatment and serial biomarkers associated with response and mechanisms of&#xD;
      resistance to venetoclax, obinutuzumab and ibrutinib when given in combination for&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory or previously untreated patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of Bcl-2 inhibitor GDC-0199 followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 (days 1, 2, 8, and 15 for course 1&#xD;
      only) every 28 days for up to 8 courses. Beginning in course 2, patients receive ibrutinib&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Beginning in course 3, patients receive Bcl-2&#xD;
      inhibitor GDC-0199 PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 14 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 weeks, every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
