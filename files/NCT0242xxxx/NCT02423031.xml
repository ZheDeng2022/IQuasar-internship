      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Medical problems and treatments can cause stress in some people. Researchers want to learn&#xD;
      more about how to measure distress in young people with medical illnesses. A screening tool&#xD;
      called Checking In will be developed in order to help researchers find ways to identify&#xD;
      concerns and stresses common to this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To create a screening tool that will help health care providers identify psychological and&#xD;
      social distress in young people with serious illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Outpatient youth ages 8 21 who are enrolled on a research protocol at the NIH at the time&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 participants will complete a paper-and-pencil version of Checking In. It asks&#xD;
           about mood, pain, fatigue, peer relationships, and sleep. During this phase,&#xD;
           participants will be asked about the wording of the questions in Checking In. They will&#xD;
           also talk about what they thought of the questions and if they understood them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 will not involve participant enrollment. During this phase the researchers will&#xD;
           be working with technologists to develop the software for an electronic version of&#xD;
           Checking In.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3 participants will complete an electronic version of Checking In. Researchers&#xD;
           will ask questions about the ease or difficulty of using an electronic screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 4 participants and one of their caregivers will complete an electronic version of&#xD;
           Checking In. They will also complete other questionnaires related to mood, pain fatigue,&#xD;
           peer relationships and sleep. They will be asked their thoughts about using Checking In.&#xD;
           On the same day, their NIH doctor will get summary data about their questionnaire&#xD;
           answers. The doctor will also provide feedback about the summary form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will compare data from Checking In with data from the other questionnaires.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to develop and implement Checking In, a brief and interactive&#xD;
      screening measure of distress, designed to identify emotional, physical, social, practical&#xD;
      and spiritual concerns of pediatric patients. An accompanying provider summary sheet that&#xD;
      delineates patient report of distress, will allow providers to triage services to patients&#xD;
      and their families, thereby enhancing patient quality of life throughout the treatment&#xD;
      trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: The primary objective of this protocol is to develop a brief electronic&#xD;
      screening tool, Checking In, which would assist clinicians in assessing the presence of&#xD;
      psychological distress in children and adolescents with cancer and other serious medical&#xD;
      illnesses. In order to accomplish this aim, the researchers will conduct cognitive interviews&#xD;
      with 60 pediatric patients in order to refine the questions and phrasing of items on Checking&#xD;
      In. The results from this phase of the study of will be used to develop the electronic&#xD;
      screen, which will be used to accomplish the remaining aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To assess the feasibility of administering Checking In to pediatric patients and&#xD;
      their caregivers. Researchers who administer Checking In will complete a brief questionnaire&#xD;
      rating the feasibility of administration and all barriers encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To assess the feasibility of completing the Checking In screening tool among&#xD;
      pediatric patients with cancer and other serious illnesses and their caregivers. This aim&#xD;
      will be achieved by having the patients and their caregivers answer a brief questionnaire&#xD;
      that assesses how feasible and acceptable they found Checking In to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: To establish the utility of the Checking In summary report. Providers will&#xD;
      complete a survey evaluating the usefulness of the summary report to indicate whether: 1) the&#xD;
      report provided useful information, 2) the information was presented in a userfriendly&#xD;
      manner, and 3) the summary report impacted care planning for the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 5: To assess the concurrent validity (i.e. the extent to which a test correlates&#xD;
      with other previously validated measures of similar constructs) of Checking In as compared to&#xD;
      validated measures of psychological symptoms (i.e. depression, anxiety, pain and fatigue) in&#xD;
      patients with pediatric cancer, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) or Primary Immune Deficiencies&#xD;
      (PIDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 1: To compare patient and caregiver ratings of Checking In in order to&#xD;
      determine agreement rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatients, ages 8-21, enrolled in a research study either at the Pediatric Clinic or the&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the NIH with a diagnosis of pediatric cancer, NF-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      LiFraumeni or PIDs will be invited to participate in this study. Additionally, outpatients&#xD;
&#xD;
      ages 8-21, receiving active cancer treatment or follow-up at Johns Hopkins, Children s&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital Colorado, or Levine Children s Hospital will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial phase of this study will consist of the researchers conducting cognitive&#xD;
      interviews with 60 patients in order to refine the questions and phrasing of items on&#xD;
      Checking In. Preliminary questions for Checking In were derived and modified from the PI s&#xD;
      previous protocol on the Distress Thermometer. During this first phase, a paper and pencil&#xD;
      version of Checking In will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this initial phase will be used in phase 2 to develop the electronic version of&#xD;
      Checking In. A bid will be conducted through the NIH to hire a technology development group&#xD;
      who will build the Checking In application. This will include the interface development,&#xD;
      graphics, and ability for the application to generate a printout summary report.&#xD;
      De-identified data from both phase 1 and the physician survey will be utilized to guide the&#xD;
      application development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase 3, the electronic version of Checking In will be pilot tested and assessed for&#xD;
      feasibility. Sixty quartets, including the patient, parent/caregiver, health care provider&#xD;
      and associated staff member will be interviewed for this phase. Patients and their&#xD;
      parent/caregiver will be given a tablet and asked to complete Checking In. They will then be&#xD;
      asked to complete questionnaires assessing the feasibility of the interface of the Checking&#xD;
      In application as well as it s content. A researcher who is present to ensure that the&#xD;
      application runs smoothly and that the interface is feasible will also complete a feasibility&#xD;
      questionnaire evaluating the interface. Health care providers will be given the associated&#xD;
      summary reports and asked to complete a questionnaire assessing the report content and layout&#xD;
      as well as impact on patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the electronic version of Checking In is finalized, researchers will begin phase 4 of&#xD;
      the study. During phase 4, each patient will complete a brief electronic self-report distress&#xD;
      scale, Checking In, and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, and peer relationships, as well as an evidence-based questionnaire for&#xD;
      self-harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary caregivers will rate their child s level of distress using Checking In, as well as&#xD;
      complete measures assessing their child s depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, suicide risk and peer relationships&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both patients and primary caregivers will assess the feasibility of completing Checking In.&#xD;
      Medical providers will rate the usefulness of the Checking In summary report, as well as&#xD;
      provide a performance rating of the patient using Lansky/Karnofsky Performance status scores.&#xD;
      Additionally, data collectors will assess the feasibility of administering Checking In in a&#xD;
      pediatric outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures include Checking In; Phase 3 Feasibility Questionnaires, Phase 4 PROMIS measures of&#xD;
      Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, Sleep Disturbance, Self Harm&#xD;
      (evidence-based questionnaire) and Peer Relationships; and an Feasibility scale for&#xD;
      completion of Checking In. Self- harm and suicide risk questions will only be asked to&#xD;
      patients 10 and older.&#xD;
