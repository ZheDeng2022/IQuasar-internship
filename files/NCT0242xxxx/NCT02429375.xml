  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how safe and effective treatment with a new&#xD;
      combination of drugs, mocetinostat and brentuximab vedotin, is in treating cancer. There will&#xD;
      be 2 parts to this trial: a phase I part and a phase II part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brentuximab vedotin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be given to&#xD;
      patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma. Mocetinostat is an experimental drug that has been given to&#xD;
      patients with Hodgkin lymphoma in another clinical trial. When given alone, mocetinostat&#xD;
      caused lymphoma to shrink in about 1 out of 4 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. This is the&#xD;
      first study that will give mocetinostat and brentuximab vedotin together.&#xD;

    <description>For this objective the standard 3+3 dose-escalation scheme will be used. Patients will be accrued to the study in cohorts of 3 (starting with dose level 1). For any given dose an initial cohort of 3 patients will be treated at that dose. The dose level will be escalated if none of the 3 patients exhibits any DLT</description>

    <description>Patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma will receive brentuximab vedotin combined with mocetinostat. For the phase I portion of the study, patients will be enrolled in a traditional 3 + 3 phase 1 design on sequential dosing cohorts in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mocetinostat when given with brentuximab vedotin. Once the MTD is determined, (up to) an additional 26 patients will be enrolled on to the phase II portion of the study at the MTD to determine the response rate and toxicity associated with treatment. The phase Ib and II study will include a lead-in with mocetinostat alone for 1 week followed by the combined treatment beginning day 15 following initiation of mocetinostat.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive a 1-week lead-in with mocetinostat alone (administered days 1, 3, and 5). Patients with palpable peripheral lymph nodes will undergo FNA before and after this 1 week treatment. Cycle 1 will then begin 15 days (+/-3 days) following initiation of the lead-in.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed CD30 positive relapsed or refractory&#xD;
             Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed autologous stem cell transplant or at least 2 prior&#xD;
             cytotoxic regimens for Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients who have failed only 1 prior&#xD;
             cytotoxic regimen for Hodgkin lymphoma are permitted to enroll as long as they are not&#xD;
             eligible for autologous stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;

             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of mocetinostat and brentuximab vedotin administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known cerebral or meningeal involvement by lymphoma are excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to mocetinostat or brentuximab vedotin.&#xD;
