      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of self-management support,&#xD;
      pain science education, and individualized, goal-oriented exercises helps people with chronic&#xD;
      pain to increase their function.&#xD;

      Primary objective: This study will test the hypothesis that participants with chronic pain&#xD;
      experience greater change in function with ChrOnic pain self-ManageMent support with pain&#xD;
      science EducatioN and exerCisE (COMMENCE) in comparison to a wait-list control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective #1: This study will test the hypotheses that people with chronic pain&#xD;
      experience greater change in pain intensity, pain interference, self-efficacy, catastrophic&#xD;
      thinking, fear of movement/re-injury, pain neurophysiology knowledge, how much participants&#xD;
      are bothered by difficulty with functional activities, fatigue, depressive symptoms, health&#xD;
      care utilization and work status with COMMENCE in comparison to a wait-list control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective #2: This study will identify demographic, psychological, or&#xD;
      psychophysical variables that are predictive of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study will be a randomized trial with parallel groups, a wait-list control and&#xD;
      balanced randomization. A cross-over will take place after a 12-week follow-up assessment&#xD;
      (ie. the group initially receiving treatment will receive no treatment and the group&#xD;
      initially on the wait-list will receive treatment for 6 weeks). The between group comparison&#xD;
      will be performed using only the data up to the 12-week follow-up due to anticipated&#xD;
      carry-over effects with self-management support. Data collected after the cross-over will be&#xD;
      used to help identify factors that predict response to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Due to the nature of the treatment and comparison, participants and the treating&#xD;
      physiotherapist will not be blinded. The assessor who is completing the two objective&#xD;
      measures will be blind to the treatment allocation. Data analysis will be performed by&#xD;
      someone who is not blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: 110 participants with chronic pain will be recruited at Woodstock and Area Community&#xD;
      Health Centre (WACHC) in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada. WACHC has an interdisciplinary team of&#xD;
      health care providers that provide care to priority populations in Oxford County, Ontario,&#xD;
      Canada. The priority populations include people with the following barriers to accessing&#xD;
      health care: addictions concerns, mental health challenges, low incomes, lack of health&#xD;
      insurance, and isolated seniors. The investigators expect this sample to represent a&#xD;
      marginalized population of people with chronic often excluded from chronic pain treatment and&#xD;
      research by barriers to accessing health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The sample size necessary for a randomized controlled trial with three repeated&#xD;
      measures at 0, 7 and 18 weeks was calculated using online sample size software (GLIMMPSE&#xD;
      2.0). The calculation was performed using a significance level of 0.05, a power of 0.8, a&#xD;
      minimum detectable mean difference between groups of 10 points on the Short Musculoskeletal&#xD;
      Function Assessment Dysfunction Index (SMFA-DI) at both 7 weeks and 18 weeks, and a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 23 points on the SMFA-DI based on clinical data at WACHC. The needed sample size&#xD;
      calculated was 88 participants. To account for a potential 20% drop-out rate, 110&#xD;
      participants will be recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation: The allocation sequence will be generated by a study investigator who is not&#xD;
      involved in the enrolment of participants or assigning interventions. A computer-generated&#xD;
      blocked random number schedule will be used to determine allocation sequence. The block size&#xD;
      will be unknown to the other study investigators. The allocation sequence will be concealed&#xD;
      through the use of sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes, opened after the initial&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-intervention: Participants will be free to continue with other treatments. Other&#xD;
      treatments will be recorded through self-report at each assessment time-point and analyzed&#xD;
      for between group differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawing Participants from this Study: Participants may withdraw from the treatment at any&#xD;
      time. Participants who choose to withdraw will be documented and data will be analyzed as a&#xD;
      member of the group to which they were randomly assigned (intention-to-treat)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential prognostic indicators or predictors of response: Potential predictors of response&#xD;
      for secondary objective #2 will include baseline measures for each of the outcome measures&#xD;
      listed under outcomes as well as post-traumatic stress measured by the Post-traumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder Checklist, sense of perceived injustice measured by the Injustice Experience&#xD;
      Questionnaire, number of medications, comorbidities measured by disease count, and&#xD;
      expectations for recovery. Expectations for recovery will be assessed with two questions: i)&#xD;
      Do you think your pain will improve? ii) Do you think your functional abilities will improve?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information: The following information will be collected at the initial&#xD;
      assessment and analyzed as potential covariates and predictors of response: age, sex, work&#xD;
      status prior to symptom onset, length of time since symptom onset in months, diagnosis&#xD;
      provided by a medical professional as reported by the patient, medication use, previous&#xD;
      treatment received, and expectations for recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment fidelity: Treatment fidelity will be assessed through a combination of attendance&#xD;
      (categorized as &lt;25%, 25-49%, 50-74%, â‰¥75% of visits) and adherence to self-management&#xD;
      strategies. This will be measured by clinician report when the clinician reviews the workbook&#xD;
      at each individual treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring and auditing: This trial will not include a data monitoring committee and&#xD;
      will not be audited outside of the study investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Statistical analysis will be conducted using Stata software, version 13 (StataCorp,&#xD;
      College Station, Texas, USA). Baseline characteristics for treatment and wait-list groups&#xD;
      will be compared using a Student's t-test for continuous data and Chi squared or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test for categorical variables. Analysis for the primary objective and secondary&#xD;
      objective #1 will be performed using linear mixed-effects modelling with data from three&#xD;
      repeated measures (baseline, 7 weeks, 18 weeks). A p value of less than 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered indicative of statistical significance. The primary analysis will use intention to&#xD;
      treat principles, but a secondary analysis to investigate efficacy for those that complete&#xD;
      75% of visits will be performed as well (per protocol analysis). Predictors of response&#xD;
      (change in SMFA-DI) will be determined using a series of multiple regression models.&#xD;

    <description>ChrOnic pain self-ManageMent support with pain science Education and exerCisE (COMMENCE) consists of two visits with a physiotherapist per week over six weeks. One of the two visits is in a group setting, where the emphasis is on pain neurophysiology education and provision of self-management strategies. The second visit each week is an individualized, one-to-one session in which the focus is on providing support for implementing self-management strategies and developing of an individualized, goal-oriented exercise program.</description>
