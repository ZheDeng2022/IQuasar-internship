      This research study is studying Dasatinib as a possible treatment for cancer of bile ducts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma is combination chemotherapy with&#xD;
      gemcitabine and cisplatin. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved&#xD;
      dasatinib for your specific disease (Cholangiocarcinoma) but it has been approved for other&#xD;
      uses (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia)&#xD;

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;

             asymptomatic and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting&#xD;
             study treatment are eligible. Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain&#xD;
             biopsy is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment.&#xD;
             (Baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans for subjects with known&#xD;

             superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and cervical carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ) diagnosed within the past 3 years or any currently active malignancy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are known to be HIV-positive are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with dasatinib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with dasatinib. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other study agents concurrently while on this study&#xD;
