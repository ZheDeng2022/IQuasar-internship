      The purpose of this study is to investigate viral factors determining the early onset of T1D.&#xD;
      Thanks to the quantification of viral exposures of T1D patients before the disease onset with&#xD;
      questionnaires and environmental databases analyses, and through whole genome association&#xD;
      studies of these patients, investigators could attempt to identify gene-virus interactions&#xD;
      determining the age of T1D onset.&#xD;

      The &quot;hygiene hypothesis&quot;, which has been proposed to explain the observed increase of the&#xD;
      incidence of T1D, relies on experimental evidence acquired in mouse models. However,&#xD;
      epidemiological data are still lacking to validate this hypothesis in man. This is critical,&#xD;
      because -in opposition with the hygiene hypothesis- there are many reasons to believe that,&#xD;
      at contrary, certain virus can trigger the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic predisposition to a severe infection form (particularly primary infection) was&#xD;
      demonstrated for several infectious diseases (Casanova JL, Science 317:617-619, 2007;&#xD;
      Casanova JL, EMBO J 26:915-922, 2007). It usually corresponds to deficiencies in genes&#xD;
      involved in the host's immune response, the transmission of which being Mendelian. Genetic&#xD;
      factors affect the ability of enteroviruses and other viruses to damage beta cells and to&#xD;
      induce diabetes. Recently, Nejentsev et al have demonstrated a link between enteroviruses and&#xD;
      diabetes genes: they have indeed identified 4 rare IFIH1 polymorphisms that reduce the T1D&#xD;
      risk. However, this gene encodes an enzyme recognizing the DNA enterovirus, causing immunity&#xD;
      activation; mutations inhibit gene activation. Except one study on HIV-1, there is to our&#xD;
      knowledge no genome wide association studies (GWAS) in humans on the role of host's genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the risk of infection, clinical expression, duration of viral shedding, or&#xD;
      response to therapy or to anti-viral vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We relied on our cohort of T1D children (Isis-Diab) to investigate the possible relation&#xD;
      between viral exposures, genetic polymorphisms, and subsequent T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The search for viral factors responsible for the increased T1D prevalence in youth children&#xD;
      is difficult to implement. The absence or scarcity of infections is difficult to assess&#xD;
      robustly at the individual level. The analysis of digestive, ENT or blood samples in the&#xD;
      search for viruses themselves can only be done at T1D diagnosis and is therefore unlikely to&#xD;
      be positive several years after the causal infection. It is not possible to reconstitute&#xD;
      retrospectively viral events, which an individual has been exposed between birth and date of&#xD;
      diabetes diagnosis. That is why our project proposes to use a proxy of viral infections&#xD;
      crossed by a child, quantifying viral exposures to which he was submitted before the T1D&#xD;
      diagnosis. We focused on early childhood's viral infections that may interfere with early&#xD;
      forms of T1D. We combine 2 data sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The geolocation of the child's address will locate places where he lives.&#xD;
           Spatio-temporal data from Sentinel Network, collected since 1984, will provide access on&#xD;
           the following viral exposures: seasonal influenza, viral diarrhea (mostly enteroviral),&#xD;
           mumps, measles, chickenpox. If the defect of our approach is that it does not see real&#xD;
           viral infections experienced by children, but only the level of exposure to which they&#xD;
           were exposed according to their address, the advantage is an objective spatio-temporal&#xD;
           description of virus epidemics around children, making it more or less likely infection&#xD;
           of these. Only France has such Sentinel data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccination (including MMR) and information on infectious past of children will be&#xD;
           collected from data recorded in his book health. We will focus on the mother's pregnancy&#xD;
           and the child between birth and 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental data from these 2 sources will be crossed with already available genetic data&#xD;
      from GWAS to identify gene-virus associations potentially determining age of T1D onset. This&#xD;
      &quot;high dimensionality&quot; analysis will be addressed with &quot;machine learning&quot; programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If avoidable risks are identified, it would be possible to think to design clinical trials&#xD;
      for prevention of the identified forms of T1D.&#xD;
