      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, debilitating, functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
           disorder with estimated population prevalence in Europe between of 10 -15% (Ford et al).&#xD;
           These symptoms can be debilitating and lead to a significant reduction in quality of&#xD;
           life particularly in the more severely affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alterations in the function and composition of the gut microbiota are increasingly being&#xD;
           implicated as potential aetiological factors. (Collins et al). One of the strongest&#xD;
           indictors for this concept is the significantly increased risk of developing IBS after&#xD;
           an episode of acute gastroenteritis. Prospective studies have demonstrated that between&#xD;
           3- 36% of enteric infections lead to new, persistent IBS symptoms. (Gwee at al.,Neal et&#xD;
           al) A number of studies have demonstrated that the diversity, stability and metabolic&#xD;
           activity of the gut microbiota are altered in IBS patients compared with healthy&#xD;
           individuals (Jeffrey et al). Although a distinct microbial signature has not been&#xD;
           identified for IBS, several studies have shown a gut microbial composition enriched with&#xD;
           Firmicutes together with a reduced abundance of Bacteroides (Jeffery et al,&#xD;
           Rajilic-Stojanovic et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) has proven to a safe, inexpensive and effective&#xD;
           treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection achieving up to 90% cure rates&#xD;
           in some studies with a very good side effect and adverse event profile (van. Nood et&#xD;
           al.). In this study the investigators wish to investigate whether restoring healthy gut&#xD;
           microbiota profiles, using stool from healthy donors, will lead to improved clinical&#xD;
           outcomes for patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Autologous fecal microbiota transplant using re - infusion of the participants own&#xD;
           faeces has been previously been used as a placebo in studies using FMT (Vrieze et al)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The design of the study is a prospective randomised, placebo controlled study that will&#xD;
           be carried out on a single site. The study will involve four visits in total over an 8&#xD;
           week period. The first visit will be a screening visit to assess eligibility for the&#xD;
           study. Visit two will be the treatment visit at which patients will receive the FMT&#xD;
           using stool from a healthy donor or placebo. An autologous faecal microbiota transplant&#xD;
           will be used as the placebo in this study. Follow up visits will be performed at 4 weeks&#xD;
           and 8 weeks after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Up to 50 patients with IBS will be recruited for the study. All patients will have an&#xD;
           established diagnosis of IBS as per the Rome III criteria. Subjects will be recruited&#xD;
           from the population of IBS patients attending Cork gastroenterology outpatients.&#xD;
           Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or placebo control&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Donor Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Donor stool will be obtained from healthy donors. The donors will be interviewed to&#xD;
           ensure they are in good health and will undergo a screening questionnaire to identify&#xD;
           potential infectious risk which could be transferred by stool. Certain exclusion&#xD;
           criteria will apply and donors will undergo testing of stool and serum. The donation&#xD;
           process is safe for the donor (Bakken et al). A selected healthy individual with a&#xD;
           diverse microbial composition will preferentially be used as the donor candidate unless&#xD;
           recipient wishes dictate the use of a designated donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Donor Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risk of infectious agent Known Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B or C. Known&#xD;
           exposure to HIV or viral hepatitis Known current communicable disease High risk&#xD;
           lifestyle factors Factors which increase risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.&#xD;
           Gastrointestinal co-morbidities History of inflammatory bowel disease History of IBS&#xD;
           History of gastrointestinal malignancy or polyposis History of major Gastrointestinal&#xD;
           surgery Factors that can or do affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
           Antibiotics within the preceding 3 months Major immunosuppressive medications Systemic&#xD;
           anti-neoplastic drugs Additional recipient specific considerations Recent ingestion of a&#xD;
           potential allergen where recipient has a known allergy. Systemic autoimmunity Atopic&#xD;
           diseases Chronic pain syndrome Obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Donor Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following screening tests will be performed on all potential donors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stool testing Clostridium difficile by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PCR for Shigella,&#xD;
           Salmonella, E.coli verotoxin, Campylobacter Cryptosporidium Ova and parasites&#xD;
           Serological testing HIV, type 1 and 2 Hepatitis A IgM Hepatitis B surface antigen,&#xD;
           hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis B surface antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hepatitis C screen human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) Rapid Plasma Reagin and&#xD;
           fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. FMT procedure protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures should be followed in terms of donor and recipient preparation and&#xD;
      in the preparation and administration of the donor stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Donor Preparation Can use gentle osmotic laxative the night before procedure. Provide&#xD;
           the stool sample on the morning of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recipient Preparation Standard pre colonoscopy bowel preparation on the day before the&#xD;
           FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stool preparation After passage of the stool by the donor it will be immediately be&#xD;
           transferred to an anaerobic hood to be processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The stool will be diluted and filtered producing a liquid slurry consistency The liquid&#xD;
           stool will then be placed in an anaerobic bottle and transferred to the site of&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stool administration. The stool should be administered as soon as possible after it's&#xD;
           prepared, at maximum 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The FMT will be performed endoscopically. All patients will undergo a colonoscopy and&#xD;
           the liquid stool will be infused through the endoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ideally all patients will also have a duodenal infusion of stool performed via an&#xD;
           oesphogastrodoudenoscopy at the same session. However if the patient does not consent to&#xD;
           this it will not be deemed a protocol breach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted as outlined in this protocol and in accordance with the ICH&#xD;
           Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, and the declaration of Helsinki [Appendix A].&#xD;
           Informed consent will be obtained prior to any study related procedures being&#xD;
           undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.1 Screening Visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the study and the procedures to be undertaken will be explained to all&#xD;
           potential subjects. Subjects will then be requested to read the subject information&#xD;
           sheet and read and sign the informed consent form, and will receive a signed copy. The&#xD;
           following assessments will be performed at Visit 1 Informed consent Demographics Medical&#xD;
           and medication history Rome III questionnaire Evaluation of eligibility criteria Vital&#xD;
           signs Physical examination, body weight, height and BMI assessment Food frequency&#xD;
           questionnaire IBS symptom assessment scores Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
           International Physical activity Index Blood samples Stool samples&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the patient meets the eligibility criteria they will return within 28 days to undergo&#xD;
           faecal microbiota transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.2 Treatment Visit (Visit 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
           At visit 2 the patients will undergo faecal microbial transplantation. Prior to the&#xD;
           procedure all patients should undergo standard bowel preparation. At Visit 2 the&#xD;
           following assessments will be performed on all patient before FMT is performed Brief&#xD;
           interview about the previous weeks Vital signs and physical examination. Eligibility&#xD;
           assessment Informed consent for endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The donor stool will be administered to the patient endoscopically. All patients will&#xD;
           undergo colonoscopy and the donor stool will be infused through the colonoscope.&#xD;
           Decision to perform duodenal infusion as well as colonic infusion will be dictated by&#xD;
           patient preference. If the patient consents they will also undergo&#xD;
           oesphogastrodoudenoscopy and donor stool will be infused through the gastroscope into&#xD;
           the patients duodenum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following the procedure the patent will be managed in recovery as per standard endoscopy&#xD;
           guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.3 Visit 3 and 4 - Follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At visits 3 and 4 the patients will undergo the following Interview about the previous&#xD;
           weeks. Vital signs and physical exam incl BMI Concomitant medication Adverse events&#xD;
           monitoring Blood samples for clinical and research. Stool sample (collected at home&#xD;
           prior to visit). Food frequency questionnaire IBS symptom assessment scores Global&#xD;
           assessment question. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale International Physical&#xD;
           activity Index&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Removal of subjects from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if the subject; Elects independently to&#xD;
           withdraw from the study; If he/she develops any condition which contravenes the original&#xD;
           criteria; Is considered at any point to be unsuitable to continue the study, at the&#xD;
           discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Concomitant Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be questioned about their medication history. The details of any&#xD;
           medication taken will be recorded in the patient case notes and case report form&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4 Endpoint assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will have the following endpoint assessments performed: assessment of medical&#xD;
           and surgical history changes since baseline/treatment visits, IBS severity/QOL scores,&#xD;
           faecal sample assessment/analysis, blood sample analysis, physical assessment,&#xD;
           concomitant medication and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To ensure subject safety the following evaluations will be performed during the study:&#xD;
           vital signs, adverse event monitoring, physical examination and laboratory assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Biological Sample Collections and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected at each visit for clinical haematological and biochemical analysis&#xD;
      and cytokine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haematology and biochemistry panels will be done as per standard of a care - Full blood&#xD;
      counts (including haemoglobin, white cell count, platelet count, haematocrit and differential&#xD;
      white cell count), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR), sodium, potassium, chloride, urea,&#xD;
      creatinine, protein, albumin, crp, liver function tests and quantitative immunoglobulin (IgA,&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin G, IgM). Participants will also have HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HTLV and&#xD;
      syphilis screens performed at visit 1. This analysis will be performed at Cork University&#xD;
      Hospital (CUH) laboratories. All laboratory results will be reviewed and reports signed the&#xD;
      investigators and recorded in the patients case repot form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research bloods for serum analysis of inflammatory immune markers including cytokines will be&#xD;
      performed, theses bloods will be processed in the laboratories of the Alimentary Pharmabiotic&#xD;
      Centre, University College Cork(UCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Faecal Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal samples will be collected at each visit. Bacterial DNA will be extracted from the&#xD;
      faecal samples of each subject and the composition of the microbiota determined by sequencing&#xD;
      of amplified bacterial ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) genes, before and after the faecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplantation is performed. Faecal samples will also be analysed for viral&#xD;
      particles and phageome studies performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Biopsy/ Intestinal Tissue Collections, Storage and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient consents, during their endoscopy at time of FMT biopsy of intestinal tissue&#xD;
      will be performed. The tissue samples will be collected in culture medium and stored at 4 0C&#xD;
      until delivered to the lab in UCC. Microbiota composition analysis will be performed by&#xD;
      direct pyrosequencing of 20,000-40,000 16S rRNA gene amplicons per subject (Pubmed:&#xD;
      20571116). Sequence generation and analysis performed by the UCC bioinformatics team will&#xD;
      determine the composition of the microbiota of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of all samples collected will be conducted in the CUH and/or UCC/Teagasc&#xD;
      laboratories. On some occasions the analyses may be done in collaboration with a third party&#xD;
      outside UCC including pharmaceutical companies, which may require samples to be shipped to&#xD;
      this organisation. These samples will be coded and identified only using anonymised sample&#xD;
      identifier numbers. In addition samples may be stored and used for analysis in future&#xD;
      studies. Again samples will be coded and identified only using anonymized sample identifier&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 .Statistics and Study Powering:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo response rate of 40% is predicted in this study population. The study will be&#xD;
      appropriately powered to detect additional benefit of at least 15% in the treatment group&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary objectives will be analysed using standard parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric statistical techniques to test the efficacy of FMT. The exploratory objective&#xD;
      will be assessed using sophisticated biostatistical analysis to identify a microbiota profile&#xD;
      that predicts response to FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of emergency situations, any significant change in the protocol (i.e., one&#xD;
      that affects the safety of the subjects, scope of the investigation, the scientific quality&#xD;
      of the study) will not be implemented until the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) have&#xD;
      reviewed, approved, and documented the protocol amendment in writing. Amendments include&#xD;
      changes in the investigator and investigators or site address, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a change is made to eliminate or reduce the risk to subjects, it may be implemented&#xD;
      before review and approval by the IEC. The investigator shall notify the IEC of said change&#xD;
      in writing within 5 working days after implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of an emergency, the investigator shall institute any medical procedures deemed&#xD;
      appropriate, however all such procedures (minor or non significant), change (e.g.&#xD;
      Statistician, typographical errors, spelling errors, etc) will not be made until said change&#xD;
      is reviewed and approved by the Independent Ethics Committee and a memo communicating the&#xD;
      change is provided by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Obligation of the investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary symptoms of IBS will be scored on a six point Likert scale at baseline, week 4 and at end of study. The following symptoms will be assessed and recorded: abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distension, sense of incomplete evacuation, straining at stool, urgency of bowel movement, passage of gas and mucus, bowel habit satisfaction. Each symptom will be assessed using a 6-point scale, where 0 = none to 5 = very severe. Bowel habit satisfaction will be assessed using a 6-point scale where 0 = very satisfied and 5 = very dissatisfied. Overall assessment of IBS symptoms will be also be scored on a 6 - point scale. An IBS composite score(15 point score) representing the sum of individual scores for abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/distension, and bowel movement difficulty (straining at stool or urgency of bowel movement) will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Patient microbiota compositional profiles</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will characterise all participants' microbiota composition at baseline and at the end of study to determine if there is a subgroup of patient/donor combinations, based on their microbiota composition, in whom a positive response to FMT was obtained. This would be very valuable for future optimization of a positive primary outcome.</description>
