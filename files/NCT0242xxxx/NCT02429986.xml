    <textblock>
      Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV) treatment is routinely prescribed in France. In order to be&#xD;
      reimbursed according to the French Social Security rules, the patient treated with an ASV&#xD;
      needs to be examined each year. In this observational transversal single-visit study, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to describe the clinical characteristics of patients treated with ASV and&#xD;
      the associated device settings.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in &quot;real life conditions&quot; the use of Adaptative&#xD;
      Servo-Ventilation (ASV) treatment. ASV treatment is routinely prescribed in France in&#xD;
      patients with various sleep disorders breathing (Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) and Central&#xD;
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome (CSAS), CHF and central and obstructive sleep apnea (COSA), Obstructive&#xD;
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) and complex sleep apnea syndrome (compSAS), idiopathic or drug&#xD;
      induced periodic breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be reimbursed according to the French Social Security rules, the patient treated&#xD;
      with an ASV needs to be examined each year. In this observational transversal single-visit&#xD;
      study, the aim is to describe the clinical characteristics of patients treated with ASV and&#xD;
      the associated device settings. The aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy issues in real&#xD;
      life conditions of the ASV prescription.Depending of the data, data are obtained after&#xD;
      analysis of the six latest months data of the ASV device, after questioning the patient,&#xD;
      after analysis of the polygraphy/oximetry (if prescribed by the doctor for the renewal&#xD;
      consultation of the ASV care and reimbursement by the French Social Security). All the data&#xD;
      are obtained during the annual consultation required by the French Social Security.&#xD;
