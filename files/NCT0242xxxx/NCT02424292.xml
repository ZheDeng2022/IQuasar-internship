  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with breast cancer generally have a fairly well prognosis with estimated&#xD;
      average survival rates of 73% and five year survival rates of 89% in developed countries.&#xD;
      However, women who are obese at the time of breast cancer diagnosis seem to be at risk for a&#xD;
      worse breast cancer related and overall survival, as compared to their normal weight&#xD;
      counterparts. In addition, weight gain after diagnosis might be negatively associated with&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight gain is a common phenomenon among breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy as well as receiving adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy. While sufficient physical&#xD;
      activity and limitation of the amount of weight gain is important for all breast cancer&#xD;
      patients, it surely is for overweight and obese patients. The recently published national&#xD;
      guideline oncological rehabilitation provides exercise goals, for physical training based on&#xD;
      the Dutch PA guideline &quot;Nederlandse Norm Gezond Bewegen (NNGB)&quot;. It recommends to engage in&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise (e.g. brisk walking) for at least 30 minutes a day, on at least 5&#xD;
      days a week. For people who are overweight (Body Mass Index ≥ 25 kg/m2) it is recommended to&#xD;
      exercise at least 60 minutes at a moderate-intensity level, equal or more than 3 Metabolic&#xD;
      Equivalent Task Hours (&gt; 3 MET/h), on at least 5 days a week. However, only 61% of the&#xD;
      general population, meets these guidelines (8) and among cancer patients this percentage is&#xD;
      even less. This study aims to increase the percentage of overweight breast cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy that reaches the goal of the NNGB by the&#xD;
      oncological rehabilitation program with 20%.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with breast cancer generally have a fairly well prognosis with estimated&#xD;
      average survival rates of 73% and five year survival rates of 89% in developed countries (1).&#xD;
      However, women who are obese at the time of breast cancer diagnosis seem to be at risk for a&#xD;
      worse breast cancer related and overall survival, as compared to their normal weight&#xD;
      counterparts. In addition, weight gain after diagnosis might be negatively associated with&#xD;
      prognosis. Possible mechanisms explaining this association include host-related,&#xD;
      tumour-related and treatment-related factors (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular physical activity (PA) after a diagnosis of breast cancer can have various beneficial&#xD;
      effects with respect to overall survival (3) as well as health-related quality of life (4).&#xD;
      The Dutch PA guideline &quot;Nederlandse Norm Gezond Bewegen (NNGB)&quot; recommends to engage in&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise (e.g. brisk walking) for at least 30 minutes a day, on at least 5&#xD;
      days a week (5). For people who are overweight (Body Mass Index ≥ 25 kg/m2) it is recommended&#xD;
      to exercise at least 60 minutes at a moderate-intensity level, equal or more than 3 Metabolic&#xD;
      Equivalent Task Hours (&gt; 3 MET/h), on at least 5 days a week (6,7). However, only 61% of the&#xD;
      general population, meets these guidelines (8) and among cancer patients this percentage is&#xD;
      even less (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently published national guideline oncological rehabilitation provides exercise goals,&#xD;
      for physical training based on the NNGB (5) as well as advice regarding nutrition and&#xD;
      education on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The guideline emphasises the importance of a&#xD;
      tailored program, taking into account personal preferences and attitudes concerning physical&#xD;
      exercise. Level of PA self-efficacy (beliefs in one's capabilities to successfully execute&#xD;
      the required PA) is mentioned as an important predictor of compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight gain is a common phenomenon among breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (10) as well as receiving adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy (11). While sufficient&#xD;
      physical activity and limitation of the amount of weight gain is important for all breast&#xD;
      cancer patients, it surely is for overweight and obese patients. In the provinces of&#xD;
      Groningen and Drenthe, the percentage of overweight women is significantly higher compared to&#xD;
      the national average. In addition, in this area the average socio-economic status (SES),&#xD;
      often associated with unhealthy lifestyle, overweight and not seeing the personal relevance&#xD;
      of health recommendations, is lower than in the rest of the Netherlands. This leaves this&#xD;
      group extra vulnerable for all kinds of health problems like diabetes mellitus, hypertension,&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease and decreased cancer related survival. However, it&#xD;
      is also known to be a population that is very difficult to motivate to engage in more&#xD;
      physical activity. Therefore, it is uncertain if the guideline oncological rehabilitation is&#xD;
      sufficient enough to reach the NNGB goals. Oncological rehabilitation can render health gain&#xD;
      in this patient population, as it can potentially limit weight gain, improve parameters of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and improve health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To increase the percentage of overweight breast cancer patients treated with&#xD;
      adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy that reaches the goal of the NNGB by the oncological&#xD;
      rehabilitation program with 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To evaluate whether the possible increase in percentage of patients&#xD;
      meeting the NNGB is sustained up to 26 weeks (=3 months) after completion of the oncological&#xD;
      rehabilitation. To evaluate the effect of oncological rehabilitation on body composition&#xD;
      including weight, on parameters of metabolic syndrome, on health-related quality of life and&#xD;
      on self-efficacy in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The primary aim of this study is to determine whether oncological&#xD;
      rehabilitation results in reaching the goals of the NNGB for overweight breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. A single-arm, experimental pre-post test design, evaluating preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of a 12-week personalised oncological rehabilitation program in overweight or&#xD;
      obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) breast cancer patients, on adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy will be&#xD;
      used. The oncological rehabilitation program will vary according to patients' baseline&#xD;
      characteristics, possible functional limitations and personal preferences. Assessment of&#xD;
      meeting the NNGB (by accelerometry), of body composition, parameters of metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and self-efficacy, will be performed at baseline, immediately&#xD;
      after completion of the 12 week study period and at follow-up 26 weeks after baseline (= 3&#xD;
      months after completion of the intervention). Changes in these parameters between baseline&#xD;
      and 12 weeks and baseline and 26 weeks will be analysed. The secondary aims are to establish&#xD;
      the effect of physical activity on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, the quality of life&#xD;
      and self-efficacy in this group of patients. These secondary parameters will be assessed as a&#xD;
      positive reinforcement for patients to continue with the engaged physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 141 overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) women 18-75 years old who are&#xD;
      treated with adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be offered a personalised program following the guidelines of&#xD;
      oncological rehabilitation, which over a period of 12 weeks will facilitate them to stepwise&#xD;
      increase the level of PA up to meeting the PA guideline for overweight/obese people. To&#xD;
      explore physical activity patients will be asked to wear an accelerometer during 1 week&#xD;
      before the start of the oncology rehabilitation program (baseline). For patients already&#xD;
      meeting the guideline at baseline, the program will stimulate them to keep doing so and other&#xD;
      aspects of achieving a healthy lifestyle will be discussed together with the physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereto all patients will have an intake with the physiotherapist of the oncology&#xD;
      rehabilitation program assessing personal preferences with regard to physical activities,&#xD;
      hindering factors as well as functional limitations in the individual patient. Possible&#xD;
      solutions for hindering factors will be sought for. Based on patient's individual&#xD;
      characteristics and preferences, the physiotherapist will create a tailored PA program for&#xD;
      this individual patient to stimulate them in meeting the PA guidelines at the end of the&#xD;
      study period. To facilitate meeting the guidelines, patients can follow a supervised PA&#xD;
      program (individual or group-wise) 2-3 times a week, or a combination of an unsupervised&#xD;
      home-based program (individual or group-wise) with a supervised program. Activities engaged&#xD;
      will be gradually increased in duration per session and/or intensity. In addition,&#xD;
      incorporating physical activity in the daily routine (household activities, going to the shop&#xD;
      by bike instead of by car) will be stimulated. All patients will have follow-up conversations&#xD;
      by skype/facetime or telephone after 1, 3 and 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the set goals, of possible hindering factors and how to overcome them,&#xD;
      encouragement and - if needed and in consultation with the physiotherapist - setting new&#xD;
      realistic goals for the next period will be standard part of these follow-up conversations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of patients meeting the Dutch PA guideline for overweight/obese people (≥&#xD;
      times one hour per week) after completion of the 12 week intervention. Meeting the guideline&#xD;
      will be measured with accelerometry (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustainability of the possible increase in percentage of patients meeting the Dutch PA&#xD;
           guideline for overweight or obese people up to 3 months after completion of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in body composition (weight, BMI, fat percentage as measured with the skinfold&#xD;
           measurements), parameters of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, blood pressure,&#xD;
           fasting blood glucose, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides), health-related quality&#xD;
           of life (using EORTC QLQ-C30, the EORTC BR23 and single question on satisfaction with&#xD;
           life) and general and PA self-efficacy (using the ALCOS and PA self-efficacy&#xD;
           questionnaire respectively), between baseline,12 weeks after baseline and 26 weeks&#xD;
           thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Despite participation in this study being reserved for those without any&#xD;
      contra-indication for physical exercise and despite the conclusion of the American College of&#xD;
      Sports Medicine Roundtable on Exercise Guidelines for Cancer Survivors that exercise is safe&#xD;
      during and after cancer treatment (13), in doing physical exercise there is always a risk of&#xD;
      (sports) strain/injury. However, regarding the nature of the targeted intensity of exercise&#xD;
      (moderate), this risk will be low and the investigators expect the benefits (both physically&#xD;
      and psychologically) to far outweigh possible risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and 12 and 26 weeks thereafter, the following assessments will be performed:&#xD;
      measurement of physical activity with an accelerometer, measurement of body composition&#xD;
      (weight, BMI, fat percentage as measured with the skinfold measurements), parameters of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (this includes measuring waist circumference and blood pressure, drawing&#xD;
      blood to measure fasting blood glucose, high density lipoprotein and triglycerides). In&#xD;
      addition, filling out questionnaires on general physical activity (ALCOS) and PA&#xD;
      self-efficacy (PA self-efficacy questionnaire), health-related quality of life including&#xD;
      satisfaction (EORTC QLQ-C30, the EORTC BR23 and single question on satisfaction with life)&#xD;
      will be part of the study. Information on these questionnaires can be found in Appendix 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, a questionnaire regarding baseline characteristics (marital status, education&#xD;
      level, employment status, monthly household income, being advised to exercise by the treating&#xD;
      oncologist, being on a diet with the purpose of losing weight, known with diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, current medication and stage of behavioural change) will&#xD;
      be filled out. Medical record will be viewed by the researcher for additional patient&#xD;
      characteristics like tumour stage at diagnosis (see 5.1.3).&#xD;
