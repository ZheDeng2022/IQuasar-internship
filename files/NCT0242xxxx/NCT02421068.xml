      This study will provide information on the pharmacokinetics, safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      off--label drugs used in critically ill premature infants: doxapram, fentanyl, midazolam,&#xD;
      paracetamol, phenobarbital, sildenafil, levetiracetam, ibuprofen and fluconazole. PK/PD&#xD;
      analysis with NONMEM (non-linear mixed effects modelling) will result in (adapted) dosage&#xD;
      guidelines, thus contributing towards an improvement in the quality of care and cost&#xD;
      efficiency. Furthermore the development of Dried Blood Spot (DBS) analysis is investigated&#xD;
      for these drugs as a minimally invasive method for conventional patient care and to perform&#xD;
      pharmacological studies in children. The adapted dosage guidelines will be implemented&#xD;
      directly into clinical practice in collaboration with the NKFK. Therefore the study is&#xD;
      designed as an observational multicenter study to be able to collect sufficient data for the&#xD;
      drugs of interest.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Approximately 60% of drugs are used off--label in critically ill neonates in the&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). This is even more true for pre--term born neonates in&#xD;
      whom pharmacokinetics of these agents may be different due to immature elimination pathways.&#xD;
      The lack of sufficient data about efficacy and safety of many of these drugs makes it&#xD;
      difficult to have evidence based dosing guidelines for these agents. Therefore the urge for&#xD;
      drug research in this population is of great importance. The pharmacokinetic (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of drugs in premature infants are different from the&#xD;
      characteristics found in term neonates, older children and adults. These differences are&#xD;
      caused among others by a different body composition, by immaturity of the renal excretion&#xD;
      systems, the metabolic pathways in the liver and other organ functions as well as immature&#xD;
      drug receptors and transporters. After birth, there is a rapid development of many of these&#xD;
      functions, necessitating frequent adaptation of dosage guidelines in the first few weeks of&#xD;
      life. Besides age and size, co--morbidity, co--administration of drugs and genetic&#xD;
      heterogeneity may further contribute to this extensive inter--individual variability in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of premature infants. There is a critical lack of&#xD;
      evidence--based data of drug dosing in (extremely) preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE Recently, population PK/PD modeling and simulation studies have enabled the&#xD;
      development of evidence--based individualized dosing schemes for children with a limited&#xD;
      number of subjects, thus improving drug safety and efficacy. The application of PK/PD&#xD;
      modeling in the most critically ill population of premature infants, with the highest&#xD;
      variability in the pharmacokinetics of drugs, and the greatest lack of adequate data&#xD;
      underscoring optimal dosage, can contribute to the development of rational, individualized&#xD;
      and safe dosing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information on the pharmacokinetics, safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      off--label drugs used in critically ill premature infants: doxapram, fentanyl, midazolam,&#xD;
      paracetamol, phenobarbital, sildenafil, levetiracetam, ibuprofen and fluconazole (only&#xD;
      studied for the PK). PK/PD analysis will result in (adapted) dosage guidelines, thus&#xD;
      contributing towards an improvement in the quality of care and cost efficiency. Furthermore&#xD;
      the development of Dried Blood Spot (DBS) analysis is investigated for these drugs as a&#xD;
      minimally invasive method for conventional patient care and to perform pharmacological&#xD;
      studies in children. The adapted dosage guidelines will be implemented directly into clinical&#xD;
      practice in collaboration with the NKFK. Therefore the study is designed as an observational&#xD;
      multicenter study to be able to collect sufficient data for the drugs of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN This is a prospective observational multicenter study on the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of paracetamol, fentanyl, midazolam, phenobarbital, doxapram, levetiracetam,&#xD;
      sildenafil, ibuprofen and fluconazole routinely administered to preterm infants according to&#xD;
      standard protocols. The treatment regimen is left to the discretion of the treating physician&#xD;
      in accordance with current guidelines. During this study a limited number of additional blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn from the participants for pharmacokinetic analysis, never exceeding 3%&#xD;
      of the total blood volume during any four--week period or 1% at any single time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is standard care in the Netherlands for all premature born infants under 32 weeks to get&#xD;
      seen by the paediatrician at the age of two years for a check on growth and development. The&#xD;
      visit to the day care clinic of the hospital of their admission on birth, enables us to&#xD;
      collect qualitative data on growth and physiological development as well as from&#xD;
      psychological and neurodevelopmental standardised tests.The collected data enables us to gain&#xD;
      a better description of the subjects in our study and to further determine safety of the&#xD;
      studied drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION All preterm infants born with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks who are admitted to one&#xD;
      of the participating NICUs are eligible for inclusion. The participating departments are all&#xD;
      level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units. Three are situated in an academic hospital&#xD;
      (Rotterdam, Nijmegen and Maastricht) and one in a non--academic hospital (Veldhoven).&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the 4 NICUs consist of both inborn and outborn neonates with different&#xD;
      gestational ages (24--42 weeks). All admitted patients need intensive or high care treatment.&#xD;
      Most patients will be admitted on the first postnatal day, but sometimes are referred at&#xD;
      older post natal ages (&lt;14 days) to the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Pharmacokinetic endpoints for all 9 drugs are clearance en volume of distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics of paracetamol, fentanyl, midazolam, phenobarbital, doxapram, levetiracetam&#xD;
      and sildenafil will be explored in all included preterm neonates. Fluconazole will only be&#xD;
      studied for the pharmacokinetics. Drug specific effects of drugs (e.g. pain scores for&#xD;
      morphine, blood pressure for dopamine) as well as side effects and short term effects on&#xD;
      morbidity and outcome will be analyzed. Additional pharmacodynamic endpoints for the 7 PK/PD&#xD;
      study drugs is the drug target concentration for each drug that is related to the desired&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters to measure the effect of the drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fentanyl and paracetamol, used as analgetics; clinical endpoint is pain relief, as&#xD;
           routinely measured by the validated COMFORTneo scale and the NRS (numeric rating scale)&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Midazolam, phenobarbital and levetiracetam, used as anticonvulsive drugs; clinical&#xD;
           endpoint is control of convulsions, measured by Cerebral Function Monitoring using&#xD;
           amplitude--integrated EEG (aEEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Midazolam and fentanyl, used as a sedative drug during endotracheal intubation; clinical&#xD;
           endpoint is the intubation readiness score (IRS) and a qualitative intubation score and&#xD;
           sedation score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Midazolam and fentanyl, used as a sedative drug during nursing care is measured by the&#xD;
           COMFORTneo scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Doxapram, used as treatment for neonatal apnea; clinical endpoint is control of neonatal&#xD;
           apnea and endotracheal intubation in case of failure. The first endpoint can be measured&#xD;
           by modern monitoring technology, in which central post--monitoring data stored after&#xD;
           initiation of treatment will reveal the effect of doxapram on the reduction or&#xD;
           elimination of apneas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sildenafil, a treatment for PH (pulmonary hypertension); clinical endpoints are level of&#xD;
           ventilatory support, oxygen need (repetitive oxygenation index analyses) and BPD&#xD;
           (broncho pulmonary dysplasia) development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Ibuprofen is used to close patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in different dosages, orally&#xD;
           and intravenously in the recruiting sites. Endpoints are measured by cardiac ultrasound:&#xD;
           ductus closure (yes/no), ductal diameter and LA/AO ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-- and intra--patient variability of the PD and PK parameters of the drugs to be&#xD;
      investigated. Parameters with effect on this variability will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development of a minimally invasive Dried Blood Spot analysis method to perform future&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic studies in neonates. The measured concentration of the drugs in the&#xD;
           dried blood spot samples will be compared with the concentration of the blood samples in&#xD;
           the vial, which is the current validated standard method. The validity of the DBS method&#xD;
           will be the endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Influence of specific polymorphisms involved in the metabolism of the investigated&#xD;
           drugs.&#xD;
