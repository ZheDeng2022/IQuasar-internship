  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple ascending oral doses of ASP6282 in healthy&#xD;
      male and female subjects. 1 cohort (elderly) receives also a midazolam dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also explore the effect of itraconazole (another drug) on the PK of ASP6282,&#xD;
      as well as to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP6282 alone and in combination with&#xD;
      itraconazole in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, this study is to evaluate the PD and PK effects of single oral doses of ASP6282 on&#xD;
      pilocarpine-induced salivation and pupil diameter in healthy nonelderly male and female&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study consists of three parts. Part 1 is Single Ascending Dose Including Food Effect and&#xD;
      Drug-drug Interaction (DDI) with Itraconazole. There will be a washout between treatment&#xD;
      period 1 and 2 in the DDI arm of Part 1; Part 2 is a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD); Part 3,&#xD;
      with a treatment period 1, 2 and 3 is Proof of Pharmacology. There will be a washout between&#xD;
      each treatment period&#xD;
