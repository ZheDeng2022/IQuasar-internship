  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for Phase Ib and II:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient at least 18 years old and has definitive histologically or cytologically&#xD;
             confirmed metastatic solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors measurable by CT scan (or PET/CT, if patient&#xD;
             is allergic to CT contrast media). Tumor sites that are considered measureable must&#xD;
             not have received prior radiation therapy. For metastatic tumors not measurable by CT&#xD;
             and/or PET/CT, there needs to be tumor measuring at least 1cm in one dimension by&#xD;
             digital calipers on physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients can be enrolled only on one of the treatment arms on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The investigator will select the appropriate treatment arm for the patient with the&#xD;
             following requirements: (a) Patients cannot have had prior progression or intolerance&#xD;
             on the single agent chemotherapy and then enrolled on an arm with that same single&#xD;
             agent chemotherapy plus nivolumab (b) The chemotherapy on the arm selected must be&#xD;
             considered standard of care or its components listed in the NCCN guidelines&#xD;
             (www.nccn.org) for that cancer type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have recovered from acute toxicities of prior treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &gt; 3 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &gt; 2 weeks must have elapsed since receiving any radiotherapy, or ≥ 3 weeks or 5&#xD;
                  half-lives whichever is shorter for treatment with cytotoxic or biologic agents (&#xD;
                  ≥ 6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas). Chronic treatment with&#xD;
                  non-investigational gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs or other hormonal or&#xD;
                  supportive care is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood&#xD;
             counts at time of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500 mm3, platelet count ≥ 100×109 L, hemoglobin ≥ 9&#xD;
             g/dL. Subject can be given packed red blood cell transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min by Cockroft-Gault equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             [CreatClear = Sex * ((140 - Age) / (SerumCreat)) * (Weight / 72); where Sex = 1 for&#xD;
             men and 0.85 for women], total bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
             range, AST/ALT ≤ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within institutional normal limits. If TSH is above&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal range, then a free T4 within institutional normal limits is&#xD;
             acceptable. If thyroid replacement therapy is initiated then patient may be screened&#xD;
             and enrolled once the above criterion is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Persistent prior systemic therapy non-hematologic AE grade ≤ 2 (except alopecia or&#xD;
             correctable electrolyte abnormality with supplementation)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically&#xD;
             sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method (abstinence, oral&#xD;
             contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the study and for 5 months&#xD;
             following the last dose of nivolumab and 30 days following the last dose of&#xD;
             chemotherapy on this trial on this trial, and must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. If a female&#xD;
             subject or female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during this period then&#xD;
             patient will be recommended to seek appropriate obstetric care. The study will not be&#xD;
             monitoring subjects or female partners of subjects for pregnancy after the last dose&#xD;
             of study drug or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for Phase Ib and II:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has known brain metastases. Baseline imaging of the brain is required within&#xD;
             28 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior therapy with a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor for the RCC&#xD;
             subjects, prior therapy with irinotecan or topotecan for NSCLC subjects, and prior&#xD;
             therapy with irinotecan for CRC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment&#xD;
             plan and follow-up requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has known active infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C (patients are&#xD;
             NOT required to be tested for the presence of such viruses prior to therapy on this&#xD;
             protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Requiring daily corticosteroid dose ≥ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (e.g., surgery done&#xD;
             to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ), within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Day 1 of treatment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems, or&#xD;
             serious psychiatric disorders, which could compromise the patient's safety or the&#xD;
             study data integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient will be receiving any other anti-cancer therapy during participation in this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior treatment with nivolumab is not allowed. Prior receipt of other PD-1 inhibitors&#xD;
             or PD-L1 inhibitors is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the&#xD;
             past 2 years.&#xD;
