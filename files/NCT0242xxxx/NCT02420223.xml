    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot study designed to evaluate whether the beta-adrenergic&#xD;
      antagonist propranolol is effective in decreasing gene expression of stress-mediated&#xD;
      beta-adrenergic pathways among a cohort of individuals receiving an autologous hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant (HCT) for multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot study designed to evaluate whether a drug designed to&#xD;
      block the physiologic effects of stress is effective at blocking stress-related gene&#xD;
      expression in people receiving autologous stem cell transplants (their own cells) for&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Such stress-related gene expression is one way that the body is programmed&#xD;
      to make specific proteins under conditions of stress. These proteins are believed to&#xD;
      contribute to worse health outcomes. By using the drug propranolol, we aim to see whether we&#xD;
      might block these negative health effects of stress as occur in the cancer setting and during&#xD;
      the transplant process. We hypothesize that individuals taking propranolol will have more&#xD;
      favorable gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 40 individuals, randomizing half to receive propranolol and half to serve as&#xD;
      the control group not on the study drug. Study participants will start propranolol three&#xD;
      weeks prior to their transplant and continue it until 30 days after the transplant. We will&#xD;
      explore the effect of socioeconomic status, depression, and anxiety on individuals' gene&#xD;
      expression response to propranolol with the idea that the more impoverished, anxious, or&#xD;
      depressed individuals will display an even greater change in their gene expression. Part of&#xD;
      the purpose of this study is also be to assess whether it is feasible to give this drug to&#xD;
      individuals with cancer. Results of this study may inform larger trials assessing the effects&#xD;
      of propranolol on cancer progression.&#xD;

    <measure>Beta-adrenergically Mediated Gene Expression (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-Transplant); 4 weeks post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Expression (up or down regulation) of genes involved in the stress response can be modulated through the beta-adrenergic pathway. The log2 RNA abundance is a means to normalize results to determine whether a gene is up regulated (value greater than 1) or down regulated (value less than 1). Differential change in log2 RNA abundance is defined by the fold change (FC) as log2FC=Log2(B)-Log2(A). Logarithmic measures are unitless. The change in the measure between two time points determines whether a gene has up-or down-regulated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported Depression and Anxiety Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS scale includes fourteen 4-response Likert-scale questions graded 0 to 3. Seven questions are specific to depression; 7 questions are specific to anxiety. The score is the total of the responses in their respective categories. Lower scores indicated less depression and/or anxiety. Scores 0-7 indicate normal status; scores 8-10 suggest borderline abnormal status; and scores 11-21 indicate abnormal status. Only anxiety scores are presented.</description>

        <title>Beta-adrenergically Mediated Gene Expression (Change From Baseline)</title>
        <description>Expression (up or down regulation) of genes involved in the stress response can be modulated through the beta-adrenergic pathway. The log2 RNA abundance is a means to normalize results to determine whether a gene is up regulated (value greater than 1) or down regulated (value less than 1). Differential change in log2 RNA abundance is defined by the fold change (FC) as log2FC=Log2(B)-Log2(A). Logarithmic measures are unitless. The change in the measure between two time points determines whether a gene has up-or down-regulated.</description>

Propranolol will start at 20mg twice daily and will be titrated to 40mg twice daily as tolerated. Both groups will come back to the hospital weekly in order to assess items such as patient's level of anxiety, depression, your adherence, and also to monitor for side effects. The patient's will complete questionnaires during your visit. These will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. This will continue for up to 7 total weeks for patient's on the Propranolol arm.&#xD;

        <description>This measure will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS scale includes fourteen 4-response Likert-scale questions graded 0 to 3. Seven questions are specific to depression; 7 questions are specific to anxiety. The score is the total of the responses in their respective categories. Lower scores indicated less depression and/or anxiety. Scores 0-7 indicate normal status; scores 8-10 suggest borderline abnormal status; and scores 11-21 indicate abnormal status. Only anxiety scores are presented.</description>
