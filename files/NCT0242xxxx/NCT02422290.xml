    <textblock>
      This pilot study is proposed to determine the acceptability, feasibility and potential&#xD;
      efficacy of ketamine, a medication that modulates glutamate in the brain, as a rapid&#xD;
      treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms in adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      with OCD. This study will recruit 6 youth (ages 14-22) who are diagnosed with clinically&#xD;
      significant OCD and have failed at least one adequate trial of a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor&#xD;
      (SRI) medication and a course of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (unless unable to access&#xD;
      or tolerate) for OCD in the past. Participants will receive a single infusion of intravenous&#xD;
      ketamine and be assessed at regular intervals post-infusion for up to 14 days. At the end of&#xD;
      the 14-day treatment phase, all participants will be offered three months of open treatment&#xD;
      for OCD with medication and/or CBT.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Day 7, Day 17, 3-Month; Baseline and Day 14 pre-specified to be reported</time_frame>
    <description>The CY-BOCS is a semi-structured measure of OCD severity with excellent inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. It is validated in those starting at age 7 and used in studies up to age 20. The CYBOCS differs from the adult YBOCS only in its use of simpler language. The CY-BOCS consists of 10 items which are summed up to derive the total CY-BOCS score. The total score ranges from 0-40 with higher scores indicating greater severity of OCD symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions - Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Day 7, Day 17, 3-Month; Baseline and Day 14 pre-specified to be reported</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a clinician rated 7-point rating scale for the severity of a participant's illness relative to the clinician's experience of working with this particular population. The score ranges from 1-7 with higher scores indicating greater illness severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OCD Visual Analogue Scale (OCD-VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Day 1-14, 3-Month; Baseline and Day 14 pre-specified to be reported</time_frame>
    <description>The OCD-VAS is a one-item unipolar scale to assess OCD symptoms over a rapid time frame (&quot;No obsessions&quot; to &quot;Constant obsessions&quot;). The scale ranges from 0-10 with higher scores indicating higher presence of obsessions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Challenge Scale (Y-BOCCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, Day 1-14, 3-Month; Baseline and Day 14 pre-specified to be reported</time_frame>
    <description>The Y-BOCCS is self-report scale which assesses OCD symptoms on a 5-point likert scale (&quot;None&quot; to &quot;Extreme&quot;). It consists of 10 items which are summed up to derive the total Y-BOCCS score. The total score ranges from 0-40 with higher scores indicating higher prevalence of OCD symptoms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             (i.e., currently the most severe and in need of treatment) and have had OCD for at&#xD;
             least six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant must score ≥ 16 on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale&#xD;
             (CYBOCS) prior to entering the study, report at least moderate severity of obsessions&#xD;
             and/or compulsions..&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant must have tried and failed at least one adequate trial of SRI medications&#xD;
             or clomipramine and a course of CBT unless the participant is unable to access or&#xD;
             tolerate CBT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In order to meet criteria for having had at least one adequate trial of SRI&#xD;
                  medication, participants must have been on a stable and minimal adequate dose of&#xD;
                  at least one SRI medication or clomipramine as defined by the literature for at&#xD;
                  least 12 weeks, and have a documented history of intolerable adverse effects at a&#xD;
                  higher dose as evaluated by the study psychiatrist and are therefore unable to&#xD;
                  increase the dose or complete the full 12 weeks, or have refused further SRI&#xD;
                  trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Congruent with the literature, the range of minimally adequate doses to treat OCD are&#xD;
             as follows: Clomipramine (Anafranil) 75-100 mg/day; Fluoxetine (Prozac) 20-60 mg/day;&#xD;

             Fluvoxamine (Luvox) 100-200 mg/day; Citalopram (Celexa) 20-40 mg; Escitalopram&#xD;
             (Lexapro) 10-20 mg/day for a minimum of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In order to meet criteria for having had an adequate course of CBT for OCD,&#xD;
                  patients should have received at least 8 sessions of Exposure and Response&#xD;
                  Prevention Therapy (EX/RP) by a licensed clinician trained in doing CBT for OCD.&#xD;
                  A CBT expert on our team will ensure that the clinician administering these&#xD;
                  exposures has had adequate training and experience in providing this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant is off all psychotropic and other types of drugs likely to interact with&#xD;
             glutamate for at least 14 days before starting the study. The exceptions are SRI&#xD;
             medications and short acting benzodiazepines for distressing anxiety or insomnia&#xD;
             (which can be taken up to 24 hours prior to ketamine infusion). Participants will be&#xD;
             off neuroleptics for 1 month and off fluoxetine for 6 weeks prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For participants younger than 18, written informed assent by the participant and&#xD;
             consent by the parent. For participants 19 and older, written consent by the&#xD;

             disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder, psychosis due to general medical&#xD;
             condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severely depressed patients with the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) ≥ 60 or&#xD;

             relapsing-remitting symptom course, a temporal association between symptom&#xD;
             exacerbations and a Group-A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection, association&#xD;

        <description>The CY-BOCS is a semi-structured measure of OCD severity with excellent inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. It is validated in those starting at age 7 and used in studies up to age 20. The CYBOCS differs from the adult YBOCS only in its use of simpler language. The CY-BOCS consists of 10 items which are summed up to derive the total CY-BOCS score. The total score ranges from 0-40 with higher scores indicating greater severity of OCD symptoms.</description>
