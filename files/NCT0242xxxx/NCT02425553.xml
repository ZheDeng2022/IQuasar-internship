  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reflux and dyspeptic symptoms are common affecting 10-20% of the population on a regular&#xD;
      basis. Reflux symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation are caused by the return of acid&#xD;
      or non-acid gastric contents into the esophagus. Dyspeptic symptoms are caused by abnormal&#xD;
      gastric relaxation (impaired accommodation) or increased sensitivity of the stomach to&#xD;
      distension during the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of diet on gastrointestinal function are debated and the efficacy of dietary&#xD;
      management for digestive symptoms has not been established. Epidemiological studies suggest&#xD;
      an effect; however, it is not possible to distinguish the effects of fat intake and total&#xD;
      energy (i.e. calorie) intake in this work. This issue has been addressed by small&#xD;
      physiological studies. The results show that esophageal acid exposure was related to total&#xD;
      calorie intake but not to fat content. In contrast, the number of reflux symptoms was 40%&#xD;
      higher after the high-fat than the low-fat meals. Similar findings were found for the&#xD;
      relationship between gastric distension, fullness and dyspeptic symptoms by Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging. Thus, it appears that fat does not cause digestive dysmotility but&#xD;
      heightens sensitivity to visceral events and so increases the number and severity of symptoms&#xD;
      reported by patients. As yet, these findings have not been confirmed in larger, more&#xD;
      representative surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the effects of food, there are inconsistent findings regarding the effects of&#xD;
      alcohol on gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and gastric function. Physiological studies have&#xD;
      noted delayed gastric emptying and an increase in reflux events when alcohol is taken with&#xD;
      food. However, larger surveys have not confirmed that alcohol triggers reflux or dyspeptic&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed observational, dietary study with cross-over design will assess the independent&#xD;
      effects of energy intake (i.e. calorie load) and fat intake on gastric fullness, the number&#xD;
      and severity of reflux and dyspeptic symptoms after meals. The effect of alcohol on symptoms&#xD;
      after the high calorie, high fat meals will also be documented. The study population of&#xD;
      senior academics attending a conference are likely to have a relatively high prevalence of&#xD;
      risk factors for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) being predominantly male, with an&#xD;
      older age and a larger waist circumference than average in the general community. This will&#xD;
      increase study power and relevance of the findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will provide new information concerning the impact of dietary factors and alcohol&#xD;
      on digestive symptoms after meals. This data will inform future guidelines for the dietary&#xD;
      management of patients with reflux and dyspeptic symptoms after meals which will be relevant&#xD;
      in both primary and secondary care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, dietary study with cross-over design. Restaurant style meals and&#xD;
      beverages are provided to faculty and delegates attending the Ascona II conference that agree&#xD;
      to participate and provide written consent. Approximately 120 participants are expected to be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On four consecutive days the evening meal served will vary in calorie load and fat content&#xD;
      using the established, partially balanced study design applied in previous studies. On the&#xD;
      first three days fruit juice will be served, whereas, on the final day, an alcoholic beverage&#xD;
      with the same acidity and number of calories will be served. All meals will have the same&#xD;
      size and salt content. Controlling for all these parameters will reduce possible confounding&#xD;
      factors in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High calorie (1200 kcal), High fat (50% energy), 400 ml juice (230 kcal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High calorie (1200 kcal), Low fat (20% energy), 400 ml juice (230 kcal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low calorie (600 kcal), Low fat (20% energy), 400 ml juice (230 kcal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. High calorie (1200 kcal), High fat (50% energy), 300 ml wine (40 g alcohol, 230 kcal),&#xD;
           100 ml water Note: The order of meals on day 1-3 will be fixed, but not necessarily in&#xD;
           the order above. Meal constituents will not be disguised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Testing digestive symptoms in response to diet on successive days is possible because&#xD;
      clinical physiological studies have shown no evidence of a sequence effect in previous&#xD;
      studies using similar test meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alginate-antacid preparation will be available as required for acute relief of any reflux&#xD;
      or dyspeptic symptoms (Gaviscon Liquid, Reckitt Benckiser (available across-the-counter for&#xD;
      this indication in Switzerland)). No participant is required to take this preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence and severity of fullness, reflux and dyspeptic symptoms will be recorded&#xD;
      contemporaneously by participants for three hours after each of the four test meals using a&#xD;
      mobile application (SymTrack, Gastric Imaging &amp; Analysis GmbH, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland). Paper&#xD;
      forms will be made available for those without a mobile device. Three hours is the period of&#xD;
      time during which reflux and dyspeptic symptoms are most often reported after meals. Positive&#xD;
      reporting bias will be minimized by automatic reminders sent to the participants by the&#xD;
      SymTrack every 30 minutes for three hours to remind participants to document the severity of&#xD;
      symptoms including, if appropriate, an absence of symptoms. The use of the rescue medication&#xD;
      to treat reflux and dyspeptic symptoms during the study will also be documented on the&#xD;
      SymTrack. Symptoms and use of the rescue medication that occur after this three hour period&#xD;
      up to 12 hours (i.e. the following morning) will be documented as part of safety follow-up&#xD;
      data; however these will not contribute to primary or secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All faculty and delegates will be invited to participate in this observational, dietary&#xD;
      study. The investigators expect to recruit all, or nearly all, of those attending. The fixed&#xD;
      menu provided every night by the restaurant will be the same whether the attendee does or&#xD;
      does not participate in the study (unless specific dietary requirements are present).&#xD;
      Involvement of almost all attendees will reduce selection bias; however, selection bias will&#xD;
      remain because the group of clinical academics is not wholly representative of the general&#xD;
      population. Note that the study population is predominantly male, with an older age and a&#xD;
      larger waist circumference than the average in the community. These are all risk factors for&#xD;
      reflux disease. This should increase study power to show treatment effect and the clinical&#xD;
      relevance of findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All those attending the Centro Stefano Franscini conference centre in Ascona take their&#xD;
      evening meal together. The cost of these meals is included in the registration package. This&#xD;
      is a fixed menu with non-alcoholic drinks (alcohol is available to purchase). No other food&#xD;
      is available on site except for individuals that have registered special dietary&#xD;
      requirements. If other food is wanted, then this is available nearby in the town of Ascona.&#xD;
      This local organizational arrangement with the provision of fixed meals free of charge will&#xD;
      encourage compliance with the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participants do not adhere to the meal and beverages set out in the study protocol&#xD;
      then this can be documented using the SymTrack. To assess compliance, the participant will&#xD;
      respond to the questions &quot;did the patient consume the study meal?&quot;, &quot;did the patient take&#xD;
      additional food?&quot;, &quot;did the patient consume the study beverage?&quot;, and &quot;did the patient take&#xD;
      additional alcoholic drinks?&quot;. Failure to comply with study procedures will not preclude the&#xD;
      individual from participating on the following days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study analysis will investigate associations between number symptoms and caloric&#xD;
      and fat content of the meals. It will be expressed as odds ratio. There will be a qualitative&#xD;
      description of the deviation from study protocol. For example if participants report drinking&#xD;
      alcohol during or after the meal on days 1-3 this will be expressed as a percentage&#xD;
      deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary variables plus other outcomes of interest will be documented using&#xD;
      a mobile application (SymTrack; Gastric Imaging and Analysis GmbH, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland).&#xD;
      Paper symptom diaries will be available for those participants without access to a&#xD;
      smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival at the meeting each attendee that agrees to participate and signs Written Informed&#xD;
      Consent will be given personal instructions as to the operation of the mobile application.&#xD;
      Should any difficulties remain then investigators, including those involved in the&#xD;
      development of the app, will be on hand to assist participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the Written Informed Consent is signed the participants will be given a unique username&#xD;
      and password to allow them to log into the SymTrack and start entering screening information&#xD;
      and symptoms. This username will allow the identification of study participant as data is&#xD;
      entered and ensure effective monitoring of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be performed following study completion. The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      number of reflux or dyspeptic symptoms. Odds ratio will be computed to describe the&#xD;
      association of the number of symptoms with the meal calorie load and fat content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are the severity of reflux and the severity of dyspeptic symptoms as well&#xD;
      as sensation of fullness after each test meal. Analogue to the primary outcome an odds ratio&#xD;
      will be computed to describe the association of these outcomes with the meal calorie load and&#xD;
      fat content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An odds ratio will be computed to describe the association of the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes with the ingestion of alcohol after the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional analysis will be performed to identify factors - other than composition of the&#xD;
      test meal - that increase the likelihood of reporting reflux and dyspeptic symptoms after&#xD;
      meals (e.g. age, gender, BMI and low quality of life score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control questions that describe the study compliance will be described using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of data acquired in this study originates from electronic sources. Screening&#xD;
      data and symptoms entered via the smartphone are immediately transferred over an encrypted&#xD;
      channel to the server and stored in a MySQL-database. Both the server application and the&#xD;
      database are hosted on a professional application hosting provider located in Switzerland.&#xD;
      The server application and the database design are developed and tested by Gastric Imaging &amp;&#xD;
      Analysis GmbH. The software version used during this study will be tested using&#xD;
      semi-automated functional tests and load tests. Study principal investigator (Mark Fox) is&#xD;
      responsible for all data stored in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with ethical principles, internal&#xD;
      monitoring will be carried out regularly throughout the study. At the screening the internal&#xD;
      monitor will review the protocol, and the database and all other aspects of the study with&#xD;
      the investigator and other staff. Monitoring will be carried out early in the study and again&#xD;
      after the last subject has completed the study. During monitoring, the monitor will verify&#xD;
      compliance with the protocol and amendment(s), review the signed informed consent forms,&#xD;
      diverse logs and all other source data. Direct access to all study-related site and source&#xD;
      data/documents is mandatory for the monitoring review. Study team staff must be made&#xD;
      available to answer any queries during the monitoring process.&#xD;
