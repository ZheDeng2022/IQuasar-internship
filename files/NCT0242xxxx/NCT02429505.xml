      This study is a prospective observational study in which patients undergoing treatment for&#xD;
      leishmaniasis with miltefosine (Impavido) in the US and who weigh &gt; 75 kg can volunteer to&#xD;
      provide information about their clinical response to treatment up to 6 months after the start&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

      Objective: The purpose of this observational study is to fulfill PMR 2127-4 for the&#xD;
      miltefosine NDA (204684): implement a higher-weight-patient registry for the time period Mar&#xD;
      2015-Mar 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This study is a prospective observational study in which patients undergoing&#xD;
      treatment for leishmaniasis with Impavido in the US and who weigh &gt; 75 kg can volunteer to&#xD;
      provide information about their clinical response to treatment up to 6 months after the start&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Leishmaniasis patients treated with Impavido who weigh more than 75 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug name: Impavido (50 mg capsules). Dosing regimen: as per the Impavido Product Label&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: Patients who weigh more than 75 kg will become aware of the Impavido&#xD;
      Higher-Weight Patient Registry via the Impavido website. By calling 1-866-588-5405, the&#xD;
      patient will be connected to the Impavido Higher-Weight Patient Registry Coordinating Center.&#xD;
      A trained staff member will acquaint the patient with the goals and procedures of the study.&#xD;
      If the patient tentatively agrees to participate in the study over the telephone, the patient&#xD;
      will be mailed information forms, the Consent/Assent Forms, and the Consent for the patient's&#xD;
      physician to release medical information. Receipt of the two signed Consent and/or Assent&#xD;
      Forms by the Coordinating Center will signify patient consent. The Coordinating Center will&#xD;
      contact the patient's physician at the end of treatment, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after&#xD;
      completing treatment, to collect data on efficacy and adverse effects (only during&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Study Duration: Estimated 3-10 patients per year for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Baseline data, compliance to prescribed treatment, and outcomes will be reported&#xD;
      for individual patients and for all patients.&#xD;
