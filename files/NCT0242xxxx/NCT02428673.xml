  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with neuromuscular disabilities and limited ambulation are at significant risk for&#xD;
      decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased incidence of fracture. This is caused, in&#xD;
      part, by low levels of load experienced by the skeleton due to a child's functional&#xD;
      limitations. Low BMD has been shown to be predictive of fracture, and in fact, fractures&#xD;
      usually occur without significant trauma in children with neuromuscular conditions. The&#xD;
      discomfort and distress from fractures in this population are considerable, and the&#xD;
      associated costs to the family and healthcare system are substantial. Numerous interventions&#xD;
      have been devoted to improving BMD in these children. Stationary assisted standing devices&#xD;
      are widely used and represent the standard-of-care. However, evidence supporting this&#xD;
      approach is limited due to inadequate study designs with insufficient numbers of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use load-sensing platforms in patients with neuromuscular conditions.&#xD;
      Successful completion of this pilot study will assist in the development of a future&#xD;
      multicenter clinical trial to definitively determine relationships, if any, between passive&#xD;
      standing and measures of BMD, fracture incidence, pulmonary function, and health-related&#xD;
      quality-of-life measures in children with a variety of neuromuscular disabilities (e.g.,&#xD;
      spinal muscular atrophy, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, Rett syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Assisted standing treatment program will gradually increase their duration of&#xD;
      standing by up to 75% after the baseline phase.&#xD;

      Children with neuromuscular disabilities and limited ambulation are at significant risk for&#xD;
      decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased incidence of fracture. This is caused, in&#xD;
      part, by low levels of load experienced by the skeleton due to a child's functional&#xD;
      limitations. Low BMD has been shown to be predictive of fracture, and in fact, fractures&#xD;
      usually occur without significant trauma in children with neuromuscular conditions such as&#xD;
      cerebral palsy, spinal muscular atrophy, or other muscular dystrophies. The discomfort and&#xD;
      distress from fractures in this population are considerable, and the associated costs to the&#xD;
      family and healthcare system are substantial. Numerous interventions have been devoted to&#xD;
      improving BMD in these children. Stationary assisted standing devices are widely used and&#xD;
      represent the standard-of-care. However, evidence supporting this approach is limited due to&#xD;
      inadequate study designs with insufficient numbers of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various modifications are added to assisted-standing devices to allow children with&#xD;
      neuromuscular impairments to achieve standing postures. These customizations lead to&#xD;
      load-sharing with the standing device, and consequently, a decrease in the amount of load&#xD;
      passing through the lower extremities. Previous investigators developed custom-made&#xD;
      load-measuring sensors to quantify the amount of load borne by the lower extremities while in&#xD;
      passive standers, and found that the actual load varied from 23-102% of the child's body&#xD;
      weight. These load-measuring sensors were specifically developed for restricted laboratory&#xD;
      testing, rather than recording the load magnitude and duration of standing in any brand of&#xD;
      standing device during daily use at home, school or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously developed load-sensing platforms that accurately measure loads experienced by&#xD;
      the lower extremities of children with cerebral palsy in passive standers. These platforms&#xD;
      can be incorporated into any stander design, are able to be used on a routine basis at a&#xD;
      child's home, school or therapy, and are able to record the duration of weight-bearing to&#xD;
      monitor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use these load-sensing platforms in patients with neuromuscular conditions.&#xD;
      Successful completion of this pilot study will assist in the development of a future&#xD;
      multicenter clinical trial to definitively determine relationships, if any, between passive&#xD;
      standing and measures of BMD, fracture incidence, pulmonary function, and health-related&#xD;
      quality-of-life measures in children with a variety of neuromuscular disabilities (e.g.,&#xD;
      spinal muscular atrophy, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, Rett syndrome).&#xD;
