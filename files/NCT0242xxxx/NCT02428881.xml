      Hypothesis / aims of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary retention is uncommon in young women, and one cause is a primary disorder of urethral&#xD;
      sphincter relaxation, characterised by an elevated urethral pressure profile and specific&#xD;
      findings in the urethral sphincter EMG (Fowler's Syndrome). Women may present with symptoms&#xD;
      of obstructed voiding or complete urinary retention. Clean intermittent self-catheterisation&#xD;
      is often painful to perform and currently, the only treatment to show benefit is sacral&#xD;
      neuromodulation. This aim of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of urethral sphincter&#xD;
      injections of botulinum toxin, defined as improvement of flow rates by more than 50%,&#xD;
      improvement in residual volume and scores on the IPSS questionnaire, and safety, in women&#xD;
      with Fowler's Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, materials and methods In this open label pilot institutional review board&#xD;
      approved study, ten women with a primary disorder of urethral sphincter relaxation (elevated&#xD;
      urethral pressure profile (UPP), sphincter volume and abnormal EMG) presenting with&#xD;
      obstructed voiding (n=5) or in complete urinary retention (n=5) are recruited from a single&#xD;
      tertiary referral centre. Baseline symptoms are being assessed using the IPSS questionnaire,&#xD;
      and urinary flow and post-void residual volume were measured. After 2% lidocaine injection,&#xD;
      100U of onabotulinumtoxintypeA is being injected into the striated urethral sphincter,&#xD;
      divided on either side, under EMG guidance. Patients are being reviewed at weeks 1, 4 and 10&#xD;
      post-treatment and symptoms are reassessed using the IPSS questionnaire, and urinary flow and&#xD;
      post-void residual volume are being measured. The UPP is being repeated at week 4.&#xD;

      Full Title: Open label pilot study to treat women with chronic urinary retention or voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction due to a primary disorder of sphincter relaxation (Fowler's syndrome) with&#xD;
      outpatient urethral injections of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Title: Botulinum toxin A injections in patients with Fowler's Syndrome Rationale: The&#xD;
      department of Uro-Neurology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery attracts&#xD;
      approximately 300 new female patients with urinary retention referred from all over the UK a&#xD;
      year. A retrospective study showed the commonest diagnosis was a primary abnormality of the&#xD;
      striated urethral sphincter or Fowler's syndrome. Fowler's syndrome (FS) is due to an&#xD;
      intrinsic muscle disorder causing the muscle to be in a state of constant contraction and is&#xD;
      recognized by needle electromyography (EMG) of the striated muscle. In the original&#xD;
      description the EMG abnormality was frequently observed in women with clinical features of&#xD;
      polycystic ovaries, leading to the hypothesis that the electromyographic abnormality was a&#xD;
      consequence of a hormonal abnormality, since it is known that the female urinary sphincter is&#xD;
      hormonally dependent. The ongoing abnormal EMG activity is thought to lead to a sustained and&#xD;
      involuntary contraction of the sphincter that has a secondary effect of inhibiting detrusor&#xD;
      contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of FS is made by finding the characteristic abnormal activity on EMG recording&#xD;
      but the findings of an abnormally raised urethral pressure profile and an enlargement of the&#xD;
      striated urethral sphincter muscle on ultrasound have been shown to be additional valuable&#xD;
      investigations. The only treatment found so far to restore voiding is sacral neuromodulation.&#xD;
      This is an expensive, resource intensive surgical intervention, subject to a high revision&#xD;
      rate (53%). An alternative management option would be welcomed both by patients and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sphincter injection of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) was first used to treat detrusor sphincter&#xD;
      dyssynergia following spinal injury when inappropriately timed but qualitatively normal EMG&#xD;
      activity occurs in the sphincter with detrusor contraction. However some recent publications&#xD;
      have reported a restoration of detrusor function after sphincter injections of botulinum&#xD;
      toxin A in women with non-neurological conditions, although insufficient detail is given in&#xD;
      those papers to know if the patients had FS. Although, Fowler used sphincter botulinum toxin&#xD;
      injections 15 years ago in an attempt to treat that condition it was concluded then that the&#xD;
      intervention was not effective. This was possibly because a much lower dose was used compared&#xD;
      with the recently reported successful studies, in which 100 U Botox速 were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this small scale, open label pilot study is to obtain data about the&#xD;
      response of women with a definite diagnosis of FS after an injection of 100 U Botox速 (BoNT-A)&#xD;
      into the striated urethral sphincter. If there is evidence for a positive response the data&#xD;
      will form the basis for a future large scale, placebo controlled, grant funded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: 5 women with complete urinary retention due to the abnormality of sphincter&#xD;
      relaxation demonstrated to be characteristic of FS and 5 women with the same sphincter&#xD;
      abnormality but with obstructed voiding will be fully studied to document the severity and&#xD;
      extent of their sphincter-bladder dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment assessment will include the standard investigations appropriate for women with&#xD;
      complete urinary retention or obstructed voiding which have been shown to be&#xD;
      characteristically abnormal in FS. These are urine flow rate (if voiding), cystometry,&#xD;
      urethral pressure profile, sphincter volume. The definitive diagnosis rests on the findings&#xD;
      of sphincter EMG and as this test is uncomfortable it will be possible to combine the&#xD;
      necessary EMG recording with the injection of the Botox速 if the patient consents to enter the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection treatment will be an outpatient procedure (estimated to take less than 15&#xD;
      minutes): following 1ml of 1% or 2% lignocaine injected either side of the urethral orifice,&#xD;
      100 U Botox速 dissolved in 2mls of saline will be injected, 1ml on each side into the striated&#xD;
      urethral sphincter under EMG control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of BoNT-A injected into other striated muscle is known to have an onset within 3-4&#xD;
      days and duration of action of 6 weeks. The patients will therefore be followed up at 1, 4,&#xD;
      and 10 weeks following treatment with flowmetry and ultrasound residual volumes and IPSS&#xD;
      questionnaire. The pre intervention investigations of cystometry, urine flow rate (if&#xD;
      voiding) and residual volume measured by ultrasound, urethral pressure profile will be&#xD;
      repeated at 4 weeks. Sphincter EMG will only be repeated in patients who have shown a highly&#xD;
      significant response i.e. restoration of detrusor contraction in women who previously had&#xD;
      complete urinary retention or elimination of post void residual volume in women with&#xD;
      obstructed voiding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in urinary flow rates (as assessed by uroflowmetry and measured in mL/sec)&#xD;
           by more than 50% after botulinum toxin compared to baseline in women with obstructed&#xD;
           voiding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Restoration of voiding (either yes or no) after botulinum toxin for women in complete&#xD;
           urinary retention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of post void residual urine (as assessed by bladder scan and measured in mL)&#xD;
           compared to baseline after botulinum toxin. A reduction to less than 100mls would be&#xD;
           considered clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms as assessed by an improvement in scores on&#xD;
           the IPSS (International Prostate Symptom score) questionnaire&#xD;
