    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of v-akt murine thymoma&#xD;
      viral oncogene homolog (Akt)/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1(ERK) inhibitor ONC201 and to&#xD;
      see how well it works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has returned&#xD;
      after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine recommended phase II dose for oral ONC201 (Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201) in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase I) II. To identify toxicities associated&#xD;
      with oral ONC201 in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase I) III. To determine&#xD;
      the objective response rate to ONC201 in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase&#xD;
      II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral ONC201 following administration. (Phase I)&#xD;
      II. To observe the anti-tumor effects of oral ONC201, if any occur, in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase I) III. Confirm tolerability of recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose. (Phase II) IV. Assess clinical outcomes associated with ONC201 treatment in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase II) V. Correlate clinical outcome with tumor and&#xD;
      serum biomarkers. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 orally (PO) on day 1 of every cycle or day 1 of&#xD;
      every week. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
