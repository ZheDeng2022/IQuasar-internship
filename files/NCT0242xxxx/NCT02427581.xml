  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most important consideration in the design of this clinical trial is to ensure the safe&#xD;
      translation of the personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) dictates that initial studies of biologic therapies be performed in such&#xD;
      a way that there is a balance between the potential risks and benefits in individual&#xD;
      patients. Consistent with these recommendations, the investigators will target patients with&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer who do not have a pathologic complete response after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These patients typically have no gross evidence of disease&#xD;
      following standard of care therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy)&#xD;
      but are at extremely high-risk for disease recurrence. Targeting this patient population&#xD;
      provides a window-of-opportunity to design and manufacture the personalized cancer vaccines,&#xD;
      maximizes the potential benefit from the vaccine as the regulatory networks associated with&#xD;
      metastatic disease are not present, and balances risk in this patient population with&#xD;
      extremely high risk for disease recurrence but no other treatment options.&#xD;

    <description>Each subject will receive a single synthetic long peptide vaccine on Days 1, 4, 8, 15, 22, 50, and 78.&#xD;
The first five injections must take place within +/- 1 day window and the remaining injections must take place within a +/- 2 week window.&#xD;
The synthetic long vaccine is reconstituted in up to four pools (A, B, C, and D). At each vaccination time point, each of the up to four pools will be administered to one of the four limbs (A - Right Arm, B - Left Arm, C - Right Leg, and D - Left Leg) by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Alternative anatomical locations for patients who are status post complete axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection or other contraindications that prevent injections to a particular extremity are the left and right midriff, respectively. The same pool should be administered to the same limb across doses.</description>

             study only if the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer&#xD;
             survivor is eligible provided the following criteria are met: (1) patient has&#xD;
             undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies, (2) patients have&#xD;
             been considered disease free for at least 1 year (with the exception of basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;

             complicated by study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive status. These patients are ineligible because of the potential&#xD;
             inability to generate an immune response to vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a strong likelihood of non-adherence such as difficulties in adhering to&#xD;
             follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the Siteman Cancer Center should&#xD;
             not knowingly be registered.&#xD;
