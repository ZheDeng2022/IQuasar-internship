      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      outpatient study evaluating the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in subjects 6 to 12 years&#xD;
      of age with ADHD using 2 doses of dasotraline (2 mg/day and 4 mg/day) versus placebo over a 6&#xD;
