  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WHISH trial applies state-of-the science behavioral principles and currently available&#xD;
      technologies to deliver a physical activity intervention without face-to-face contact to&#xD;
      ~25,000 older U.S. women expected to consent. It includes the National Institute of Aging&#xD;
      (NIA) Go4Life® Exercise &amp; Physical Activity materials 3 and WHISH developed targeted&#xD;
      materials based on Go4Life® to provide inspirational tips and recommendations about how to&#xD;
      achieve nationally recommended levels of PA and overcome barriers to exercise, with a means&#xD;
      for self-monitoring and setting personal goals. The intervention builds upon evidence-based&#xD;
      behavioral science principles and intervention components that have proven to be effective in&#xD;
      increasing PA in older women, with innovative adaptive approaches to tailoring the delivery&#xD;
      to meet individual (personal) needs.&#xD;

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Short Performance Battery (SPPB). Scoring uses the Look AHEAD methods that were based on Health ABC (Simonsick EM, Newman AB, Nevitt MC, et al. Measuring higher level physical function in well-functioning older adults: expanding familiar approaches in the Health ABC Study. J Gerontol Med Sci. 2001;56A,M644-M649.) The SPPB score is sum of three ratios, the Standing Balance Ratio (SBRatio), the Chair Stand Ratio (CSRatio), and the Usual Walk Ratio (UWRatio). The results are in a continuous score ranging from 0 to 3. s (balance, gait speed, stair stand) are each scored 0 or 1 with the three scores summed for an SPPB score of 0 to 3 from lowest to highest physical function. Implemented in a subset.</description>

    <description>The Physical Activity Intervention Group will receive guidance on being physically active, including aerobics, flexibility, balance, strength, and decreased sedentary time. The primary resource is the National Institute of Aging Go4Life exercise and physical activity materials. The materials are based on the United States national guidelines for physical activity for older adults</description>

    <description>The PA intervention will consist of a multimodal activity program of aerobics, balance, strength, flexibility. The intervention will involve encouraging participants to increase all forms of PA throughout the day and to decrease sedentary time, such as sitting. This may include activities such as leisure sports, gardening, use of stairs instead of escalators, leisurely walks with friends, and less use of remote control devices.The intervention is conducted primarily by mail with website support and resources available.</description>
