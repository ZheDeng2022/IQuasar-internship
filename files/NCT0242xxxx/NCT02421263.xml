  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current protocol is a pilot study of the effects and possible utility of&#xD;
      psilocybin-facilitated experiences for professional religious leaders. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      religious professionals, given their interests, training, and life experience, will be able&#xD;
      to make nuanced discriminations of their psilocybin experiences, thus contributing to the&#xD;
      scientific understanding of mystical-type experience. As we better characterize the&#xD;
      phenomenology of psilocybin-induced mystical experiences, we may apply this knowledge to&#xD;
      improve potential treatment studies in the future. A primary objective is to investigate&#xD;
      changes in psychological functioning, spirituality, health, well-being, prosocial attitudes&#xD;
      and behavior in professional religious leaders that may occur after receiving psilocybin&#xD;
      under supportive conditions. A secondary objective is to determine whether participants who&#xD;
      report having had the strongest mystical-type effects during psilocybin sessions will show&#xD;
      the largest positive changes in the Interim Questionnaire.&#xD;

      This randomized-controlled pilot study uses a wait-list control design. A wait-list design&#xD;
      includes a control group that is assigned to a waiting list to receive an intervention after&#xD;
      the active treatment group does. In this study, the active group will receive the psilocybin&#xD;
      at weeks 5 and 9 and the wait-list control group will receive psilocybin at weeks 30 and 34.&#xD;
      The wait-list control group serves the purpose of providing an untreated comparison for the&#xD;
      active treatment group, while at the same time allowing the wait-list participants an&#xD;
      opportunity to obtain the intervention at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's procedures include screening, preparatory meetings, psilocybin sessions, and&#xD;
      follow-up assessments. A large battery of behavioral and psychological measures will be&#xD;
      assessed throughout. The study team will consent and enroll up to 86 subjects to obtain a&#xD;
      total of 12 completer participants as well as 2-3 family members or friends per study&#xD;
      participant who can assess said completers on the Observer Rating Form (COM-R). This number&#xD;
      will account for screen-failures and dropouts as well. The 12 participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either an immediate participation group (N=6) or a 6-month delayed participation&#xD;
      group (N=6). Although statistical power calculations show that 12 participants will be&#xD;
      sufficient to detect the major effects anticipated in this study, the sponsor of this study&#xD;
      (The Council on Spiritual Practices) is concurrently funding Johns Hopkins University School&#xD;
      of Medicine to conduct a methodologically identical study with 12 additional participants&#xD;
      (IND #59009). This will permit the two sites to collaborate post study completion and combine&#xD;
      the data from the two studies to provide statistical power to detect even more subtle effects&#xD;
      of the psilocybin intervention. Twelve volunteers (6 from each group) will participate at&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins and 12 at New York University. Randomization and data analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted at New York University.&#xD;
