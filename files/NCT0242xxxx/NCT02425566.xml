  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of the abdominal veins (splanchnic&#xD;
      capacitance) and the sympathetic nervous system in human hypertension. The investigators will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that constriction of abdominal veins due to sympathetic activation&#xD;
      contributes to human hypertension. Splanchnic capacitance will be assessed in normotensive&#xD;
      and hypertensive subjects at baseline and during acute blockade of the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The splanchnic circulation contains a highly compliant venous bed which normally stores ~25%&#xD;
      of the blood volume, and receives up to 25% of the resting cardiac output. It is highly&#xD;
      innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, and this neural regulation results in large&#xD;
      volume shifts that modulate blood pressure (BP). The splanchnic circulation may play a role&#xD;
      in hypertension as suggested by studies showing that surgical splanchnic denervation&#xD;
      effectively lowered BP in hypertensive subjects without affecting renal function. Recently,&#xD;
      studies in animal models have shown that splanchnic sympathetic activation, particularly to&#xD;
      capacitance vessels, was critical to the development of hypertension. The clinical&#xD;
      translation of these findings to human hypertension has lagged behind because of limitations&#xD;
      in previously available experimental approaches. The investigators propose to use splanchnic&#xD;
      radionuclide plethysmography and sympathetic withdrawal with the ganglionic blocker&#xD;
      trimethaphan to overcome these limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that sympathetic activity contributes to hypertension.&#xD;
      Accordingly, our previous studies showed that sympathetic withdrawal with the ganglionic&#xD;
      blocker trimethaphan resulted in normalization of BP in hypertensive subjects. Interestingly,&#xD;
      this was caused mainly by a fall in stroke volume, rather than a decrease in arterial&#xD;
      vascular resistance suggesting that decreased venous return may play a major role, and that a&#xD;
      sympathetically mediated contraction of splanchnic capacitance contributes to the maintenance&#xD;
      of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the decrease in BP induced by autonomic blockade with&#xD;
      trimethaphan results from an increase in splanchnic capacitance leading to a reduction in&#xD;
      venous return. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will compare the effect of&#xD;
      sympathetic withdrawal on splanchnic capacitance between hypertensive and normotensive&#xD;
      subjects. Splanchnic venous capacitance will be measured by radionuclide plethysmography.&#xD;
      Abdominal blood volumes will be measured using labeled red cells with technetium-99 while&#xD;
      applying different levels of continuous positive airway pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will assess whether changes in splanchnic capacitance measured&#xD;
      by bioimpedance are similar to those measured by radionuclide imaging. For this purpose, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare the effects of nitroglycerin on splanchnic capacitance measured by&#xD;
      the two techniques.&#xD;

For analysis, the Y-intercept (volume) and the slope of the P-V relationship during autonomic blockade adjusted by their corresponding baseline values will be compared between groups.</description>
