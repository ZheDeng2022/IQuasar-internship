    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if urelumab given in combination with&#xD;
      rituximab can help to control CLL or SLL. The safety of the drug combination will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive rituximab by&#xD;
      vein over 4-6 hours on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 43, and 64 of each 84 day (12 week) cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive urelumab by vein over about 1 hour on Days 2, 23, 44, and 65 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 2-week period between each study cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 43, and 64 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 2, 29, 36, 50, 57, 71, and 78 of each cycle, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be&#xD;
      drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each cycle (about Day 85):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT or PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood draws, CT scans (or PET scans) and/or bone marrow aspiration and biopsies&#xD;
      at any time that the doctor thinks it is needed while you are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 2 cycles of study drugs. However, your study doctor may allow you to&#xD;
      receive the study drugs beyond Cycle 2. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if&#xD;
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow&#xD;
      study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taken off study for any reason, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and CT or PET&#xD;
           scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you are no longer on study, 1 time every month:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and&#xD;
      CT or PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff may ask you to take part in other MD Anderson clinical research study&#xD;
      (PA13-0291) for additional research testing. The study doctor will discuss this with you and,&#xD;
      if you decide to take part, you will sign a separate consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Urelumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      Rituximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with CLL.&#xD;
      The use of these drugs in combination is investigational. The study doctor can explain how&#xD;
      the drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or localized&#xD;
             prostate cancer. If patients have another malignancy that was treated within the last&#xD;
             2 years, such patients may be enrolled if the likelihood of requiring systemic therapy&#xD;
             for this other malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%, as determined by an expert&#xD;
             in that particular malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center and after consultation with&#xD;

             abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated&#xD;
             with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere&#xD;
             with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate&#xD;
