      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability of ascending single intraarticular doses of GZ389988 in&#xD;
      patients with painful osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ascending single intraarticular doses of&#xD;
      GZ389988 in patients with painful OA of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain preliminary pharmacodynamic evaluation of ascending single intraarticular doses of&#xD;
      GZ389988 in patients with painful OA of the knee.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Screening will be performed within 28 days of dosing. Following the single dose of study&#xD;
      medication, the study period for each patient will be 84 ± 7 days up to the end-of-study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration for one patient will be up to 17 weeks (up to the end-of-study visit), not&#xD;
      including the long term observational safety follow-up by phone call for 12 additional weeks.&#xD;
