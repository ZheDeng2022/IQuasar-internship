  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the known link between dietary patterns and disease, it has been observed that the&#xD;
      specific response of each individual to dietary components highly varied, and this may limit&#xD;
      the impact of the nutritional interventions to improve public health. These observations&#xD;
      provided the basis to the development of the Nutritional Genomics at the beginning of the&#xD;
      90s, which main goal was to study the interaction between dietary factors and the genome that&#xD;
      modulate phenotypic expression. From this idea, in the recent years, Precision Nutrition has&#xD;
      been emerged as a therapeutic approach that takes into account all individual's&#xD;
      characteristics to develop targeted nutritional advices. The main goal of Precision Nutrition&#xD;
      is to maintain or improve health by using genetics, phenotypic, clinical, dietary and other&#xD;
      information to provide more precise and more efficacious personalized healthy eating advice&#xD;
      and to motivate appropriate dietary changes. However, all the genotype-dependent advice must&#xD;
      be based on scientific evidence. Most of the available evidence in support of personalized&#xD;
      nutrition has come from observational studies with risk factors as outcomes, and it was&#xD;
      needed randomized controlled trials using clinical endpoints to ratify these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the Platform for Clinical Trials in Nutrition and Health (GENYAL) is to&#xD;
      contribute to Precision Nutrition Research by the construction, for the first time, of a&#xD;
      human gene and phenotype database to be used in: 1) The evaluation of the efficacy of&#xD;
      different foods, functional foods and bioactive compounds capsules on general population and&#xD;
      by genotypes and 2) The performance of nutritional genetics and nutrigenomics studies. For&#xD;
      that purposes, GENYAL has a permanent recruitment of volunteers, which are phenotypically and&#xD;
      genotypically characterized, and give consent to be contacted to perform clinical trials and&#xD;
      nutritional intervention studies. Therefore, GENYAL may help to increase the existing&#xD;
      knowledge for moving along to Nutritional Genomics research to its practical application in&#xD;
      Precision Nutrition; contributing in the improvement in health and disease prevention through&#xD;
      dietary recommendations based on the genome.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At the beginning and before 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The validated Spanish version of the MLTPAQ is used to quantitatively measure the average physical activity practice (kcal/day) by the volunteers. Based on the Compendium of physical activities (PA), Energy Expenditure in Physical Activity (EEPA) is estimated as follows: EEPA = I x N x T; where &quot;I&quot; is the degree of intensity for each physical activity in kcal/min; &quot;N&quot;, the number of times that physical activity is developed; and &quot;T&quot;, the time in minutes spent in each session.&#xD;
The MLTPAQ is administered to assess the quality of PA according to their intensity code: low (intensity code of &lt;=4 kcal/min), moderate (4.5-5.5 kcal/min) and high (&gt;=6 kcal/min).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical activity pattern according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning and before 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity (PA) is assessed using the validated Spanish version of the IPAQ.&#xD;
The continuous score is expressed as metabolic equivalents (MET)-min per week: MET level x minutes of activity x events per week.&#xD;
The pattern of PA is classified into 3 categories in accordance with the intensity:&#xD;
Low: the lowest level of physical activity.&#xD;
Moderate: any one of the following criteria: &gt;=3 days of vigorous activity of at least 20 min/day or &gt;=5 days of moderate-intensity activity or walking of at least 30 min/ day or &gt;=5 days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET-min/week.&#xD;
High: any one of the following criteria: vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 MET-min/week or &gt;=7 days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 3000 MET-min/week.</description>
