  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination treatment of protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitor, afuresertib, with androgen&#xD;
      synthesis enzyme inhibitor, LAE001, may provide an effective treatment for metastatic&#xD;
      castration resistant prostate cancer (m-CRPC) patients who have progressed/drug resistant&#xD;
      following prior standard care treatments of any anti-androgen. This study intends to identify&#xD;
      the most appropriate combined doses of LAE001/prednisone and afuresertib in m-CRPC patients&#xD;
      who have progressive disease or are intolerant of 2 prior standard treatments of any&#xD;
      anti-androgen or anti-androgen treatment plus chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I part of this study will perform a dose-escalation to identify the recommended&#xD;
      Phase II dose of LAE001/prednisone plus afuresertib in m-CRPC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase II part of this study, the anti-tumor efficacy of LAE001/prednisone plus&#xD;
      afuresertib and docetaxel/prednisone plus afuresertib will be assessed in mCRPC patients with&#xD;
      PTEN loss and/or PIK3CA/AKT/PTEN alteration who have progressed on, or who are intolerant of,&#xD;
      1-3 prior standard treatments for mCSPC, or nmCRPC, or mCRPC, including at least one&#xD;
      antiandrogen treatment and no more than one chemotherapy. Participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two study cohorts, based on the investigator's clinical judgement. Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      receive LAE001/prednisone plus afuresertib using RP2D established in the Phase I study.&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will receive docetaxel/prednisone plus afuresertib, with a safety run-in period&#xD;
      during the first cycle in the first 6 patients. These study results will provide preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy and safety information of the combination of LAE001/prednisone plus afuresertib and&#xD;
      docetaxel/prednisone plus afuresertib as requested in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      combined therapy guideline. Whether to move one or both combination therapies to the pivotal&#xD;
      study will be based on the PFS improvements of the combination therapy versus historical&#xD;
      controls of abiraterone or docetaxel monotherapies in mCRPC patients who failed 1-3 lines of&#xD;
      standard of care therapies.&#xD;
