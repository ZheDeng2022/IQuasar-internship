    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to analyse if live video as a supplement to emergency calls can&#xD;
      improve medical dispatchers' situation awareness and enhance the assistance they provide&#xD;
      including provision of pre-hospital resources. Focus will also be on evaluating the&#xD;
      unconscious patient and improve CPR quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general experience from the medical dispatcher and the person calling the emergency&#xD;
      number regarding the feasibility of adding live video will also be analysed.&#xD;

      Setting; The study will be conducted in Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services (EMS), which&#xD;
      covers a population of approximately 1.84 million people and an area of 2559 km2. In case of&#xD;
      an emergency, there is a single emergency phone number (1-1-2) to a call center that&#xD;
      identifies the need for police, fire or medical assistance. If the problem is medical, the&#xD;
      caller is re-directed to the EMS where medical dispatchers answer, process and respond to the&#xD;
      call by activating the appropriate EMS response and delivering medical advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every emergency call, the medical dispatcher starts by asking the caller about the nature&#xD;
      of the problem and whether the patient is awake and breathing normally. In case of suspected&#xD;
      cardiac arrest, the dispatcher follows a guideline for dispatcher assisted cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation based on the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines for Resuscitation. The&#xD;
      medical dispatchers are specially trained registered nurses or paramedics with experience&#xD;
      within emergency care. They all have a basic life support course and advanced course in&#xD;
      DA-CPR. Their decision-making process is supported by a criteria-based, nationwide Emergency&#xD;
      Medical Dispatch System (Danish Index), which is a validated tool for managing emergency&#xD;
      calls for the most urgent cases of emergencies. The instructions in DA-CPR is divided into&#xD;
      two depending on whether the bystander have received a basic CPR course (BLS course). If the&#xD;
      bystanders have a BLS course they are also instructed in ventilation. Instructions to lay&#xD;
      people consist of short commands. E.g., &quot;place the victim in the supine position&quot;. All&#xD;
      medical dispatcher has a metronome available to support they guidance. The medical dispatcher&#xD;
      guide bystander until ambulance arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods; When the medical dispatcher receives an emergency call they decide emergency&#xD;
      priority level, dispatch vehicle type and competence allocation and guide in CPR as before&#xD;
      the study. Afterwards then can add livestreaming to the emergency call. Each medical&#xD;
      dispatcher can choose in which emergency call they want to add live video, but they are&#xD;
      recommended to do it with all unconscious patients including cardiac arrest after bystander&#xD;
      CPR is started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical solution; For livestreaming of video footage the dispatcher sends a text message,&#xD;
      asking the caller to give their consent to share stream video from their camera on their&#xD;
      smartphone. When the caller confirms consent, the smartphone automatically starts securely&#xD;
      transmitting a video live stream from the scene back to the medical dispatcher. When the&#xD;
      emergency call is finished the link will be inactivated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and outcome; All medical dispatchers will participate. After each emergency&#xD;
      call with stream of live video the medical dispatcher fills out a questionnaire about their&#xD;
      evaluations of the patient before and after live video, if the live video resulted in changed&#xD;
      treatment of the patient, or different response. Emergency priority level, emergency&#xD;
      response, date and time for the call and symptom-based criteria from Danish Index (1-39&#xD;
      items) will be collected from the dispatch system Logis CAD and compared with emergency calls&#xD;
      without use of live video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The person calling the emergency number 1-1-2 and accepted transmission of live video to the&#xD;
      emergency medical dispatcher will afterwards receive a text message with a questionnaire&#xD;
      about their experience. We will collect data for aprox. 500 emergency calls where live video&#xD;
      is added to the call including around 200 cases with unconscious patients and 53 cases with&#xD;
      cardiac arrest patients. We will analyse the change in CPR quality before the medical&#xD;
      dispatcher assist in CPR using live video and after the medical dispatcher has assisted. The&#xD;
      first evaluation of CPR quality will be as soon as possible from the streamed video and the&#xD;
      after score will be registered when the CPR is optimized as much as possible.&#xD;
