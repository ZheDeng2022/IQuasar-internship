      This trial will test the effectiveness of delivering medication for opioid use disorder&#xD;
      (MOUD) pre-treatment via telehealth, alone and with peer navigation, to increase MOUD&#xD;
      initiation and maintenance in the community following jail release. This trial will focus on&#xD;
      incarcerated women in 6 experimental and 3 control sites in Kentucky. Enrollment is not open&#xD;
      to the general public.&#xD;

      This study will incorporate random assignment for two study conditions: medication for opioid&#xD;
      use disorder (MOUD) PreTreatment Telehealth or MOUD PreTreatment Telehealth with Peer&#xD;
      Navigation using a rigorous randomized block design. Women in the experimental conditions&#xD;
      will be stratified by sites (6 sites; 3 urban and 3 non-urban) and by offender classification&#xD;
      level of felony versus misdemeanor (due to potential differences in community supervision).&#xD;
      Three comparison sites with existing jail-based MOUD treatment for women will not be&#xD;
      randomized but will be included in analyses within planned, non-randomized comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MOUD PreTreatment Telehealth: Participants who screen positive for moderate to high-risk&#xD;
           opioid use and complete the baseline interview will be connected via telehealth to the&#xD;
           community MOUD provider for a psychosocial assessment. The study data coordinator will&#xD;
           assist with linking the participant to the community MOUD provider via telehealth, as&#xD;
           well as collecting initial in-person biological specimens for medical evaluation. The&#xD;
           psychosocial assessment with the community MOUD provider will involve a more detailed&#xD;
           examination of OUD using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)&#xD;
           5 criteria. Type of medication (naltrexone, buprenorphine, or methadone) will depend on&#xD;
           the psychosocial assessment and medical evaluation. Indications for the most appropriate&#xD;
           course of treatment will be determined by the community MOUD provider in conjunction&#xD;
           with the study participant. Women in this condition will also receive general education&#xD;
           about MOUD options including risks and benefits, and they will be given the opportunity&#xD;
           to ask questions about the medication. The community MOUD provider will also use&#xD;
           motivational interviewing to assess each woman's readiness to engage in MOUD and to&#xD;
           better understand possible barriers to MOUD utilization. At the end of the education&#xD;
           session, the study participant and the MOUD community provider will develop a re-entry&#xD;
           plan for ongoing care, which will include a plan for insurance coverage of medications&#xD;
           in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MOUD PreTreatment Telehealth + Peer Navigation: In addition to MOUD PreTreatment&#xD;
           Telehealth, women in this arm will be connected with a peer, a woman in recovery who is&#xD;
           employed by Voices of Hope (VOH) in Lexington, KY. Peer Navigators will be located in&#xD;
           Lexington through a partnership with VOH. VOH is a non-profit recovery support&#xD;
           organization which provides peer recovery support services. In conjunction with the&#xD;
           study data coordinators, the Peer Navigator will schedule an initial session via&#xD;
           telehealth with the participant, assist with scheduling a follow-up appointment with the&#xD;
           community MOUD provider, and provide recovery support for community MOUD initiation and&#xD;
           maintenance. Peer Navigators will be certified Peer Support Specialists trained and&#xD;
           supervised by VOH in accordance with state statutory requirements. When a woman returns&#xD;
           to the community, Peer Navigators will engage her in weekly telephone recovery services&#xD;
           (TRS) for 12 weeks, which may include identifying personal goals and strength-based,&#xD;
           practical strategies for success. In addition to MOUD linkages to care, Peer Navigators&#xD;
           will suggest strategies to maintain sobriety and improve recovery capital, including&#xD;
           safe housing, transportation, financial counseling, continued education, employment&#xD;
           skills, and sober social activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Services as Usual: Women in this arm will not be randomized, but will receive substance&#xD;
           abuse treatment as usual in three comparison jail sites. Each of these jails has a&#xD;
           women's substance abuse program (SAP) managed by the Kentucky Department of Corrections&#xD;
           (KY-DOC with the option to initiate MOUD prior to jail release. These programs operate&#xD;
           as modified therapeutic communities with transitional support following release.&#xD;
