  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rocha (2017), published a systematic review and meta-analysis highlighting the clinical&#xD;
      utility of frailty scales for the prediction of post-operative complications. The results of&#xD;
      the review of 15 studies show that, overall, frailty significantly increases the risk for&#xD;
      developing adverse outcomes such as, mortality, morbidity and extended length of hospital&#xD;
      stay. However, different frailty scales showed different prevalence of frailty even when&#xD;
      tested in the same population, which means that future studies are required for a better&#xD;
      understanding of frailty tools. Early detection of frailty may provide a window of&#xD;
      opportunity for intervention and a key factor to determine clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate that this project will allow the creation of a registry to&#xD;
      describe our population in terms of the presence or absence of frailty. The investigators&#xD;
      will use validated measures to determine existence of frailty prior to interventional cardiac&#xD;
      procedures (PRISMA-7, Edmonton and FRIED Frailty Index). The measures will be repeated at 6&#xD;
      weeks and 6 months post procedure. Clinical data will also be collected to assess any links&#xD;
      between frailty and clinical outcomes. Data collection sheets will be designed, data will be&#xD;
      entered and analyzed by a statistician.. If the data provides meaningful insight, the&#xD;
      investigator will aim to create a specific frailty tool for the cardiac population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are also keen to understand the effects of health-related quality of life&#xD;
      on frailty and will be collecting generic data via the SF-36 and EQ5-D. In order to assess&#xD;
      the lived experience of frailty, the investigators are proposing a qualitative interview for&#xD;
      15 willing patients, to allow the exploration of the concepts of frailty in more detail for&#xD;
      patients who have undergone a cardiac intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The totality of the data collection will help the study team examine care pathways and assess&#xD;
      any areas of concern, which may be addressed for the benefit of patients in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once we have gathered data to define the population in terms of frailty and the impact of&#xD;
      frailty on health-related quality of life, the investigators aim to adapt the services to&#xD;
      accommodate the needs of frail patients undergoing heart procedures. This may involve amended&#xD;
      pre-admission care which may influence discharge planning, depending on the nature of the&#xD;
      individual patients. An integrated care pathway (ICP) is a step by step approach to patient&#xD;
      care which also considers the requirements of research, training, resources, clinical&#xD;
      governance and performance. It is anticipated that an amended ICP may be created for patients&#xD;
      with frailty. . This initial project will form part of a longer-term plan to assess and&#xD;
      manage frailty in a systematic process.&#xD;
