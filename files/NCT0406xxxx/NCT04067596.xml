  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The very large sizes can be very disabling and at the origin of a difficult psychological&#xD;
      experience. Some families are in demand for a growth-curbing treatment. Currently, only&#xD;
      hormonal treatments are offered in France but they are at the origin of many side effects.&#xD;
      Northern European countries applied a surgical technique, deviated from the one used for a&#xD;
      long time in leg asymmetries, to sterilize the proximal tibial and distal femoral growth&#xD;
      cartilage, with most of the growth taking place at this level. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      be able to offer this technique to families in demand.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      By &quot;very large size&quot; we mean a size greater than +3 SD (standard deviation) on the updated&#xD;
      French reference curves. Most of the very large sizes are constitutional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step in the management of the paediatrician endocrinologist with very large body&#xD;
      height is to collect the auxological parameters (family height, not just parental height,&#xD;
      birth height, weight, height, head circumference, body mass index, height, sitting height)&#xD;
      and plot the corresponding adolescent growth curves. The clinical stage (interview, clinical&#xD;
      examination) will attempt to rule out a diagnosis other than a very large constitutional&#xD;
      size: a recent statural acceleration related to a hormonal cause with specific medical&#xD;
      treatment (hyperthyroidism or hyper androgeny or early puberty or acromegaly or more rarely&#xD;
      estrogen deficiency by mutation of the CYP19A1 aromatase gene or by mutation of the ERα&#xD;
      receptor) and will seek a syndrome in which the very large size is a sign among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the main syndromes are Klinefelter's syndrome (prevalence 1 person/1,200 or 1/600 boy&#xD;
      births), Marfan's syndrome (about 1/6,000 births, prevalence 1 to 5 persons/ 10000), triple X&#xD;
      syndrome (1 to 5 persons/10,000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional examinations will be guided by diagnostic hypotheses; the very large&#xD;
      constitutional diagnosis remains a diagnosis of elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The very large constitutional size is defined as family, i.e. related to the size of at least&#xD;
      1 of the 2 parents or close family members of the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target size can be calculated as an indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target size =[father size (cm) + mother size (cm) +13] /2 for boys&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target size =[father size (cm) + mother size (cm) -13] /2 for girls However, experience&#xD;
           shows that the target size is a poor prognostic tool in very large constitutional sizes:&#xD;
           growth is always above it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very large constitutional size remains the most frequent diagnosis among etiological&#xD;
      diagnoses of very large sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic question follows the diagnostic stage. Only very large sizes secondary to a&#xD;
      hormonal cause can benefit from specific medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outside these situations, a therapeutic discussion will be proposed based on the size&#xD;
      prognosis estimated by the pediatrician endocrinologist. In the event of a predicted very&#xD;
      large size and if this represents an inconvenience for the adolescent, the paediatrician&#xD;
      endocrinologist may propose a growth-blocking treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very large sizes can be disabling and cause a difficult psychological experience, so some&#xD;
      families are in need of growth-restricting treatment, especially girls who consult more often&#xD;
      and earlier than boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimation of adult prognosis by the pediatrician endocrinologist, formerly based on&#xD;
      Bayley and Pinneau's tables, has been replaced by more modern software integrating Greulich&#xD;
      and Pyle's tables, Tanner Whitehouse 2 and 3, and taking into account parental sizes and&#xD;
      ethnic origin. This automated reading of bone maturation makes it possible to be more&#xD;
      accurate in predicting final size, an essential step before any therapeutic discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the international literature (mainly the United States, Northern Europe and Australia) it&#xD;
      is relatively consensual to consider a growth-blocking treatment for a prognosis ≥185 cm for&#xD;
      girls and ≥ 200 cm for boys. For our study, we will use a prognosis ≥ 184 cm for girls and ≥&#xD;
      198 cm for boys, which corresponds to a size of +3 SD on the updated French curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently in France, the therapeutic possibilities to slow down growth and thus reduce the&#xD;
      final adult size are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Either medical treatments: excluding MA and causing many side effects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or surgical treatments: performed anecdotally in France and based on publications from&#xD;
           Northern Europe.&#xD;

    <description>The procedure consists of sterilizing the growth cartilage of the various localizations (distal femur and proximal tibia).&#xD;
Under general anesthesia under scopic control, the growth cartilage will be approached from both sides in order to curse the growth zone.&#xD;
This procedure is monitored throughout the procedure with iterative X-rays, to ensure complete curettage of the growth cartilage. The average duration of the intervention is 1 hour and a half.&#xD;
At the end of the procedure, there will be on each limb, 2 operative scars on each side of the knee, 8 scars in all.&#xD;
Closing will be done with resorbable stitches A simple dressing will be applied to each scar and a Zimmer splint in extension will be installed postoperatively to limit the painful mobilizations in acute phase.</description>
