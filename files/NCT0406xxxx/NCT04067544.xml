      This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility to conduct a study of acupuncture treatment&#xD;
      (AT) for Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) at Huntsman Cancer Institute and&#xD;
      to investigate changes in physiological biomarkers when using acupuncture to treat CIPN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most common and disabling&#xD;
      complications of cancer chemotherapy. CIPN is a major cause of morbidity and reduced quality&#xD;
      of life among cancer survivors due to pain, gait instability, and fall related injury. Up to&#xD;
      60% of patients receiving potentially neurotoxic chemotherapeutics develop CIPN, 40% of whom&#xD;
      have persistent neuropathy after termination of chemotherapy. CIPN commonly necessitates dose&#xD;
      reduction or cessation of therapy, potentially limiting treatment efficacy and likely&#xD;
      impacting patient outcomes.First-line treatments include anticonvulsants, tricyclic&#xD;
      antidepressants, selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) and&#xD;
      topical lidocaine. Second-line treatments include opioids. Given the risk of abuse, overdose&#xD;
      and addiction, treatments besides opioids are advised and warrant investigation. A multimodal&#xD;
      approach may be most effective, with acupuncture being a safe option reporting low rates of&#xD;
      adverse events. Acupuncture treatment (AT) is a well-tolerated and safe treatment option&#xD;
      frequently used for symptoms associated with cancer therapies such as nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      xerostomia and fatigue. Several case series and small uncontrolled trials of AT for CIPN&#xD;
      suggest potential efficacy, although well-designed and powered clinical trials are lacking&#xD;
      and mechanisms underlying AT's potential efficacy are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although drug-induced damage to the peripheral nervous system is well recognized in CIPN, the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) also shows concomitant involvement. Much of our current&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of central pain processing in chronic painful conditions&#xD;
      such as diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, post-herpetic neuralgia and chronic low&#xD;
      back pain has utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Previous pain-related&#xD;
      functional studies identified alterations in brain activation in multiple cortical and&#xD;
      subcortical regions including the frontal lobe, insular cortex, somatosensory cortex,&#xD;
      thalamus, periaqueductal grey and precuneus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While fMRI has not yet been used to evaluate mechanisms of action of AT in the context of&#xD;
      CIPN, an increasing number of studies have applied fMRI to investigate AT over a wide range&#xD;
      of pain disorders. Stimulation of acupuncture points is associated with overlapping activity&#xD;
      in cortical and subcortical brain regions, including the insula, thalamus, anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, and deactivation in&#xD;
      limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network. Acupuncture can modulate activity within specific&#xD;
      brain areas, many of which are known to be important to CIPN pain processing. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that regions involved in pain perception will show decreased&#xD;
      connectivity between the insula, amygdala and somatosensory cortex with successful pain&#xD;
      treatment, with decreased task-related activation of the brain's salience network (anterior&#xD;
      cingulate and frontal insula) during mental pain imagery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, neurological evidence indicates that some of the brain regions activated during&#xD;
      pain perception are also activated when engaging in interoceptive awareness. Acupuncture has&#xD;
      been shown to alter pain processing regions but has not been evaluated regarding changes in&#xD;
      mind-body awareness. The possible role of enhanced mind-body awareness as a mechanism of&#xD;
      action of acupuncture has not yet been tested. This pilot study will provide a preliminary&#xD;
      fMRI and questionnaire data for this topic. Clinical trials of interventions such as&#xD;
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy demonstrate increased interoceptive awareness and&#xD;
      decreased depression. It seems plausible that AT may provide an opportunity for participants&#xD;
      to increase their mind-body awareness while they lie on the treatment table and relax, as&#xD;
      well as via neurologic changes in the insula, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex. These&#xD;
      regions are known to affect pain processing as well as interoceptive (or mind-body)&#xD;
      awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot feasibility study aims to determine if conducting a trial of AT for CIPN is&#xD;
      feasible at HCI. The investigators aim to enroll and retain twenty participants who will&#xD;
      undergo fMRI during the baseline visit, receive 10 sessions of AT, and undergo fMRI after&#xD;
      completion of AT. The investigators will examine fMRI for potential neurologic mechanisms of&#xD;
      action of AT in CIPN management. The ultimate objective of this pilot project is to lay the&#xD;
      foundation for a future randomized controlled clinical trial of AT for CIPN. Specifically,&#xD;
      the investigators will be able to demonstrate that the investigators have the team and&#xD;
      location in place to conduct a successful trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will receive 10 acupuncture treatments over the course of 8 weeks with a&#xD;
      baseline fMRI done prior to receiving acupuncture treatments and a final fMRI done after the&#xD;
      completion of acupuncture treatments. Participant will receive questionnaires before fMRI,&#xD;
      acupuncture treatments following final fMRI and at a 3 month follow up time point. (See below&#xD;
      for more detail.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Primary Objectives and Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the feasibility to conduct a trial of AT for CIPN + standard of care therapy.&#xD;
      Primary feasibility objectives will be evaluated in terms of recruitment (enrollment of 20&#xD;
      women, average of 2 eligible women per month to participate in the trial, identification of&#xD;
      appropriate recruitment strategies, the appropriateness of eligibility criteria), retention&#xD;
      (70% or more participants comply with 8 or more AT sessions and complete both fMRI scans),&#xD;
      safety (zero serious adverse events directly related to AT) and questionnaire completion (70%&#xD;
      or more enrolled participants comply with all data collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.1 Primary outcome measures: Mean enrollment, completion rate of AT, fMRI, rate of serious&#xD;
      adverse events, rate of questionnaire completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Secondary Objectives and Endpoints To evaluate the impact of AT on the reported&#xD;
      experience of CIPN. 1.2.1 To evaluate central pain processing and cortical connectivity in&#xD;
      patients with CIPN treated by acupuncture by analyzing fMRI of all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.2 To evaluate if there is any change in patient-reported measures from before AT to after&#xD;
      study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll female patients who have completed treatment with paclitaxel or&#xD;
      docetaxel at least three months prior. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are neurotoxic chemotherapies&#xD;
      known to cause CIPN. Patients must have experienced at least one month of altered sensation&#xD;
      and/or pain with a score of greater than or equal to 20 for CIPN on the sensory subscale of&#xD;
      the CIPN-20. The investigators will commence recruitment 3 months after patients have&#xD;
      completed their last paclitaxel or docetaxel dose. Patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Huntsman Cancer Center Oncology Clinics in collaboration with their oncologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, enrollment will be limited to patients with breast, ovarian, cervical,&#xD;
      endometrial, or uterine cancer with CIPN and completed paclitaxel or docetaxel treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible subjects will be scheduled for a screening visit. After informed consent&#xD;
      is obtained, the SC will review and confirm inclusion/exclusion criteria. The SC will take a&#xD;
      brief medical and neurological history and administer the CIPN-20 questionnaire. If all&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled, the subject will proceed to baseline visit.&#xD;
      This visit may occur on the same day as screening, but must occur within 2 weeks of study&#xD;
      screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with breast, ovarian, cervical, endometrial, or uterine cancer who were&#xD;
      treated with paclitaxel or docetaxel chemotherapy associated with CIPN will undergo a number&#xD;
      of questionnaires/exam scales designed to assess neuropathic symptoms and the effect of&#xD;
      neuropathy on quality of life. The patient will then be enrolled in the study and scheduled&#xD;
      in the Wellness Center for acupuncture therapy (AT). All participants will be scheduled for&#xD;
      fMRI , which must occur within nine days after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo study interview and fMRI within 9 days after baseline following&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data and clinical data including current medications and medical history and fall&#xD;
      rates will be gathered during the baseline visit. Questionnaires (BPI, CIPN-20, CIPN-R-ODS,&#xD;
      MAIA-2) will be completed in person or emailed to patients via REDCap at baseline. Reminder&#xD;
      calls and AT appointments will be scheduled by HCI Wellness and Integrative Health Center&#xD;
      personnel in conjunction with a SC. The SC will aid participants in scheduling fMRI&#xD;
      appointments online. AT treatments will occur within 7 days/4 business days in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 10 sessions of AT: twice per week for 2 weeks, thereafter once per&#xD;
      week for six weeks, with a total of 10 treatments during a two-month course. Each session&#xD;
      will last 45-60 minutes, with acupuncture needles retained 30-40 minutes. A minimum of 8&#xD;
      treatments must be received by each participant with no more than 9 days' gap between weekly&#xD;
      treatments permitted (sessions 5-10). Concurrent medications are allowed as prescribed and&#xD;
      will be tracked in the study and analyzed as potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo examination within one week of AT completion. This will include the&#xD;
      fMRI scan and questionnaires. Compensation for participation will be offered following the&#xD;
      completion of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be completed in person or emailed to patients via REDCap at baseline and&#xD;
      study conclusion, as well as at a 3-month follow-up. Primary Endpoints: Mean enrollment,&#xD;
      percentage completion rate of all study procedures, frequency count of serious adverse&#xD;
      events, and percentage of enrolled participants completing questionnaires will be calculated.&#xD;
      Data will be collected via REDCap and analyzed with SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional measures to be collected: CIPN-20: This measure includes questions about tingling,&#xD;
      numbness, painful numbness, cramps, balance, temperature intolerance, grasping items, ankle&#xD;
      flexion weakness and leg weakness. CIPN-R-ODS (a validated measure of quality of life&#xD;
      specific to CIPN), will be used to assess impact on function, BPI to assess pain and&#xD;
      Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA-2) to assess mind-body&#xD;
      awareness. The investigators will also collect demographic information including age, marital&#xD;
      status, race and ethnicity, current medications and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture therapy (AT): AT will be delivered onsite at HCI in the Linda B. and Robert B.&#xD;
      Wiggins Wellness &amp; Integrative Health Center. AT will be delivered twice per week for two&#xD;
      weeks and then weekly for six weeks by Annie Budhathoki, DAOM, a Licensed Acupuncturist who&#xD;
      has over five years' clinical experience treating persons with cancer, or another Licensed&#xD;
      Acupuncturist in the Wellness &amp; Integrative Health Center. Each session will last 45-60&#xD;
      minutes, with acupuncture needles retained 30-40 minutes. A minimum of 8 treatments must be&#xD;
      received by each participant with no more than 9 days' gap between weekly treatments&#xD;
      permitted (sessions 5-10). .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI (fMRI) to be conducted within 9 days after baseline and within 1 week of final&#xD;
      AT session. fMRI scans will be conducted at Imaging and Neuroscience Center (INC) in Research&#xD;
      Park. Imaging will consist of structural brain imaging (MP2RAGE), task fMRI, and&#xD;
      resting-state fMRI connectivity. Task fMRI will consist of a mental imagery task with a&#xD;
      20-second block design wherein patients will alternate between concentration on a part of&#xD;
      their body where they experience pain and a part of their body where they do not experience&#xD;
      pain, prompted by visual cues. The investigators will provide gift cards for $25 after the&#xD;
      completion of the second fMRI and questionnaires associated with this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations: Demographic data, clinical data including current medications and&#xD;
      medical history and fall rates will be gathered.&#xD;
