      IMAGINE is a Phase II, randomized, two-arm, chemotherapy controlled modular trial in subjects&#xD;
      with histologically confirmed, resectable gastric cancer (GC) or adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction (AEG). Up to 22 patients will be included in each arm of the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will determine the rate of pathological complete responses (pCR) as determined by&#xD;
      pathological examination of the resected tumor following preoperative systemic therapy. A pCR&#xD;
      rate of 15% is expected with neoadjuvant FLOT chemotherapy. An increase to 35% is estimated&#xD;
      to be clinically relevant when patients are treated with either nivolumab in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Arm B) or nivolumab and another immuno-oncology (IO) agent (relatlimab) in Arm&#xD;
      D. Additional objectives include resection rate, diseasefree survival (DFS), median overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), patient's quality of life (QoL), and safety and tolerability of the treatment.&#xD;
      Furthermore, translational endpoints will be investigated.&#xD;
