  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double - blind study of 200 male and female volunteers&#xD;
      with gastritis diagnosed at the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital Gastroenterology Outpatient&#xD;
      Clinic from October 2019 to July 2020. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a non-inferiority study, the hypothesis is that the use of oral Aroeira (Schinus&#xD;
      terebinthifolius raddi), associated with amoxicillin and clarithromycin, for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with gastritis and dyspeptic symptoms has similar efficacy and safety&#xD;
      (non-inferior) and/or superior efficacy and safety to traditional therapy based on the use of&#xD;
      omeprazole-associated antibiotic therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a non-inferiority study, the hypothesis is that the use of oral Aroeira (Schinus&#xD;
      terebinthifolius raddi), associated with amoxicillin and clarithromycin, for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with gastritis and dyspeptic symptoms has similar efficacy and safety&#xD;
      (non-inferior) and/or superior efficacy and safety to traditional therapy based on the use of&#xD;
      omeprazole-associated antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, unicenter, clinical trial for patients who are diagnosed&#xD;
      with H pylori gastritis and have associated dyspeptic symptoms seen at the Oswaldo Cruz&#xD;
      University Hospital Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic in Recife / PE, Brazil. October 2019&#xD;
      to July 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to verify the hypothesis that treatment with oral Aroeira, amoxicillin and&#xD;
      clarithromycin has similar (not inferior) and/or superior efficacy and safety than treatment&#xD;
      with omeprazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin, a sample of 200 patients was defined,&#xD;
      keeping the proportion 1: 1, which will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test group with 100 patients undergoing treatment with:&#xD;
&#xD;
           oral Aroeira (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, 640mg / tablet) 1 tablet every 12 hours +&#xD;
           amoxicillin 2 500mg tablets every 12 hours + clarithromycin 1 tablet 500mg every 12&#xD;
           hours for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group with 100 patients undergoing treatment with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      omeprazole 1 20mg tablet every 12 hours + amoxicillin 2 500mg tablet every 12 hours +&#xD;
      clarithromycin 1 tablet 500mg every 12 hours for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, patients will answer the sociodemographic questionnaire, which&#xD;
      includes identification data, concomitant presence of chronic diseases and time of onset of&#xD;
      symptoms. Patients will also respond to the symptom questionnaire. At the time of upper&#xD;
      digestive endoscopy and pathological examination, which will be performed before and after&#xD;
      treatment completion, patients will have their results graded endoscopically, using the&#xD;
      Sydney criteria and according to the Sydney Histological Classification. After performing the&#xD;
      second upper digestive endoscopy and pathological examination, professionals will be&#xD;
      instructed to answer questionnaires to evaluate the endoscopic and histological response to&#xD;
      treatment. At the end of treatment, patients will respond to a specific treatment response&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
