  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-frequency brain rhythms in the alpha (8-14Hz) and beta (15-29Hz) bands are strong&#xD;
      predictors of perception and functional performance in a range of tasks, and are disrupted in&#xD;
      several disease states. The purpose of this study is to investigate a direct causal&#xD;
      relationship between low-frequency brain rhythms and sensory perception, and to optimize&#xD;
      commonly used TMS paradigms to impact sensory processing and perception in a similar manner&#xD;
      as endogenous rhythms. To do so, this study combines human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG), non-invasive brain stimulation (transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation; TMS), and biophysically principled computational neural modeling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies have shown that high power low-frequency brain rhythms in the alpha (8-14) and&#xD;
      beta (15-29 Hz) bands in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) are associated with a decreased&#xD;
      probability of perceiving tactile stimuli at perceptual threshold, and can be modulated with&#xD;
      attention. Furthermore, high power beta activity in SI emerges as brief &quot;events&quot; (&lt;150ms) in&#xD;
      un-averaged data, the rate and timing of which underlie the attentional and perceptual&#xD;
      effects associated with high beta power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, human electroencephalography (EEG) and a non-painful tactile detection task&#xD;
      are used to assess if and how the rate and timing of ongoing rhythmic events in the&#xD;
      alpha/beta bands prior to a tactile stimulus causally impact touch perception, and how this&#xD;
      relates to attention. A custom TMS protocol that is hypothesized to mimic endogenous&#xD;
      beta-frequency event patterns is used to test whether TMS can impact perception in a similar&#xD;
      manner. Finally, computational neural modeling designed to simulate macro-scale EEG signals&#xD;
      is used to aid in the interpretation of potential neural circuit mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      features of acquired EEG data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMS-EEG components of this study will use a within-subjects crossover design. In initial&#xD;
      study sessions, participants will have an MRI. In subsequent study sessions, participants&#xD;
      will complete a tactile detection task while EEG data is recorded concurrent with online&#xD;
      active or sham TMS. Analyses will focus on comparing detection probabilities of tactile&#xD;
      stimuli presented at perceptual threshold and tactile evoked response potential waveforms&#xD;
      between trials in which TMS pulses or endogenous beta events occur with similar timing and&#xD;
      intensity.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will complete an initial MRI. MRIs are subsequently used for TMS neuronavigation (region of interest targeting). There is no intervention applied during the MRI session.&#xD;
In two subsequent concurrent TMS-EEG sessions, all participants will receive active TMS while carrying out a tactile detection task. During one of the two TMS-EEG sessions, TMS will be applied over primary somatosensory cortex. During the other TMS-EEG session, TMS will be applied over a control brain region.&#xD;
The order of somatosensory vs. non-somatosensory TMS targeting will be counterbalanced across participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Threshold-level tactile detection</measure>
