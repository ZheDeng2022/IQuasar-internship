      The SEEQUOIA-AHF (Safety and Efficacy of Early, seQUential oral dIuretic nephron blockAde in&#xD;
      Acute Heart Failure) trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm trial&#xD;
      assessing the impact of early sequential nephron blockade (i.e. a regimen based on the&#xD;
      combination of four oral diuretics with different sites of action along the nephron at low&#xD;
      doses) compared to a conventional approach with a high-dose loop diuretic in the treatment of&#xD;
      congestion in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, after 24-72 hours of high-dose intravenous furosemide started at the time of&#xD;
      hospital admission, patients admitted with AHF will be randomized to open-label oral&#xD;
      treatment with either low-dose sequential nephron blockade or high-dose furosemide for 96&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point will be the bivariate change in body weight and serum creatinine value&#xD;
      at 96 hours since randomization. Secondary endpoints will include clinical (e.g., total&#xD;
      change in body weight during hospitalization, change in dyspnea score at 96 hours since&#xD;
      randomization, 30-day readmission rate) and laboratory (e.g., change in BNP or NT-proBNP at&#xD;
      discharge vs randomization) parameters, and safety (e.g., change in serum creatinine value at&#xD;
      discharge versus randomization and up to 30 days from discharge) issues.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The SEEQUOIA-AHF trial is aimed at ascertaining if the early, oral administration of a&#xD;
      combination of four diuretics with different sites of action along sequential nephron&#xD;
      segments (i.e., sequential nephron blockade: proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule,&#xD;
      cortical collecting duct) may achieve greater decrease in body weight and lower increase in&#xD;
      serum creatinine values as compared with standard of care, i.e. a conventional diuretic&#xD;
      therapy regimen based on high-dose oral furosemide. To assess the efficacy and safety of an&#xD;
      early sequential nephron blockade, the study intervention will be initiated 24-72 hours after&#xD;
      an algorithm-based treatment with high-dose intravenous furosemide started at the time of&#xD;
      hospital admission to achieve patient stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 24-72 hours of algorithm-based treatment with high-dose intravenous furosemide,&#xD;
      eligible patients will be randomized to either control (furosemide-only) or intervention&#xD;
      (early sequential nephron blockade) arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be put on a low sodium diet (&lt; 70 mEq/24 hours), and will be allowed a&#xD;
      fluid intake of &lt; 1 L/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization patients will be started on oral diuretic therapy according to two&#xD;
      different approaches, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High-dose oral furosemide-only arm A furosemide oral dose equivalent to twice the&#xD;
           intravenous dose of the last 24 hours will be given in two daily divided doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unless serum potassium value is higher than 5.0 mEq/L, oral spironolactone or potassium&#xD;
           canrenoate will be added; dose will be established based on serum creatinine value Oral&#xD;
           or intravenous potassium supplementation (potassium chloride at least 24 mEq/day) will&#xD;
           be started if serum potassium value is lower than 4.0 mEq/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Early sequential oral diuretic nephron blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Furosemide A furosemide oral dose equivalent to the previous 24-hour intravenous&#xD;
                dose will be given in two divided doses&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Metolazone. Dose will be established based on serum creatinine value&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Acetazolamide. Dose will be established based on serum creatinine value&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Spironolactone or Potassium Canrenoate. Unless serum potassium value is higher than&#xD;
                5.0 mEq/L, oral spironolactone or potassium canrenoate will be added; dose will be&#xD;
                established based on serum creatinine value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, if within the first 48 hours since randomization urine output is lower than 1.5&#xD;
      L/day and/or body weight decrease is less than 0.5 Kg/day, the oral dose of furosemide will&#xD;
      be doubled, or the patient will be switched to intravenous administration at the discretion&#xD;
      of the attending physician. If urinary output exceeds 50 ml/Kg/day current furosemide dose&#xD;
      will be halved. Diuretics can be decreased or temporarily discontinued if there is a decrease&#xD;
      in systolic blood pressure (&gt; 25% of basal value) or worsening kidney function (WKF, defined&#xD;
      as an increase in serum creatinine value ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or 25% from baseline value within 24-48&#xD;
      hours) that is felt as being be due to a transient episode of intravascular volume depletion.&#xD;
      After the patient has stabilized, if congestion persists, diuretics will be reinitiated or&#xD;
      their doses will be increased until the patient's fluid balance has been optimized.&#xD;
      Investigators may opt-out of the treatment algorithm if they feel that it is in the interest&#xD;
      of patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the bivariate change in body weight and serum creatinine value&#xD;
      at 96 hours since patient randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the data from the study of Grodin et al (J Card Fail 2016; 22:26-32), comparing&#xD;
      subjects randomized to stepped-care diuretic treatment in the Cardiorenal Rescue Study in&#xD;
      Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (CARRESS-HF) trial with those developing the cardiorenal&#xD;
      syndrome during standard treatment with intravenous furosemide in the Diuretic Optimization&#xD;
      Strategies Evaluation Acute Heart Failure (DOSE-AHF) trial and the Renal Optimization&#xD;
      Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE-AHF) trial, the mean difference in body&#xD;
      weight obtained with the stepped-care oral approach versus the intravenous approach was -1.2&#xD;
      Kg, with a standard deviation (SD) ranging between 1.5 and 2.4 Kg; the mean difference in&#xD;
      serum creatinine was -0.1 mg/dL, with a SD of 0.3 mg/dL. Thus, the investigators estimated&#xD;
      that the enrollment of 206 patients would yield a 90% power to detect a 0.5 effect size for&#xD;
      either component of the bivariate primary endpoint (1.2/2.4 Kg and 0.15/0.30 mg,&#xD;
      respectively) with a two-sided 0.05 alpha level.&#xD;
