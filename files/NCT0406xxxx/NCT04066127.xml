      The overall aim of this study is to compare a new state-of-the-art ex-vivo organ preservation&#xD;
      method with standard ischemic cold static storage of donor hearts in adult cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard heart preservation before transplantation consists of cold ischemic storage of the&#xD;
      heart. Clinical studies have shown that the morbidity and mortality risk increases with the&#xD;
      extension of the allograft ischemic time over four hours. For each additional hour the&#xD;
      mortality risk increase with 25% the first year. This time constraint is costly and results&#xD;
      in severe logistical problems, leading to loss of transplantable organs. The preliminary&#xD;
      results from our safety study, where six patients transplanted with the new state-of-the-art&#xD;
      ex-vivo organ preservation method, have shown promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a multicenter, prospective, open, blinded endpoint, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial. The primary end-point is survival free of acute cellular rejection (ACR) and&#xD;
      retransplantation within 1-year post-transplant. ACR will be assessed blinded. The secondary&#xD;
      end-points are ischemia/reperfusion injury, early graft dysfunction, and QoL.&#xD;

      SURVEY OF THE FIELD Ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) - elicited tissue injury contributes to&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. In organ transplantation, it is a major challenge. The imbalance in&#xD;
      metabolic supply and demand within the ischemic organ results in tissue hypoxia and&#xD;
      microvascular dysfunction. The following reperfusion enhances the activation of innate and&#xD;
      adaptive immune responses resulting in a cell death program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A damaged endothelium increases the risk of allograft rejection within 1-year after&#xD;
      transplantation and a drug treated rejection increases the risk of chronicle rejection and&#xD;
      five-year mortality. An improved preservation of the endothelium of the coronary arteries is&#xD;
      therefore instrumental to achieve an improved short- and long-term outcome for the&#xD;
      transplanted patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard heart preservation before transplantation consists of cold ischemic storage of the&#xD;
      heart. Clinical studies have shown that the mortality risk increases sharply with extension&#xD;
      of the allograft ischemic time over four hours. For each additional hour, the mortality risk&#xD;
      increases with 25% the first year. Different myocardial cardioplegic preservation solutions&#xD;
      and ex-vivo perfusion machines have been developed. Despite some promising experimental&#xD;
      results, no consistent differences in outcome have been found. Our first-in-man pilot study,&#xD;
      including 6 NIHP cases, show the device's feasibility and provide the first pieces of&#xD;
      evidence that machines improves outcome of heart transplantation. However, as these results&#xD;
      are based on a non-randomized study design with a few patients, a randomized study is needed&#xD;
      to ensure the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE AND AIMS The purpose of this study is to compare a new state-of-the-art non ischemic&#xD;
      heart preservation (NIHP) method, on heart allograft function, rejection episodes, and&#xD;
      quality of life, with the standard ischemic cold static storage (SCS) method of donor hearts&#xD;
      in adult heart transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial. The study will randomly assign eligible patients to be&#xD;
      transplanted with a donor heart preserved with either a new ex-vivo perfusion method (NIHP)&#xD;
      or the standard cold static storage (SCS). The study will be performed at Skane University&#xD;
      Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Linköping University Hospital, and Uppsala&#xD;
      University Hospital, which cover two-thirds of the population in Sweden. Patients listed at&#xD;
      these centres will be transplanted at Skane University Hospital and then returned to their&#xD;
      centre for post-transplant care. The data collection, statistical analysis, and presentation&#xD;
      of results will be done according to the CONSORT criteria. The main outcomes will be reported&#xD;
      on intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICO Population: Adult patients with end-stage heart failure eligible for heart&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Recipient transplanted with a donor heart preserved using NIHP. Control:&#xD;
      Recipient transplanted with a donor heart preserved using SCS. Outcome: Survival, rejection,&#xD;
      graft function, and quality-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYS PLAN Populations for analysis The full analysis set will consist of all&#xD;
      randomized patients. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients will be analyzed&#xD;
      according to the preservation methods (NIHP and SCS, respectively) to which they were&#xD;
      assigned at randomization. Efficacy variables will be analyzed based on all randomized&#xD;
      patients as the primary population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics Baseline value is defined as the last&#xD;
      non-missing assessment prior to the transplantation. Summary statistics will be provided by&#xD;
      treatment group for demographics and baseline characteristics, including age, sex, weight,&#xD;
      height, body mass index (BMI), diagnosis, prior hospitalization, need for inotropic support&#xD;
      pre-transplant and/or ECMO, CK-MB, TnI, proBNP, and vital signs. Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      summarized using n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical&#xD;
      variables will be summarized using frequency and percentage. The difference between treatment&#xD;
      groups will be compared using the Chi-square test for categorical variables or using&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables. The p-values will be provided for descriptive&#xD;
      purposes and will not be considered to define any formal basis for determining factors to be&#xD;
      included in statistical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary efficacy variable and outcomes The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the survival free of allograft rejection and re-transplantation after heart&#xD;
      transplantation comparing two preservation methods (NIHP versus SCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-to-event variables (primary efficacy variable) will be analyzed using the Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazard model. The estimated hazards ratio and the corresponding two-sided 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval will be provided. A supplemental log-rank test will be performed.&#xD;
      Survival function for each treatment group will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented. The frequency and percentage of patients who reach the&#xD;
      primary composite endpoint will be provided by treatment group for the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of secondary efficacy, exploratory, and safety variables and outcomes The secondary&#xD;
      objects of this study are to test if the new preservation technique (NIHP) is superior to&#xD;
      standard preservation technique (SCS) in I/R injury (cTnI and CK-MB), immediate graft&#xD;
      function, QoL and severe adverse events. Furthermore we will analyse the postoperative renal&#xD;
      function (minimum creatinine clearance, need for CRRT), postoperative liver function (ASAT,&#xD;
      ALAT), postoperative pulmonary function (hours in ventilator), SAE, time to no improvement in&#xD;
      physical activity, resource utilizations (length of stay, and number of visits to&#xD;
      professional healthcare).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continues variables (cTnI, CK-MB, inotrope score, minimum creatinine clearance, hours of&#xD;
      ventilator, physical activity (calorie use), length of stay, and number of visits to&#xD;
      professional healthcare, EQ-5D index and EQ VAS) will be analysed using Mann-Witney U-test.&#xD;
      Additionally, the baseline value of the corresponding variable may be included as a covariate&#xD;
      if appropriate. The estimated treatment effect and the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binary variables (primary graft dysfunction, LVEF&lt;40%, RVEF&lt;40%, severe adverse events) will&#xD;
      be analysed using logistic regression. Additionally, the baseline value of the corresponding&#xD;
      variable may be included as a covariate if appropriate. The estimated treatment effect and&#xD;
      the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval will be provided. EQ-5D descriptive&#xD;
      system will be analysed by using χ2-test and Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY The assessment of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of adverse events&#xD;
      and laboratory abnormalities. Other safety data will be summarized as appropriate. Laboratory&#xD;
      data will be summarized by presenting shift tables using extended normal ranges (baseline to&#xD;
      most extreme post-baseline value), by presenting summary statistics of raw data and change&#xD;
      from baseline values (mean, medians, standard deviations, ranges). An interim assessment of&#xD;
      the initial 10 patients in the intervention group will be performed when all of them has&#xD;
      passed 30-days post-transplant or expired.&#xD;
