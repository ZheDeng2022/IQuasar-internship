  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide messages to providers if their patient is at high&#xD;
      risk of developing intraoperative hypotension based on past medical history and&#xD;
      co-morbidities preoperatively and minutes of hypotension intraoperatively.&#xD;

      Preoperative decision support:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the patient's past medical history and comorbidities providers received one of two&#xD;
      messages in the preoperative section of the chart. If the patient had a past medical history&#xD;
      of renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, or ischemic heart disease the provider&#xD;
      received a message that the patient was at a high risk of developing sequale of hypotension.&#xD;
      If the patient had more than 15 minutes of hypotension (defined as a mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP)&lt;65mmHg) during a previous anesthetic, then the provider received a message that the&#xD;
      patient was at high risk of developing intraoperative hypotension. Based on the past medical&#xD;
      history of the patient, providers will receive zero, one or both messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative decision support:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the vitals signs section of the intraoperative record a line denoting the mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) was added. If the patient had more than 10 cumulative minutes of hypotension&#xD;
      (defined as a MAP&lt;65 mmHg) then a yellow alert was displayed in the lower right section of&#xD;
      the screen. If the patient had more than 20 minutes of hypotension, then the alert was&#xD;
      changed to red.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data were acquired via our previously published Department of Anesthesiology and&#xD;
      Perioperative Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) perioperative data&#xD;
      ware- house (PDW). The PDW is a structured reporting schema that contains all the relevant&#xD;
      clinical data entered into the electronic medical record (EMR) via the use of Clarity, the&#xD;
      relational database created by EPIC for data analytics and reporting. While Clarity contains&#xD;
      raw clinical data, the PDW was designed to organize, filter, and improve data so that it can&#xD;
      be used reliably for creating these types of metrics. Last, the PDW servers interfaced with&#xD;
      other health system resources to allow for automated emailed reports and the generation of&#xD;
      web-based graphical dashboards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Hypotension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each case, hypotension was defined as the total number of minutes the patient spent with&#xD;
      a blood pressure below predefined MAP mmHG thresholds (as previously reported Salmasi paper):&#xD;
      60-65, 55-60, 50-55, and &lt;50. In order to determine the effect of the pathway roll out on the&#xD;
      incidence of intraoperative hypotension the investigators plan to carry out several analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For each month from 12 months before pathway go-live until 12 months after go-live the&#xD;
           percentage of case that experienced hypotension as defined above in the ranges of 0-10&#xD;
           minutes, 11-20 minutes, and &gt;20 minutes (the cut-points used in the decision support&#xD;
           system) will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In essence patients were assigned to one of four pathways in the CDS program based on&#xD;
           their risk of hypotension or sequalae of hypotension. The investigators will carry out&#xD;
           sub-group analysis on each of the four pathways (hypotension message, high risk of&#xD;
           complications message, both messages, no message) to see if the response of providers&#xD;
           differed based on the message they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the effect of decision support on postoperative AKI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the effect of the pathway to decrease postoperative AKI (defined by the&#xD;
      KDIGO criteria as a binary instance 0 vs stage 1,2,3) the investigators carried out the&#xD;
      following analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics (age, sex, ASA, etcâ€¦) and study variables (including hypotension,&#xD;
      AKI) will be summarized using means (SD) and frequencies (%) stratified by pre/post&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators will then create a risk score for postoperative AKI based&#xD;
      upon the risk factors identified by Sun et al. For each patient in the post implementation&#xD;
      group the investigators will identify a patient in the pre-implementation group who has a&#xD;
      similar risk of AKI using propensity score matching in R V3.5.1 (Vienna, AU www.r-project.org&#xD;
      ). The investigators will assess the performance of the matching algorithm by exploring&#xD;
      standardized mean difference (SMD) plots before and after matching. If the matching is deemed&#xD;
      to be inadequate (SMD &gt; 0.1 for any matching variable) the investigators will try more&#xD;
      complex models including squared terms, interactions, or widening the caliper width for what&#xD;
      the investigators consider an adequate match (from the standard starting width of 0.2*SD of&#xD;
      the logit of the propensity score). Once the matching has been deemed successful, the&#xD;
      investigators will then assess the effect of the intervention by analyzing the incidence of&#xD;
      hypotension in each month from the 12 months prior to roll until until the 12 months after&#xD;
      roll out after allowing for a 2 month washout period using an interrupted time series&#xD;
      approach as described by Wagner et. Al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the effect of the intervention will likely have a negligible effect on low risk&#xD;
      patients, the investigators will carry out a subgroup analysis on those patients at high risk&#xD;
      of AKI and use methodology similar to those described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, if the investigators observe a significant reduction in AKI according to the process&#xD;
      outlined above, the investigators hypothesize that this reduction would be mediated through&#xD;
      hypotension and test this using Baron and Kenny's steps for mediation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First, on the risk matched cohort, the investigators will show that the rate of AKI went&#xD;
           down after implementation (a significant path C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Next, the investigators will show that the intervention is associated with a reduction&#xD;
           in time spent in at least one hypotension category (60-65, 55-60, 50-55, &lt;50) in a&#xD;
           similar manner as above (significant path A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finally, the investigators will show that the association between the intervention and&#xD;
           AKI goes away (or is reduced) after including hypotension information in the model and&#xD;
           use Sobel's test to obtain a p-value to test for a significant reduction in the&#xD;
           intervention coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of these steps above fail (a,b,c) then the investigators cannot conclude that the&#xD;
      reduction in AKI was mediated exclusively through hypotension.&#xD;
