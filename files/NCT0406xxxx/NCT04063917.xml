  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the PLUTO study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      ZENS transcutaneous nerve stimulator device in primary snorers and those with mild&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea. The study will assess the impact of ZENS on snoring frequency,&#xD;
      duration, and other relevant sleep parameters. The intended purpose of the investigational&#xD;
      device is to deliver a transcutaneous electrical stimulation signal to the hypoglossal nerve&#xD;
      in the &quot;ON&quot; phase in order to alter the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), as well as mean snoring&#xD;
      burden (intensity, duration), and to deliver no signal in the &quot;OFF&quot; phase of the study as a&#xD;
      means for comparison. Subjects utilizing the ZENS Device will experience a reduction in&#xD;
      snoring during the &quot;ON&quot; versus &quot;OFF&quot; phase, as quantified by a reduction in the percentage of&#xD;
      time per hour of snoring (≥40 dB) in the active ZENS Device (&quot;ON&quot; phase) versus the inactive&#xD;
      ZENS Device (&quot;OFF&quot; phase).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After indicating their consent to contact and signing an Informed Consent Form, potential&#xD;
      participants will undergo a screening assessment that includes a review of their medical&#xD;
      history, a focused physical exam, and a level 3 at-home sleep test (Sagatech SnoreSat Sleep&#xD;
      Recorder, Philips Alice OneNight or equivalent), if not already available in the medical&#xD;
      records). At the screening visit potential participants' eligibility for the study will be&#xD;
      evaluated against the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of eligibility, up to 45 (n=45) participants will be scheduled for&#xD;
      their overnight in-laboratory PSG, which must occur no more than 12 weeks after screening has&#xD;
      taken place. A final determination of eligibility and &quot;enrollment&quot; is completed when&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified on the day of the study visit. Those who do not&#xD;
      meet inclusion and exclusion criteria on the day of the study will be deemed &quot;screening&#xD;
      failures&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear the ZENS Device for the 8 to 12-hour overnight in-laboratory&#xD;
      polysomnography assessment. Participants will be monitored for and asked about any adverse&#xD;
      events and device effects that they experience during the overnight sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by the site via telephone 24 to 96 hours after the overnight&#xD;
      sleep study to determine if any adverse events and device effects were experienced late after&#xD;
      the overnight polysomnography. After the telephone follow-up, participation in the study is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
