    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             20/32). *If the subject meets this criterion at the Screening Visit, but the Baseline&#xD;
             BCVA letter score is between 48 and 77, the subject may be entered in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of dry AMD as defined by the presence of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Drusen that are intermediate in size or larger (63 μm or larger in diameter) with at&#xD;
             least a few (3) being regular drusen and not pseudodrusen and/or geographic atrophy&#xD;
             (GA) visible on two of the following: color fundus images, OCT and/or FAF, to be&#xD;
             confirmed by the reading center&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to communicate well with the Investigator and able to understand and comply with&#xD;
             the requirements of the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Current or history of neovascular maculopathy that includes any of the following (to&#xD;
             be confirmed by the reading center):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) defined as pathologic angiogenesis originating&#xD;
                  from the choroidal vasculature that extends through a defect in Bruch's membrane&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Serous and/or hemorrhagic detachment of the neurosensory retina or retinal&#xD;
                  pigment epithelial (RPE)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Retinal hard exudates (a secondary phenomenon resulting from chronic&#xD;
                  intravascular leakage)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subretinal and sub-RPE fibrovascular proliferation&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Disciform scar (subretinal fibrosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of center involving GA within the central ETDRS 1 mm diameter at Screening,&#xD;
             to be confirmed by the reading center&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Media opacities, including cataracts, which might interfere with visual acuity or&#xD;
             imaging in the study eye(s). Subjects should not be entered if there is likelihood&#xD;
             that they will require cataract surgery in the study eye in the next 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Posterior capsule opacification, which might interfere with visual acuity or imaging&#xD;
             in the study eye(s). Subjects should not be entered if there is likelihood that they&#xD;
             will require surgery in the study eye in the next 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Invasive eye surgery (e.g. cataract, capsulotomy) on a qualifying eye within three 3&#xD;
             months prior to Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ocular disorder or disease that partially or completely obstructs the pupil (e.g.&#xD;
             posterior synechia in uveitis)&#xD;
&#xD;

             (glomerulonephritis Type 2, Autosomal dominant drusen), GA (North Carolina dystrophy)&#xD;
             or mitochondrial diseases (parafoveal petaloid GA, Stargardt disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence or history of disease or condition affecting functional vision without&#xD;
             obvious structural abnormalities (e.g. amblyopia, stroke, nystagmus)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Serious medical illness that will prevent the subject from performing study activities&#xD;
             (including cardiac, hepatic, renal, respiratory, endocrinologic, neurologic, or&#xD;
             hematologic disease) or, in the judgement of the Investigator, is likely to require&#xD;
             surgical intervention or hospitalization at any point during the study&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Use of any photosensitizing agent (e.g. topicals, injectables, oral) within 30 days of&#xD;
             treatment without consulting subject's physician&#xD;

             dry AMD, has not been stabilized for a minimum of 1 month prior to Screening. Subjects&#xD;
             are considered to be stable if they are taking the AREDS supplements consistently as&#xD;
             prescribed by their treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has received Low Vision Rehab/Therapy within 30 days prior to Screening or intends to&#xD;
             receive during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has an open sore(s) that may come in contact with the Valeda System, has periorbital&#xD;
             skin erythema or is prone to such conditions with exposure to light.&#xD;
