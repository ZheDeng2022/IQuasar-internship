    <textblock>
      Study consists of an open-label, safety run-in part and a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 part. In the Phase 2/3 part, the study will evaluate whether&#xD;
      bintrafusp alfa in combination with the current standard of care (SoC) (gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      cisplatin) improves overall survival (OS) in chemotherapy and immunotherapy-naïve&#xD;
      participants with locally advanced or metastatic BTC compared to placebo, gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin.&#xD;
