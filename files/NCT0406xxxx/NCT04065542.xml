  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Model and map, from a qualitative multi-phased protocol, the conceptions and systems of&#xD;
      conceptions of the determinants of health and cancer expressed and perceived by&#xD;
      schoolchildren aged 6 to 11 years. The secondary objectives are to analyze the ability to&#xD;
      question the conceptions of children's health regardless of their age and to link conceptions&#xD;
      and determinants to contextual factors. The informative value and complementarity of the&#xD;
      collection tools (photo expression, QC, photo-narration) and the relevance of a mixed&#xD;
      analysis methodology (qualitative and quantitative) in order to highlight the different&#xD;
      determinants of health will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qualitative observational study of human and social sciences (SHS), multicenter, conducted&#xD;
      with schoolchildren.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative methodology used combines the use of photographs, open questionnaires and&#xD;
      focus groups, over very large panels, aiming at both diversity and representativeness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photo expression: to identify the determinants perceived as having a positive or&#xD;
           negative influence on one's health;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CQR : Certainty/Question/Rumour on how to take care of one's health (health promotion&#xD;
           input following on from school policies, i.e. PES: Politique d'Etablissements&#xD;
           Scolaires);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photo narration: to identify argumentative frameworks in health and alternatives&#xD;
           perceived as being positive or negative for one's health,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focus groups: to improve understanding of the rationalities built by adolescents in&#xD;
           relation to that which determines their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This choice is justified by the need to explore and understand the actions from the&#xD;
      participants' point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diversity of schools and pupils (5 classes in 4 schools in the AURA region, i.e. 320&#xD;
      pupils) will make it possible to obtain the data saturation required in qualitative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This makes it possible to consider a mixed analysis strategy, both qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to better understand the rationalities elaborated by children and the way&#xD;
      in which their concepts on the determinants of cancer interlink, as well as to describe the&#xD;
      declared impact these concepts have on the decision-making regarding their health.&#xD;
