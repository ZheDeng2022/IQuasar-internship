      Background: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a technique based on the principles of&#xD;
      electromagnetic induction. It applies pulses of magnetic radiation that penetrate the brain&#xD;
      tissue, and it is a non-invasive, painless and practically innocuous procedure. Previous&#xD;
      studies advocate the therapeutic capacity of TMS in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric&#xD;
      processes, both in animal models and in human studies. Its uses in Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and in Huntington's chorea have shown improvement in the symptomatology&#xD;
      and in the molecular profile, and even in the cellular density of the brain. Consequently,&#xD;
      the extrapolation of these TMS results in the aforementioned neurodegenerative disease to&#xD;
      other entities with etiopathogenic and clinical analogy would raise the relevance and&#xD;
      feasibility of its use in multiple sclerosis (MS). The overall objective will be to&#xD;
      demonstrate the effectiveness of the TMS in terms of safety and clinical improvement, as well&#xD;
      as to observe the molecular changes in relation to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and design: Phase I clinical trial, unicentric, controlled, randomised, single blind.&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who meet&#xD;
      all the inclusion criteria and do not present any of the exclusion criteria that are&#xD;
      established and from which clinically evaluable results can be obtained. The patients&#xD;
      included will be assigned under the 1:1:1 randomization formula, constituting three groups&#xD;
      for the present study: 30 patients treated with natalizumab + white (placebo) + 30 patients&#xD;
      treated with natalizumab + TMS (1 Hertz) + 30 patients treated with natalizumab + TMS (5&#xD;
      Hertz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Results of this study will inform on the efficiency of the TMS for the treatment&#xD;
      of MS. The expected results are that TMS is a useful therapeutic resource to improve clinical&#xD;
      status (main parameters) and neurochemical profile (surrogate parameters); both types of&#xD;
      parameters will be checked.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is based on the hypothesis that the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      at 1 Hertz or 5 Hertz in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) implies&#xD;
      a neuroprotective effect against the progression of the disease, resulting in a clinical&#xD;
      improvement (attenuation of symptoms and signs, as direct measures of the therapeutic effect)&#xD;
      and a biochemistry improvement (decrease of serum oxidative stress molecules and acute phase&#xD;
      reactants, as indirect measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with the traditional techniques for measuring biochemical magnitudes, proteomic&#xD;
      techniques would allow the identification (and subsequent validation) of molecules that are&#xD;
      clearly different in situations of stability-relapse, presence-absence of therapeutic&#xD;
      response, better-worse evolution. These molecules (in isolation or considering their&#xD;
      characteristics together) could be useful as therapeutic targets or as useful biomarkers for&#xD;
      diagnostic or prognostic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to demonstrate the therapeutic effect of TMS in patients with MS by means of&#xD;
      measurement of clinical changes according to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&#xD;
      Consequently, the specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the consequences of the administration of TMS (1 Hertz/5 Hertz) in patients&#xD;
           with MS, paying special attention to its clinical impact according to the MSFC scale&#xD;
           (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of the application of TMS (1 Hertz/5 Hertz) on fatigue in people&#xD;
           with MS, according to the FIS scale (Fatigue Impact Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the effect of the application of TMS (1 Hertz/5 Hertz) on the degree of&#xD;
           depression, according to the Beck scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of TMS (Hertz/5 Hz) on cognitive changes in patients with MS, in&#xD;
           relation to the BRB scale (Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the changes induced by the application of TMS (1 Hertz/5 Hertz) on&#xD;
           neurochemical biomarkers, oxidative damage, acute phase reactants and in differential&#xD;
           expression proteomic profiles, in patients affected by MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the possible associations between the parameters studied and the likely&#xD;
           changes that may be observed in them after TMS therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II clinical trial, unicentric, controlled, randomised, single blind. The patients&#xD;
      included will be assigned under the 1:1:1 randomization formula, constituting three groups&#xD;

      treated with natalizumab + TMS (1 Hertz) + 30 patients treated with natalizumab + TMS (5&#xD;
      Hertz).&#xD;

&#xD;
      POPULATIONS AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE CHOICE OF NATALIZUMAB AS A BASAL MEDICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility analysis will be done by intention to treat, and will include all patients&#xD;
      for whom investigators have some feasibility data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the three RRMS groups are treated with natalizumab. It could have been decided to&#xD;
      recruit those treated with another pharmacological therapy (such as alemtuzumab, being a more&#xD;
      modern monoclonal antibody); however, natalizumab offers us four advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Its idiosyncrasy of administration (intravenous) leads to the patient going to the&#xD;
      hospital and undergoing a blood analysis, which facilitates obtaining the sample needed in&#xD;
      the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) It is the drug with which a greater number of patients with RRMS is currently being&#xD;
      treated in our hospital, which makes it possible to maximise the possibilities of&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Regarding the previous point, considering patients under the same treatment&#xD;
      (pharmacological) allows us to homogenise the characteristics of the three groups of the&#xD;
      sample recruited, which increases the internal and external validity of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) To the above the investigators can add that natalizumab is the drug with which the&#xD;
      research group has the most experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE LOSS OF PATIENTS: RETIREMENT CRITERIA AND ANALYSIS OF ANTICIPATED WITHDRAWALS AND&#xD;
      ABANDONMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A withdrawal is defined as the situation in which a subject included in the Clinical Trial&#xD;
      ends his/her participation in it before completing the protocol in its entirety,&#xD;
      independently of the circumstances that motivate the termination. Patients will interrupt&#xD;
      their participation and will be removed from the clinical trial in any of these situations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Presence of a serious adverse event since the patient's recruitment. ii) Clinical&#xD;
      conditions of the patient that prevent his/her continuity. iii) Other reasons: protocol&#xD;
      violation, lack of cooperation, revocation of informed consent, loss of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The date and reason why a subject interrupts his/her participation in the Clinical Trial must&#xD;
      be recorded in the Data Collection Notebook. The circumstance of the interruption should be&#xD;
      notified immediately to the monitor and if this has been a Serious Adverse Event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient has the full right to leave the study at any time and any patient can be removed&#xD;
      from the study for any reason beneficial to his/her well-being. According to the standards of&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice (GCP), all patients who leave the study before the foreseen time will&#xD;
      be recommended the best alternative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTINGENCY PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has been planned from a preventive point of view. Therefore, before starting it was&#xD;
      assumed up to 20% loss of patients' follow-up in the calculation of the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT IMPLICATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the protocol following the&#xD;
      standard procedures established at the participating hospital. Said trial will be carried out&#xD;
      according to the recommendations for Clinical Trials and product evaluation in human research&#xD;
      phase, which appear in the Declaration of Helsinki, reviewed in the successive world&#xD;
      assemblies (WMA, 2008), and the current Spanish Legislation in the field of Clinical Trials&#xD;
      (RD 1090/2015). The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH-GCP) standards&#xD;
      (CPMP/ICH/135/95) will be followed. The Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CEIC) of Córdoba&#xD;
      has already reviewed and approved the protocol and informed consent in December 2017, as well&#xD;
      as the completion of the present clinical trial itself. Before carrying out any of the&#xD;
      procedures specified in the protocol, the participating subject must sign and date the&#xD;
      informed consent document approved by the CEIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to guarantee the confidentiality of the trial data, the original data will be kept&#xD;
      in the hospital and will only be accessed by the researcher and his/her team of&#xD;
      collaborators, the trial monitor and the CEIC of Córdoba, which is the body that would&#xD;
      protect the present essay. The researcher will allow the audits and inspections of the&#xD;
      Spanish or European Health Authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content of the data collection notebooks and the confidentiality of the data of each&#xD;
      patient will be respected at all times. Appropriate procedures will be followed to ensure&#xD;
      compliance with the provisions of Organic Law 15/99 of December 13 on the Protection of&#xD;
      Personal Data. The documents generated during the study, will be protected from uses not&#xD;
      allowed by people outside the investigation and, therefore, will be considered strictly&#xD;
      confidential and will not be disclosed to other people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note 1: DESCRIPTION OF THE TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By means of the magnetic stimulator with the coil located in the primary motor cortex the&#xD;
      investigators induce a cerebral electric current that is able to obtain a motor potential in&#xD;
      the first dorsal interosseous bone (PID) of the left hand. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      muscle stimulation by placing conventional surface electrodes connected to a device of evoked&#xD;
      potentials. It is a Compound Muscle Action Potential (PAMC) that represents the sum of the&#xD;
      action potentials of all the individual muscle fibres underlying the electrodes. For this,&#xD;
      the electromyograph is programmed with the following parameters: A) Sensitivity: 50 uV; B)&#xD;
      Frequency filter: between 2000 Khz and 1 Hz; C) Scan speed 10 ms / div; D) Digitised&#xD;
      preamplification signs, and v) Surface electrodes are placed: active in the eminence of the&#xD;
      dorsal interosseous muscle and reference in the dorsal bony prominence of the second finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will depend on the group to which the patient has been assigned. In groups 2&#xD;
      and 3, the investigators will place the probe from 8 to 3 centimetres in front of the vertex&#xD;
      (Cz) medially and perpendicular to the craniocaudal axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note 2: DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention procedure consists of two steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First step: OBTAINING THE MOTOR EVOKED THRESHOLD AT REST: Each patient, regardless of to the&#xD;
      group to which they belong will have his/her threshold evoked motor calculated at rest, by&#xD;
      stimulation of the right motor cortex, evoking electromyographic responses (EMG) in the&#xD;
      contralateral muscles, called motor evoked potentials (PEM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second step: ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION: To calculate the motive&#xD;
      threshold as the percentage of the same to which the treatment will have to be applied, a&#xD;
      'Rapid2 Magstim' device (Magstim Co.®, Whitland, Carmathenshire, Wales) equipped with a coil&#xD;
      in eight of 70 mm, will be used. The selection of the specific point of stimulation in the&#xD;
      somato-sensory area (SMA) will be sufficiently anterior to prevent the propagation of the&#xD;
      impulse from triggering the muscular contraction of the shoulders, trunk and lower limbs. The&#xD;
      treatment will be administered for 5 consecutive days, with 3 weeks of rest, between each&#xD;
      stimulation. To complete a treatment period of 14 months (based on previous studies of the&#xD;
      group in RRMS patients treated with natalizumab). In the case of the placebo group (patients&#xD;
      with RRMS treated with natalizumab and placebo coil) patients will be stimulated with an&#xD;
      inactive probe, the perception being indistinguishable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation with TMS (or administration of placebo) will be carried out every day in the&#xD;
      same time slot for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks, during a period of 14 months.&#xD;
