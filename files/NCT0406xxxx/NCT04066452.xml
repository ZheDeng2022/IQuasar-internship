      TITLE: Study of Prevalence of Amyloidosis in Heart Failure: PREVAMIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Multicenter, observational, cross-sectional, prospective, cohort study with a&#xD;
      one-year follow-up. 44 hospitals from Spain will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES. PRIMARY: To estimate the current prevalence of different types of cardiac&#xD;
      amyloidosis (CA) in patients with heart failure, aged 65 years and older, with LVH &gt; 12 mm&#xD;
      and any LVEF value, managed in Internal Medicine departments. SECONDARY: To describe the&#xD;
      clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic features of patients with CA. To compare one-year&#xD;
      readmissions and mortality rates in patients with and without CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA: Inpatients or outpatients with heart failure, aged ≥ 65 years, both&#xD;
      genders, under the care of internists. They should have a NYHA Class II-IV, echocardiogram&#xD;
      performed in the previous 24 months, any value of LVEF, LVH: septum or posterior wall &gt; 12&#xD;
      mm, diuretic treatment in the last 6 months and NTproBNP&gt; 1800 pg/ml or BNP&gt; 400 pg/ml in&#xD;
      acute hear failure, or NT-proBNP &gt;600 pg/ml o BNP &gt;150 pg/ml in stable condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: Heart failure outpatients or inpatients of Internal Medicine Services. It is&#xD;
      expected to include around 450 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: To calculate the prevalence of TTR-CA and other types of CA. To compare the&#xD;
      clinical, analytical, echocardiographic, and readmissions and mortality rates during one-year&#xD;
      in patients with and without CA.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN AND PATIENT SELECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter, observational, cross-sectional, prospective, cohort study with a one-year&#xD;
      follow-up. Approximately 450 patients will be gathered (according to the calculation of the&#xD;
      sample size, 382 patients would be necessary), of both sexes (with stratification Male:Female&#xD;
      1:1), age ≥ 65 years, under the care of Internal Medicine Services, who meet the criteria of&#xD;
      the 2016 Heart Failure Guide of the European Society of Cardiology for the diagnosis of Heart&#xD;
      Failure, and that have LVH (Septum or Posterior Wall &gt; 12 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be duly informed of the study and their written informed consent will be&#xD;
      requested prior to their enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once included in the study a series of clinical, analytical and echocardiographic parameters&#xD;
      will be collected and measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bone-cardiac scintigraphy with Tc-DPD (or similar: Tc-PYP or Tc-HMDP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analysis to rule out monoclonal protein:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Proteinogram and serum immunoglobulins.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Free light chains in serum -Freelite-&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Immunofixation in serum and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of readmissions, emergency visits and mortality in the following 12 months&#xD;
           will be recorded to compare the readmission and mortality rates during one year of&#xD;
           patients with and without CA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prescribed pre- and post-diagnostic treatments will be described, according to&#xD;
           clinical practice (without intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No intervention, whether diagnostic or follow-up, that is not the usual clinical&#xD;
           practice will be applied to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION Inpatients or outpatients of Internal Medicine Services with diagnosis of Heart&#xD;
      Failure from the participating centers, selected by the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      defined for our study, in appropriate number, according to the calculation of the sample&#xD;
      size, to assess the main objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION OF HOSPITALS AND PATIENTS All eligible patients will be candidates to enter the&#xD;
      study (that is, all those who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve all Spanish hospitals that voluntarily desire to participate and that&#xD;
      have the necessary diagnostic methods to carry out the study. To participate in the study, no&#xD;
      minimum hospital size (number of beds) has been set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND WORK STRATEGY IN EACH HOSPITAL. The number of cases to be collected by&#xD;
      each hospital will be calculated proportionally based on the total number of beds in each&#xD;
      center. The number of patients that each center should include refers to the total number of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will begin the same week of the year for all hospitals. All cases that meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of exclusion and sign the consent will be collected&#xD;
      consecutively, with gender stratification (50% men and 50% women of the number of patients&#xD;
      assigned to the center) until at least the number of patients assigned to the center is&#xD;
      completed . Optionally, patients may continue to be included, in that week or in subsequent&#xD;
      weeks,as long as it is done consecutively and stratified by sex (without selecting the&#xD;
      cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS The patients included in this study will be treated according to standard&#xD;
      medical care, since being a prevalence study that does not change the usual clinical&#xD;
      practice. The study will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and&#xD;
      the Spanish Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CEI) of the Virgen&#xD;
      Macarena-Virgen del Rocío University Hospitals. In those cases that are necessary, the&#xD;
      approval of the other local CEIs will also be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers of each participating center will explain to each patient all the aspects of&#xD;
      the study and the patients will be given an information sheet giving details of it, making it&#xD;
      clear that participation is voluntary and that they can leave the study at any time if they&#xD;
      wish. If the patient wants to participate, both the investigator and the patient himself, or&#xD;
      his legal representative in case of disability, must sign the informed consent. The patient&#xD;
      will be given a copy of the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATABASE An online Database will be developed to record the data of the study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTIC ANALYSIS Continuous variables will be expressed with the value of the mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation or as median and interquartile range, depending on the normality of their&#xD;
      distribution. Categorical variables will be expressed in percentages or rates. A descriptive&#xD;
      analysis of the data will be made, calculating the prevalence rates, and a comparative&#xD;
      analysis in relation to different variables, such as gender, age and other factors that are&#xD;
      of interest for the objective of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison will be made using the Chi-square test in the categorical variables and the&#xD;
      Student's T test for normal quantitative variables. For non-normal quantitative variables,&#xD;
      the non-parametric U-Mann Whitney test will be used. Regarding the follow-up data, the&#xD;
      association of different variables with the re-entry and mortality data will be assessed&#xD;
      using univariate and multivariate analysis. Survival curve analysis will also be performed&#xD;
      using the Kaplan-Meier method using log-rank test. A p &lt;0.05 will be considered statistical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
