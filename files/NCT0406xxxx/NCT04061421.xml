  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ABNL-MARRO (A Basket study of Novel therapy for untreated MDS/MPN and Relapsed/Refractory&#xD;
      Overlap Syndromes) is an international European-American cooperation providing the framework&#xD;
      for collaborative studies to advance treatment of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative&#xD;
      neoplasms (MDS/MPN) and explore clinical-pathologic markers of disease severity, prognosis&#xD;
      and treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABNL MARRO 001 (AM-001) is an Open label, phase 1/2 study within the framework of the&#xD;
      ABNL-MARRO that will test novel treatment combinations in MDS/MPN. Each Arm of AM-001 will&#xD;
      test an active myeloid target compound in combination with ASTX727, an oral drug combining&#xD;
      fixed doses of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) decitabine and the cytidine&#xD;
      deaminase inhibitor E7727, also known as cedazuridine in a single tablet.&#xD;

      Current Arm: ASTX727 + itacitinib (INCB039110; JAK1 inhibitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Characterize the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of each novel oral targeted agent in&#xD;
      combination with oral ASTX727 in order to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test whether the overall response to each novel ASTX727 combination therapy in MDS/MPN&#xD;
      patients is sufficiently high to warrant further investigation in more definitive trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To expand the safety analysis of each treatment combination in MDS/MPN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the morphologic bone marrow response in MDS/MPN patients treated on each Arm&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the effect of each treatment combination on patient survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the applicability of the proposed MDS/MPN IWG response criteria across multiple&#xD;
           Arms of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary/Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate genetic biomarkers of response in MDS/MPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize molecular responses to individual treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate synergistic effects of hypomethylation by ASTX727 and specific pathway&#xD;
           blockade by study compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the use of automated quantification of spleen volume from CT exams as a&#xD;
           measure of clinical benefit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test and/or validate diagnostic algorithms and prognostic indices for MDS/MPN&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the correlation of patient reported outcomes with disease severity and/or&#xD;
           treatment response&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF); must&#xD;
             voluntarily sign an ICF; and must be willing and able to meet all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have morphologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS/MPN, excluding JMML, in&#xD;
             accordancewith WHO (2016) diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment-naïve patients (patients who have had no prior disease-modifying therapy)&#xD;
             may enroll in any AM-001 Arm that is open to accrual in phase 1 or phase 2.&#xD;
             Treatment-naïve patients may have received recombinant erythropoietin, danazol,&#xD;
             hydroxyurea or anagrelide, which are not considered to be disease-modifying therapy&#xD;
             for the purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After an appropriate wash-out period, patients who have failed (or were intolerant to)&#xD;
             prior therapy with a regimen(s) containing a DNMTi may enroll in any Arm in phase 1b&#xD;
             or any Arm which has met the criterion of the first Simon's Stage and are open to&#xD;
             accrual in the second Simon's Stage in phase 2. Except in the first stage of the phase&#xD;
             2, there are no limits on number of prior therapies if the patient meets all other&#xD;
             eligibility criteria. Previously treated patients include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients treated with DNMTi therapy prior to enrollment in AM-001 who failed to&#xD;
                  achieve a complete remission, per the MDS/MPN IWG response criteria, after at&#xD;
                  least 4 cycles of DNMTi therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ;Patients enrolled in AM-001, or patients treated off-study with a regimen&#xD;
                  containing a DNMTi, who have definitive disease progression as defined in the&#xD;
                  protocol after at least 2 cycles of the prior therapy-this includes patients who&#xD;
                  fail to achieve a response with clearly progressive disease and patients who&#xD;
                  achieve an initial response who then lose that response;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients enrolled in AM-001 who have stable disease as best response at the&#xD;
                  second response evaluation after 6 cycles of the prior AM-001 therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients treated on AM-001 who had and recovered from an adverse event that&#xD;
                  precludes further therapy on that Arm; after recovery from a toxicity that is&#xD;
                  likely to be related to ASTX727, enrollment in another AM-001 may occur provided&#xD;
                  that dose modifications are made as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to undergo bone marrow biopsy with aspiration during screening and&#xD;
             bone marrow aspiration with tissue collection for disease assessment and correlative&#xD;

          -  For previously treated patients, recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline of any toxicities&#xD;
             due to prior systemic treatments, excluding alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN or ≤ 2x ULN, if upon judgment of the treating&#xD;
                  investigator the elevated bilirubin is due to extramedullary hematopoiesis&#xD;
                  related to the underlying MDS/MPN or to Gilbert's disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance (eCCR) &gt;/=40&#xD;

                  INCB59872 arm. eCCR may be calculated using the standard institutional formula.&#xD;
                  The estimation tool/formula employed and result must be declared in the case&#xD;
