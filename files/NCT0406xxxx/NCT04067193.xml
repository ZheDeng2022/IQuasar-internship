    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the usability of a new remote warning system for fall in old people.&#xD;
      This system is integrated in a shoe. Patients hospitalized in a geriatric ward but also their&#xD;
      informal and professional caregivers will assess the usability of the device using a&#xD;
      structured survey.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a major health concerned because of their frequency and severity. It is estimated&#xD;
      that 30% of people over 65 years old and 50% of those over 85 years old fall at least once a&#xD;
      year. Falls are also one of the main factors of morbidity, mortality and early&#xD;
      institutionalization for old people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventive measures have been implemented to limit the recurrence of falls. Most of these&#xD;
      preventive measures are secondary and tertiary prevention programs, such as MultiFactorial&#xD;
      Interventions (MFIs). Home-based programs are under evaluation, but evidences of their&#xD;
      effectiveness are currently controversial. Effects of prevention programs for in and&#xD;
      outpatients remain modest. The objectives of these interventions are to decrease the&#xD;
      frequency of falls but also to decrease the severity of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of falls is due to their physical complications (found in 50 to 55% of cases),&#xD;
      their psychological complications (40%) but it is also reflected by the subsequent&#xD;
      hospitalizations (20%), the acceleration of dependency (50%) and the institutionalizations&#xD;
      (40%). Falls are complicated by death in 5% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the literature on fall complications is profuse. One of these complications is&#xD;
      the hip fracture. Hip fracture is the main cause of mortality and loss of autonomy due to&#xD;
      falls. However, in a previous study conducted by Bloch et al. in 2009 at Cochin Hospital,&#xD;
      several indirect evidences tended to show that mortality from falls was related to the&#xD;
      metabolic disorders linked to the extended stay on the ground, rather than to immediate&#xD;
      traumatic consequences. As metabolic disorders reflects the time needed to be rescued, this&#xD;
      article highlights the importance of using early warning systems to reduce the occurrence of&#xD;
      such complications in old frail patients living alone, and unable to get up alone from the&#xD;
      ground.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used warning tools are remote assistance systems (necklace or bracelet)&#xD;
      with a button to push in case of a fall. In the study conducted by Flemming et al. in 2008,&#xD;
      when these systems are activated, the great majority of fallers are back on their feet within&#xD;
      one hour after the alert. Nevertheless, of 143 old people living alone and unable to get up&#xD;
      alone from the ground, only 28 were using a warning system. The reasons for non-use are as&#xD;
      follows: the person does not have a warning remote assistance systems, the person owns a&#xD;
      warning remote assistance systems but was not wearing it at the time of the fall, the person&#xD;
      was wearing a warning remote assistance systems but was forgetting (or was in difficulty) to&#xD;
      use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many research projects on fall warning and detection systems have been initiated. In the 2018&#xD;
      meta-analysis by Nguyen et al., fall detection systems are divided into 2 groups: a pre and a&#xD;
      post-fall group. In the latter group, the detection systems were mainly using 3D&#xD;
      accelerators, gyroscopes, magnetometers or smartphones with the above-mentioned devices.&#xD;
      However, to date, there is no reliable detection system on the market because some obstacles&#xD;
      remain. These obstacles are concerning technology but also usability. Concerning&#xD;
      technological issue, one of the problems remains the ability of devices to detect low kinetic&#xD;
      falls, which is common in the elderly. Concerning usability, questions are for example the&#xD;
      problem of the voluntary activation by the user of the most common devices, or the absence of&#xD;
      wearing the device during numerous falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARADE CONNECT would remove some of the usability obstacle typically associated with remote&#xD;
      warning systems. Indeed, the system is activated independently of the will, cognitive state&#xD;
      and consciousness of its user. The warning system is integrated into a shoe usually worn by&#xD;
      the old people, with probably a less stigmatizing character of aging and loss of&#xD;
      independence. This is why it seems important to us, as a first step, to evaluate its&#xD;
      acceptability and usability by patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Satisfaction of the PARADE CONNECT shoes: recommendation scale</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours after removal of the device</time_frame>
    <description>Average recommendation score. Satisfaction score is calculated using the responses to the recommendation scale. This scale is a ten point's scale from 0 (I don't recommend at all) to 10 (I fully recommend). An average score greater than 5/10 would be acceptable, a score greater than or equal to 7/10 would be satisfactory.</description>

The Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The average score is reported on ten. An average score greater than 5/10 would be acceptable, a score greater than or equal to 7/10 would be satisfactory.</description>
