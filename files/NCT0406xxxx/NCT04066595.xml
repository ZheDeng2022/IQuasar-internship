  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase II study we investigate the benefit of cabozantinib treatment for patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastasized urothelial cell carcinoma who have been pre-treated with&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors only (cohort 1) or who have been pre-treated with cisplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors (cohort 2). We are lacking adequate response and&#xD;
      outcome data in patients after immunotherapy and consider that this study will improve future&#xD;
      treatment modalities for this important patient cohort.&#xD;
