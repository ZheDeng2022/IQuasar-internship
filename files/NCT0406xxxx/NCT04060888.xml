    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in Chinese participants&#xD;
      with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have not adequately responded to one or&#xD;
      more standard-of-care treatments.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Pre-planned IA (global study) showed lack of efficacy in this indication. No new safety signals&#xD;
    observed, findings consistent with known profile.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) Composite Response at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Time to flare is the duration of flare occurring at any time after the baseline will be calculated with flare defined as either 1 or more new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A or 2 or more new BILAG B domain scores relative to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

Sustained reduction of glucocorticoid dose is defined as achieving an average daily oral glucocorticoid dose reduction between Weeks 24 and 40, and sustaining that reduction through Week 52, in those participants who, at baseline, were receiving oral glucocorticoids.</description>
