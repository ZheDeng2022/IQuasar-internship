  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study population includes primary care physicians and heart failure (HF) patients&#xD;
      attending one of over 100 family physicians in seven family health teams in Southwestern&#xD;
      Ontario. Study purpose is to measure the effect of an integrated disease management (IDM)&#xD;
      program for people diagnosed with HF and receiving treatment at a primary care facility.&#xD;
      Components of IDM include HF specific patient education and self care management skills&#xD;
      training by a heart failure educator. Study outcomes include health service use, HF symptoms,&#xD;
      quality of life, medication adherence and HF knowledge assessment compared to the usual care&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is composite and will measure the effect of integrated&#xD;
      disease management (IDM) on all cause hospitalizations, ED visits and mortality events.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include HF related hospitalizations, HF related ED visits, quality of&#xD;
      life, mortalit, other health service utilization, acute HF episodes, NYHA class. We&#xD;
      hypothesize HF specific IDM implemented in primary care will be superior to usual&#xD;
      physician-based care measured by a combined reduction in the total number of all cause&#xD;
      hospitalizations and ED visit events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be identified through patients attending one of 100 family&#xD;
      physicians under seven different family health teams (FHTs) in the Southwestern Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A parallel cluster randomized trial design has been chosen comparing the&#xD;
      intervention arm (patients entered on the IDM) to the control arm (patients receiving usual&#xD;
      care). A multi-level study design is proposed, level 3 the FHT, level 2 the physician and&#xD;
      level 1 the HF patient. We have chosen to randomize at level 2, the physician and implement&#xD;
      the intervention at both level 2 and 1, the physician and the individual. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      measured at individual level. Stratified randomization of physicians will be performed by&#xD;
      FHT, giving greater balance between arms and increased power and precision by reduction of&#xD;
      between cluster variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Physicians from the FHTs will be invited to participate and informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained. The physician will be randomized to either the control or intervention&#xD;
      group and randomization will be computer generated by FHT strata. Allocation for overall&#xD;
      study will be 1:1 as will allocation by FHT with an even number of physicians. If FHT's have&#xD;
      an uneven number of physician's random allocation of the 'extras' will be 1:1. Each&#xD;
      participating physician will identify all individuals with a HF diagnosis in their care&#xD;
      suitable for the trial and a simple random sample will be taken from this group to obtain the&#xD;
      desired cluster size. An initial visit will be arranged with the patient to discuss study&#xD;
      details, obtain informed consent, further determine eligibility, collect baseline data and&#xD;
      heart failure history and complete questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: As a part of the objectives of this study a POSS electronic tool has been&#xD;
      developed, all data collected about the participants will be entered by heart failure&#xD;
      educators and stored in a central server. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only.&#xD;
      The POSS has been designed not only as a secure storage depot but also as a tool to&#xD;
      standardize the data collected minimizing information bias. There is extensive data checking&#xD;
      at the time of data entry. Data definitions are incorporated to support quality data inputs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: With a minimum recruitment of 50 physicians recruited and 4 participants per&#xD;
      physician, this study would be powered to detect a minimum 36% reduction in the rate of&#xD;
      number of hospitalizations or ED visits per person year with an attrition rate of 20%. This&#xD;
      calculation is based on 80% power to 5% significance with an ICC of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 100 physicians are recruited with 2 to 3 participants per physician (and a total sample&#xD;
      size of 280) the study will have 90% power to detect a 35% reduction in the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Analysis will be on an intention to treat basis. Baseline data will be&#xD;
      used to characterize the study population, to identify any imbalances between arms.&#xD;
      Continuous data will be displayed as mean ±standard deviation and count (percent) for&#xD;
      categorical variables (variables to be presented will be predetermined in an analysis plan).&#xD;
      Due to over dispersion that occurs in this type of count data the primary outcome (and health&#xD;
      service utilization secondary outcomes) will be analyzed using a negative binomial&#xD;
      distribution with random effects to account for clustering and for individuals experiencing&#xD;
      multiple events. The results will be presented as rate ratios. The secondary outcome (change&#xD;
      in KCCQ at 6 months) will be analyzed at individual level using logistic regression, results&#xD;
      will be presented as odds ratios. Reliability will be assessed by using a quadrature check&#xD;
      and in the event of failure a generalizing estimating equation (GEE) model will be fitted.&#xD;

    <description>Physicians randomized to intervention will attend a training session on the program standards and details of the IDM. Following the initial baseline interview a certified heart failure educator (CHFE) will meet with subjects to obtain a detailed history of their HF, provide education, self-care management strategies (medication adherence, symptoms monitoring, dietary adherence, fluid restriction, exercise, weight management, smoking cessation) and review immunization status. A self-management action plan will be developed with the study physician and CHFE to enable monitoring and management of HF by the participant.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive HF care as usually provided by their physician as advised or as needed. Study commitments for the control group include the initial interview, the expected time allotment for this initial visit is 1 hour. Telephone follow-up will occur at 3 months and 9 months to collect exacerbation data and maintain contact with participant. At 6 months and 12 months telephone follow-up will be conducted by the research assistant and the questionnaires will be completed.</description>
