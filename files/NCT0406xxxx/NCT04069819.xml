  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cilostazol is a PDE 3 inhibitor, which showed as decrease in HAM-D scores in post-stroke&#xD;
      depression through inhibition of neurodegeneration in the primary lesion and secondary&#xD;
      extrafocal sites and through promotion of neurogenesis. These beneficial effects on&#xD;
      post-stroke depression may be involved in activation of CREB/BDNF signaling.The aim of the&#xD;
      current study is to evaluate the potential adjunct antidepressant effect of cilostazol in&#xD;
      adult patients with MDD. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between HAM-D score and&#xD;
      BDNF as well as their role as a therapeutic targets of MDD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cilostazol produces various powerful pleiotropic effects via restoration of intracellular&#xD;
      second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Treatment with cilostazol against&#xD;
      cerebral ischemic injury ameliorates negative effects of cerebral hypoperfusion through the&#xD;
      PDE3- cAMP signaling cascade with subsequent activation of inducible transcription factor&#xD;
      cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), suggesting the importance of the CREB signaling&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of CREB promotes the gene expression of neuroprotective molecules that activate&#xD;
      subsequent anti-apoptotic pathways with the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic&#xD;
      factor (BDNF). BDNF also regulates neurogenesis, proliferation, and survival of neural stem&#xD;
      or progenitor cells, as well as neuronal survival. In addition, CREB and BDNF signaling play&#xD;
      an important role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychopharmacotherapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers provides an effective&#xD;
      treatment for depression after stroke, but alternative therapy by activation of CREB and BDNF&#xD;
      signaling may exert beneficial effects on various aspects of negative mood. Drugs that&#xD;
      activate CREB and BDNF signaling may provide a potential therapeutic approach for treatment&#xD;
      of poststroke depression via neural cell survival and proliferation of neural progenitor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the potential adjunct antidepressant effect of&#xD;
      cilostazol in adult patients with MDD. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between&#xD;
      HAM-D score and BDNF as well as their role as a therapeutic targets of MDD.&#xD;

    <description>The principal measure of the outcome was the 17-items HAM-D. Scoring is based on the 17-item scale and scores of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-13 suggest mild depression, 14-17 moderate depression and scores over 17 are indicative of severe depression. Remission is defined as HAM-D total score ≤ 7 (primary outcome). Treatment response is defined as ≥ 50% drop in the HAM-D total score.</description>
