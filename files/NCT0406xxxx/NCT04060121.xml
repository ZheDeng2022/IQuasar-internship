    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is study bowel symptoms, quality of life, and personal factors that&#xD;
      may affect your health. In Aim 1 of this study participants will be invited to complete 6&#xD;
      survey-based questionnaires online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 2 of this study will monitor the effectiveness of a 12 week therapy program on bowel&#xD;
      symptoms and overall quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For Aim 1, investigators will conduct a cross-sectional survey study examining prevalence of&#xD;
      early adverse life events and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with&#xD;
      constipation-predominant IBS or chronic constipation with or without overlapping dyssynergic&#xD;
      defecation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2, investigators will recruit and enroll individuals who have a positive history of&#xD;
      early adverse life events or possible PTSD as identified in Aim 1 for a 12 week outpatient&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy program as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Participants will present to the GI Office at one of our dedicated locations&#xD;
      including the downtown Digestive and Liver Disorders (DaLD) clinic, Springmill Clinic, or IU&#xD;
      North Multispeciality Clinic) At this screening visit, participants do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Read and sign the informed consent after all your questions about the study will be&#xD;
           answered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a medical history taken including demographics, symptoms and history of illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications will be reviewed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical exam will be performed by the physician if the visit is being conducted in&#xD;
           person. If the visit is done virtually, the physician will record that exam as a virtual&#xD;
           exam with all relevant information that can be gathered by a virtual exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs will be measured if the visit is conducted in person. If the visit is&#xD;
           virtual, vital signs will not be physically done but any available data pertaining to&#xD;
           vital signs will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be provided a bowel pattern diary to record bowel symptoms over the&#xD;
           course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete global assessment scales (2 questions) during&#xD;
           each week of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be administered the PAC-SYM, PAC-QOL, global assessment scale, SF-12,&#xD;
           HADS and PCL-5 during CBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be administered the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 at every CBT visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study visit may take 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1-15 (Run-In Phase):&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Participants be asked to record stool symptoms and patterns in a diary daily starting from&#xD;
      Day 1 to Day 15. The daily dairy can either be completed on paper or by phone or on the web.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 16-100 (Visit 2-13): During this time, participants will undergo regular sessions with a&#xD;
      dedicated GI psychologist. They will receive one 60-minute session every week for 10-12&#xD;
      weeks. The treatment schedule will include education on the relationship between bowel&#xD;
      symptoms and stressful life events with instructions on ways to cope and manage symptoms&#xD;
      through the use of relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises and other methods for&#xD;
      self calming. During the 10 to 12 weeks of therapy, participants will be given assignments&#xD;
      and asked to monitor your progress. After you have completed your treatment sessions, you&#xD;
      will be asked to fill out the same questionnaires that you completed at your screening visit&#xD;
      that can be done either in person using a physical form or virtually online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 14:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • We will also confirm completion of the study.&#xD;
