  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of peposertib and to see how&#xD;
      well it works with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies that have spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (advanced/metastatic). Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of&#xD;
      radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer&#xD;
      side effects. Giving peposertib in combination with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation&#xD;
      therapy may work better than other standard chemotherapy, hormonal, targeted, or&#xD;
      immunotherapy medicines available in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of peposertib&#xD;
      (M3814) in combination with hypofractionated radiation and avelumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination&#xD;
      of hypofractionated radiation, M3814, and avelumab as compared to the combination of&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation and avelumab in patients with advanced/metastatic hepatobiliary&#xD;
      tumors by objective response rate (ORR) in non-irradiated lesions. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of M3814 in combination with avelumab. (Phase I) III. To&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of hypofractionated radiation, M3814,&#xD;
      and avelumab as compared to hypofractionated radiation and avelumab by measurement of disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), PFS outside&#xD;
      the irradiated field, and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced/metastatic&#xD;
      hepatobiliary tumors. (Phase II) IV. To determine if baseline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      repair defects inherent to some cholangiocarcinomas correlate with a more dramatic response&#xD;
      to radiation compared to those without as measured by gamma H2AX phosphorylated (p)NBS1&#xD;
      multiplex immunofluorescence (IFA) assay. (Phase II) V. To characterize the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) profiles of M3814 and avelumab. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not&#xD;
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES), ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq), mass&#xD;
      cytometry (CyTOF), multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), and T cell receptor sequencing in&#xD;
      order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To determine if baseline tumor mutation burden and pattern, and neoantigen burden&#xD;
      correlate with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. To determine if combination therapy results in changes in the immune landscape in both&#xD;
      the tumor and the host that correlate with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. To determine if baseline defects in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair in some&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinomas correlate with an increased response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of peposertib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced/metastatic malignant solid tumors undergo 8 fractions of&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) every day (QD) on days -17 to -7. Patients also&#xD;
      receive peposertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and avelumab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients advanced/metastatic cholangiocarcinoma/gallbladder cancer are randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo 8 fractions of hypofractionated RT QD on days -17 to -7. Patients&#xD;
      also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo 8 fractions of hypofractionated RT QD on days -17 to -7. Patients&#xD;
      also receive peposertib PO BID on days 1-28, and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and&#xD;
      15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for&#xD;
      2 years, then annually thereafter.&#xD;

             thromboplastin time (aPTT) =&lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This applies only to patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation; patients&#xD;
                  receiving therapeutic anticoagulation should be on a stable dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have the ability to swallow and retain oral medication and not have&#xD;
             any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that might alter absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required. The effects of M3814 and avelumab on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown and there is the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For&#xD;
             this reason, women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study treatment, and for 6 months after completion of M3814&#xD;
             and avelumab administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M3814 and&#xD;
             avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M3814 and&#xD;
             avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a close caregiver&#xD;
             or legally authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, definitive radiation, biological cancer therapy,&#xD;
             or investigational agent/device within 21 days of first planned dose of study therapy&#xD;
             (within 14 days for palliative radiation). Previously irradiated lesions may be&#xD;
             re-irradiated provided there is disease progression in the irradiated lesion and the&#xD;
             prescribed radiation dosage can safely be re- administered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
             [CTCAE] grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received prior immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated/uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS)/leptomeningeal&#xD;
             disease. Patients with asymptomatic, treated CNS disease are eligible if the treating&#xD;
             physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is&#xD;
             unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy and the following criteria&#xD;
             are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiographic demonstration of clinical stability upon the completion of&#xD;
                  CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the&#xD;
                  completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening radiographic study done &gt;= 4&#xD;
                  weeks from completion of radiotherapy and &gt;= 2 weeks from discontinuation of&#xD;
                  corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No stereotactic radiation or whole-brain radiation within 28 days prior to&#xD;

             sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis, with the&#xD;
             following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a history of autoimmune hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid&#xD;
                  replacement hormone are eligible&#xD;

                  desonide 0.05%, alclometasone dipropionate 0.05%) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate,&#xD;
             thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents) within 6 weeks must&#xD;
             discontinue these medications prior to starting M3814 and avelumab on day 7, with the&#xD;
             exception of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with active autoimmune disease managed with systemic corticosteroids&#xD;

                  medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone)&#xD;
                  for patients with orthostatic hypotension and adrenocortical insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone prior solid organ or bone marrow transplant with the&#xD;
             exception of patients with prior renal transplant for whom dialysis may be employed in&#xD;
             the event of graft rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness (e.g., including but not limited to&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension [HTN] [systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150, diastolic BP &gt;&#xD;
             100], symptomatic congestive heart failure [CHF], unstable angina pectoris, ischemic&#xD;
             myocardial infarction [MI] within 6 months, cardiac arrhythmia, recent transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack [TIA or cerebrovascular accident (CVA)]) within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious active infection within 4 weeks prior to enrollment (e.g.&#xD;
             requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous [IV] antibiotics), signs/symptoms of&#xD;
             infection within 2 weeks prior to enrollment, or currently receiving oral or IV&#xD;
             antibiotics for the treatment of infection. Patients receiving prophylactic&#xD;
             antibiotics are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must have an&#xD;
             undetectable viral load on suppressive therapy if indicated. Patients with known&#xD;
             chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. Patients who are&#xD;
             currently on curative treatment are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral&#xD;
             load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are allowed on study provided&#xD;
             they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention&#xD;
                  of opportunistic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An undetectable HIV viral load on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based&#xD;
                  testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug&#xD;
             induced), organizing pneumonia (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing&#xD;
             pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography&#xD;
             (CT) scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known concurrent malignancy that is expected to require active treatment&#xD;
             within two years, or may interfere with the interpretation of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
             outcomes of this study in the opinion of the treating investigator. Superficial&#xD;
             bladder cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and low-grade prostate cancer not requiring&#xD;
             cytotoxic therapy should not exclude participation in this trial. Patients with&#xD;
             chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may be enrolled if they do not require active&#xD;
             chemotherapy and their hematologic, renal and hepatic function meets criteria&#xD;
             previously mentioned&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to M3814 or avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to discontinue medications or substances that are potent inhibitors,&#xD;
             inducers or sensitive substrates of CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C19 prior to starting M3814 and&#xD;
             avelumab on day 7 are ineligible. Medications or substances that are strong inhibitors&#xD;
             of CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C19 must be discontinued at least 1 week prior to first M3814 dose.&#xD;
             Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 or CYP2C19 must be stopped at least 3 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             first dose. Drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A with a narrow therapeutic index as&#xD;
             judged by the investigator must stop at least 1 day prior to first M3814 dose. Because&#xD;
             the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly&#xD;
             consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed&#xD;
             consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with&#xD;
             other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the&#xD;
             patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. The primary&#xD;
             elimination mechanism of avelumab is proteolytic degradation, thus there are no&#xD;
             contraindicated medications with respect to avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) prior to&#xD;
             starting M3814 and avelumab. These must be discontinued &gt;= 5 days prior to study&#xD;
             treatment. Patients do not need to discontinue calcium carbonate. H2 blockers are&#xD;
             allowed provided they are taken at least 2 hours after M3814 dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving sorivudine or any chemically related analogues (such as brivudine)&#xD;
             and not able to discontinue prior to starting M3814 and avelumab are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study because M3814 and avelumab&#xD;
             are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with M3814 and avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued&#xD;
             if the mother is treated with M3814 and avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received live vaccination within 30 days before the study&#xD;
