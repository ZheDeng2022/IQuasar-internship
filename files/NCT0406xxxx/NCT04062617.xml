      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a form of endoscopy where a&#xD;
      Side-viewing endoscope is introduced into the duodenum, following which instruments are&#xD;
      passed into bile or pancreatic ducts, to allow their radiological visualisation by injecting&#xD;
      contrast medium and/or perform various therapeutic procedures, e.g., removal of bile duct&#xD;
      stone. It is a complex endoscopic procedure with long learning curve and has number of&#xD;
      complications which can even be life-threatening.(1) . Since its introduction in 1968, ERCP&#xD;
      has become a widely used endoscopic procedure for a variety of disorders (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy was first reported in 1974(3). ERCP at its inception was&#xD;
      predominantly a diagnostic procedure, however over the past decade its predominantly carried&#xD;
      out for therapeutic indications (4-5) because of the availability of other imaging&#xD;
      techniques, such as abdominal Ultrasound (US), Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) that provide detailed diagnostic&#xD;
      information and thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for therapeutic ERCP.&#xD;
      Complications are expected to occur in a proportion of patients undergoing ERCP, even when&#xD;
      performed by endoscopists with significant expertise in the procedure. A number of&#xD;
      patient-related and technique-related factors are known to increase the risk of complication&#xD;
      (6). ERCP requires sedation and therefore has in addition a risk of anaesthesia related&#xD;
      adverse events (7). Most of the complications post-ERCP are apparent during the first 6 hours&#xD;
      after the procedure (8). Thus patients require careful monitoring during this phase to detect&#xD;
      symptoms or signs suggesting adverse events. Table 1 below sums up the complications related&#xD;
      to ERCP that has been reported in various studies. (9,10,11,12,13- 21) . Table 1:&#xD;

      of retrieval basket Biloma Multiple studies have evaluated the incidence of post ERCP&#xD;
      complications (9,10,11,12) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective surveys from single referral centres ensure the highest accuracy but are unlikely&#xD;
      to be representative of the frequency and severity of unfavourable events in day-to-day&#xD;
      practice. By comparison, prospective multi-centre studies involving centres with different&#xD;
      volumes of activity and operators with various degrees of expertise more reliably reflect the&#xD;
      general effectiveness and safety of ERCP in the community (10,12). There are no large scale&#xD;
      study evaluating the complications of ERCP in Indian or even Asian population. In an attempt&#xD;
      to address this deficit we will be conducting a dual centre prospective study to look at the&#xD;
      incidence of various ERCP-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed study will be done in both a tertiary care public academic centre and a tertiarycare&#xD;
      private hospital. Both have specialised and well equipped department to carry out ERCP&#xD;
      procedures and evaluate and manage complications if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REVIEW OF LITERATURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERCP is used to diagnose and intervene therapeutically in various pancreatico-biliary&#xD;
      disorders in a minimally invasive manner. But to acquire competence a minimum of 180&#xD;
      procedures is required for a trainee in diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP, defined by deep&#xD;
      cannulation of bile duct in 70 to 80 % of cases.(22) ERCP has a wide variety of indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERCP is generally indicated in as per guidelines published by American Society of&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.(23)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The jaundiced patient suspected of having biliary obstruction (appropriate therapeutic&#xD;
           manoeuvres should be performed during the procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient without jaundice whose clinical and biochemical or imaging data suggest&#xD;
           pancreatic duct or biliary tract disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of signs or symptoms suggesting pancreatic malignancy when results of direct&#xD;
           imaging (eg, EUS, US, CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are equivocal or normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluation of pancreatitis of unknown etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Preoperative evaluation of the patient with chronic pancreatitis and/or pseudocyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluation of the sphincter of Oddi by manometry. Empirical biliary sphincterotomy&#xD;
           without sphincter of Oddi manometry is not recommended in patients with suspected type&#xD;
           III sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Endoscopic sphincterotomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1. Choledocholithiasis. 7.2. Papillary stenosis or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. 7.3.&#xD;
           To facilitate placement of biliary stents or dilation of biliary strictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.4. Sump syndrome. 7.5. Choledochocele involving the major papilla. 7.6. Ampullary&#xD;
           carcinoma in patients who are not candidates for surgery 7.7. Facilitate access to the&#xD;
           pancreatic duct.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Stent placement across benign or malignant strictures, fistulae, postoperative bile&#xD;
           leak, or in high-risk patients with large unremovable common duct stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Dilation of ductal strictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Balloon dilation of the papilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Nasobiliary drain placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Pancreatic pseudocyst drainage in appropriate cases. M. Tissue sampling from pancreatic&#xD;
           or bile ducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Ampullectomy of adenomatous neoplasms of the major papilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Therapy of disorders of the biliary and pancreatic ducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Facilitation of cholangioscopy and/or pancreatoscopy. It is generally recommended that&#xD;
           patients not undergo routine pre-procedure laboratory testing, chest radiography, or&#xD;
           electrocardiography prior to endoscopic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (24) Instead, pre procedure testing should be used selectively based on the patient's medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination findings, and procedural risk factors. Since ERCP carries an&#xD;
      approximate 5 percent risk of major complications, including acute pancreatitis, bleeding,&#xD;
      sepsis, and perforation, we typically obtain laboratory tests prior to the procedure if an&#xD;
      intervention is anticipated (such as sphincterotomy) and blood tests that have not been&#xD;
      obtained as part of the patient's prior evaluation. Such tests include a complete blood count&#xD;
      and prothrombin time/international normalised ratio. A consensus panel introduced a&#xD;
      standardised, outcome-based set of definitions and grading system for the major complications&#xD;
      of ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy.(9) These are noted in Table 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall specific complications (ie, pancreatitis, bleeding, sepsis, and perforation)&#xD;
      varies from 5 to 10 percent in various studies. In a prospective study of total 2347 patients&#xD;
      , complications occurred in 229 (9.8%) patients.(10) In a summary of 21 studies involving&#xD;
      16,855 patients between 1987 and 2003, specific complications totalled 1154 (6.9 percent),&#xD;
      with 55 deaths (0.33 percent).(11) Mild-tomoderate events occurred in 872 patients (5.2&#xD;
      percent), and severe events in 282 (1.7 percent). Among 12,973 patients enrolled in 14&#xD;
      prospective studies, non specific complications totalled 173 (1.3 percent), with nine deaths&#xD;
      (0.07 percent)(11) Despite technological progress and recommendations of scientific&#xD;
      societies, the incidence of complications and procedure-related mortality does not appear to&#xD;
      have decreased over time. One possible reason is that ERCP has become a primarily therapeutic&#xD;
      procedure. In a single center Finnish study with over 1200 ERCPs performed between 2002 and&#xD;
      2009, the overall complication and mortality rates were 11 and 0.4 percent, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (25)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PANCREATITIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the most common complication after ERCP with most studies demonstrating rates of 1.5 to&#xD;
      6 percent. Table 4 demonstrates the complication rates noted in major studies assessing&#xD;
      complication rates of ERCP done over past 20 years. Most of the cases are mild to moderate in&#xD;
      severity. Table 5 demonstrates incidence of post ERCP pancreatitis based on their severity.&#xD;
      The various risk factors for pancreatitis implicated in various Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction&#xD;
      (SOOD), younger age, precut sphincterotomy, difficult cannulation, number of pancreatic&#xD;
      contrast injection, pancreas divisum, failed clearance of biliary stone, prior post ERCP&#xD;
      pancreatitis, female sex, normal serum bilirubin, absence of chronic pancreatitis, placement&#xD;
      of stent and ASA score III-IV(10,26,27,28,29)&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLEEDING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the second most common complication post ERCP in most studies. Bleeding was the most&#xD;
      feared complication when therapeutic biliary endoscopy was first introduced. Because of&#xD;
      advances in equipment and experience, it has become a relatively uncommon complication of&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and it is mostly observed after&#xD;
      sphincterotomy.(22) In a review of 21 studies of over 16,000 patients undergoing ERCP, there&#xD;
      were a total of 226 bleeding episodes (1.3 percent), with eight deaths (0.05 percent).(11)&#xD;
      Bleeding was severe in 66 of the 226 episodes (29 percent). Table 6 enlists the major studies&#xD;
      evaluating rate of Post ERCP bleeding. As a general rule, sphincterotomy is contraindicated&#xD;
      in patients with severe coagulation disorders, such as patients with advanced liver disease,&#xD;
      in patients with hematologic diseases, and in patients with disorders of hemostasis, such as&#xD;
      hemophilia and von Willebrand disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEPTIC COMPLICATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic complications of ERCP include ascending cholangitis, liver abscess, acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis, infected pancreatic pseudocyst, infection following perforation of a viscus,&#xD;
      and less commonly, endocarditis/endovasculitis(30) Ascending cholangitis: In the setting of&#xD;
      ERCP, it is most often due to incomplete drainage of an infected and obstructed biliary&#xD;
      system. Table 7 demonstrates incidence of cholangitis in various studies. Failure to achieve&#xD;
      drainage of an obstructed biliary system is the most important predictor of post-ERCP biliary&#xD;
      sepsis. Acute Cholecystitis: Acute cholecystitis following ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic&#xD;
      biliary drainage may be more common than once appreciated, and must be distinguished from&#xD;
      cholangitis. The incidence of acute cholecystitis in most large series having an incidence&#xD;
      ≤0.5 percent.Table 8 lists the 2 major series evaluating the same. The pathogenesis may be&#xD;
      related to the introduction of non-sterile contrast media into a poorly emptying gallbladder&#xD;
      and/or mechanical or inflammatory obstruction of the cystic duct by an endoprosthesis,&#xD;
      malignancy, or gallstone. Acute cholecystitis following ERCP should be suspected in patients&#xD;
      who develop tenderness localised in the right upper quadrant and have thickening of the&#xD;
      gallbladder wall and pericholecystic fluid on ultrasonography or computed tomography&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERFORATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perforation is one of the most feared complications of endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography. The Stapfer classification is most commonly used and is based on&#xD;
      the mechanism, anatomical location, and severity of the injury that may predict the need for&#xD;
      surgical intervention.(33)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type I: Free bowel wall perforation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type II: Retroperitoneal duodenal perforation secondary to periampullary injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type III: Perforation of the pancreatic or bile duct&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type IV: Retroperitoneal air alone In a case series of 44 post-ERCP perforations, 30 (68&#xD;
           percent) were retroperitoneal duodenal perforations, which usually occur as a result of&#xD;
           a sphincterotomy that extends beyond the intramural portion of bile duct.(34) In a&#xD;
           single-center series, 79 post-ERCP perforations were diagnosed: seven perforations were&#xD;
           type I, 54 were type II, nine were type III, six were type IV, and three were&#xD;
           hypopharyngeal or esophageal. While most patients with Type II perforations were&#xD;
           medically managed, four patients from this group (7 percent) required surgical&#xD;
           intervention.(13)Table 8 below demonstrates the rate of post ERCP perforation in various&#xD;
           studies over the years. In another study, the incidence of perforation following ERCP&#xD;
           was approximately 0.4 percent, with a mortality rate of approximately 7 to 8&#xD;
           percent.Type I perforations accounted for 25 percent of perforations, type II for 46&#xD;
           percent, type III for 22 percent, and type IV for 3 percent (35)&#xD;
&#xD;
      RARE COMPLICATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of less common adverse events have also been described including cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      complications, contrast allergy, impaction of a retrieval basket, and numerous other events&#xD;
      reported in only small numbers of patients or individual case reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These unusual adverse events, which may be difficult to manage, can be associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. Uncommon complications of ERCP have been described in&#xD;
      several large studies. Miscellaneous complications occurred in 25 of 2347 cases (~1 percent)&#xD;
      in a prospective series of patients who underwent biliary sphincterotomy 5. Six of these were&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary events, which were fatal in three patients. In a systematic review of 14&#xD;
      prospective studies including a total of 12,973 patients, there were a total of 173&#xD;
      miscellaneous complications (1.3 percent) and nine deaths (0.07 percent)(13) Anaphylactic&#xD;
      reactions to contrast agents used during ERCP are rare.(14) Nevertheless, a history of&#xD;
      sensitivity to iodine contrast or drug should always be considered in the preprocedure&#xD;
      assessment and in the informed consent process. Electrocautery can influence implantable&#xD;
      devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although most modern pacemakers are unaffected by electrocautery, cardiac arrhythmias can&#xD;
      develop if a monopolar current passes through the pacemaker or the heart. The risk is greater&#xD;
      for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators since electrocautery may trigger their&#xD;
      activation. As a result, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Technology&#xD;
      Assessment Committee recommends that implantable cardioverter-defibrillators be deactivated&#xD;
      during endoscopic electrosurgery.(15) Opacification of the portal vein has been described&#xD;
      following sphincterotomy.(16) Accidental cannulation of the hepatic artery following&#xD;
      needle-knife sphincterotomy has also been reported.(17) Filling of portal, arterial, or&#xD;
      lymphatic vessels has potential risks, including sepsis, air embolism, bleeding, and&#xD;
      thrombosis. Furthermore, failed prompt recognition of contrast in vascular structures may be&#xD;
      a source of confusion leading to prolongation of the procedure, thereby further increasing&#xD;
      the risk of complications. As an example, an opacified portal vein may be misinterpreted as&#xD;
      an incompletely filled bile duct. Insertion of a stent into the portal vein may further&#xD;
      worsen the consequences. Cases of air embolism have been reported following upper and lower&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy, although most described cases have been related to ERCP. In a&#xD;
      review including 40 cases of systemic air embolism following an endoscopic procedure, 24&#xD;
      patients (60 percent) underwent ERCP (18) Hemorrhage following endoscopic sphincterotomy&#xD;
      usually occurs in the duodenal lumen arising from the actual sphincterotomy site. In rare&#xD;
      cases intraperitoneal hemorrhage has been described from injury to the spleen, liver, or&#xD;
      abdominal vessels. Splenic injury is more commonly caused by colonoscopy, but it has also&#xD;
      been reported following ERCP.(19) Previous abdominal surgery with adhesion formation is&#xD;
      recognized as a risk factor; concomitant liver laceration has also been reported (20,21)&#xD;
      Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoperitoneum have been reported secondary to&#xD;
      gastrointestinal perforation, including perforation following endoscopic sphincterotomy.&#xD;
      However, pneumothorax has also been described during diagnostic upper endoscopy and during&#xD;
      ERCP without perforation (25) Such cases are due to a rise in airway and intra alveolar&#xD;
      pressure and the rupture of pulmonary blebs. Impaction of a Dormia basket around a large&#xD;
      calculus was a feared complication of bile duct extraction prior to the introduction of&#xD;
      mechanical lithotripsy. Despite the availability of lithotripsy, cases are still reported.&#xD;
      Usually the basket becomes trapped at the ampulla within the intraduodenal portion of the&#xD;
      common bile duct. Once the basket impaction has occurred, the first and common alternative is&#xD;
      mechanical lithotripsy. (38) TABLE 2 - CLASSIFICATION OF COMPLICATIONS OF ERCP TABLE 3 -&#xD;
