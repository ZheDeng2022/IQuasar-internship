      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy works when&#xD;
      given before surgery in treating patients with stage I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab, may induce changes in body?s immune system and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as cisplatin and pemetrexed, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy may shrink the cancer prior to&#xD;
      surgery and decrease the likelihood of the cancer returning following surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the impact of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy on the&#xD;
      composition, phenotype, and function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in patients&#xD;
      with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab alone and in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy as measured by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab alone and in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the relationship between changes in TIICs and clinical efficacy in patients&#xD;
      with early stage NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize changes in the frequency and number of circulating immune cells induced&#xD;
      by neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy in patients with early stage NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the impact of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy on the&#xD;
      composition and phenotype of the tumor microenvironment (including tumor and stromal cells)&#xD;
      in patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the change in T cell repertoire within the tumor and blood induced by&#xD;
      neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based combination therapy in patients with early stage NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore molecular profiles to identify potentially predictive biomarkers for patients&#xD;
      with early stage NSCLC treated with immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery within 4 weeks following study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes and chemotherapy&#xD;
      (cisplatin/pemetrexed) IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery within&#xD;
      4 weeks following study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
