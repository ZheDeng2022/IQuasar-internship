  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of&#xD;
      multiple dose levels of SC administered ELX-02 in patients with cystinosis with nonsense&#xD;
      mutation in at least one allele.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six patients will be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of the following periods for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of up to 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total treatment period of 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A safety follow-up period of 4 weeks after the last treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive three escalating doses as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period 1: ELX-02 0.5 mg/kg SC daily for 7 days (total dose not to exceed 3.5&#xD;
           mg/kg for this week; the daily dose will be individualized to achieve the target weekly&#xD;
           exposure of about 47.5 µg*h/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period 2: ELX-02 1.0 mg/kg SC daily for 7 days (total dose not to exceed 7.0&#xD;
           mg/kg for this week; the daily dose will be individualized to achieve the target weekly&#xD;
           exposure of about 95 µg*h/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period 3: ELX-02 2.0 mg/kg SC daily for 14 days (total dose not to exceed 14&#xD;
           mg/kg for these two weeks; the daily dose will be individualized to achieve the target&#xD;
           weekly exposure of about 190 µg*h/mL)&#xD;
