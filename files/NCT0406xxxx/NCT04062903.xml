  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a new social prescribing service delivered by Mind Cymru in four&#xD;
      communities in Wales. Mind Cymru have made a new social prescribing service, where a link&#xD;
      worker works with a patient who has mild/moderate mental or emotional health problems, to&#xD;
      understand their needs and set them goals for the future. The link worker will then help them&#xD;
      find a service in their local community that might help them achieve their goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a waitlist trial, which means that some participants will get to meet the link&#xD;
      worker and have the intervention straight away, while others will have to wait for 20 working&#xD;
      days. From this, the researchers can compare the people who had the intervention straight&#xD;
      away with the people who had to wait. Scores on well-being, quality of life and loneliness&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used to see the effects of the intervention on patients, whilst&#xD;
      information like patient attendance at the General Practioner surgery will be used to see if&#xD;
      there is a difference in the patient's use of health services.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial will employ a randomised wait-list control design. The study has been co-designed&#xD;
      with the research team at University of South Wales, Mind Cymru, the link workers and General&#xD;
      Practioners working within the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the effectiveness of services provided through making three sets of&#xD;
      comparisons (based on a set of individual- and service-level outcomes over time - comparing&#xD;
      between: - The four Local Mind sites (Merthyr and Valleys, Vale of Clwyd, Brecon and&#xD;
      District, Ystradgynlais);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who complete the intervention immediately, with those who are in the waitlist&#xD;
           group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who fully complete the social prescribing intervention with those who do not&#xD;
           complete or partially the full social prescription but receive care as usual (either&#xD;
           because they do not attend or only partially attend); and Participants will be randomly&#xD;
           allocated to receive the social prescribing link worker intervention either immediately,&#xD;
           or after a waiting period of 20 working days. Participants will be recruited through&#xD;
           consultations with healthcare professionals, either their General Practioner, a practice&#xD;
           nurse or the Total Nurse Triage system within the doctors surgery. If the healthcare&#xD;
           professional identifies that the prospective participant meets the eligibility criteria&#xD;
           of the study (experiencing mild/moderate mental health and/or emotional wellbeing&#xD;
           disorders, aged 18+ and registered with a General Practioners in Wales), they will&#xD;
           provide the prospective participant with an information pack, and ask for permission to&#xD;
           contact. If this permission is given they will be subsequently contacted by the link&#xD;
           worker at least 2 working days later, to gain verbal consent and for baseline data&#xD;
           collection and randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study recruitment target is 1,000 participants, randomized into two groups (a control&#xD;
      group, n = 500 and an intervention group n = 500). The sample collected across the 3 General&#xD;
      Practice clusters over the 24-month period that the study is open. An attrition rate of 5% is&#xD;
      expected. Recruitment will end after 18-months, allowing for 6 months to complete the study&#xD;
      and follow-up on participants. The service may continue independently of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at a maximum of five time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to randomisation to either the immediate or wait-list arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For wait-list controls: in a reminder telephone call at the end of the 20 day wait&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of their intervention with the link worker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four weeks after the end of their intervention with the link worker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three months after the end of the previous data collection point Data will be collected&#xD;
           either over the telephone or during the intervention with the link workers. All link&#xD;
           workers who are collecting data will have study specific training for receiving consent&#xD;
           and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place over a 24-month period, with participant recruitment lasting a&#xD;
      total of 18-months. Data analysis will take place at the end of the 24-month period, although&#xD;
      transfer of data from the link workers to the research team at University of South Wales will&#xD;
      be continuous over the 24-month period. A final report will be produced at the end of the&#xD;
      study for the Welsh Government.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline. The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, 4 weeks and 3 months after randomisation.</time_frame>
    <description>SWEMWBS is completed by the participants and allows self reflection on mental well-being before and during involvement in health enhancing activities. Each of the 7 statements can be scored 1 to 5, from &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot;. A total score is calculated by summing the 7 individual statement scores. The minimum score is 7 and the maximum is 35. The higher score signifies better mental well-being.</description>

    <time_frame>At Baseline, 4 weeks and 3 months after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The Recovering Quality of Life questionaire is completed by the participants and allows self-reporting on their journey to recovery. There are twenty statements with five answers, and can be scored 0-4. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 80, where 0 indicates poorest quality of life and 80 indicates highest quality of life.</description>
