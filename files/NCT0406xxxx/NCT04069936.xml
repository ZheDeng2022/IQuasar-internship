      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of MILs™ - NSCLC alone and&#xD;
      in combination with nivolumab with or without tadalafil in subjects with locally advanced and&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic NSCLC who are refractory or relapsing to a PD-1 containing&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;

      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of Marrow Infiltrating Lymphocytes-Non-Small&#xD;
      Cell Lung Cancer (MILs™ - NSCLC) combined with nivolumab with or without tadalafil in&#xD;
      subjects with locally advanced and unresectable and metastatic NSCLC who were refractory to,&#xD;
      or have relapsed on, an anti-PD-1 containing regimen. MILs™ - NSCLC are an adoptive cell&#xD;
      therapy product derived via the activation and expansion of bone marrow T cells. Subjects&#xD;
      will have bone marrow harvested during the Screening Period which will be used to manufacture&#xD;
      the MILs™ - NSCLC. The MILs™ - NSCLC will then be administered on Day 0. Nivolumab will be&#xD;
      administered on Day 1 and will continue every four weeks until treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
      Tadalafil will be administered on Day 1 and will continue daily until treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
