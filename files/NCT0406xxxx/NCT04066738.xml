    <textblock>
      Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is a proven treatment for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRT consists of a special pacemaker with two/three leads (insulated wires which take the&#xD;
      electrical impulses from the device to the heart), one in the right ventricle, one in a vein&#xD;
      on the outer surface of the left ventricle (in a vessel called coronary sinus or CS) and&#xD;
      sometimes one in the right atrium (right top chamber of the heart). Tiny electrical impulses&#xD;
      are simultaneously sent to the ventricles to make them beating together again in a more&#xD;
      synchronised pattern. This leads to a coordinated, synchronous pumping action that, in most&#xD;
      patients, translates into improved heart failure symptoms and improved quality and quantity&#xD;
      of life, reducing the chance of being admitted to hospital with worsening heart failure.&#xD;
      Unfortunately up to one third of the patients do not benefit from CRT therapy and to date&#xD;
      there are no useful criteria to predict the response to CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to improve the response rate to CRT, alternative methods have been developed. In&#xD;
      particular, a new technology called MultiPoint Pacing (MPP) (St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA)&#xD;
      has recently become available. It allows simultaneous stimulation of 2 different points in&#xD;
      the left ventricle by using a single lead with four electrodes. This strategy should improve&#xD;
      the pumping function of the heart by recruiting a larger mass of muscle. Although MPP is as&#xD;
      safe and as effective as standard CRT pacing, the improvements to date in the heart pump&#xD;
      function it gives over standard CRT pacing are variable and small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that MPP pacing could be particularly beneficial in some subgroups&#xD;
      of patients, in particular patients with a previous history of heart attack resulting in scar&#xD;
      formation in the left ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that MPP works better when the lead is closer to the scar&#xD;
      because this allows recruitment of areas with slow conduction, thus increasing&#xD;
      synchronization further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this aim, they plan to compare, in each patient, the acute response produced by MPP on the&#xD;
      cardiac function when the CS lead is placed close to myocardial scar and when it is placed&#xD;
      far from scar respectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective single-centre pilot study will be conducted to investigate this topic. Fifteen&#xD;
      patients, with a history of previous ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) resulting in&#xD;
      myocardial scar and elected to CRT implant at the OUH, will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to standard practice, additional research investigations will be a baseline visit&#xD;
      for eligibility assessment, informed consent and pre-CRT implant cardiac MRI, a&#xD;
      three-dimensional electroanatomical map reconstruction of the CS venous system during the&#xD;
      standard CRT implant and the evaluation of the acute haemodynamic response (AHR, percentage&#xD;
      increase of LV-dP/dT max) of MPP over conventional single-site LV pacing during the CRT&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be performed in each patient 1-2 weeks&#xD;
      before the CRT implant during the baseline visit. It will provide information regarding&#xD;
      presence and location of myocardial scar and anatomy of the CS venous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A de-novo CRT implant will be performed under fluoroscopic guidance as per standard care. All&#xD;
      subjects will be implanted with a regulatory approved St. Jude Medical CRT device compatible&#xD;
      with MPP feature (models nÂ° CD3271-40(Q), CD3371-40(Q), CD3371-40C(QC) or newer) and St. Jude&#xD;
      Medical quadripolar left ventricular lead (Quartet 1458Q or newer). The choice of the right&#xD;
      ventricular and right atrial leads will be left to the operator. After implant of the right&#xD;
      ventricular and right atrial leads, a CS venogram will be then performed as per standard&#xD;
      practice (see intervention section for more details).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three-dimensional electroanatomical map of the CS venous system will be constructed with&#xD;
      Precision mapping system and a Biotronik Vision wire (Biotronik Se &amp; Co. KG, Berlin, Germany)&#xD;
      by using the CS venogram as a guide. The map will be merged with the correspondent cardiac&#xD;
      MRI images in order to locate the myocardial scar in respect to the CS branches. This will&#xD;
      allow the identification of two target CS branches for the study measurements, one located in&#xD;
      the peri-infarct region and one located in the remote myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Certus PressureWire will be then introduced into the LV. A PhysioMon software (Radi Medical&#xD;
      Systems, Uppsala, Sweden) will be used for electronic calculation of the LV-dP/dTmax from&#xD;
      every heartbeat for a period of at least thirty seconds to ensure steady-state conditions.&#xD;
      The baseline LV-dP/dTmax will be measured during ventricular spontaneous rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A St. Jude Medical quadripolar left ventricular lead will be sequentially placed in the&#xD;
      &quot;peri-infarct&quot; CS branch and in the &quot;remote myocardium&quot; CS branch. In each site the&#xD;
      percentage increase in LV-dP/dTmax (Acute Haemodynamic Response, AHR) produced by both&#xD;
      conventional single-site and MPP LV pacing to will be measured. All 4 poles of the&#xD;
      quadripolar lead will be used in turn for conventional single-site LV pacing, 3 different&#xD;
      configurations will be used in turn for MPP. The LV-dP/dTmax will be recorded for each pacing&#xD;
      configuration in order to identify the MPP and the single-site LV pacing configurations&#xD;
      producing the best AHR (best percentage increase of LV-dP/dTmax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AHR produced by the best MPP configuration in peri-infarct region will be compared with&#xD;
      the AHR produced by the best MPP configuration in the remote myocardium. Moreover, the&#xD;
      percentage increase of LV-dP/dTmax produced by the best MPP configuration over the best&#xD;
      conventional single-site LV pacing in the peri-infarct region will be compared with the same&#xD;
      measurement obtained in the remote myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision about the final position of the LV lead and the activation of MPP feature after&#xD;
      the CRT implant will be left to operator preference.&#xD;
