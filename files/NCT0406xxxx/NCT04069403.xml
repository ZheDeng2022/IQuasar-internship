      Analyze baseline concurrent opioid prescribing metrics at the individual prescriber level in&#xD;
      the Duke Health System on the identified three main outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test the impact of reports on opioid prescriber behaviors with the following primary&#xD;
      measures: number of prescriptions with concurrent benzo within reporting period, number of&#xD;
      prescriptions with concurrent muscle relaxants within reporting period, and number of&#xD;
      encounters with naloxone prescriptions for patients with any opioid-related diagnosis within&#xD;
      reporting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Create a blueprint to implement the concurrent opioid prescribing nudge intervention in other&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Concurrent Opioid Prescribing Nudge project intends to address multiple points within the&#xD;
      opioid-use cycle through the development of standardized and scalable reporting mechanisms to&#xD;
      provide social comparisons and feedback to physicians across the Duke Health System regarding&#xD;
      their concurrent and co- opioid, benzodiazepines, and muscle relaxant prescribing practices.&#xD;
      Concurrent are hereby defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  writing a new opioid prescription for a patient with a benzodiazepine prescription&#xD;
           within the last 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  writing a new benzodiazepine prescription for a patient with a opioid prescription&#xD;
           within the last 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  writing a new muscle relaxant prescription for a patient with an opioid prescription&#xD;
           within the last 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  writing a new opioid prescription for a patient with muscle relaxant prescription within&#xD;
           the last 3 months, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  writing a new prescription for both an opioid and benzodiazepine or opioid and muscle&#xD;
           relaxant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will leverage insights from behavioral economics to design informational&#xD;
      and social incentives to reduce concurrent practices and mitigate opioid harm. Opioid&#xD;
      prescribers (attending physicians, residents, and advanced practice providers) at&#xD;
      participating departments and clinics in the Duke Health System will be randomized to a&#xD;
      control or intervention arm. Over six month reporting periods beginning fall 2019, providers&#xD;
      in the intervention arms will receive monthly reports with their individual prescribing&#xD;
      patterns and comparison to peer prescribing patterns for the following measures: number of&#xD;
      prescriptions with concurrent opioid active prescriptions of opioid/ benzodiazepines, number&#xD;
      of prescriptions with concurrent opioid active prescriptions of opioid/muscle relaxants, and&#xD;
      number of missed opportunities to prescribe naloxone to patients with any opioid-related&#xD;
      diagnosis. The control arm will receive usual clinical education and feedback. Interventions&#xD;
      will be implemented at participating departments and clinics utilizing a stepped-wedge&#xD;
      timeline.&#xD;
