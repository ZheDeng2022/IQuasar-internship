      Prospective, non-randomized, single-center study of adult subjects referred for&#xD;
      echocardiography. Total of 200 enrolled subjects at 1 site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vivio system data capture, standard of care transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Vivio&#xD;
      analysis will not be available to non-Avicena personnel&#xD;

    <description>The Vivio System is an electronic auscultatory device and optical sensor, plus software application intended to provide support to the physician in the evaluation of heart sounds in patients. The product will analyze the acoustic signals of the heart and signals from a captured arterial (carotid) waveform. The analysis procedure will identify and analyze specific heart sounds and arterial waveform features captured by the Vivio device, to devise a scoring system for severe aortic stenosis.</description>
