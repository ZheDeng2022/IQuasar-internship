  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase II clinical trial to observe the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Camrelizumab combined with AVD in the first-line treatment for patients with advanced&#xD;
      classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a kind of malignant tumor of the lymph system, approximately 95%&#xD;
      of which are classical hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL). Currently, ABVD and BEACOPP are commonly&#xD;
      used in the first-line treatment for cHL. There are about one third of patients, whose&#xD;
      pre-treatment assessment are mainly advanced cHL, suffering relapse and drug resistance.&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway plays an important role in the development and progression of&#xD;
      cHL. Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab have been used in the therapy in relapsed and refractory&#xD;
      patients with cHL. Camrelizumab, a humanized anti-PD-1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody, is&#xD;
      independently developed in China. The goal of our trial is to assess the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Camrelizumab combined with AVD (Epirubicin, Vincristine and Dacarbazine) in the first-line&#xD;
      treatment for patients with advanced classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
