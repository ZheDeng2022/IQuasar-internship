    <textblock>
      The WEstlake precision BIRTH cohort（WEBIRTH) is a prospective cohort study among women with&#xD;
      hyperglycemia during pregnancy and their offspring living in Hangzhou, China. The primary aim&#xD;
      of this cohort is to characterize the continuous blood glucose response to dietary intake and&#xD;
      physical activity among pregnant women with hyperglycemia over 2 weeks, and to facilitate the&#xD;
      development of personalized nutritional/lifestyle recommendation among these patients.&#xD;
      Another aim of WEBIRTH is to investigate the association of dietary and physical activity&#xD;
      together with continuous glucose change during pregnancy on the adverse birth outcomes&#xD;
      including preterm birth, low birth weight and small-for-gestational age birth. The secondary&#xD;
      aim is to investigate the prospective associations of diet, physical activity and continuous&#xD;
      glucose change over 2 week among the patients with the long-term metabolic health of the&#xD;
      women and their offspring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, an alarming increase in the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)/&#xD;
      diabetes in pregnancy (DIP) patients has been observed in the past decade. GDM and DIP are of&#xD;
      concern because they are associated with several maternal and fetal medical disorders.&#xD;
      Lifestyle changes such as diet and physical activity modifications are key for the prevention&#xD;
      and treatment of GDM/DIP. However, the associations between dietary intake and physical&#xD;
      activity and health outcomes for GDM/DIP women and their children remain unclear due to&#xD;
      subjective measurements of diet and physical activity. Recently, the development of objective&#xD;
      measurement such as food image identification and wearable activity trackers give an&#xD;
      opportunity to gain more precise insight into these associations. In addition, for the same&#xD;
      food and physical activity exposure, GDM/DIP women may have different blood glucose&#xD;
      responses, but the nature of variation is currently poorly characterized. Therefore, the&#xD;
      present WEBIRTH design incorporates three unique components, 1) objective measurement of&#xD;
      physical activity during pregnancy using accelerometer; 2) measurement of dietary intake&#xD;
      using both FFQ and food photos; 3) measurement of blood glucose levels over 2 weeks using&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitors, with a standardized test meal during the 2 weeks. We will then&#xD;
      follow up these women participants during and after this pregnancy, and also follow up their&#xD;
      offspring.&#xD;
