    <textblock>
      The institution of perioperative Enhanced Recovery Protocols (ERPs) has been found to&#xD;
      decrease hospital length of stay, in-hospital costs, and complications among adult surgical&#xD;
      populations but data in pediatric populations are lacking. The Assessing Effectiveness and&#xD;
      Implementation of a Perioperative Enhanced Recovery Protocol for Children Undergoing&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Surgery, which has the short title &quot;ENhanced Recovery In CHildren Undergoing&#xD;
      Surgery (ENRICH-US),&quot; study is a multicenter, pragmatic, prospective study, using a stepped&#xD;
      wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design. The study is designed to test the adoption,&#xD;
      effectiveness, and generalizability of a newly developed, 21-element ERP for children&#xD;
      undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the clinical effectiveness and to examine&#xD;
      obstacles to implementing a Perioperative Enhanced Recovery Protocol (ERP) in pediatric&#xD;
      surgery. ERPs are evidence-based interventions that have been developed among adult surgical&#xD;
      populations, but implementation of ERPs and data in pediatric populations are lacking. To&#xD;
      address this need, we have designed a multicenter, prospective study entitled ENhanced&#xD;
      Recovery In CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US). This study is designed to test the&#xD;
      adoption, effectiveness, and generalizability of a pediatric specific 21-element ERP&#xD;
      intervention for children recovering from surgery compared with usual care. All other&#xD;
      peri-operative care in this study will not be modified from usual care pathways, including&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic elements of the ENRICH-US intervention are very similar to the elements of most&#xD;
      adult ERPs and include perioperative counseling and education, mindfulness training,&#xD;
      maintenance of euvolumia through limited perioperative fasting and limited intraoperative&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation, early enteral intake, early mobilization, limited opioid use, and&#xD;
      non-routine use of surgical drains and tubes. Elements span the preadmission and pre-,&#xD;
      intra-, and post-operative phases of care. The concurrent use of these integrative healthcare&#xD;
      interventions results in a markedly improved patient care experience that minimizes the&#xD;
      physiologic stress of surgery and hastens recovery. These ERPs have been found to decrease&#xD;
      hospital length of stay, in-hospital costs, complications, and help patients recover sooner&#xD;
      after surgery. Though each ERP element is independently simple, implementation of the&#xD;
      combined elements likely will require substantial redesign of the systems and processes of&#xD;
      care to assure a high level of coordination among surgery, anesthesia, and nursing&#xD;
      clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study involves multiple sites and uses a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized,&#xD;
      controlled study design of the ENRICH protocol in pediatric patients undergoing elective GI&#xD;
      surgery. The cluster-randomized trial design is ideally suited for pragmatic intervention&#xD;
      implementation. A hybrid, type 2 study design will be used with equal focus on evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness and the implementation. The study will optimize implementation using the&#xD;
      National Implementation Research Network's five Active Implementation Frameworks (AIFs),&#xD;
      which identify competency, organization, and leadership as drivers of implementation and&#xD;
      empower team collaboration and facilitate rapid-cycle evaluation. The five AIFs used as key&#xD;
      tools to achieve high-fidelity and sustainable implementation will include&#xD;
      patient-stakeholder input in all steps of the improvement process and a Learning&#xD;
      Collaborative (LC) with rapid-cycle data feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, by taking place in the setting where patients receive usual clinical care by usual&#xD;
      clinicians, using data primarily from existing data sources (e.g., EHR), having minimal&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, and recruiting all eligible pediatric patients undergoing GI surgery&#xD;
      delivery, fulfills most of the pragmatic qualities to understand the real-world performance&#xD;
      and implications of the intervention. The nature of this trial does not allow for subjects&#xD;
      (patients or clinicians) to be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll patients at 18 US hospitals (&quot;sites&quot;) that participate in the Pediatric&#xD;
      Surgery Research Collaborative (PedSRC), a cooperative group of pediatric surgeons and&#xD;
      researchers committed to performing clinical research in pediatric surgery. All sites offer&#xD;
      comprehensive, inpatient, pediatric services, including surgical services. The PedSRC&#xD;
      represents one of the largest pediatric surgical networks for collaboration and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 18 sites will be randomly assigned to one of three clusters for the stepped wedge design&#xD;
      with each cluster, in turn, being randomly assigned to an intervention start period. Given&#xD;
      that many sites have already initiated some ERP elements, a study design that randomizes&#xD;
      sites or patients to a control arm without any ERP elements is not feasible. The&#xD;
      stepped-wedge design was selected, in part, to ease the practical challenges of concurrently&#xD;
      coordinating training and data collection across the 18 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ENRICH-US study provides a unique opportunity to accelerate, yet evaluate the adoption of&#xD;
      ERP elements for pediatric GI patients, thus improving surgical care for this high-risk&#xD;
      population by rapidly incorporating ERPs into practice, using the five AIFs. This study will&#xD;
      serve as a model for future pediatric surgical quality improvement implementation efforts.&#xD;

In addition to the peer-reviewed publication of study results and the dissemination of findings through publicly available websites, blogs, and newsletters, the PI and Biostatistics Director will create a patient-deidentified data set that will be made publicly available to researchers. We have included a request for funds to curate this dataset for public use. It will include clinical data and outcomes collected through REDCap for the complete ENRICH-US study, as well as, raw data for the PedsQL health-related quality of life surveys. All data will be fully de-identified. A copy of the study protocol, data definition dictionary, and public use file with instructions will also be generated for ease of use.
