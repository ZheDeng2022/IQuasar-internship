  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Delirium is a common acute confusion state in patients in intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICUs). It has been linked to poor clinical prognoses (e.g., prolonged ICU stay) in critical&#xD;
      patients. Furthermore, it might connect with long-term cognitive dysfunction. Mostly,&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments have been frequently prescribed for preventing ICU delirium;&#xD;
      however, their side effects might subsequently increase the risks of ICU delirium. Therefore,&#xD;
      developing an effective non-pharmacological intervention of preventing delirium among&#xD;
      critically mechanical ventilated patients is of clinical relevance. Purposes: To examine the&#xD;
      effects of music intervention on reducing delirium in mechanically ventilated critical&#xD;
      patients, to determine its beneficial effects on delirium-related outcomes, including&#xD;
      sedation dosage and time, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the length of ICU stay,&#xD;
      and to compare the change of heart rate variability, electroencephalography and serum&#xD;
      biomarkers after music therapy between groups.&#xD;

      Delirium is a common acute confusion state among critical patients in intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICUs). The symptoms are serious disturbance in mental abilities which may cause inattention,&#xD;
      confused thinking, agitated mood, and fluctuated consciousness. Delirium also lead to higher&#xD;
      mortality, longer hospital stay, higher cost of healthcare and poor recovery. However, the&#xD;
      mechanism of delirium still not fully understand. Imbalanced neurotransmitters may be one of&#xD;
      the possible explain for such situation. It is related to increased level of dopamine and&#xD;
      acetylcholine deficiency. In addition, the relation between low level of melatonin and&#xD;
      postoperative delirium was also reported. Glucocorticoid which represent the stress response&#xD;
      is also related to postoperative delirium. Both changes of neurotransmitters and hormone&#xD;
      levels would affect sleep-awake cycle. It is observed that patients who is delirium show a&#xD;
      relative higher EEG theta power and a reduced alpha power than non-delirious patients.&#xD;
      Several modifiable risk factors, such as noise, light, physical restrain, pain, anxiety, and&#xD;
      sedatives, may contribute to poor sleep quality or sleep disruption and further delirium&#xD;
      occurrence. Effectiveness interventions are extremely important when patients are inevitably&#xD;
      exposed to such risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological interventions are rapid and effective way for delirium management. However,&#xD;
      the concern about side effect and increased mortality among high risk patients are needed.&#xD;
      According to 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain,&#xD;
      Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU,&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention was suggested for delirium management firstly.&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological interventions, such as using earplug or eye mask at night, music therapy&#xD;
      or early mobilization, should be safe, less side effect and widely applicable for first-line&#xD;
      healthcare providers. In addition, multicomponent interventions should be more effective than&#xD;
      single component intervention. However, the evidence of direct comparison is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music intervention is a non-invasive, low-cost and non-pharmacological intervention. Several&#xD;
      clinical trials were proved that music therapy could reduce the pain and anxiety among&#xD;
      postoperative and old age population for better clinical progress. Listening to soft music&#xD;
      can enhance brain alpha wave, and there is a negative correlation between alpha wave of EEG&#xD;
      and sympathetic excitation. The preference of music also influences power of alpha wave.&#xD;
      Recent studies report that implying music intervention on postoperative patients could lead&#xD;
      to fewer acute confusion status, however, the incidence and potential exposed risk factors of&#xD;
      delirium between medical and surgical populations were different. The effect of music&#xD;
      intervention on medical critical patients and the related mechanism still need further&#xD;
      investigation. In addition, whether the multicomponent intervention could obtain greater&#xD;
      effect than single component intervention still not ascertained. Furthermore, the evidences&#xD;
      of music intervention in decreasing the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU&#xD;
      stay, sedation time and mortality were still lacking. The mechanism between music&#xD;
      intervention and delirium occurrence also need to further investigate.&#xD;
