  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central aim of this study is to characterize how the costs of acute and lifetime stress&#xD;
      affect the neural architecture for decision-making in healthy humans. Investigators will use&#xD;
      behavioral choice paradigms to measure how the costs of stress influence decisions about&#xD;
      rewards (e.g., foods, money) as well as decisions about the use of self-control strategies.&#xD;
      They will further examine associations between these stress measures and other decision&#xD;
      variables commonly studied in our lab which have well-understood mechanisms, such as risk&#xD;
      preferences. This behavioral work lays the foundation for an fMRI experiment that combines&#xD;
      our measures of the behavioral costs of stress with neural measures of brain changes. Acute&#xD;
      stress will be measured using a physiological stressor (cold-pressor task) coupled with&#xD;
      saliva sample collection for cortisol analysis. Lifetime stress will be measured using a&#xD;
      computerized life stress survey. We will study three cohorts: One purely behavioral cohort&#xD;
      will be examined on-site (n=60). In a smaller subset of participants (n=40), investigators&#xD;
      will measure neural activity changes in relevant brain areas as measured with MRI during&#xD;
      decisions to use self-control in the presence of rewards. In a larger sample (n=500) the&#xD;
      correlation between participants' risk preferences and lifetime stress exposure at scale&#xD;
      using Amazon Mechanical Turk subjects will be measured.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English as a native language&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected-to-normal vision&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals on diets to maintain or lose weight, or those not on a diet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All races, ethnicities, and cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For all fMRI studies we will exclude participants who meet one of the standard CBI MRI&#xD;
             exclusion criteria (see attached exclusion questionnaire) prior to participation. This&#xD;
             screening questionnaire will be administered prior to scheduling the study, and once&#xD;
             again before the scanner session during the second consenting procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of and/or medication for neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High blood pressure, heart condition or related medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes, metabolic disorders, history of eating disorders, or food allergies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Handedness (this has been shown be indicative of variations in brain circuitry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since we will measure stress hormones, subjects currently taking corticosteroids or&#xD;
             beta-blockers will be ineligible to participate, as these medications have been found&#xD;
             to dramatically alter stress hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Furthermore, evidence suggests that fluctuations in bodily hormones (such as that&#xD;
             induced through hormonal contraceptives or different stages of menstrual cycle phase)&#xD;
             can affect stress hormone levels (Tersman, Collins, &amp; Eneroth, 1991; Kirschbaum et al,&#xD;
             1999; Andreano, Arjomanid, Cahill, 2008). In order to account for hormonal&#xD;
             differences, we will ask female participants if they are taking oral contraceptives.&#xD;
             Likewise, we propose to use a simple, non-invasive questionnaire to determine cycle&#xD;
             phase, as in McCormick &amp; Teillon, 2001. We may need to exclude on the basis of whether&#xD;
             or not female participants use hormone-based contraceptives, which, for the reason&#xD;
             stated above, could be a potential confound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In some cases, we will pre-screen subjects to ensure they are on a diet to maintain or&#xD;
             lose weight in order to examine how dietary and health goals influence decisions about&#xD;
             self-control and rewards.&#xD;
