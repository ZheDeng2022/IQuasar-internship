  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Equal access to evidence based rehabilitation in the stroke population is a challenge. Home&#xD;
      based solutions including telerehabilitation is a promising strategy to meet these needs.&#xD;
      However, the tools must be customized for persons with stroke and the technologies developed&#xD;
      to serve rehabilitation purposes. The DISKO-tool was developed to enable efficient,&#xD;
      continuous training in the home setting with health professional follow ups of training and&#xD;
      training results after stroke via video link. The tool has in a preliminary study proved&#xD;
      feasible and safe in different phases after stroke. The functional effect of using the&#xD;
      DISKO-tool added to conventional rehabilitation in the home setting is yet to be explored.&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the added value of using the DISKO-tool during&#xD;
      rehabilitation in the home setting.&#xD;

      Aim:The DISKO-tool was developed to enable efficient, continuous training in the home setting&#xD;
      with health professional follow ups of training and training results after stroke via video&#xD;
      link. The tool has in a preliminary study proved feasible and safe in different phases after&#xD;
      stroke. The functional effect of using the DISKO-tool added to conventional rehabilitation in&#xD;
      the home setting is yet to be explored. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the added&#xD;
      value of using the DISKO-tool during rehabilitation in the home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested: Participants who perform 6 weeks of intensive training supported by&#xD;
      the DISKO-tool in addition to the regular stroke rehabilitation interventions, gain a higher&#xD;
      level of functioning compared to the control group with regular rehabilitation interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized controlled intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and methods: 100 participants will be included in the study 3-6 months after&#xD;
      stroke and after informed consent. The participants are recruited from primary care i.e.&#xD;
      neuroteam and out-patient rehabilitation in Stockholm, Sweden. The included patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either 1) the intervention group (n=50) or 2) the control group (n=50). Based&#xD;
      on previously published results on the BESTtest [14], a significance level of 5% and a power&#xD;
      of 80%, 41 patients/treatment arm need to be included. With an expected minimal loss of&#xD;
      participants per treatment arm, the study will require 50 patients/treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline assessment, the patients will receive a first introduction to the&#xD;
      DISKO-tool. Thereafter the DISKO-tool system is set up at the patients' home by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist. For safety reasons, space requirements and convenience of the patients, the&#xD;
      physiotherapist in dialogue with the patients will select the placement of the screen. During&#xD;
      the home visit, the patients will receive a manual and are instructed and guided in how to&#xD;
      use the DISKO-tool including turning on the screen, controlling the user interface and&#xD;
      performing test exercises. Dates and times for follow-ups by video communication with the&#xD;
      physiotherapist are scheduled. After the installation, the physiotherapist will design an&#xD;
      individualized training program for each of the patients. The training program will be based&#xD;
      on the initial assessments of functioning and disability and the patients' performance of the&#xD;
      test exercises. Type and number of exercises per session, level of difficulty and number of&#xD;
      repetitions (including proportion of repetitions to the right and left side of the body) will&#xD;
      be set. The set training program is thereafter introduced and evaluated during the first&#xD;
      follow-up by video communication with the patients. In both groups, patients are instructed&#xD;
      to train self-sufficiently 5 days a week and will be supervised by the treating&#xD;
      physiotherapist. The intervention will last for 6 weeks. The baseline and final testing will&#xD;
      both be performed at the rehabilitation clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-ups, by video communication, will be registered by the physiotherapists in&#xD;
      standardised logbooks. Data on conventional interventions will be retrieved from medical&#xD;
      records. From the DISKO-tool, data regarding number of performed self-training sessions will&#xD;
      be retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, the physiotherapist's (also after informed consent) and patient's&#xD;
      experience and perception of using the DISKO-tool will be assessed in a study specific&#xD;
      questionnaire based on the results of the semi-structured interviews performed in the&#xD;
      feasibility study that preceded this study.&#xD;
