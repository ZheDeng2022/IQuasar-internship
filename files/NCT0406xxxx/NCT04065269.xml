      ATARI trial tests the ATR inhibitor drug AZD6738 and a PARP inhibitor drug olaparib in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed gynecological cancers to assess the response in groups of patients&#xD;
      selected based on their cancer cell subtype and the presence of an abnormality in ARID1A&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ATARI is a multi-centre, open-label, multiple two-stage parallel cohorts phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial for patients with relapsed gynaecological cancers, with ARID1A-deficient ('loss') and&#xD;
      &quot;no loss.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial tests the ATR inhibitor drug AZD6738 and a PARP inhibitor drug olaparib to assess&#xD;
      the response in groups of patients selected based on their cancer cell subtype and the&#xD;
      presence of an abnormality in ARID1A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment groups are: 1A - Women with clear cell subtype with (ovarian/uterus) ARID1A&#xD;
      loss treated with AZD6738. 1B - Women with clear cell subtype with (ovarian/uterus) ARID1A&#xD;
      loss treated with AZD6738 + olaparib. 2 - Women with clear cell subtype (ovarian/uterus) with&#xD;
      no ARID1A loss treated with AZD6738 and olaparib. 3 - Women with other rare gynaecological&#xD;
      cancers (carcinosarcoma, cervical, endometrioid type) irrespective of ARID1A loss treated&#xD;
      with AZD6738 and olaparib.&#xD;

             following histological subtypes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ovarian and endometrial clear cell (&gt;50% clear cell carcinoma with no serous&#xD;
                  differentiation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Endometrioid&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cervical - adenocarcinomas and squamous&#xD;

                  only will not be eligible for entry into the study unless a biopsy confirming&#xD;
                  above histology is performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histological tissue specimen (tissue block or 8-10 unstained slides) must be available&#xD;
             (specimen can be the sample at diagnosis or taken at relapse). Otherwise, a biopsy&#xD;
             must be carried out to obtain sufficient tissue for histological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of radiological disease progression since last systemic anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             and prior to trial entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have progressed after â‰¥1 prior platinum containing regimen.&#xD;
             Platinum-based therapy does not need to be the last treatment prior to study entry.&#xD;
             For patients who have disease progression within 6 months of last dose of a&#xD;
