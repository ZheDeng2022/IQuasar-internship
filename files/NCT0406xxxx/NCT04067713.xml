  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is looking into plasma tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (ptDNA), a substance&#xD;
      that is shed by cancer cells and can be detected in blood samples. Analysing ptDNA may&#xD;
      therefore be able to provide more information about the characteristics of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve taking additional blood samples during standard treatment. The&#xD;
      samples will be analysed in laboratories for levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA); which&#xD;
      gives information on the activity of the cancer; ptDNA; circulating tumour cells (ones that&#xD;
      are derived from the cancer) (CTCs) and cells that affect immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PARADIGM study is not, therefore, testing a new drug. Instead, the study is investigating&#xD;
      if a new blood test can provide information about which current treatments for prostate&#xD;
      cancer will work best for future patients with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the future and PARADIGM's ultimate aim is to identify which of the current treatment&#xD;
      options will work best for patients. The research may also identify new opportunities for the&#xD;
      development of drugs potentially useful in treating prostate cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and with about 1 in 8 men&#xD;
      diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. Up to a third of prostate cancer deaths&#xD;
      occur when cancer spreads to other parts of the body known as metastatic prostate cancer,&#xD;
      which is a major healthcare burden. Currently, physicians use a maximum of six cycles of&#xD;
      Docetaxel and continue Abiraterone until disease progression with long term androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no early test to indicate if treatment is working for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Currently Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is not sensitive enough to guide&#xD;
      treatment alone. Studies in colorectal, lung and prostate cancers have started looking at&#xD;
      substance called Plasma tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (ptDNA) and correlated presence of ptDNA&#xD;
      will early relapse. Therefore, this study will investigate if the detection of ptDNA after&#xD;
      initiating treatment is associated a worse clinical outcome. Our ultimate aim, is to identify&#xD;
      which of the current treatment options will work best for patients in the future. This&#xD;
      research may also identify new targets for the development of new drugs to test in clinical&#xD;
      trials in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will include blood taken before and during treatment and at cancer progression.&#xD;
      In selected centres, an optional Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WBMRI) will be&#xD;
      performed before and during treatment for those patients who are eligible. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed up for a maximum of 5 years at the time they register onto the study. We expect&#xD;
      recruitment duration to be 18 months.&#xD;

        Newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer patients starting long term therapy with either&#xD;
        abiraterone (PARADIGM A) or Docetaxel (PARADIGM D) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        This is a UK based trial recruiting from approximately 10 sites over 18 months with a&#xD;
        maximum follow up for 5 years.Patients will be screened at Multi disciplinary teams, and&#xD;
        patient clinic appointments and those who fulfill eligibility criteria will be offered to&#xD;
        take part. They will be given the patient information sheet (PIS) to take away and read and&#xD;
        discuss with family and friends. They will be given the opportunity to ask questions before&#xD;
        they consent. If the patient wishes, consent can happen on the same day as the PIS was&#xD;
        given.&#xD;
