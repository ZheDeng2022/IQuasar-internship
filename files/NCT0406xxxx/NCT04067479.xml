      Tendon pain is a common complaint in older adults. The mechanisms contributing to the large&#xD;
      number of tendon problems in older adults are not known. It has been shown that tendon&#xD;
      cross-sectional area (CSA) is reduced with aging concurrent with a significant loss of tendon&#xD;
      collagen. Exercise is used to reverse the loss of muscle mass with aging but surprisingly&#xD;
      exercise interventions designed to reduce tendon problems in older people are relatively&#xD;
      unexplored. In young adults, exercise stimulates tendon collagen synthesis and enhances the&#xD;
      production of growth factors, which stimulate tendon collagen production. It is presumed that&#xD;
      exercise-induced increase in collagen synthesis contributes to the increase in tendon&#xD;
      stiffness and CSA noted in young adults after chronic resistance exercise (RE). In contrast,&#xD;
      our preliminary work indicates that RE is not effective at reducing the effects of aging on&#xD;
      tendon. The investigators have demonstrated that 12-weeks of RE does not lead to increases in&#xD;
      tendon CSA or stiffness, even when skeletal muscle mass and strength are greatly enhanced. To&#xD;
      prevent tendon injury, greater tendon CSA and stiffness aid in withstanding the force&#xD;
      generated by trained skeletal muscle. Greater CSA and stiffness also optimize force transfer&#xD;
      through tendon to maximize musculoskeletal function. Our findings indicate that RE is not an&#xD;
      optimal intervention for reversing age-related changes in tendon properties. Novel&#xD;
      interventions are clearly needed that will enhance collagen synthesis leading to an increase&#xD;
      in tendon stiffness and CSA while also improving skeletal muscle mass and strength in older&#xD;
      individuals. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of various methods for stimulating&#xD;
      tendon collagen synthesis during a bout of acute exercise. Specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      propose two approaches to this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An acute bout of cycling exercise will enhance the release of growth factors leading to&#xD;
           a larger increase in tendon collagen synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A bolus of amino acids given orally will increase the release of key stimulators of&#xD;
           tendon collagen synthesis leading to enhanced collagen synthesis after acute exercise.&#xD;
