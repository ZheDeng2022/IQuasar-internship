  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past few decades, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have rapidly&#xD;
      developed as effective, and probably the most cost-effective tools to connect most aspects of&#xD;
      family lives. Alongside the growth in popularity of ICTs and its role in promoting family&#xD;
      well-being, there is also an increasing appreciation that ICTs such as internet-enabled&#xD;
      devices and web-based applications can offer many advantages compared to traditional&#xD;
      face-to-face approaches when delivering behaviour change programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain more understanding of the potential new avenues of using ICT in programme&#xD;
      implementation, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has initiated the Jockey Club SMART&#xD;
      Family-Link Project in collaboration with The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and&#xD;
      non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This project aimed at helping 26 NGO-operated&#xD;
      Integrated Family Service Centres and Integrated Service Centres (Centres), making effective&#xD;
      use of information and communications technology (ICT) and data analytics, to enhance the&#xD;
      quality and efficiency of their family service. The present study aims to supplement the&#xD;
      existing services and interventions delivered by the FRU, FSU and FCU, a series of brief&#xD;
      ICT-based family interventions that promote family communication, cohesion, support and&#xD;
      well-being and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ICT-based interventions.&#xD;

      Information and communications technology (ICT) as a global trend The last few decades have&#xD;
      seen a dramatic rise in the use of information and communications technology (ICT) and&#xD;
      Internet access. According to the World Bank, 1.33 per cent of individuals in the world were&#xD;
      using the Internet in 1996; in 2006, this figure rose to 17.58 %; by 2016, 45.91 % of&#xD;
      individuals were using the Internet. Concurrently, there has been a dramatic rise in the&#xD;
      number of mobile cellular subscriptions across the globe in the last two decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the global trend, Hong Kong had 18.25 million mobile service subscribers in&#xD;
      2016. The Hong Kong Family and Health Information Trends Survey (FHinTs) under the Jockey&#xD;
      Club FAMILY Project was conducted to monitor opinions and behaviours regarding family health,&#xD;
      information use, and health communications. Our results showed that ICT platforms such as&#xD;
      online websites, social media, and instant messages are widely used in Hong Kong. In FHinTs&#xD;
      2016 survey, 82.6% of the respondents had smartphones, and 48.8% had tablets. Similar&#xD;
      findings from the Nielsen Media Index 2017 year-end report showed that 97% of all internet&#xD;
      users in Hong Kong were using smartphones to access the internet. The amount of time spent&#xD;
      online each day was 3.2 hours and 94% of people aged 12 to 64 were using the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of ICT in enhancing family well-being in Hong Kong With the increasing use of ICT,&#xD;
      family information can be easily accessed. According to the findings from FHinTs 2016, ICT&#xD;
      was increasingly used as a method of family information seeking: 66.7% of respondents sought&#xD;
      family information from online websites, compared with 53.6% in 2009. About 30.9% sought&#xD;
      family information from social media such as Facebook, and 22.8% sought family information&#xD;
      from instant messaging platforms such as WhatApp. Family information such as recreation&#xD;
      (46.6%), family heath (22.9%) and elderly-related topics (17.9%) were most commonly sought.&#xD;
      Also, family information seeking was associated with higher levels of family health,&#xD;
      happiness, harmony, and overall family well-being. The associations were observed regardless&#xD;
      of the type of sharing methods, such as face-to-face sharing or sharing via ICT means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICT in family interventions Alongside the growth in popularity of ICTs and its role in&#xD;
      promoting family well-being, there is also a growing appreciation that ICTs such as&#xD;
      internet-enabled devices and web-based applications can offer many advantages compared to&#xD;
      traditional face-to-face approaches when delivering behaviour change programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the biggest challenges of face-to-face programmes is diminishing reach and impact due&#xD;
      to barriers to accessibility, cost-efficiency, flexibility to adapt to individuals, and&#xD;
      structured intervention integrity . Using ICTs can address these barriers and may thus&#xD;
      contribute to improving reach. ICT also helps facilitate access to interventions from a large&#xD;
      variety of settings at all times, bringing the intervention to participants at times&#xD;
      convenient to them and diminishing the influence of the situational constraints on&#xD;
      intervention participation rates. The rise of ICT has created promising and potential new&#xD;
      avenues and demand for implementing interventions related to mental health and parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family services in Hong Kong In light of the review on family services in Hong Kong in 2000,&#xD;
      pilot projects on the Integrated Family Service Centre (IFSC) service mode were conducted in&#xD;
      2002. Having received positive feedback from the community on the pilot projects, 61 IFSCs&#xD;
      were established in 2004 to provide public-funded family services in Hong Kong. These IFSCs&#xD;
      comprise three important components, including the family resource unit (FRU), family support&#xD;
      unit (FSU), and family counselling unit (FCU) to provide preventive, supportive, and remedial&#xD;
      services respectively. They are operated by the Social Welfare Department and subvented&#xD;
      non-governmental organizations to support and strengthen individuals and families,&#xD;
      particularly single parents, new arrivals, ethnic minorities, and deprived families receiving&#xD;
      Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Society is always changing, and so do the community and families. In order to meet the&#xD;
      changing needs of the community and families, a Review on the Implementation of the IFSC&#xD;
      service mode was carried out in 2008 and completed in 2010 to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the IFSC service mode. The Review report &quot;Building Effective Family Services: Review on the&#xD;
      Implementation of the IFSC Service Mode&quot; stated that the IFSC service mode is an appropriate&#xD;
      service mode for public-funded family services in Hong Kong. However, the Review also&#xD;
      identified factors hindering the delivery of IFSC services. These hindering factors are&#xD;
      namely poor accessibility of some IFSCs, heavy workload, and stigmatization. With the use of&#xD;
      ICT, these hindering factors can be overcome, thus improving the IFSC service mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project Family well-being is the cornerstone of a harmonious&#xD;
      society, and early support for families in need will avert crisis. The Hong Kong Jockey Club&#xD;
      Charities Trust has funded to a four-year (2018-2021) &quot;Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project&quot;&#xD;
      to advance the use of Information and Communications Technology (&quot;ICT&quot;) in family services.&#xD;
      Interventions leveraging ICT (i-Action) is one of the project components, which leverage ICT&#xD;
      to help social workers offer ICT-based interventions in their work to add on their&#xD;
      face-to-face interventions. ICT tools and mobile apps will be designed and interactive games&#xD;
      will be provided to engage children and young family service users through e-platforms.&#xD;
      Social workers will also be able to connect with service users between face-to-face sessions&#xD;
      using these e-platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of this study The present study aims to supplement the existing services and&#xD;
      interventions delivered by the FRU, FSU and FCU, a series of brief ICT-based family&#xD;
      interventions that promote family communication, cohesion, support and well-being and improve&#xD;
      the efficiency and effectiveness of ICT-based interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is to seek approval from Institutional Review Board (IRB) to collect data from&#xD;
      the participants in the family services for in-depth analysis, and to write up scientific&#xD;
      papers based on the findings generated from this project.&#xD;
