  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to correct an important systemic deficit in the care of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD), VHA's fourth most common healthcare condition with high mortality and&#xD;
      healthcare burden. Currently, many Veterans with CKD have poor awareness of their condition.&#xD;
      This leads to suboptimal care. The investigators anticipate that the proposed comprehensive&#xD;
      pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) education (CPE) will enhance Veterans' CKD knowledge and&#xD;
      their confidence in making an informed selection of an appropriate dialysis modality, and&#xD;
      lead to an increase in the use of home dialysis (HoD) - an evidence-based, yet underutilized&#xD;
      dialysis modality. Further, this study will allow us to examine whether such Veteran-informed&#xD;
      dialysis choice can improve Veteran and health services outcomes. If successful, this study&#xD;
      may deliver a ready to roll-out strategy to meet the CKD care needs of the Veterans and&#xD;
      reduce VHA healthcare costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 4th most common diagnosis among Veterans. Each year, over&#xD;
      13,000 Veterans transition from CKD to end stage renal disease (ESRD), a disease with high&#xD;
      mortality and poor health related quality of life (HRQoL). Over 52,000 Veterans with ESRD are&#xD;
      currently on dialysis and CKD/ESRD care costs VA over $18 billion per year. The majority of&#xD;
      Veterans progressing from CKD to ESRD have limited to no awareness of CKD and its treatment&#xD;
      options. This hinders Veterans' informed dialysis selection resulting in a gross underuse&#xD;
      (7%) of home dialysis (HoD). As there are no significant differences in mortality among&#xD;
      different dialysis modalities, VHA National Kidney Program and professional renal societies&#xD;
      advocate informed dialysis selection and greater use of HoD to facilitate improvements in&#xD;
      Veterans' post-ESRD clinical and health services utilization outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports from Europe and Canada show that providing comprehensive pre-ESRD patient education&#xD;
      (CPE) improves the quality of CKD care and empowers patients to make informed dialysis&#xD;
      modality selection. Data further show that informed modality selection substantially corrects&#xD;
      the underuse of HoD as desired by the healthcare systems, including VHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, across VHA, many Veterans with CKD are identified too late to benefit from CPE; and&#xD;
      even for those identified and under renal care, the availability of CPE is limited. This&#xD;
      results in suboptimal pre-ESRD care and preparation, and continued low HoD utilization. Thus,&#xD;
      there is an urgent systemic need to provide CPE to all pre-ESRD (stage 4 and 5 CKD) Veterans&#xD;
      and study its effectiveness prospectively within the VHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the impact of the comprehensive pre-ESRD patient education on&#xD;
      high-impact outcomes for Veterans and health services, across a local Veterans Healthcare&#xD;
      System (VHS). The investigators will compare the impact of CPE (intervention), delivered&#xD;
      either in-person or through telemedicine, with the usual care (control) enhanced by the&#xD;
      provision of the self-learning CKD information among Veterans with advanced CKD across the&#xD;
      North Florida/South Georgia VHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study has four aims, consisting of one primary outcome (HoD use) and&#xD;
      multiple secondary outcomes, to help us understand the impact of CPE on patients' informed&#xD;
      decision making and on important post-ESRD clinical, patient-reported, and health services&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare the impact of CPE on Veterans' knowledge of CKD, their confidence in dialysis&#xD;
      decision making, and their selection of dialysis modality, between the CPE and usual care&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1.1: CPE will improve Veterans' knowledge of CKD and its management. H1.2: CPE will improve&#xD;
      Veterans' confidence in making an informed selection of a dialysis modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1.3: CPE will increase Veterans' selection of HoD. Aim 2: Compare Veterans' actual use of&#xD;
      HoD (Primary Outcome) between the CPE and usual care groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2.1: Veterans in the CPE group will show increased HoD use. Aim 3: Examine Veterans'&#xD;
      perceived satisfaction with CPE, explore their preferences for F2F- or Tele-CPE, and&#xD;
      investigate barriers and facilitators in the selection and use of their preferred dialysis&#xD;
      modality. (Qualitative) Aim 4: Compare the following post-ESRD secondary outcomes between the&#xD;
      CPE and usual care groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcomes: 1) health-related quality of life and 2) satisfaction with&#xD;
      dialysis; clinical outcomes: 3) time to ESRD, 4) estimated glomerular filtration rate at&#xD;
      ESRD, 5) need for inpatient initiation of dialysis, and 6) vascular access status at ESRD;&#xD;
      and health services utilization outcomes: 7) number of inpatient stays, and 8) number of&#xD;
      outpatient visits, from enrollment to 90-day post ESRD period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: Veterans in the CPE group will show improvement in these secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study will help to achieve the long-term goal of better meeting the needs&#xD;
      of Veterans with advanced CKD by improving Veterans' knowledge of CKD and its management, and&#xD;
      promoting evidence-based Veteran-centered ESRD care.&#xD;
