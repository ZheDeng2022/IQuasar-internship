  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate a significant decrease in asynchrony with NIV-NAVA&#xD;
      using the Servo n ventilator (Getinge, Sweden), as compared to abdominal triggered (Graseby&#xD;
      capsule) synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (sNIPPV) using the&#xD;
      Infant Flow CPAP device (Care Fusion, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the data obtained can be used to develop a large-scale study aimed at reducing the&#xD;
      rate of re-intubation in the study population (pilot study). In fact, the re-intubation&#xD;
      criteria for extremely premature children are based on clinical criteria (desaturations,&#xD;
      apnea, signs of respiratory control) and paraclinical criteria (FiO2, Potential hydrogen&#xD;
      (pH), PCO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study will help to develop an adapted methodology and to calculate&#xD;
      a sample size to compare the 2 modes of NIV to the test on a clinical criterion: the rate of&#xD;
      re-intubation after extubation, which is classically high in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of non-invasive ventilation has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      premature newborns by reducing the pulmonary lesions caused by invasive ventilation.&#xD;
      Currently, variable flow continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, such as the&#xD;
      infant flow® driver, are considered more efficient than constant flow pressure sources. Nasal&#xD;
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation, as compared to CPAP, might reduce the extubation&#xD;
      failure rate, but has no impact on mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, data is&#xD;
      lacking on the interest of synchronization and on the effect of the different available&#xD;
      interfaces (prongs, masks, cannulas). In addition, the ventilatory characteristics (high&#xD;
      respiratory rate and low inspiratory effort) of the premature infant increase the risk of&#xD;
      asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator, which is a major cause of poor tolerance&#xD;
      for this type of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAVA (neurally adjusted ventilatory assist) is a recent ventilatory mode that offers&#xD;
      proportional assistance to respiratory work based on the measured electrical activity of the&#xD;
      diaphragm via oesophageal electrodes. It thus allows a regulation of inspiratory pressures&#xD;
      and time by the patient him/herself. The physiological effects of NAVA have been primarily&#xD;
      described in intubated neonates and studies have shown a significantly improved&#xD;
      synchronization and significantly decreased inspiratory pressures in patients ventilated with&#xD;
      NAVA compared to intermittent controlled ventilatory support. However, the currently&#xD;
      available evidence is limited and no beneficial effect on morbidity or mortality has been&#xD;
      identified so far .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies on noninvasive NAVA (NIV-NAVA) conducted exclusively in neonates, most&#xD;
      of which included a limited number of patients. Only one study to date compared NIV-NAVA to&#xD;
      another synchronized NIV mode (NIV pressure support) using the Servo-i ventilator. This&#xD;
      prospective crossover study found a significant decrease in peak inspiratory pressure (PIP),&#xD;
      FiO2, frequency and length of desaturations in the NIV-NAVA group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased asynchrony has been observed during NIV-NAVA as compared to pressure-support NIV In&#xD;
      adult patients and in 6 children hospitalized in the Pediatric ICU (median age 18 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In premature neonates, variable flow CPAP is preferentially used. Synchronized intermittent&#xD;
      positive pressure can be delivered using a variable flow device and a Graseby abdominal&#xD;
      capsule. Since variable flow CPAP is considered the most efficient pressure generator, it is&#xD;
      legitimate to compare synchronization performance of the variable flow synchronized nasal&#xD;
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation (sNIPPV) to NIV-NAVA. This comparison has never&#xD;
      been performed so far, to our knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that synchronization will be markedly improved with NIV-NAVA as compared to&#xD;
      sNIPPV.&#xD;
