      The purpose of the investigator's study is to assess the effect of a standardized prenatal&#xD;
      testing educational video on the use of prenatal genetic testing and decision-making.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized trial of video education on prenatal testing vs. usual care,&#xD;
      with the goal to assess women's prenatal testing choices, understanding of testing options&#xD;
      and decisional conflict and regret. Participants will be recruited from a convenience sample&#xD;
      of patients presenting for prenatal care at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While receiving prenatal care at NMCSD, all women are offered the option of screening for&#xD;
      aneuploidy (serum screen (with or without nuchal translucency ultrasound) or cell free DNA&#xD;
      testing) or diagnostic testing (chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis) or no testing in&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing consent, participants will be randomized to video education or usual care.&#xD;
      Randomization will be completed using a random number table. Women randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group (video education) will view the prenatal screening video made by the&#xD;
      Genetic Support Foundation and the Washington Department of Health, the 4.5 minute video &quot;How&#xD;
      to Decide About Prenatal Genetic Testing,&quot; available at:&#xD;
      https://www.geneticsupportfoundation.org/genetics-and-you/pregnancy-and-genetics/prenatal-gen&#xD;
      etic-testing-videos .7 They will then complete the study related surveys at their initial&#xD;
      obstetric visit. The educational video was created with input from clinicians including&#xD;
      licensed genetic counselors, obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine physicians, and patients.&#xD;
      Extensive testing and reviewing was completed to ensure adequate comprehension by a wide&#xD;
      range of audiences and minimize counseling bias. Women randomized to the control group will&#xD;
      receive routine prenatal care with no additional study intervention other than completion of&#xD;
      the study related surveys at baseline (initial prenatal testing). Current national guidelines&#xD;
      recommend offering all women prenatal diagnosis and prenatal screening at the beginning of&#xD;
      the pregnancy.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this study will be screening uptake rates, and will be based on&#xD;
      review of the patient's electronic medical record. Secondary outcomes will include invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic test rates, participant knowledge about testing (as assessed using the Maternal&#xD;
      Serum Screening Knowledge Questionnaire,2 and decisional conflict (as assessed by the&#xD;
      Decisional Conflict Scale) and decisional regret (as assessed by the Decision Regret Scale).&#xD;
      These assessments will be conducted at time of prenatal testing (&lt; 20 weeks). (Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study questionnaire will include a check box for participants to indicate if they would&#xD;
      be willing to participate in a follow on qualitative study to assess participant's personal&#xD;
      experience related to their method of education about prenatal testing. This component of the&#xD;
      study will aim to determine personal and social reasoning behind their decisions, and to&#xD;
      further explore their experience, beliefs and behaviors. Interested participants from each&#xD;
      group (both intervention and control) will be contacted to arrange a telephone or in person&#xD;
      interview. (Appendix C) Participants will be interviewed in person or over the phone.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed by the Decisional Conflict Scale. Questions are scored on a Likert scale of 1 to 5, with 1 equating to Strongly Agree and 5 equating to Strongly Disagree. Thus, lower scores indicate lower decisional conflict. Subscale Decisional Uncertainty score range 3 to 15. Subscale Percieved Effective Decision range 4 to 20.</description>
