      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Diabetes positive affect skills&#xD;
      intervention or a psychoeducation control group. Both programs last 8 weeks and take place on&#xD;
      a simplified research version of the Happify platform. Participants assigned to the diabetes&#xD;
      positive affect program will have full access to Happify, with a track that focuses on&#xD;
      building skills for greater happiness, reducing stress, and coping better with diabetes&#xD;
      displayed as the feature track. Participants assigned to the psychoeducation (control)&#xD;
      condition will be asked to complete a series of polls on various wellbeing topics, and then&#xD;
      provided with some social comparison data about how their responses compared with the&#xD;
      responses of other users, as well as information about why the well being topic is important.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires before, during, and after the 8-week&#xD;
      program as well as 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up questionnaires after the&#xD;
      program is complete, at which point study participation will end.&#xD;
