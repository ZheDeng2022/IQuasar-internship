  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thus far no large randomized trial has demonstrated a correlation between screening and&#xD;
      improved outcomes. This would need to be done to gain widespread acceptance of screening and&#xD;
      case finding programs. Early detection of cognitive impairment could potentially result in&#xD;
      the appropriate treatment of reversible cognitive impairment conditions or earlier initiation&#xD;
      of pharmacological interventions for the management of a variety of other dementia or Mild&#xD;
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conditions. A screening approach that reduces the number of false&#xD;
      positive screens would improve the comfort level of physicians and patients with cognitive&#xD;
      screening programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use the Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) and&#xD;
      the Electronic Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (eSAGE) to identify patients who&#xD;
      score in the cognitive impairment range during an office visit with their primary care&#xD;
      provider. Conversation with an individual who knows the patient well (if possible) will be&#xD;
      performed to ascertain a significant change in the patient's cognitive skills over the&#xD;
      previous year. The investigators wish to determine if screening for cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      this way leads to new diagnoses and management outcomes compared to a group of primary care&#xD;
      providers who use their current usual method in screening for cognitive impairment during&#xD;
      office visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center has over 100 primary care providers who see&#xD;
      patients at 14 offices in central Ohio. These providers routinely see geriatric patients and&#xD;
      routinely conduct Annual Wellness Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least two primary care offices will be involved in this trial. At least one location will&#xD;
      serve as the control office and will continue to conduct their visits including screening for&#xD;
      cognitive impairment as they normally do using their usual method based on the primary care&#xD;
      provider's normal practice. At least one different location will serve as the intervention&#xD;
      office where all the providers, as their standard of care, use a standardized method for&#xD;
      screening for cognitive impairment consisting of using the SAGE or eSAGE test and having a&#xD;
      conversation with an individual who knows the patient well (if possible) to ascertain if a&#xD;
      significant change (based on primary care provider opinion) occurred in the patient's&#xD;
      cognitive skills over the previous year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chart reviews will be conducted on all of the patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the trial using a 60 day window from the initial visit. The demographics,&#xD;
      medical history and list of current medications will be reviewed. SAGE or eSAGE test results&#xD;
      and the primary care provider's opinion of the informant information regarding the patient's&#xD;
      cognitive change over the previous year will be obtained. Additionally, the charts will be&#xD;
      reviewed for the number of referrals for further evaluation/management of potential cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (including lab work, neuroimaging, neuropsychology testing, neurology/psychiatry,&#xD;
      occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, counseling, respite care, legal&#xD;
      assistance (DPOA or living will), day care, home health, social work, financial planning, and&#xD;
      cognitive research), the initiation of pharmacological interventions for the management of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and the diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Charts will also be screened&#xD;
      to assess the number of follow up visits that were scheduled after the office visit for&#xD;
      follow up regarding cognitive issues. For the intervention office, chart reviews will be&#xD;
      conducted on patients who complete the SAGE or eSAGE and on patients who do not complete the&#xD;
      SAGE or eSAGE. Possible reasons for why patients would not complete the SAGE or eSAGE&#xD;
      include: time constraints, patient noncompliance and provider oversight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 control groups. Control group 1 consists of primary care offices that did not&#xD;
      use SAGE or eSAGE for any of their patients and Control group 2 consists of patients handled&#xD;
      by the intervention office who did not complete the SAGE or eSAGE. Intervention group&#xD;
      consists of patients handled by the intervention office who did complete the SAGE or eSAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAGE and eSAGE test scoring will be compared between the intervention office and the research&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the trial, the providers from the intervention group will be requested to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire to evaluate the practicality and ease of use of the SAGE and eSAGE&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) or Electronic Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (eSAGE): The Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) is a reliable and valid assessment that is used to detect MCI and early dementia. It is a pen and paper assessment that has 4 interchangeable versions. The digital version of SAGE (eSAGE; commercially known as BrainTest®) is made for tablet use, consists of the identical test questions as SAGE, and is strongly associated with the validated SAGE.&#xD;

      <time_frame>Adverse event collection was not applicable for this trial since it was a retrospective chart review study that compared standard of care practices. Although there was an intervention (SAGE or eSAGE) the intervention was a standard of care practice for one of the buildings. It was already in place by that office when we started our trial and was not implemented for the trial. We reviewed the charts retrospectively and compared standard of care practices.</time_frame>

          <title>Control Group 1</title>
          <description>At least one location will serve as the control office and will continue to conduct their visits including screening for cognitive impairment as they normally do using their usual method based on the primary care provider's normal practice.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Intervention Group</title>
          <description>At least one different location will serve as the intervention office where all the providers, as their standard of care, use a standardized method for screening for cognitive impairment consisting of using the SAGE or eSAGE test and having a conversation with an individual who knows the patient well (if possible) to ascertain if a significant change (based on primary care provider opinion) occurred in the patient's cognitive skills over the previous year.&#xD;
Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) or Electronic Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (eSAGE): The Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) is a reliable and valid assessment that is used to detect MCI and early dementia. It is a pen and paper assessment that has 4 interchangeable versions. The digital version of SAGE (eSAGE; commercially known as BrainTest®) is made for tablet use, consists of the identical test questions as SAGE, and is strongly associated with the validated SAGE.&#xD;
Informant Conversation: If possible, the provider will have a conversation with an individual who knows the patient will to ascertain if a significant change (based on primary care provider opinion) occurred in the patient's cognitive skills over the previous year.</description>
