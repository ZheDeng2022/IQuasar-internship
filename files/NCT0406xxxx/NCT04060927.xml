    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to to provide data and experience comparing two different&#xD;
      techniques of breath hold SBRT treatments. The first technique will include SGRT, but with&#xD;
      the assistance of implanted fiducials. Subjects will be treated with a breath hold technique&#xD;
      utilizing SGRT, but will also be imaged during treatment with fiducial match. The second&#xD;
      technique will utilize SGRT for breath hold treatments without the assistance of implanted&#xD;
      fiducials/continuous imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary objective is estimate the incidence of SBRT and fiducial-related&#xD;
      pulmonary toxicities for subjects treated with SBRT who have tumors that move ≥ 1 cm in 3&#xD;
      different cohorts: 1) free breathing with SGRT 2) breath hold utilizing SGRT only; 3) breath&#xD;
      hold utilizing SGRT in combination with implanted fiducials. Secondary objectives also&#xD;
      include Estimate reliability of gated SBRT treatments utilizing SGRT vs. SGRT with fiducials&#xD;
      estimating local control for SBRT in subjects treated in the three different cohorts,&#xD;
      estimating overall survival, and evaluating quality of life. A safety objective of estimating&#xD;
      acute and long-term grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicities attributed to SBRT/fiducial&#xD;
      implantation in subjects treated in the three different cohorts will also be explored.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent with HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 years at the time of consent. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of fiducials in combination with SBRT in subjects &lt;18&#xD;
             years of age, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stage IA-IIB (T1a-T3bN0) presumed non-small cell lung cancer, carcinoid tumors, or&#xD;
             lung metastasis that have ≥ 1 cm of respiratory associated motion measured on 4DCT at&#xD;
             time of simulation for SBRT with or without respiratory motion suppression techniques.&#xD;
             Histologic confirmation of malignancy is encouraged but not required. Primary or&#xD;
             metastatic tumor ≤ 7 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects may be receiving systemic chemotherapy or other systemic agents prior to&#xD;
             enrollment, but these agents must be stopped during SBRT treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to day 1 of treatment. NOTE: Females are considered of child&#xD;
             bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least&#xD;
             12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The effects of radiation on the developing human fetus are not well described. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and non-sterilized men who are sexually&#xD;
             active with a woman of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. FCBP must be willing to use a highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a failure rate of &lt;1% per year when&#xD;
             used consistently and correctly) from the time of informed consent until 5 days after&#xD;
             last dose of SBRT. Contraceptive methods with low user dependency are preferable but&#xD;
             not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. As determined by the enrolling physician, ability of the subject to understand and&#xD;
             comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior radiation to the chest that would overlap with the current radiation fields and&#xD;
             determined by the treating physician to impede the treatment of the study malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active ongoing pulmonary infection or pneumonitis that is requiring active treatment&#xD;
             with antibiotics or steroids. Prior pneumonitis from drug or other therapies that has&#xD;
             been treated within 15 days of first day of treatment.&#xD;
