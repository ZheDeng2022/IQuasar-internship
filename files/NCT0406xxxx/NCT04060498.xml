  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Practicing mindfulness is popular and well-accepted for its benefits in improving mental and&#xD;
      physical health. In particular, its benefits in promoting resilience to stress and well-being&#xD;
      have been shown in studies involving different psychiatric conditions, as well as preventing&#xD;
      relapse in patients with depressive disorders. However, its role in relapse prevention among&#xD;
      patients with psychosis has not been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a multi-site, single-blind, 12-month randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in Hong Kong to examine the effectiveness of mindfulness intervention in&#xD;
      prevention of relapse among 152 remitted psychosis patients.&#xD;

      Objectives and hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ To examine if mindfulness-based intervention can reduce rates of relapse at 1 year in&#xD;
           remitted patients with psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To test whether mindfulness-based intervention can reduce stress, depressive&#xD;
                symptoms, and improve functioning and quality of life at 1 year in remitted&#xD;
                patients with psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Patients will be recruited from the Early Assessment Service for Young people&#xD;
      with psychosis (EASY). This service provides specialized psychiatric care for the first three&#xD;
      years for young persons with first episode psychosis and covers the entire population of Hong&#xD;
      Kong of approximately seven million people. The sample will consist of 152 fully remitted&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or non-affective psychosis (schizophreniform disorder,&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder, brief psychotic disorder, or psychotic disorder not otherwise&#xD;
      specified)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a single-blind, 12-month, multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      of the effect of mindfulness intervention in preventing relapse in remitted psychosis.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into either having 7-week mindfulness-based intervention or&#xD;
      7-week psychoeducation groups. The study consists of the following time points: baseline&#xD;
      (before the start of intervention), at 7-week after the intervention, and then monthly for&#xD;
      the remaining 12 months following end of the intervention. Relapse will be assessed monthly&#xD;
      during the 1-year follow-up period. Patients will be terminated from the study if relapse&#xD;
      occurs during the follow up. The study will be carried out in accordance with Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice and with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study have sought for approval from the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Boards at each site. All participants will be required to provide&#xD;
      written informed consent. Patients will be individually randomized to one of the two parallel&#xD;
      groups: 7-week mindfulness intervention or 7-week psychoeducation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness intervention group All patients in the mindfulness group will receive EASY&#xD;
      service and 7 weekly-session mindfulness-based intervention for psychosis (MBI-p). It is a&#xD;
      protocol-based, low intensity mindfulness developed to help patients to achieve greater sense&#xD;
      of peace and calmness, and facilitate participants in handling everyday stress and conflicts.&#xD;
      MBI-p consists of seven 1.5-hour group sessions, and each group will have 2-6 participants.&#xD;
      Each MBI-p session has the following components: engagement and introduction, mindfulness&#xD;
      practices, daily life application and consolidation of learning. Facilitators in conducting&#xD;
      the MBI-p will be trained by experienced investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychoeducation group All patients in the psychoeducation group will receive EASY service and&#xD;
      7 weekly-session psychoeducation. Each psychoeducation will last for 1.5 hours, including&#xD;
      topics on the signs and symptoms of psychosis, aetiology of psychosis and medication usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments The primary outcome of relapse will be assessed using the Positive and Negative&#xD;
      Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale (Guy, 1976). Relapse&#xD;
      will be assessed before (baseline) and after intervention, and then monthly for 12 months.&#xD;
      When patients experience a psychotic relapse at any point during this 12-month period, their&#xD;
      participation will be terminated.&#xD;
