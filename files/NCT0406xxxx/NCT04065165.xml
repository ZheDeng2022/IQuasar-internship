  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase III clinical trial of Lanreotide combined with Telotristat ethyl&#xD;
      or placebo for the first-line treatment in patients with advanced well differentiated small&#xD;
      intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (siNET) with highly-functioning carcinoid syndrome to test&#xD;
      whether telotristat ethyl plus lanreotide is more effective than placebo plus lanreotide in&#xD;
      reducing the number of daily bowel movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study allows evaluation of the biochemical response (5-HIAA and&#xD;
      chromogranin-A), the reduction in the number of daily cutaneous flushing episodes, the&#xD;
      improvement in abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life, improvement in&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal and endocrine symptoms, changes in emotional functioning, the impact of&#xD;
      discontinuation of telotristat ethyl/placebo on HRQOL and symptoms, and the safety and&#xD;
      toxicity of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will enter into a screening/run-in period of 1 week to establish baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and symptomatology. The baseline assessment of daily bowel movement, as&#xD;
      assessed in an electronic diary, will be averaged over the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the screening/run-in period, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either the&#xD;
      control arm or the experimental arm for 12 months. Randomization will be stratified according&#xD;
      to the grade of tumour differentiation (grade 1 vs. grade 2) and by baseline number of bowel&#xD;
      movements per day (4-6 versus &gt;6). A total of 94 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to&#xD;
      either arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon randomization, all patients will enter the 12-month treatment period with lanreotide +&#xD;
      telotristat ethyl/placebo (blinded). In the experimental arm, patients will receive the deep&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of lanreotide (120 mg) every 28 days and 250 mg orally three times&#xD;
      daily (TID) of telotristat ethyl for 12 months. In the control arm, patients will receive the&#xD;
      deep subcutaneous injection of lanreotide every 28 days (120 mg) and placebo orally TID for&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of a minimum of 6 months on randomized blinded-treatment, the protocol&#xD;
      allows for patients on treatment with telotristat ethyl/placebo to be unblinded in the event&#xD;
      of &quot;lack of symptom control&quot;. Unblinding due to &quot;lack of symptom control&quot; can happen at any&#xD;
      time between 6 and 12 months of the blinded-treatment period. After unblinding, patient will&#xD;
      interrupt protocol treatment and will be further treated as per clinician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be unblinded after a maximum of 12 months on randomized blinded-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a follow-up of 12 months, patients will go off study except patients with carcinoid&#xD;
      heart disease. Patients off study will be further treated as per clinician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with carcinoid heart disease will continue open-label treatment on study (lanreotide&#xD;
      + telotristat ethyl or lanreotide alone according to what they were receiving at unblinding&#xD;
      at 12 months) for 4 additional years (open-label extension period). Patients with carcinoid&#xD;
      heart disease who discontinue protocol treatment before 12 months will also enter the&#xD;
      extension period for additional follow-up. Additional follow-up will last 4 years for these&#xD;
      patients and will include 6-monthly cardiological assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All efficacy analyses will be conducted in the Intention-to-treat population as primary&#xD;
      analyses i.e. all 94 randomized patients will be analyzed in the arm they were allocated by&#xD;
      randomization. Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population i.e. on all&#xD;
      patients who have received at least one dose of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational research projects include blood metabolite discovery and targeted assays to&#xD;
      find new biomarker candidates of response to Telotristat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human biological material that will be collected for translational research purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whole blood, plasma and serum at baseline, 4 hours after first dose, 4 weeks, 12 weeks&#xD;
           and at end of treatment visit with telotristat/placebo (due to end of study, disease&#xD;
           progression or lack of benefit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  archival tissue samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) will be retrieved for all&#xD;
           patients at study entry. In addition, one EDTA blood tube of whole blood (10 ml) at&#xD;
           baseline, 12 weeks and end of treatment (EOT visit) might be also collected for not yet&#xD;
           pre-defined and further translational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30)&#xD;
      version 3, together with the QLQ-GI.NET21 specific module designed for Neuroendocrine&#xD;
      Tumours. The computer-adaptive testing (CAT) diarrhea scale will also be used. The baseline&#xD;
      questionnaires must be completed during the screening period and before randomization.&#xD;
      Subsequent questionnaires are completed at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 52&#xD;
      weeks. Once a patient has stopped treatment, HRQoL data collection for that patient is&#xD;
      required 1 month (28-35 days) after protocol treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
