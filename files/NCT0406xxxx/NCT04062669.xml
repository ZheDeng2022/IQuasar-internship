  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first time-in-human (FTiH) study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity of different dose levels of an experimental rabies&#xD;
      glycoprotein G (RG) vaccine (RG-SAM [CNE] vaccine), made using a new technology, when&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (IM) on a 0, 2, 6 *-month schedule to healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * There will be no vaccinations with the third dose of any of the study treatments.&#xD;

    <masking_description>In Part 1 of the study, only data during the primary vaccination phase (from study start to Day 91) will be collected in an observer-blind manner. By observer-blind, it is meant that the vaccines recipient and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint will all be unaware of which vaccine was administered.&#xD;
For Part 1, the study will be observer-blind until Day 91. When the Day 91 analysis will result in unblinding of all the subjects to the sponsor. Therefore, the study cannot be considered observer-blind beyond Day 91 and will be conducted in a single-blind* manner thereafter; with all subjects remaining blinded up to study conclusion (Month 14).&#xD;
For Part 2, the study will be conducted in open-label manner from study start to study conclusion.&#xD;
*Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the study will be fully unblinded from study start to study conclusion to allow all subject treatments to be known to the team and investigators, thereby facilitating rapid safety assessment.</masking_description>
