    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study comparing two types of cementless femoral stems (LCU and&#xD;
      Corail) and two types of acetabular components (DeltaTT and Pinnacle Duofix) in primary total&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty. Primary outcome are component migration measured by RSA, wear and patient&#xD;
      reported outcome. Patients are evaluated up to 15 years postoperatively.&#xD;

      Material Patients The study will be conducted according to GCP, (Good Clinical Practice).&#xD;
      Potential clinical study participants will be identified from the THR waiting list of Umeå&#xD;
      University Hospital. The enrolment process will involve a review of the patient history from&#xD;
      the medical records in order to match available patient details with the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria (see below). Patients considered suitable for potential study enrolment will be&#xD;
      contacted by a member of the research team to ascertain their level of interest in&#xD;
      participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once verbal and written informed consent is provided a medical profile will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary or secondary osteoarthritis of the hip Male and non-pregnant female patients aged 18&#xD;
      to 70 years of age Type A or B femur Patients who understand the conditions of the study and&#xD;
      are willing to participate for the length of the prescribed follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria BMI under 18 and over 35 Inflammatory arthritis Osteoporosis Paget's&#xD;
      disease Grossly abnormal hip anatomy (severe dysplasia) Previous operations in the same hip&#xD;
      Presence of malignancy Patients who, as judged by the surgeon, are mentally incompetent or&#xD;
      are reasonable unlikely to be compliant with the requirements of the study Patient is female&#xD;
      of child-bearing age and not taking contraceptive precautions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants Control: Corail femoral stem and Pinnacle cup with Marathon XLPE neutral liner&#xD;
      (DePuy Orthopaedics), Bilolox delta ceramic femoral head 32 mm Study: LCU femoral stem&#xD;
      (Waldemar Link GmbH) and Delta TT cup with Neutral XLPE liner (Lima Corporate), Biolox delta&#xD;
      ceramic femoral head 32 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both designs a 28 mm femoral head will be used when cup size (&lt; 48 mm) precludes the use&#xD;
      of larger head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stems will be fitted with 2 tantalum markers by the surgeon at the operation. One&#xD;
      tantalum marker will be fixed in a small PEEK tower that will be screwed in at the shoulder&#xD;
      of the stem. Another tantalum marker will be cemented at the tip of the stem before&#xD;
      insertion. The PE liners will be fitted with tantalum beads by the surgeon at the time of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shell of the Delta TT cup will have 2 to 3 tantalum markers attached to its outer&#xD;
      surface. This process will be done by a subcontractor to the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Stratification for gender will be done. Within each stratum there will be block&#xD;
      randomization with 8 permutations in each block, each permutation will be either LCU+Delta&#xD;
      TT, LCU+Pinnacle, Corail+Delta TT, or Corail+Pinnacle. The randomization plan generator&#xD;
      available at www.randomization.com will be used to create the randomization which will then&#xD;
      be put in consecutively numbered sealed envelopes, one series for each stratum. The envelopes&#xD;
      will be located in a locked cabinet at the research nurse office. Due to logistic reasons it&#xD;
      will not be possible to open the sealed envelope at the time for surgery. Instead the surgeon&#xD;
      the day before surgery calls the research nurse who opens the envelope and assigns the&#xD;
      patient name to that randomization. This procedure will ensure that correct instrumentation&#xD;
      and implants will be available for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative technique All patients will be operated through a postero-lateral approach. The&#xD;
      height of the resection of the collum femoris is determined by preoperative templating. The&#xD;
      acetabulum is prepared by reaming in 2 mm increments until a good bone contact is&#xD;
      established. The press fit is tested with a trial cup. The recommendation is to use a cup the&#xD;
      same size as the last reamer, line-to-line. The aim is 35 to 45 degrees of abduction and&#xD;
      15-20 degrees of anteversion. Additional screws are only used if surgeon considers that&#xD;
      absolutely necessery. As standard a neutral liner is used routinely. If no sufficient&#xD;
      stability of the hip is established with the neutral liner, a 20° lipped liner is used as a&#xD;
      compromise solution. In case of acetabular fracture additional screws may be used but the&#xD;
      patient is then excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The femoral canal is opened with a box chisel and a straight rasp is used for identifying the&#xD;
      center of the femoral canal. Preparation is always started with the smallest broach. The size&#xD;
      of the broach is increased until rotational stability in the preoperatively planed height is&#xD;
      reached. A trial reduction, including testing of hip stability, is then performed. When&#xD;
      adequate leg length, offset and stability is reached the definitive stem is inserted. If a&#xD;
      femoral fracture occurs during operation a collared stem is used together with cerclage&#xD;
      wiring and the patient will be excluded from the study. The ceramic head is assembled on to&#xD;
      the properly cleaned taper with one firm blow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 Tantalum markers will be inserted into the bone of the pelvis around acetabulum and 9 in&#xD;
      the proximal femur using a special inserter. Tantalum markers will also be inserted into the&#xD;
      polyethylene liner and, in case of Delta TT cup, into the outer surface of the metal cup.&#xD;
      Finally 1 tantalum marker affixed to a purposely made PEEK tower will screwed onto the&#xD;
      shoulder of the femoral stem and 1 marker cemented onto the tip of the stem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra op measurements Clinical quality of cup and stem insertion (surgeon's judgement):&#xD;
      excellent, good, doubtful Degrees of femoral internal rotation at 90 degrees of hip flexion&#xD;
      at time for subluxation of femoral head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size of last cup and stem reamer/broach All implant parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSA Measurement of polyethylene wear, stem and cup migration and liner-shell fixation is&#xD;
      measured with RSA within one week postop, and thereafter at 1½ mo, 3 mo, 12 mo, 24 mo, 5y, 10&#xD;
      y, and 15 y postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSA has been used for implant research for over 30 years, with several hundreds of&#xD;
      publications, and is considered the golden standard for this type of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of operation tantalum spheres/markers (diameter 1 mm) are inserted into proximal&#xD;
      femur, periacetabular area and in the polyethylene liner in a standardized manner. The&#xD;
      femoral components will be equipped with 2 tantalum spheres in prefabricated cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional x rays AP pelvis and AP + lateral of affected hip will be obtained preop. (for&#xD;
      templating), within one week postop. (check and measurement of alignment) and at 12 mo, 24&#xD;
      mo, 5 y, 10 y and 15 y (for determination of osseointegration and osteolysis/stress&#xD;
      shielding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) CT of the pelvis around the cup will be performed 24 months and 5 or&#xD;
      10 years postoperatively to determine potential acetabular osteolysis / bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation Patient reported outcome measures: HOOS, Harris Hip Score, EQ5D, EQ5D&#xD;
      VAS, SF-36 and UCLA activity score will be obtained preoperatively, and at all postoperative&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological measurements Level of serum titanium will be measured preoperative, and at 12 mo,&#xD;
      24 mo, 5y, 10 y, and 15 y postoperative&#xD;
