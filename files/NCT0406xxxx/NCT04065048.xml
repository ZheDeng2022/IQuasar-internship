  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to compare the effectiveness of a soy-based diet or identical diet&#xD;
      without soy given to patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in remission, patients with active&#xD;
      CD, or healthy controls. The assigned diet will be compared to participant 'baseline'&#xD;
      (pre-diet) in terms of its ability to change the gut bacteria and fecal butyrate, an&#xD;
      important short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that limits bowel inflammation, a characteristic of&#xD;
      this debilitating disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subtype, Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and relapsing&#xD;
      inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the precise etiology of IBD is&#xD;
      not known, evidence suggests that environmental factors, including diet, contribute to its&#xD;
      pathogenesis. A soy-based diet has been demonstrated to have numerous health benefits. This&#xD;
      single-center open-label study will compare the effectiveness of a soy-based diet or an&#xD;
      identical diet without soy to change the gut microbiota composition and fecal butyrate&#xD;
      concentration to that of baseline (pre-diet) in patients with CD (remission or active&#xD;
      disease) and healthy control subjects without CD. Participants will follow either a soy-based&#xD;
      diet or an identical diet without soy to which they will be randomized for 7 days. No data&#xD;
      collection or other study procedures will take place until the potential participant provides&#xD;
      written informed consent to participate in the research study. The informed consent,&#xD;
      screening, enrollment, and baseline data collection which make up visit 1 can occur on the&#xD;
      same day or be completed across several days.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open label single center study to compare the effect of a soy-based diet or an identical diet without soy on the composition and metabolite production of gut bacteria in Crohn's disease (CD) patients in remission or active disease, and in healthy controls. Crohn's subjects will be pre-screened by the treating gastroenterologist for eligibility criteria during their normally scheduled appointment. The treating gastroenterologist will ask suitable patients whether they are interested in participating in the described dietary intervention study during the patient appointment. Initial verbal consent will be obtained by the treating gastroenterologist. Healthy controls will be recruited in the same manner, as well as via a hospital flyer advertisement. Subjects will then be contacted by the study investigator to schedule a screening visit (visit 1) and if study eligibility is confirmed, and informed consent provided, enrolled into the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary aim will focus on maintaining quiescent disease status, without worsening of any existing disease activity of the patient with Crohn's disease (CD) before/after diet intervention. This will be measured at the enrollment and end of study visits using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Fecal myleoperoxidase will also be assessed.</description>
