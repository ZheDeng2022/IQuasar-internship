  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as a non-progressive lesion of the developing foetal or infant&#xD;
      brain and causes variety of motor, sensory and cognitive impairments. Hemiplegic CP is the&#xD;
      most common type of CP in term infants, involving one half of the body. In these individuals,&#xD;
      muscle tone is reduced, and there is an inability to perform quality upper extremity&#xD;
      movements due to increased muscle tone, increased reflexes, weakness in antagonist muscles.&#xD;
      Due to spasticity upper extremity is present in shoulder adduction and internal rotation,&#xD;
      elbow flexion and pronation, wrist and fingers flexed and thumb in palm position. Spontaneous&#xD;
      movements of the upper extremity are decreased and abnormal. These individuals have a reduced&#xD;
      upper extremity function ranging from mild incompetence to almost no use of the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is designed to improve the function of the most&#xD;
      affected limb by restricting the use of the less affected limb in individuals with unilateral&#xD;
      upper extremity involvement and implementing an intensive motor learning-based training&#xD;
      program. In pediatric subjects, modified CIMT (mCIMT), which is called a 'child-friendly&#xD;
      technique', has been applied, which shows some differences from the form of CIMT in adults.&#xD;
      In mCIMT, the restriction time was reduced, activities with the child were performed within a&#xD;
      play frame, in the environment in which the child was accustomed, and restriction methods&#xD;
      such as gloves, splint, sling were used. In the literature CIMT has been used mainly in&#xD;
      children with hemiplegic CP in the pediatric population. However, there are many studies in&#xD;
      the literature evaluating the efficacy of mCIMT in individuals with hemiplegic CP and showing&#xD;
      beneficial effects on upper extremity speed and skills, and the duration of application&#xD;
      restriction varies considerably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the investigator's study was to determine the effect of consecutive or&#xD;
      intermittent implementation of mCIMT on upper extremity function in children with hemiplegic&#xD;
      CP. Thus, it will be determined whether the modification of the duration of administration in&#xD;
      the pediatric population varies in treatment results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      33 children with spastic hemiplegia age between 5-18 years will participate study. Children's&#xD;
      gross motor skills classified with Gross Motor Classification Sysytem (GMFCS) and hand&#xD;
      abilities classified with Manual Ability Classification System (MACS). The children divided&#xD;
      into 3 groups, consecutive mCIMT group, intermittent mCIMT group, and traditional&#xD;
      physiotherapy control group. The consecutive mCIMT group received mCIMT treatment for 10&#xD;
      consecutive days in addition to the conventional physiotherapy sessions. A sling used to&#xD;
      restrict the noninvolved upper extremity. The unaffected upper extremities of the children&#xD;
      restricted for 6 hours and activities performed by using shaping techniques under the&#xD;
      guidance of same therapist. Within the remaining period, the family implemented the&#xD;
      activities with his/her child that are determined by the therapist using the motor learning&#xD;
      principles, appropriate to the age of the child and that he / she likes to do. The&#xD;
      assessments performed for all three groups before, 10 days after and 5 weeks after treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Children's Hand-Use Experience Questionnaire (CHEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 days and at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing children's experience of using the affected hand in activities of daily living where usually two hands are needed. There are 29 items at questionnaire. When respondents answered the questionnaire, they were first asked whether the activity included in the questionnaire was conducted independently. If the activities can be done independently, it is questioned whether one or two hands are used during the activities. If two hands are used, answers and scores to the following 3 sub-questions are sought: hand use, time use in comparison to peers, experience of feeling bothered while doing the activity. A higher score indicates a better level of independence.</description>

    <measure>Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 days and at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is an objective test to evaluate hand function for a person's activities of daily living. Test consist of 7 subtests includes writing, card turning, manipulate small common objects, simulated feeding, stacking checkers, moving large light objects and moving large heavy objects. We will use 6 subtests except writing in our study.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses children's balance and consist of 14 items. Each item is scored between 0 and 4 points. Low score refers to the poor balance and the high score refers to the good balance.</description>

    <measure>Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 days and at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was developed to evaluate spasticity. This scale reveals the rate-dependent nature of spasticity (27). Muscle reaction quality (X) and muscle reaction angle (Y) are determined with MTS. When measuring the muscle reaction angle, the goniometer is used to measure the position of the muscle with minimum stretching. If quality of muscle reaction score was 2 or higher, the joint angle in which the muscle responds with difficulty will be measured goniometer. The scales scores range from 0 to 5. 0= no resistance to passive movement. 1= slight resistance throughout the course of the passive movement. 2= there's a clear catching at a precise angle, which makes passive movement difficult, followed by a release. 3= fatigable clonus (Less than 10 seconds). 4= infatigable clonus (More than 10 seconds). 5= the joint cannot be moved.
