      This phase II trial studies how well Triplex vaccine works in preventing cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      (CMV) infection in patients undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CMV is a&#xD;
      virus that may be carried for life and does not cause illness in most healthy individuals.&#xD;
      However, in people whose immune systems are lowered (such as those undergoing stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation), CMV can reproduce and cause disease and even death. The Triplex vaccine is&#xD;
      made up of 3 small pieces of CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (the chemical form of genes)&#xD;
      placed into a weakened virus called modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) that may help produce&#xD;
      immunity (the ability to recognize and respond to an infection) and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      developing complications related to CMV infection.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if CMV-MVA multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine (Triplex)&#xD;
      reduces the frequency of clinically significant CMV reactivation in CMV positive (+)&#xD;
      haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haploHCT) adult recipients from when&#xD;
      letermovir (Prevymis) prophylaxis is stopped at day (d)100 until d180 post HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Triplex in vaccinated, haploHCT recipients by&#xD;
      assessing the following: non-relapse mortality (NRM) at d180 post-HCT, severe (grade 3-4)&#xD;
      acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] 5.0) probably or definitely related to the&#xD;
      vaccination within 2 weeks from each vaccination at d180 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize CMV related events in recipients of Triplex compared to placebo, by&#xD;
      assessing time-to viremia (number of days from d100 to the date of &gt;= 625 IU/mL), duration of&#xD;
      viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV viremia/disease (&gt;= 625 IU/mL, &gt; 200&#xD;
      and =&lt; 365 days post-HCT), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by clinically significant&#xD;
      viremia), cumulative number of CMV specific antiviral treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the impact of Triplex on transplant related outcomes up to d365 post-HCT by&#xD;
      assessing the incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, non-relapse&#xD;
      mortality, all-cause mortality, infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if Triplex increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV-specific T cell&#xD;
      immunity in vaccinated compared to placebo treated, CMV seropositive HCT-recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine whether vaccination induces adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population&#xD;
      changes, and increase in the highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare GVHD biomarkers between the vaccine and placebo groups up to d365 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine if immunity to 3 CMV antigens contained in the Triplex vaccine correlates&#xD;
      with protection against CMV events, and if T-cell increases reflect vaccine response and&#xD;
      exceed placebo immune response levels up to d365 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive letermovir per standard of care (SOC) on days 7-100 and multi-peptide&#xD;
      CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on days 100 and 128 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive letermovir per SOC on days 7-100 and placebo IM on days 100 and 128&#xD;
      post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 365 days post-HCT and then&#xD;
      for an additional 2 years post-HCT.&#xD;

          -  Participant must be willing to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures,&#xD;
             including willingness to be followed for one year post-HCT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow (BM) HCT for the treatment of&#xD;
             the following hematologic malignancies:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second remission (for acute&#xD;
                  lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma, the disease status must be in&#xD;
                  hematologic remission by bone marrow and peripheral blood. Persistent&#xD;
                  lymphadenopathy on computed tomography [CT] or CT/positron emission tomography&#xD;
                  [PET] scan without progression is allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute myeloid leukemia in first or second remission&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia in first chronic or accelerated phase, or in second&#xD;
                  chronic phase&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other hematologic malignancies judged appropriate by the clinical principal&#xD;
                  investigators (PIs), including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myeloproliferative&#xD;
                  disorders and myelofibrosis. Patients with multiple myeloma and those with&#xD;
                  non-malignant disease such as aplastic anemia are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Adult cases of multiple myeloma (MM) are excluded as HCT is not standard of&#xD;
                       care for MM, and is only performed in very advanced cases with an associated&#xD;
                       high risk of relapse and NRM. Adults with aplastic anemia are excluded&#xD;
                       because their standard management includes T cell depletion with agents such&#xD;
                       as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), which is not permissible on this protocol.&#xD;
                       Patients undergoing a second haploHCT are not eligible (patients who have&#xD;
                       undergone a previous autologous HCT are eligible)&#xD;

             permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test (female patient&#xD;
             of childbearing potential only) within two weeks of registration&#xD;

             any investigational new drugs (IND) with unknown effects on CMV or with unknown&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women and women who are lactating. Triplex risks to pregnant women are&#xD;
             unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the administered vaccine, also&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance&#xD;
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., social/ psychological issues, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to&#xD;
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to&#xD;
             feasibility/logistics)&#xD;
