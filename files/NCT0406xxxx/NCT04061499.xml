    <textblock>
      This study will examine alterations in muscle in individuals with hip osteoarthritis compared&#xD;
      to individuals without hip arthritis. All individuals will receive imaging of their hip and&#xD;
      low back muscles in order to compare differences between groups. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that there will be differences between groups and that these differences will be&#xD;
      related to strength, functional, and balance impairments which will also be measured in all&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common causes of disability in older adults, with&#xD;
      pain, stiffness, and weakness the most frequently reported symptoms. Weakness is a major&#xD;
      concern as decreased lower extremity strength is a contributor to balance and other mobility&#xD;
      limitations that increase fall risk in the aging population. Weakness in the primary hip&#xD;
      muscles in particular have been shown to contribute to gait variability and altered mechanics&#xD;
      of stepping when recovering from a balance perturbation. Contributing factors for these&#xD;
      strength deficits are multifactorial and may include decreased muscle mass/size, changes in&#xD;
      muscle composition, and/or a decreased ability to activate the muscle. Intramuscular fat&#xD;
      infiltration (IMAT), has been reported in several conditions affecting older adults, and has&#xD;
      been shown to be more modifiable at lower levels, suggesting that earlier detection and&#xD;
      intervention may be important. CT and MRI are both commonly used to measure these relevant&#xD;
      muscle properties, but ultrasound imaging may be valid alternative, and has the advantage of&#xD;
      being more accessible to clinicians in many settings. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      cross-sectional area (CSA) and IMAT of the hip and lumbar musculature will be significantly&#xD;
      altered in individuals with hip OA (affected limb) compared to that seen in similar-aged&#xD;
      control participants, and that larger differences in CSA and IMAT will be positively&#xD;
      correlated with OA severity, increased impairment, pain, and disability.&#xD;

    <description>Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)&#xD;
The HOOS is a 40-question questionnaire with five subsections:&#xD;
Pain (10 items) Symptoms (5 items) Activities of Daily Living (ADLs - 17 items) Sports and recreations (4 items) Hip-related quality of life (4 items)&#xD;
Scoring: Scoring for each question ranges from 0 (never) to extreme (4). A normalized score is calculated for each subscale with 0 representing extreme symptoms and 100 representing no symptoms.</description>
