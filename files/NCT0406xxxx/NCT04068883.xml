  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to monitor longitudinal changes in brain structure between the&#xD;
      preseason and postseason, in a population of football and soccer playing athletes wearing the&#xD;
      Device and compared to a similar population not wearing the device. Secondly, the purpose is&#xD;
      to determine the efficacy of device to reduce alterations in brain structure relative to&#xD;
      amount and magnitude of sustained head impacts. Finally, to show that DTI efficacy and safety&#xD;
      results can be prospectively confirmed in a multi-school investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test the null hypotheses of no difference between collar users and non-collar users changes&#xD;
      from baseline to end of season for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: Alterations in pre-defined DTI metrics (AD, MD, RD) are significantly reduced&#xD;
           in the neck collar group at EOS relative to BL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: Alterations in pre-defined DTI metrics is explained by the number of hits,&#xD;
           the hit intensity, and the intensity per head impact over the season non-collar users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, secondary analytics on data derived from injury surveillance (musculoskeletal,&#xD;
      concussion and symptom/severity scores), behavioral (Trail Making, Postural Sway, Flanker,&#xD;
      Task-switching, Near Point Convergence, ADHD and King Devick) or imaging (DTI, fMRI, T1, T2,&#xD;
      and MRS) will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant morbidity, mortality, and related costs are caused by traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI). A simple, effective, and lightweight device worn by athletes or war fighters in the&#xD;
      field, designed to mitigate TBI resulting from blast trauma or concussive events, would save&#xD;
      lives, and the huge costs incurred for life-treatment of surviving victims. An&#xD;
      externally-worn medical device that applies mild jugular compression according to the&#xD;
      principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver (the Device) is being developed by Q30 Sports Science,&#xD;
      LLC (Q30). Preliminary research indicates that the Device has the potential to reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood of alterations to brain microstructure. The currently developed collar has been&#xD;
      approved for studies in humans and the results indicate safety for use during high demand and&#xD;
      maximal exertion activities, Study IDs: 2013-2240, 2016-7948, 2014-5009, 2016-9625,&#xD;
      2016-0988, and 2015-2205 Institutional Review Board - Federalwide Assurance #00002988). FDA&#xD;
      has determined that this device is a nonsignificant risk (NSR) device study because it does&#xD;
      not meet the definition of a significant risk (SR) device under ยง 812.3(m) of the&#xD;
      investigational device exemptions (IDE) regulation (21 CFR 812).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of this device in high school athletes playing&#xD;
      a collision sport such as football or soccer. Athletes participating in this study will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Device wearing during the season or 2) Non-device&#xD;
      wearing during the season. Male football players and female soccer players will be included&#xD;
      in this investigation. All participants may be outfitted with an accelerometer which will&#xD;
      measure the magnitude of every impact to the head sustained by the athlete. This&#xD;
      accelerometer will be affixed with an adhesive patch,(which will be placed behind the ear, to&#xD;
      measure the magnitude of every impact to the head sustained by the athlete Effectiveness of&#xD;
      the device will be determined via differences in longitudinal brain imaging and behavioral&#xD;
      assessments following competitive football and soccer participation. The investigators will&#xD;
      also enroll a group of athletes involved in a non-contact sport (such as cross-country) to&#xD;
      act as controls.&#xD;
