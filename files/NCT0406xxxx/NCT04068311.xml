    <textblock>
      This project will implement a 2 step protocol for multidisciplinary geriatric assessment in&#xD;
      the Emergency Department (ED) and develop a promising researcher into an expert in&#xD;
      Implementation Science and Quality Improvement. Candidate: Dr. Lauren Southerland is a&#xD;
      Geriatric- and Emergency Medicine-trained physician at The Ohio State University Wexner&#xD;
      Medical Center. She designed and leads the first accredited Level 1 Geriatric ED in the&#xD;
      Midwest and has prior research on the care of older adults in the ED and in Observation&#xD;
      Units. Training: The career development plan will build upon Dr. Southerland's unique&#xD;
      fellowship training in Geriatrics with courses in Implementation and Dissemination Science, a&#xD;
      Black Belt in Lean Six Sigma, and Master's in Public Health courses. This combination will&#xD;
      position her as an expert in Implementation research, with the career goal of translating&#xD;
      validated, effective elements of geriatric care into the daily practice of Emergency&#xD;
      Medicine. Mentors: Dr. Southerland has an experienced mentorship team who will provide&#xD;
      guidance in the intricacies of emergency research (Dr. Jeffrey Caterino, MD, MPH primary&#xD;
      mentor), implementation strategies and studies of hospital staff and nurses (Dr. Lorraine&#xD;
      Mion, PhD), implementation frameworks and reporting (Dr. Christopher Carpenter, an EM&#xD;
      physician at Washington University at St. Louis), and identifying environmental and human&#xD;
      factor barriers to quality care (Dr. Susan Moffatt-Bruce, MD, MPH, a vascular surgeon and&#xD;
      researcher). Project: Multidisciplinary assessment by geriatricians, physical therapists,&#xD;
      case managers, and pharmacists identifies and addresses underlying geriatric issues in older&#xD;
      ED patients. However, only a few EDs across the country have been able to incorporate&#xD;
      multidisciplinary care for their older patients, due to barriers such as personnel costs,&#xD;
      work flow culture, and the 24 hour ED care model. We have developed a two-step protocol to&#xD;
      address these barriers: Step 1 is ED nurses using quick, sensitive screens for fall risk (4&#xD;
      Stage Balance Test), delirium (Brief Delirium Triage Screen), and frailty (Identifying&#xD;
      Seniors at Risk Score). Patients with concerning results will be placed in an ED Observation&#xD;
      Unit for (step 2) multidisciplinary geriatric assessment. Using an ED Observation Unit for&#xD;
      these extended assessments overcomes the barriers to multidisciplinary geriatric assessment.&#xD;
      In Aim 1 we will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Lean Six&#xD;
      Sigma methods to identify and address residual barriers to full implementation. Aim 2 will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of this protocol in regards to patient-oriented outcomes&#xD;
      (functional status and health-related quality of life at 90 days). By using implementation&#xD;
      frameworks and processes, we will develop a protocol that is effective, sustainable, and&#xD;
      ready for dissemination to EDs across the US.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Older adult patients in the Emergency Department frequently experience poor outcomes due to&#xD;
      lack of recognition of underlying syndromes, such as delirium, polypharmacy, falls, and&#xD;
      social needs. This study uses rigorous implementation science processes to implement and&#xD;
      investigate an ED protocol to screen older adults for these syndromes and address them with&#xD;
      multidisciplinary geriatric assessments in an ED Observation Unit. Using an Observation Unit&#xD;
      to evaluate older adult patients at risk is a novel strategy developed to address the current&#xD;
      barriers of sustainability, cost, and timeliness that arose in prior studies of geriatric&#xD;
      assessments in an ED setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Implementation: Develop, implement, and sustain a two-step intervention&#xD;
      providing ED geriatric assessments by combining 1) ED nurse-based screening for geriatric&#xD;
      syndromes of all older ED patients with 2) multidisciplinary geriatric assessment in an ED&#xD;
      Obs Unit. Mixed-methods approaches and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation (CFIR)&#xD;
      will be used to identify resource, organizational, patient, staff, and administrative factors&#xD;
      that affect protocol adherence. Lean Six Sigma processes will be used to overcome barriers.&#xD;
      The effects of the protocol in reference to ED quality metrics, staff work flow, and work&#xD;
      culture will be tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Implementation: Lean Six Sigma processes will i) increase ED nurse-based&#xD;
      screening rates to &gt;80% older adults in the ED and ii) increase protocol fidelity in the Obs&#xD;
      Unit to &gt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: Sustainability: After 6 months of &gt;80% screening, the investigators will&#xD;
      characterize the necessary elements for sustainability by systematically withdrawing&#xD;
      implementation support strategies. Hypothesis: Attention to CFIR elements during&#xD;
      implementation will result in routinization and institutionalization that does not&#xD;
      significantly decrease with withdrawal or time, as assessed by sustainability surveys.37&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Effectiveness: The investigators will describe the effect of this protocol on&#xD;
      reducing the decline in functional status and reducing other patient and systems outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g. health related quality of life (HRQoL)) commonly seen after an ED visit.38-40 To obtain&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes, two patient cohorts (pre and post implementation) will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: The intervention will reduce the decline in functional status seen after ED&#xD;
      visits. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, ED revisits, and results&#xD;
      of the multidisciplinary assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: Patients will be satisfied with the protocol as assessed by thematic analysis&#xD;
      of qualitative subject interviews of post intervention patients.&#xD;
