  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell-based gene therapy for pediatric patients with Fanconi Anemia, subtype A (FA-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic stem cells from mobilized peripheral blood of patients with FA-A will be&#xD;
      transduced ex vivo (outside the body) with a lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene. After&#xD;
      transduction, the corrected stem cells will be infused intravenously back to the patient with&#xD;
      the goal of preventing bone marrow failure.&#xD;

      This is a pediatric open-label Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a&#xD;
      hematopoietic gene therapy consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a&#xD;
      lentiviral vector carrying the FANCA gene in pediatric subjects with FA-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enriched CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells will be transduced ex vivo with the therapeutic&#xD;
      lentiviral vector and infused via intravenous infusion following transduction without any&#xD;
      prior conditioning.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Fanconi anemia as diagnosed by chromosomal fragility assay of cultured lymphocytes in&#xD;
             the presence of DEB or a similar DNA-crosslinking agent&#xD;
