  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a developed psychosocial eHealth&#xD;
      intervention on the proposed primary outcomes, health-related quality of life and symptom&#xD;
      burden, among Hispanic breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention components include breast cancer knowledge, stress awareness and management,&#xD;
      social support, and enhanced communication and intimacy skills. The intervention will be&#xD;
      delivered via a Smartphone application over a 12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized into either an intervention application (described below) or&#xD;
      standard treatment. Aside from using the Smartphone application for the recommended 12 weeks,&#xD;
      participation in this study includes three assessments: baseline (at the beginning of the&#xD;
      research study), 6-week follow-up, and 12-week follow-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among Hispanics, the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the U.S., cancer is&#xD;
      the leading cause of death whereas cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for&#xD;
      African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Hispanics also experience substantially&#xD;
      lower rates of 5-year cancer-specific survival relative to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs).&#xD;
      Hispanic cancer patients in the U.S. also report significantly worse cancer-related symptom&#xD;
      burden and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) than NHWs, even after adjusting for&#xD;
      socioeconomic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, very few randomized, intervention studies have specifically targeted&#xD;
      cancer-related symptom burden and HRQOL outcomes among Hispanic women, especially during&#xD;
      active treatment, which is a critical period to intervene to provide skills and tools to&#xD;
      assist with cancer care. Innovative approaches to providing interventions such as Smartphone&#xD;
      technology are especially important for this patient population. Ubiquitous Smartphone use&#xD;
      among ethnic minorities in the US provide a unique opportunity to implement a pragmatic&#xD;
      technology- and evidence-based psychosocial intervention that overcomes some access to care&#xD;
      barriers as well as time and logistical constraints. Furthermore, given that Hispanics own&#xD;
      Smartphones and seek health information online from a mobile device at similar or higher&#xD;
      rates than other groups in the U.S., Smartphone interventions offer an opportunity to&#xD;
      overcome obstacles to accessing resources and services that can be culturally informed and&#xD;
      provide skills to improve symptom burden and HRQOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to create and evaluate a culturally informed eHealth psychoeducational and&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention for English or Spanish-speaking Hispanic women undergoing treatment&#xD;
      for breast cancer. This intervention is grounded in evidence-based paradigms to improve the&#xD;
      proposed Primary Outcomes: Cancer-Related Symptom Burden and HRQOL and the proposed Secondary&#xD;
      Outcomes: usability and markers the intervention use. This study is designed to develop and&#xD;
      test a Smartphone-based intervention that can be disseminated to cancer patients at a&#xD;
      relatively low cost. This study designed as a 12-week randomized trial intended to evaluate&#xD;
      the eHealth intervention when compared to a control condition. It is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      eHealth intervention will significantly improve cancer-related symptom burden and HRQOL&#xD;
      compared to the control condition.&#xD;

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life will be evaluated with The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>HRQoL will be first assessed at baseline (T1), initial HRQoL changes will be assessed at 6 weeks post-baseline (T2), and finally any additional HRQoL changes will be captured 12 weeks post-baseline (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-B has been used extensively to measure HRQoL, and has been translated to and validated in Spanish. The FACT-B assesses participant's wellbeing in physical, emotional, social, functional, and breast cancer related concerns in the last seven days using a five-point response scale.</description>

    <measure>Symptom Burden will be evaluated with The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial symptom questionnaire (BCPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Symptom Burden will be first assessed at baseline (T1), initial changes will be assessed at 6 weeks post-baseline (T2), and finally any additional changes will be captured 12 weeks post-baseline (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The BCPT measures participants' symptom burden. The BCPT asks participants to report their level of discomfort with 25 breast cancer related symptoms during the past four weeks using a five-point response scale.</description>

    <measure>Cancer-Specific Distress will be evaluated using The Impact of Event Scale (IES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cancer-specific distress will be first assessed at baseline (T1), initial changes will be assessed at 6 weeks post-baseline (T2), and finally any additional changes will be captured 12 weeks post-baseline (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The IES is made up of two subscales measuring the frequency of intrusion and avoidance experiences after a stressful event. The IES has been widely used among patients diagnosed with cancer and has been translated and validated with Spanish-speaking participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast Cancer Related Knowledge will be evaluated with the Knowledge about Breast Cancer Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>This questionnaire has been tested with Spanish-speaking Hispanic breast cancer survivors, it is made up of 16 true and false questions regarding general breast cancer knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast Cancer Related Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy will be evaluated using the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale for cancer (CASE-cancer)</measure>
    <time_frame>Breast Cancer Related Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy will be first assessed at baseline (T1), initial changes will be assessed at 6 weeks post-baseline (T2), and finally any additional changes will be captured 12 weeks post-baseline (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The CASE-cancer questionnaire is made up various subscales measuring breast cancer related communication and attitudinal self-efficacy. Each question asks participants to use a four-point response scale to agree or disagree with statements regarding their level of confidence with different skills.</description>
