  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diabetes epidemic is a pertinent concern globally. The prevalence of this metabolic&#xD;
      disease among adults had been disclosed by the World health Organisation (WHO), reporting a&#xD;
      total of 422 million diabetic adults and 3.7 million diabetic deaths in 2016, with Asian&#xD;
      countries contributing more than 60% of the world's diabetic population. Due to its economic&#xD;
      and social repercussions, preventive strategies are implemented at a population level. The&#xD;
      implementation of a diet low in glycaemic index (GI) has been widely adopted as part of&#xD;
      diabetes management strategies to prevent and control Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) as the&#xD;
      consumption of food with low GI has shown to improve glycaemic control, lipid profile, and&#xD;
      reduce systemic inflammation. Other strategies include adopting an active lifestyle and the&#xD;
      consumption of functional foods. In lieu of this, the composition of food products may be&#xD;
      altered by incorporating edible plant-based functional components with&#xD;
      carbohydrase-inhibiting properties. Black rice has been proposed as a viable source of&#xD;
      functional ingredients, namely anthocyanins, not only because of its potential benefits to&#xD;
      health that has been established by numerous in-vitro studies, but also it is easily sourced&#xD;
      for in Asia as it is widely cultivated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, black rice anthocyanin-fortified bread serves as a replacement to white bread&#xD;
      as the staple to the subject's diet, in a mixed meal setting. The fortified bread is&#xD;
      hypothesised to improve glycemic responses over white bread, offering a lower GI food&#xD;
      alternative to the conventional staple.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Black rice anthocyanin-fortified bread, compared to white bread as a control, is hypothesised&#xD;
      to improve glycaemic control and serum lipid profiles in a mixed meal setting. The aim of&#xD;
      this research is to to assess the influence of black rice anthocyanin on postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose and insulinemic responses, and lipid profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the research is to contribute to the prevention of diabetes by investigating how&#xD;
      the incorporation of functional ingredients in carbohydrate-based foods will influence&#xD;
      glycaemic and lipid panel profiles in a mixed meal setting. A human in-vivo intervention&#xD;
      study will be conducted to assess the glycaemic and lipid responses of anthocyanin-fortified&#xD;
      bread as compared to white bread, served with a ground beef patty to simulate the mixed meal.&#xD;
      The approximate time to complete study recruitment will be 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, non-smoking subjects aged 21 to 65 will be recruited in this study. There will be a&#xD;
      total of 2 visits (excluding 1 screening session), with the duration of each visit&#xD;
      approximately 4-5 h. The study procedures will be conducted in Investigational Medicine Unit&#xD;
      (IMU). During the each visit, subjects will undergo a mixed meal tolerance test. Test foods&#xD;
      will be freshly prepared on the day of the visit in Food Science amp; Technology Programme&#xD;
      food preparation area situated at Block S14 level 5, Science Drive 2, using food-grade&#xD;
      ingredients. Only small quantities of bread will be prepared each day (3 to 4). The subject's&#xD;
      glycemic response to the control meal (white bread) will be compared to their response after&#xD;
      consumption of anthocyanin-fortified bread in a mixed meal setting. An improvement in&#xD;
      postprandial blood glucose response and lipid panel profiles in response to the mixed meals&#xD;
      will show that the anthocyanin-fortification is effective in offering better control over&#xD;
      glycaemic and lipid profiles.&#xD;
