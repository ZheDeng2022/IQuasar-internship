  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effects of oral&#xD;
      sedation using midazolam and hydroxyzine with and without meperidine (a narcotic) on sedation&#xD;
      outcomes in pediatric dental patients undergoing dental treatment at the University of&#xD;
      Washington Center for Pediatric Dentistry. Procedural sedation can be offered as an option&#xD;
      for dental treatment for a young, potentially uncooperative pediatric patient to safely and&#xD;
      effectively complete dental restorative needs. Both sedation regimens are already regularly&#xD;
      used for patients at the UW CPD. The goal of this study is to assess if removing a narcotic&#xD;
      from the regimen will produce the same behavioral success outcomes as a regimen with a&#xD;
      narcotic. Our hypothesis is that patients who receive oral sedation using midazolam,&#xD;
      hydroxyzine, and meperidine will experience fewer behavioral failures than those who receive&#xD;
      oral sedation using midazolam and hydroxyzine without meperidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this project is to evaluate the relationship between child&#xD;
      temperament and sedation outcome in each treatment group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young children in the dental setting can pose significant behavioral challenges. These&#xD;
      patients may have dental anxiety or lack the effortful control (self-regulation) to&#xD;
      successfully navigate the dental experience. Oral procedural sedation is an advanced&#xD;
      pharmacological behavior guidance technique that can be used as part of the pediatric&#xD;
      dentist's armamentarium when basic behavior guidance techniques are likely to be ineffective.&#xD;
      Oral sedation can be a valuable tool, not only to facilitate dental treatment, but also to&#xD;
      protect a young child's psyche, reduce dental fear, and ensure safety of both the patient and&#xD;
      the dental team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case selection is crucial to optimizing sedation outcomes. In addition to biological factors&#xD;
      like age, gender, and weight, temperament must also be carefully evaluated for the pediatric&#xD;
      oral sedation candidate. Compared with children with high levels of effortful control,&#xD;
      children who exhibit high levels of impulsivity may be more likely to respond poorly to&#xD;
      uncomfortable or unfamiliar procedures, exhibit uncooperative behavior during sedation, and&#xD;
      ultimately experience more sedation failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard drug regimen or protocol for oral sedation. Medications used for&#xD;
      sedation studies often have a wide therapeutic range, and dosages used in the literature vary&#xD;
      widely. Varying drug regimens can also be used depending on operator preference and the&#xD;
      extent of the procedure. Benzodiazepines, opioids, and antihistamines are commonly used drug&#xD;
      options that can be used alone or in combination to achieve desired sedative effects and&#xD;
      minimize potential side effects of counterpart drugs. For example, midazolam is a&#xD;
      rapid-onset, short acting benzodiazepine that offers a sedative effect with some degree of&#xD;
      amnesia. These qualities make midazolam an ideal sedative for relatively minor or quick&#xD;
      operative procedures in young children. An opioid such as meperidine can be added to&#xD;
      potentiate the sedative effect and offer analgesia for lengthier, more complex procedures.&#xD;
      Additionally, an antihistamine like hydroxyzine can be added for additional sedative effects&#xD;
      as well as an antiemetic effect to counter potential nausea from the use of an opioid. The&#xD;
      use of supplemental nitrous oxide/oxygen (N2O/O2) in conjunction with a chosen sedation&#xD;
      regimen has been shown to further potentiate sedation effects and improve sedation outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite proving to be an effective behavior management technique, procedural sedation poses&#xD;
      its own set of risks. Compared with intravenous or intranasal methods of drug delivery, oral&#xD;
      delivery of sedation medications can be challenging due to longer and more variable onset to&#xD;
      sedation, unpredictable hepatic first-pass absorption and bioavailability, and an inability&#xD;
      to titrate the medications. Sedation effects may linger long after the procedure is completed&#xD;
      and affect post-discharge outcomes. Additionally, the use of multiple medications has been&#xD;
      shown to increase the risk of adverse outcomes compared with single or dual-combination drug&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of adverse events during sedation can be avoided with careful case selection,&#xD;
      medication dosing, and proper intra-operative monitoring. When adverse events do occur, they&#xD;
      are typically due to respiratory depression, and can include laryngospasm, neurologic injury,&#xD;
      and death. Thus, to avoid oversedation and subsequent adverse sequelae, multi-drug regimens&#xD;
      (especially those that contain opioids like meperidine) must be used judiciously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The midazolam/meperidine/hydroxyzine regimen is a popular combination of medications for&#xD;
      pediatric dental sedation. The increase in the use of meperidine has been associated with a&#xD;
      movement away from utilization of chloral hydrate (another sedative with no reversal agent,&#xD;
      previously frequently used in conjunction with a combination of the aforementioned drugs or&#xD;
      other drugs). While there are studies comparing sedation regimens that include both chloral&#xD;
      hydrate and meperidine used together, meperidine is an increasingly preferred option over&#xD;
      chloral hydrate for procedural sedation, especially with the availability of a reversal agent&#xD;
      for the opioid in the instance of oversedation, as well as a shorter half-life compared with&#xD;
      chloral hydrate. While narcotic-containing regimens are popular, there are still inherent&#xD;
      risks in utilization of an opioid in any sedation regimen. Several studies have been&#xD;
      published comparing sedation regimens that include meperidine, but to date, there are no&#xD;
      studies comparing the efficacy of midazolam and hydroxyzine with and without meperidine.&#xD;
      Additionally, many studies compare side effects of different regimens (for example,&#xD;
      post-operative drowsiness, nausea, time spent asleep, crying), but few utilize the Houpt&#xD;
      Behavior Rating that we plan to use to categorize sedation outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Children's temperament will be assessed via parental completion of the Child Behavior Questionnaire Short Form (CBQ-SF) to assess which child temperaments may be more suitable candidates for dental oral sedation.&#xD;
The CBQ-SF is a set of 94 statements scoring a child's temperament on 15 domains: activity level, anger/frustration, approach/positive anticipation, attentional focusing, discomfort, falling reactivity/soothability, fear, high intensity pleasure, impulsivity, inhibitory control, low intensity pleasure, perceptual sensitivity, sadness, shyness, and smiling and laughter.&#xD;
The parent ranks their child on a scale of 1-7 according to how well they feel the child fits each statement. An average is taken of responses applicable to a specific domain to obtain the score for the child for the domain. For example, if there are 6 questions in the survey measuring shyness and the child averages a score of 6.5/7 out of the 6 questions, we conclude that the child has a shy temperament.</description>
