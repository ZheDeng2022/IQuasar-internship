  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastasis accounted for 10-15% of all breast cancer patients and even higher in&#xD;
      patients with triple negative and HER2 overexpressed subtype. Stereotactic radiation is the&#xD;
      standard option for patients with 1-4 brain metastases. Among patients with 1-4 brain&#xD;
      metastases, many studies suggest that stereotactic radiation results in fewer neurologic side&#xD;
      effects than whole brain radiation. Also, several studies had demonstrated that 5-10 lesions&#xD;
      had similar overall survival by using whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy(FSRT) is increasingly administered in the brain&#xD;
      metastatic patients and retrospective studies had shown that FSRT had better local control&#xD;
      and lower brain radiation necrosis than single fraction stereotactic radiation. Therefore, In&#xD;
      this study, we explore to treat 1-10 brain metastasis lesion in breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      FSRT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients with 1-10 brain metastasis will be treated with FSRT for brain&#xD;
      metastasis. 3 to 5 fractions and 8Gy per fraction will be used for these patients based on&#xD;
      the lesion number and volume.&#xD;
