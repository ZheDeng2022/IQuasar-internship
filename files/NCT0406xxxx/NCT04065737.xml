    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, phase II, open-label study. The goal of this clinical research&#xD;
      study is to investigate how well sintilimab works in preventing high-risk oral premalignant&#xD;
      lesions cancerization.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      this study is a non-randomized, phase II, open-label study. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether&#xD;
      it works in preventing or treating a disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sintilimab in preventing the&#xD;
      onset of oral cancer in patients with high-risk oral premalignant lesions, who had oral&#xD;
      cancer at least once before.&#xD;
