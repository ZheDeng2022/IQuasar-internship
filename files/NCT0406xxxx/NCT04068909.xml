      The aim of the study is developing an individualized risk model for the unfavorable outcomes&#xD;
      of coronary artery disease and complications from ongoing therapy, according to clinical,&#xD;
      instrumental, biochemical and genetic parameters in patients with acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: patients with acute coronary syndrome (with or without ST elevation) who&#xD;
      have indications for PCI Number of inclusion patients - 1655 patients Scheduled time of&#xD;
      follow up - 24 month Primary end-point: all-cause death Secondary end-points: any&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal&#xD;
      stroke); non-fatal myocardial infarction; recurrent acute coronary syndrome; non-fatal stoke;&#xD;
      complicated atherosclerosis; recurrent PCI; bleeding&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The role of genetic factors in the development of coranary heart disease (CHD) exacerbations&#xD;
      studied not enough. Most research in this area planned and carried out on a &quot;case-control&quot;.&#xD;
      Using a similar protocol entails significant errors are associated with a high incidence of&#xD;
      subclinical atherosclerotic vascular lesions. Moreover, much of atheroma is extravasal,&#xD;
      making it impossible to identify them by angiography. Therefore, necessary to conduct&#xD;
      prospective studies to estimate the frequency of so-called hard endpoints. Previously,&#xD;
      similar trials were conducted, mainly in connect with drug approving procedures. The spread&#xD;
      data from them to other patients directly is not entirely justified. At the same time, the&#xD;
      influence of genetic factors in this group of patients can be substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous part of the study, the sample of patients of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan,&#xD;
      Chelyabinsk, Stavropol, Perm, and Rostov-on-the-Don was formed, of 1,200 people admitted due&#xD;
      to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      at coronary care units with follow-up for three years. We found several factors, including&#xD;
      genetic, that significantly affect the outcomes of the disease. Coronary atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      its complications now considered as a multifactorial disease associated with inherent&#xD;
      factors. Therefore, the project provides, besides accounting a significant amount of clinical&#xD;
      and instrumental data, the determination of a wide range of genotypes and alleles of&#xD;
      polymorphic markers candidate genes encoding the protein factors of the hemostatic system,&#xD;
      enzymes of lipid metabolism system, and anti-inflammatory cytokines. It is assumed that the&#xD;
      prediction outcomes of coronary heart disease should be carried out taking into account the&#xD;
      fact that several factors (gender, diabetes, age, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, etc.)&#xD;
      can not only significantly change the forecast itself but also affecting the significance of&#xD;
      other risk factors. Since the last study, the standards significantly of ACS management&#xD;
      changed. Invasive treatment not only creates opportunities to reduce coronary mortality but&#xD;
      also increased demands on the patient's adherence to the assigned medication and creates&#xD;
      additional risks associated with its activity (especially with an antithrombotic treatment&#xD;
      activity). In these circumstances, the development of personalized approaches to prescribing&#xD;
      drugs is particularly important. Thus, the prediction of coronary heart disease outcomes&#xD;
      after an ACS on a set of clinical, instrumental, biochemical and genetic indicators is of&#xD;
      great importance, as it allows to plan the most optimal treatment for the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to develop a model of individualized risk of coronary heart disease&#xD;
      outcomes and side effects of therapy based on clinical and instrumental, biochemical, and&#xD;
      genetic parameters in patients with ACS.&#xD;
