  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) is a rare type of slow growing lymphoma. It develops&#xD;
      when white blood cells grow abnormally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically a disease of the elderly, the median age of presentation is &gt;70 years and the&#xD;
      current treatment for WM is unsatisfactory, with incomplete responses and inevitable&#xD;
      recurrence. Therefore there is a need to find alternative treatments that are more effective,&#xD;
      leading to lasting responses and improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAINBOW study is a phase 2-3 trial assessing 'chemotherapy free' treatment as primary&#xD;
      therapy for WM which can potentially improve response outcome, durability and importantly,&#xD;
      reduce toxicity for WM patients. This approach will be done using the drug Ibrutinib, which&#xD;
      in combination with rituximab (RI) will be the experimental arm. As there is no agreed&#xD;
      standard on first-line therapy for WM, the control arm is the current treatment based on the&#xD;
      most recently published clinical trial results. The control arm consists of rituximab,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (DCR), and is widely recommended by international&#xD;
      consensus as appropriate treatment for first-line therapy for WM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 148 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with treatment naïve WM will be randomised on a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to either the treatment or control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised treatment lasts for a maximum of 6 cycles and response will be assessed following&#xD;
      3 cycles of treatment and completion of randomised treatment at approximately 24 weeks after&#xD;
      commencing treatment. RI patients may then have up to 5 years of Ibrutinib monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen regularly during treatment and then every 3 months for 5 years after&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation. Patients will enter annual follow up for survival until the end of&#xD;
      trial (including progressed patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at NHS hospitals and is expected to last 9 years and 6 months.&#xD;
