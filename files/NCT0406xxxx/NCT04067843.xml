      The overarching aim of this research project is to prevent orthopedic implant-associated&#xD;
      infections. This study aims to investigate if photodynamic therapy has an effect on bacterial&#xD;
      skin colonization and decrease number of colonizing bacteria associated with sebaceous and&#xD;
      sweat glands in order to improve skin antisepsis strategies for the prevention of surgical&#xD;
      site infections.&#xD;

      Background. Periprosthetic joint infections are increasing due to our elderly population with&#xD;
      the need of a joint prosthesis. These infections are difficult to treat, because bacteria are&#xD;
      able to be sessile (biologically inactive) in the biofilms formed within one day on the&#xD;
      orthopedic implant surface. Notably, the current available antibiotics do not penetrate the&#xD;
      biofilm or are not active against the sessile form of bacteria - rifampicin being the only&#xD;
      antibiotic being active. Therefore, prevention is key. In the current paradigm, bacteria from&#xD;
      the skin surface or dermis - such as Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci,&#xD;
      or Cutibacterium sp. - contaminate the peri-implant tissue during surgery. In an ongoing&#xD;
      study with the Orthopedic University Hospital Balgrist (manuscript in preparation), the&#xD;
      investigators found that the common practice of skin antisepsis is ineffective to eliminate&#xD;
      skin bacteria before surgery. Strikingly, the skin bacteria hide in sebaceous or sweat&#xD;
      glands. Photodynamic treatment has recently gained attention in the treatment of acne&#xD;
      patients, a disease of the pilosebaceous unit, in which also Cutibacterium acnes is&#xD;
      implicated. The photodynamic treatment works here on the one hand through a long-lasting&#xD;
      destruction of the sebaceous glands, and on the other hand due to anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      antimicrobial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. The investigators hypothesize that photodynamic treatment improves skin&#xD;
      antisepsis before surgical implantation of foreign material by reduction of persistent skin&#xD;
      colonizing bacteria through the destruction of the sebaceous and sweat glands and by its&#xD;
      bactericidal effects Overall and specific objectives. The overarching aim of this research&#xD;
      project is to prevent orthopedic implant-associated infections. The specific aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of photodynamic treatment on colonizing bacteria immediately after&#xD;
      surgical skin antisepsis (aim 1) and 3 weeks later (aim 2). In aim 3, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate phylogenetic similarity of same bacterial species before and after photodynamic&#xD;
      treatment if they persist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The investigators will collect scrapings from the skin surface and quantitatively&#xD;
      evaluate bacterial species and density before and after photodynamic treatment in combination&#xD;
      with skin antisepsis of povidone-iodine/alcohol, in aim 1 immediately after skin antisepsis,&#xD;
      and in aim 2, 21 days after photodynamic treatment. For aim 2, the investigators will&#xD;
      additionally evaluate changes of sebaceous and sweat glands after photodynamic treatment&#xD;
      using histopathology. To evaluate phylogenetic similarity of same bacterial species before&#xD;
      and after photodynamic treatment, the investigators will investigate the core genome using&#xD;
      whole genome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance and outlook. The current study will investigate if photodynamic treatment is able&#xD;
      to improve preoperative skin preparation to decrease surgical site infections in hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty surgery. A decrease of implant-associated infections has multiple benefits,&#xD;
      among others reduced morbidity, mortality and lower health costs. This study shall provide&#xD;
      the fundament for a prospective cohort study of patients with planned hip arthroplasty for&#xD;
      investigating the effect of photodynamic treatment before skin antisepsis.&#xD;
