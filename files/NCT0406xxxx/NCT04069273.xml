    <textblock>
      This randomized phase 2 study will evaluate 2 novel immunotherapy combinations in which&#xD;
      pembrolizumab is integrated with ramucirumab and paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric&#xD;
      and GEJ adenocarcinoma. A total of 58 patients will be enrolled to the study. Each arm will&#xD;
      have 26 patients. Although the study has a randomized design, patients in both arms will&#xD;
      receive study drug (pembrolizumab).&#xD;
