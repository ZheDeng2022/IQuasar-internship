      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel, in&#xD;
      improving coronary microvascular function, as measured by coronary flow reserve (CFR) in&#xD;
      patients with T2DM at high risk of cardiovascular (CV) events undergoing elective PCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) can be divided into macrovascular and microvascular disease,&#xD;
      both different manifestations of atherosclerosis. Macrovascular CAD, i.e. obstructive CAD of&#xD;
      epicardial coronary arteries have traditionally been the focus of CAD treatment.&#xD;
      Microvascular circulation, on the other hand, consists of arterioles (diameter &lt;100 μm)&#xD;
      within myocardium and abnormalities in this arterial bed may also impair myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      and result in ischaemia. An indication of microvascular disease can be achieved with coronary&#xD;
      flow reserve (CFR) which is an integrated measure of flow through both large epicardial&#xD;
      arteries and coronary microcirculation. CFR measurement is the ratio of resting coronary&#xD;
      artery mean diastolic flow velocity in comparison to hyperaemic coronary artery mean&#xD;
      diastolic flow velocity, where hyperaemia is often induced with pharmacologic agent such as&#xD;
      adenosine infusion. CFR of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery during&#xD;
      pharmacologic stress echocardiography has been found to provide effective prognostic&#xD;
      information in patients with known or suspected CAD. This seems evident across patient&#xD;
      populations, such as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, or older age.&#xD;
      Particularly, a CFR &lt;2.0 has been associated with markedly increased cardiovascular (CV) risk&#xD;
      in an unselected patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ticagrelor primary mode of action is as a direct acting reversibly binding P2Y12 antagonist&#xD;
      inhibiting ADP-induced platelet activation. However, ticagrelor has also been shown to&#xD;
      increase extracellular adenosine concentration by inhibition of the equilibrative nucleoside&#xD;
      transporter 1 (ENT1). Adenosine has been described to have a number of physiological effects&#xD;
      including vasodilation, anti-inflammation, anti-platelet and cardioprotective effects and&#xD;
      ticagrelor has been shown to enhance many of these adenosine-induced effects in animal models&#xD;
      and in man. These adenosine-mediated effects may be beneficial to CAD patients and&#xD;
      potentially impact coronary microvascular function and contribute to the clinical profile of&#xD;
      ticagrelor. So far only one study has explored ticagrelor effect on coronary microvascular&#xD;
      function. They showed, by using rubidium 82 positron emission tomography/computed tomography,&#xD;
      that ticagrelor could improve local CFR compared to clopidogrel in CAD patients specifically&#xD;
      in those regions that before treatment had impaired CFR (&lt;2.5). CFR has been shown to be a&#xD;
      strong independent predictor in diabetic patients with suspected coronary disease for future&#xD;
      coronary events and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing THEMIS study is designed to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor is superior to&#xD;
      placebo, in prevention of major CV events, as measured by time to first event of the&#xD;
      composite of CV death, MI, or stroke in patients with T2DM at high risk of CV events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing elective PCI are excluded from the THEMIS study as these patients are&#xD;
      treated with clopidogrel plus aspirin. The current study is designed to fill this data gap by&#xD;
      generating clinically meaningful data with ticagrelor in THEMIS-like patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective PCI.&#xD;
