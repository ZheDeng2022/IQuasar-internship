      This protocol is part of an FDA Individual Patient Non-emergency Expanded Access Request&#xD;
      submitted on behalf of a 38-year-old father and husband who on August 4, 2017 at about&#xD;
      4:30pm, slipped off a boat head-first while in the Florida Keys for a family wedding, and was&#xD;
      immediately unable to move his legs. He was emergently transferred to Miami, FL for&#xD;
      stabilization and treatment, where he was diagnosed with a C5 -C6 Grade 2 anterolisthesis of&#xD;
      C5 on C6: 7mm, with flexion teardrop fracture of the anterior aspect of C6, as well as jumped&#xD;
      facet on the right and perched facet on the left at C5-C6 with spinal canal stenosis with&#xD;
      cord compression, as well as with aspiration and near drowning. He underwent ACDF (anterior&#xD;
      cervical discectomy and fusion) of C5-C6 and reduction of jumped facets and was immediately&#xD;
      started on a hypothermia protocol to reduce spinal cord edema. His hospital course was&#xD;
      complicated by aspiration pneumonia. He discharged to Texas via air ambulance for physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation on August 23, 2017 with a diagnosis of ASIA B (American Spinal Injury&#xD;
      Association) C-5 SCI (spinal cord injury).&#xD;

      Once the eligibility is confirmed, approximately 1-3 weeks after the screening/baseline&#xD;
      visit, the subject will receive the first infusion. Subsequent treatments will occur every&#xD;
      other week in the subject's home, administered by a nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each of these visits, the subject will receive one autologous HB-adMSC infusion of 200&#xD;
      million (2 x 10^8 cells) total cells. Every infusion visit will include the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interval H&amp;P and concomitant medications update utilizing the secure VirTrial platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. QOL and Disability (SCIM self eval) surveys will be completed by the subject with the&#xD;
           assistance of the primary caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital signs monitoring will be initiated (Heart Rate, BP, Resp., Temp., SpO2),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A peripheral IV line will be inserted,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A blood sample for clinical labs (CBC with Platelets, CMP, PT, PTT, TNFa, IL6, CRP) will&#xD;
           be drawn monthly during the infusion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A &quot;time out&quot; verification of patient/consent/procedure/cell product will be performed,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The HB-adMSC infusion will be given by through the peripheral IV, infused over 1 hour at&#xD;
           a rate of 250ml/hr (83gtts/minute) by a registered nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Assessment for Infusion Related AE/SAEs&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The subject will be monitored for a minimum of 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-Person Visits The subject will return to the Clinical Trial Network CTN site for In-Person&#xD;
      visits to occur at Screening, Baseline and Week twelve (12), twenty-six (26) and at Week&#xD;
      fifty-two (52). Week 52 visit will serve as the End of Study visit. The end of study (EOS)&#xD;
      visit will include an MRI of the c-spine as well as all of the study procedures for Follow-up&#xD;
      Visits without Infusion. A written summary of the results of the treatment, including adverse&#xD;
      events will be submitted to the FDA after completion of the last follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits without infusion will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interval H&amp;P and concomitant medications update.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. QOL and Disability (SCIM self eval) surveys will be completed by the subject with the&#xD;
           assistance of the primary caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital signs monitoring will be initiated (Heart Rate, BP, Resp., Temp., SpO2),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A Physical and Neuro Exam (Asia Impairment Scale) will be completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A blood sample for clinical labs (CBC with Platelets, CMP, PT, PTT, TNFa, IL6, CRP) will&#xD;
           be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Video documentation of patient condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assessment for infusion related AEs/SAEs&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Weight&#xD;
