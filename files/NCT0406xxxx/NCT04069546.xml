  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic conditioning, consisting of several brief cycles of intermittent&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion of the arm or leg, may potentially confer systemic protection against&#xD;
      prolonged ischemia in a distant organ. Numerous reports have confirmed its strongest&#xD;
      endogenous neuroprotection against brain injury after stroke, of which the immune mechanisms&#xD;
      are majorly involved in RIC. At the same time, the inflammation response plays a great role&#xD;
      in stroke development, which may expand the infarct area. Stroke-induced immunodeficiency can&#xD;
      potentiate stroke-associated pneumonia, which is an important cause of death after strokes.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will assess the effect of RIC on stroke-induced&#xD;
      immunodeficiency and inflammation response in AIS patients.&#xD;
