  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the risks associated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC)s and the lack of defined&#xD;
      pathways for patients prescribed this class of medications, the study intervention has the&#xD;
      potential for enormous impact in preventing medication errors and improving the quality of&#xD;
      care transition, patient knowledge, and adherence with DOAC therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients first treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in an ambulatory setting are&#xD;
      at an elevated risk for adverse drug events (ADEs) or potential ADEs from medication errors.&#xD;
      An intervention that integrates clinical pharmacists, a pharmacy technician, and follows a&#xD;
      checklist published by experts at the Anticoagulation Forum can prevent adverse outcomes. The&#xD;
      Investigators propose research on the effectiveness, implementation, and dissemination for a&#xD;
      care transition intervention that follows the checklist which includes evaluation for&#xD;
      appropriateness of DOAC use, assistance with drug procurement, telephone access to an&#xD;
      anticoagulation expert, and other best practice recommendations.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC)-Related Clinically Important Medication Errors</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days Post Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of preventable, ameliorable and potential Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) that physician reviewers attribute to Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) medication. Each DOAC related clinically important medication error is counted as a separate event, enabling patients to have multiple events consistent with the literature.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Knowledge regarding Anticoagulation and Venus Thromboembolism (VTE) using the Anticoagulation and Venus Thromboembolism (VTE) knowledge questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days Post Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient knowledge regarding Anticoagulation and Venus Thromboembolism (VTE) will be evaluated using a modified version of a 22-item instrument previously developed and tested by the institution. This instrument assesses patients' knowledge of warning signs of bleeding and new VTE, interactions with other medications, and complications of VTE. A low score indicate a low level of knowledge and a high score indicates a high level of knowledge regarding anticoagulation and VTE.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of missed or extra doses to assess medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days Post Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are asked to to count out the number of remaining pills from the last filled prescription and provide the fill date, number of pills dispensed, the schedule prescribed (either once or twice a day depending on DOAC), and skipped doses for deliberate interruption to determine medication adherence with the number of missed or extra doses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) to assess medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days Post Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence is measured with Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) which is the ratio between the time a patient had medication on hand, the time that a patient is eligible to have a medication on hand, and the time that a patient is covered by the medication. The MPR ratio will be calculated by using available pharmacy data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of days covered (PDC) to assess medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days Post Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) is the ratio between the time that a patient has a medication on hand, the time that a patient is eligible to have a medication on hand, and the time that a patient is covered by the medication.Medication adherence will be evaluated using the mean PDC using available pharmacy data.</description>

    <description>Two intervention pharmacists will deliver the intervention. First, a pharmacy technician will call the patient to ensure access and affordability. Next the clinical pharmacist will call to conduct an initial consultation and educational session, documenting the findings and recommendations related to this consultation in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Finally, the intervention staff will send educational materials customized to the patient preference - short video clips, print materials, or an email with links to print materials. Over the remaining weeks of the study, the intervention pharmacists will field questions from patients, perform two follow up monthly phone calls, order and follow up on renal and hepatic function lab work, and write an off-service note.</description>
