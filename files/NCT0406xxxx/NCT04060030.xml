    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the cognitive and behavioral effects of&#xD;
      liquid leucovorin calcium on young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and determine&#xD;
      whether it improves social communication as well as the core and associated symptoms of ASD.&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5&#xD;
      years, with confirmed ASD and known social and communication delays. Participation will last&#xD;
      approximately 26 weeks, from screening visit to end of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with life-long&#xD;
      consequences that affects young children during critical times in their development. ASD is&#xD;
      defined by impairments in social-communication as well as the presence of restricted&#xD;
      interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD is frequently associated with co-occurring language&#xD;
      delays. Currently the only well-accepted treatment for core ASD symptoms is behavior therapy&#xD;
      such as Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention. There is no&#xD;
      US Food and Drug Administration approved medical therapy that addresses core ASD symptoms or&#xD;
      the pathophysiological processes that underlie ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a liquid form of leucovorin&#xD;
      calcium on social and communication impairments in very young children with ASD. Participants&#xD;
      entered into the trial will have delayed language and moderate ASD symptoms. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that leucovorin calcium will significantly improve social&#xD;
      communication as well as core and associated behavioral symptoms of ASD, and be&#xD;
      well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, in young children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether the liquid form of leucovorin calcium is superior to placebo, the&#xD;
      investigators will study 80 children across two sites, between the ages of 2.5 and 5 years,&#xD;
      with confirmed ASD and known social and communication delays at baseline. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive active treatment or placebo for 12 weeks under double-blind&#xD;
      conditions. At the end of 12 weeks, all participants will receive active treatment for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Language skills and social communication abilities will be measured at screening and&#xD;
      after each treatment arm in order to determine if the supplement positively influences social&#xD;
      communication. Additionally, the investigators will measure changes in neural pathways using&#xD;
      either magnetoencephalography at Phoenix Children's Hospital or functional Near Infrared&#xD;
      Spectroscopy at State University of New York, Downstate. While these measures will be&#xD;
      considered exploratory, they will be important to begin to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying leucovorin's impact.&#xD;

    <description>Aberrant Behavior Checklist-2, Social Withdrawal Subscale. The ABC is a 58-item parent-reported measure with ratings in the following domains: irritability, social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech. Each item is rated from 0 (Not a Problem) to 3 (Severe Problem). The raw score will be reported. The total raw score is the sum of the domain raw scores. A higher raw score in any of the domains indicates more severe problems in that domain; a higher total raw score indicates more severity of stereotypical autism symptoms overall.</description>

    <description>Modified Dosage Record and Treatment Emergent Symptoms: treating clinician will perform a review of medical and behavioral history at each visit to assess incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The treating clinician will use the scale to record presence and intensity of adverse effects. Intensity is rated on a scale of 0 (Not present) to 3 (Severe). The treating clinician will also judge the adverse effects' relatedness to treatment. Relatedness is rated on a scale of 1 (None) to 4 (Defined). The treating clinician will denote action taken. Action taken is rated on a scale of 0 (None) to 5 (Discontinue Treatment). No total score is calculated. However, higher ratings on any individual item indicate greater severity of adverse effects.</description>

The frequency of each item is scaled from 0 (Never) to 2 (Usually). For each domain, there are 45 items with a maximum score of 90. Change in each domain will be measured by the change in standard score. Standard scores are calculated from the raw scores and based on age norms. A higher standard score in any domain indicates a higher level of adaptive behavior in that domain. Domain standard scores will be used to get a standard composite score. Change in adaptive behavior will be measured by the change in the standard score. A higher composite score indicates higher overall adaptive behavior ability.</description>
