    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of chronic treatment with&#xD;
      β1-adrenergic antagonist on the NOL index variation, the heart rate variation and the mean&#xD;
      blood pressure variation after a standardized noxious stimulus.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the NOL values variations obtained in response to a&#xD;
      standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia in a group of patients chronically&#xD;
      treated with β1-adrenergic antagonists, will be similar to the NOL values variations&#xD;
      previously obtained in response to a similar standardized noxious stimulus and previously&#xD;
      reported in a group of patients without any β1-adrenergic antagonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: The Pain Monitoring Device (PMD200TM) monitor (Medasense Biometrics Ltd., Ramat&#xD;
      Gan, Israel) uses the Nociception Level (NOL) index, a multiple parameter-derived index that&#xD;
      has recently shown a good sensitivity and specificity to detect noxious stimuli. The NOL&#xD;
      index variations of the latest version of the PMD200TM has shown better sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity to detect standardized noxious stimulus than heart rate or blood pressure&#xD;
      variation in a population without any β1-adrenergic antagonist treatment. β1-adrenergic&#xD;
      antagonist treatment was so far a limitation to the use of the NOL index. Indeed,&#xD;
      β1-adrenergic antagonists have a depressive action on the heart rate, including limitation of&#xD;
      the heart rate variability after a noxious stimulus. Because heart rate and its variability&#xD;
      are parameters which are part of the parameters combined to build the NOL index, chronic&#xD;
      treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonist could alter the ability of the NOL index to detect&#xD;
      noxious stimulus. However, Edry R. (Edry R, 2017) assessed the impact of chronic treatment&#xD;
      with β1-adrenergic antagonist on NOL index variation after noxious stimuli in a pilot study&#xD;
      (9 patients under chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonist and under general&#xD;
      anesthesia) and didn't show any influence of this treatment on the NOL index variation. But&#xD;
      this study was not large enough and did not fully answered the question whether chronic&#xD;
      treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonist might impact NOL ability to detect precise and&#xD;
      standardized stimulus and to compare the results to those in patients without this type of&#xD;
      chronic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the NOL variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with&#xD;
      β1-adrenergic antagonists submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome [1] To explore the heart rate variation and the mean blood pressure&#xD;
      variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonists&#xD;
      submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome [2] To compare the heart rate variation and the mean blood pressure&#xD;
      variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonists&#xD;
      submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia to a control group of&#xD;
      patients without any β1-adrenergic antagonist chronic treatment; results gathered from a&#xD;
      previous study (Renaud-Roy E, 2019), exposed to the same noxious stimulus and under the same&#xD;
      anesthesia conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome [3] To explore the ability of the NOL index, the heart rate and the mean&#xD;
      blood pressure to discriminate between noxious and non-noxious states in a group of patients&#xD;
      with β1-adrenergic antagonist chronic treatment submitted to standardized noxious stimulus&#xD;
      under general anesthesia. To determine sensitivity and specificity (ROC curve and AUC of ROC)&#xD;
      for each parameter: HR, MAP, NOL index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome [4] To evaluate the NOL index, the heart rate and the mean blood pressure&#xD;
      variations after tracheal intubation in patients with β1-adrenergic antagonist chronic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for any types of surgery and who have been&#xD;
      chronically treated with β1-adrenergic antagonists for at least three months prior to surgery&#xD;
      will be enrolled to reach a total of patients with full analysis of data of n=25. All&#xD;
      patients will be consented prior to the surgery. Induction of anesthesia will be standardized&#xD;
      for all patients and based on their adjusted body weight calculated before induction, with:&#xD;
      IV midazolam (0.02mg/kg), IV propofol (1.5-2mg.kg-1), IV remifentanil (1mcg.kg-1 followed by&#xD;
      a continuous infusion of 0.05 µg.kg-1.min-1), IV rocuronium (0.6 to 1mg.kg-1). Depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia with desflurane will be maintained and monitored with the BIS index kept between&#xD;
      40 and 60. Intubation will be performed 3 minutes after the intravenous administration of the&#xD;
      propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium boluses. The end of the bolus of remifentanil (given&#xD;
      1mcg/kg; adjusted body weight) will be the start of the 3 min period to wait before&#xD;
      proceeding with the tracheal intubation. Three minutes after intubation, the remifentanil&#xD;
      infusion will be decreased to 0.005 µg.kg-1.min-1 to reduce the risk of developing&#xD;
      hypotensive events and to prepare the patient for the standardized noxious stimulus of the&#xD;
      study protocol realized under very low doses of opioids under desflurane hypnosis with BIS&#xD;
      40-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 10 min after the post-intubation decrease of the remifentanil infusion rate, the OR&#xD;
      team will stop any physical contact/stimulation of the patient allowing at least a 3-minutes&#xD;
      rest period under stable anesthesia. Baseline mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart&#xD;
      rate (HR) will be defined for the rest of the study as the mean of 3 measures in the 3&#xD;
      minutes during this &quot;no pain - no touching&quot; evaluation period to get baselines values of all&#xD;
      the study parameters. If necessary, phenylephrine will be given to keep a MAP &gt; 65 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, the standardized electrical (tetanic) stimulation will be applied on the area&#xD;
      of the ulnar nerve at the wrist level, at a frequency of 100 Hz and a current of 70 mA for a&#xD;
      duration of 30 seconds, followed by 3 minutes of observation period without any other&#xD;
      stimulation of the patient by the anesthesia or the surgical team (EZstimII, Model ES400,&#xD;
      Life-Tech, Stafford, Tx, USA). At the end of the observation period, the study is&#xD;
      discontinued and the anesthesia will be conducted at the discretion of the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      in charge of the patient.&#xD;
