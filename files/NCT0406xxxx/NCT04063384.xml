  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect up to 60% of individuals with bipolar disorder during&#xD;
      their lifetime-a rate 3 to 5 times higher than what occurs in the general population. The&#xD;
      mechanisms that contribute to elevated rates of comorbidity are not known. Early&#xD;
      identification in individuals with bipolar disorder who are at risk for AUDs could inform&#xD;
      novel intervention strategies and improve life-long outcomes. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      protocol is to use alcohol administration procedures and functional MRI techniques to&#xD;
      investigate subjective response to alcohol, compared to placebo, and relationship with&#xD;
      functional responses of, and connectivity among, brain regions in ventral prefrontal&#xD;
      emotional networks in young adults with bipolar disorder and healthy comparison young adults.&#xD;
      Baseline clinical and structural MRI assessments will be completed in 30 bipolar and 30&#xD;
      healthy young adults (21-26 years of age, 50% women). Then, following standard beverage&#xD;
      administration procedures, participants will complete within-person, counter-balanced, fMRI&#xD;
      scans and complete measures of subjective response to alcohol while under the influence of&#xD;
      alcohol or placebo. Specifically, individual differences in the experience of stimulating,&#xD;
      sedative, and anxiolytic effects of alcohol (measured with self-report surveys) and&#xD;
      individual differences in neural responses to alcohol within ventral prefrontal emotional&#xD;
      networks will be investigated and differences in bipolar disorder compared to healthy&#xD;
      participants assessed. Functional MRI scans during a continuous performance task with&#xD;
      emotional and neutral distractors (CPT-END) and at rest will be collected while under the&#xD;
      influence of alcohol and placebo and compared. Experience of stimulating, sedative, and&#xD;
      anxiolytic effects of alcohol from self-report survey data and neural responses to emotional&#xD;
      stimuli while under the influence of alcohol compared to placebo will be the primary data&#xD;
      outcomes assessed. Additionally, associations between subjective and neural response to&#xD;
      alcohol and drinking patterns will be explored (secondary outcomes). The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      the study will be after completion of both alcohol and placebo beverage conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 bipolar and healthy comparison subjects (n=30 per group, 21-26 years of age,&#xD;
      50% women, with no history of a moderate/severe AUD) will be recruited from the greater&#xD;
      Austin area. Once recruited and enrolled, subjects will undergo detailed structured clinical&#xD;
      evaluations to verify inclusion and exclusion criteria, comprehensive assessment of alcohol&#xD;
      and other drug use history, and cognitive testing, followed by structural MRI assessments.&#xD;
      Following standard beverage administration procedures, they will then complete measures of&#xD;
      subjective response to alcohol and fMRI scans while under the influence of alcohol or a&#xD;
      placebo condition (counter-balanced). For each participant the first beverage session&#xD;
      assignment (whether the participant is given alcohol or the placebo beverage first) will be&#xD;
      randomized. Alcohol and placebo sessions will occur within 3 days of each other. FMRI&#xD;
      assessments will include a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distractors&#xD;
      (CPT-END) and a resting state scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both the alcohol and the placebo beverage conditions, the protocol will be the same. The&#xD;
      beverage administration sessions will occur in a private room at the University of Texas at&#xD;
      Austin in the Imaging Research Center. The table in the testing room will be wiped down with&#xD;
      alcohol prior to the participant's arrival (olfactory cue). Study staff will use an algorithm&#xD;
      to calculate individual alcohol doses based on the participants' age, sex, height, and&#xD;
      weight. Participants fast from food for 4 hours prior to their session. Before beginning&#xD;
      consumption of their beverages, they will eat a weight-adjusted, 1 calorie per pound snack of&#xD;
      pretzels. While participants eat their pretzels, study staff will mix beverages in front of&#xD;
      participants. Vodka and placebo (decarbonated tonic water) will be stored in absolute vodka&#xD;
      bottles, measured out, and combined with mixer in front of participants. Mixed drinks will be&#xD;
      poured into glasses that have been sitting face down with rims soaking in vodka. Prior to&#xD;
      giving the beverage to the participant, all drinks will get an alcohol floater (squirt of&#xD;
      absolute vodka on top of the drink). Participants will be given 20 minutes to orally consume&#xD;
      two beverages (10 minutes per beverage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following oral consumption and a 10 minute absorption period, breathalyzer tests will be&#xD;
      conducted to identify a .06g% ascending limb breath alcohol concentration (BrAC). Self-report&#xD;
      of subjective response to alcohol will be collected and participants will immediately enter&#xD;
      the scanner and complete the fMRI scan (acquisition parameters are identical during alcohol&#xD;
      and placebo conditions). BrAC will be tracked after the MRI scan and subjective response to&#xD;
      alcohol collected again at peak BrAC and at descending BrAC of .06g%. Consistent with NIAAA&#xD;
      guidelines for human alcohol studies, BrAC readings will continue every 30 minutes until&#xD;
      participants are below 0.04% at which time they will be escorted home. During the placebo&#xD;
      condition, participants will be given false BrAC readings. False BrAC readings given to&#xD;
      participants during the placebo session will be based on the average BrACs we record during&#xD;
      the alcohol sessions. The average time participants stay in the laboratory will be the same&#xD;
      for the placebo and alcohol beverage conditions. Participants are debriefed after completing&#xD;
      all sessions and the need for deception to ensure the placebo-controlled alcohol session will&#xD;
      be explained.&#xD;
