      Develop a NIRSIT testing protocol that can be administered in the diagnostic setting and&#xD;
      reliably distinguishes the symptoms and severity of depression, with the help of repeated&#xD;
      measure (up to five visits per subject) comparison of patients being treated for Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder with control, non-depressed subjects.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The history of utilizing the near infrared (NIR) spectrum (650-1000nm) in cognitive studies&#xD;
      is chronicled in a recent review. Taking advantage of the facts that human tissue is&#xD;
      relatively transparent to NIR and hemoglobin absorbs those wavelengths of light, in 1977,&#xD;
      Jobsis developed a non-invasive device able to detect oxygenation changes in the brain. He&#xD;
      later used this technique to study cerebral oxygenation in new born infants. The first&#xD;
      publications describing NIRS results began to appear in the early 1990s, and in 2000, the&#xD;
      first commercially available device was marketed. In 2009, Hitachi released the first battery&#xD;
      operated wireless/ wearable device. In the 3 years preceding this 2012 review, ~400 articles&#xD;
      utilizing this technology have been published in the fields of neurology (Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, dementia, depression, epilepsy, Parkinson's, rehabilitation, stroke), psychiatry&#xD;
      (anxiety, substance abuse, schizophrenia), education (attention, comprehension, reasoning)&#xD;
      and basic research (pain, sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a non-invasive measurement of frontal lobe blood&#xD;
      flow and saturation over time. The NIRSIT device has ninety-six (96) two color infrared&#xD;
      lasers and paired photodiodes which record oxygen saturation to a depth of 2 cm from the&#xD;
      frontal cortex of humans. NIRSIT provides a measurement of blood saturation from over 200&#xD;
      prefrontal regions providing high spatial resolution at a scan rate of 32 Hz providing high&#xD;
      temporal resolution. NIRSIT can provide real-time cognitive studies which can discriminate&#xD;
      cognitive workload, concentration, and emotional stress and anxiety. NIRS provides 200&#xD;
      measurements of oxy, deoxy, total hemoglobin, and heart rate 32 times per second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Significant Risk Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinical decisions will be made based on the data acquired for this study. The NIRSIT data&#xD;
      is collected solely for the study. The NIRSIT data will not be used for any clinical decision&#xD;
      making and therefore the study qualifies for NSR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS has been studied in Japan since 20001. The OBE Lab NIRSIT device has more sensors than&#xD;
      the Hitachi ETG-4000, which has US 510K clearance (K042501) since Oct 12 2004 with an&#xD;
      intended use of the measurement of relative levels of cerebral deoxyhemoglobin and&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin, but has a similar safety profile. The OBE Lab NIRSIT device has a higher&#xD;
      sensor count (96), higher number of assessed voxels (200), higher temporal resolution (30&#xD;
      Hz), but similar safety profile to the Hitachi ETG-4000. The Hitachi ETG-4000 would be the&#xD;
      predicate device for FDA 510K clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of NIRSIT testing, depressive symptoms of subjects will be measured using the&#xD;
      Hamilton B Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Beck Depression Index (BDI) and Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and a cognitive assessment (Mini International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      interview) will be administered prior to NIRSIT testing. We will take front and side photos&#xD;
      of subjects to document how the device was placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive tasks will include cartoon humor reaction test, where subjects will be shown a&#xD;
      series of humorous cartoons and verbal fluency task, where they will be asked to say words&#xD;
      that begin with certain letters. We will make an audio recording of the words they say, to&#xD;
      validate the number of correct words.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing sessions will be repeated up to five times depending on the amount of variability&#xD;
      when compared to previous sessions with that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls will be selected to reflect the age distribution of patients treated at our&#xD;
      institution for MDD in the past two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatry collaborators will be informed of survey response that indicates possible suicide&#xD;
      ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Control Group - 30 volunteers Control subjects will be SFVAMC patients, staff or&#xD;
      general public who self-indicate that they are not depressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Group - 60 patients with Major Depressive Disorder MDD patient group will also&#xD;
      include those whose initial depressive symptoms were sufficiently severe such that they and&#xD;
      their treating physician have decided that they may benefit from treatments such as&#xD;
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or ketamine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: For the healthy controls, a flyer describing the study will be posted outside&#xD;
      the Anesthesia Business Office, at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. One of the study&#xD;
      clinical attendings will administer the MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview)&#xD;
      test to ensure that the controls do not have any conditions that would exclude them from&#xD;
      participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified and approached by study Psychiatrists and asked if they would&#xD;
      like to participate in the study. They will be given a flyer that explains the study, to&#xD;
      improve the consent process. After patients have been screened and have signed the informed&#xD;
      consent form to participate in the study, they will be enrolled in the study. One of the&#xD;
      study psychiatrists will administer the MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview)&#xD;
      test to ensure that the patients do not have any conditions that would exclude them from&#xD;
      participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained by the attending psychiatrist, the principal or&#xD;
      coinvestigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: Collaborators and colleagues will evaluate the tasks that are available&#xD;
      in the NIRSIT software and select which produce the highest readouts and evaluate which&#xD;
      channels detect changes prior to enrolling any subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal component analysis will be used to determine which channels to focus examination.&#xD;
      Previous examinations focused on the bilateral frontopolar area (Broadmann areas [BA] 9 and&#xD;
      46), ventro-lateral (BA 44, 45, 47) and fronto-polar (BA 10)5,10,11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhythmic signals that indicate noise artifacts and body movement artifacts will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean changes in blood flow will be calculated using linear fit between the final 10 s of the&#xD;
      pre-task period and the final 5 s of the post-task period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test-retest intra-class correlation will be performed at the single-subject level to evaluate&#xD;
      the reproducibility of results and indicate whether further testing is indicated for controls&#xD;
      and MDD patients during their treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANOVA and the F statistic will be used to compare the degree of changes across groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ex-Gaussian modeling will be used to compare response times and misses across severity of&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be adjusted for differences in age, the presence of post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD), substance abuse (drugs or alcohol), suicide history, anxiety, comorbidities&#xD;
      including heart, liver or kidney disease, diabetes, cancer and medications including&#xD;
      anti-psychotics, antidepressants, anti-anxiety and pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of privacy. All clinical studies have some risk for loss of privacy. Medical and&#xD;
           psychiatric records are reviewed by study staff and recorded for research purposes. All&#xD;
           records will be stored as encrypted files or in locked storage to reduce risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIRSIT device uses infrared light. The FDA has concluded that the light emitted by the&#xD;
           device is harmless and poses non-significant risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimizing Risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All study records are stored in locked file cabinets in locked offices. The risk of loss&#xD;
           of study related materials is small.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NIRSIT and depression inventory testing will be done in a manner that is sensitive to&#xD;
           patient needs and minimizes possible embarrassment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients will be screened for suicidality at each screening visit. Patients who indicate&#xD;
           on the BDI or PHQ-9 survey they have thoughts that they would be better off dead or&#xD;
           hurting themselves will be brought to the attention of the treating physician. The&#xD;
           treating physician will be filling in the HAM-D and will therefore, be investigating&#xD;
           suicidal intention as part of standard of care, using a progress note to indicate any&#xD;
           further action needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRSIT and depression inventory testing pose no more than minimal risk to subjects. This&#xD;
      study may show that the device and testing protocol are able to improve the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of depression diagnostics and thereby make possible more specific treatments and&#xD;
      therapy improve the care of future patients with depression.&#xD;
