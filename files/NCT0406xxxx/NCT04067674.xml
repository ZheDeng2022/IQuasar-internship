  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic syndromes are a major although largely under-recognized health care problem and&#xD;
      represent the first cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICU). While it has long been&#xD;
      known that sepsis deeply perturbs immune homeostasis by inducing a tremendous systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response, novel findings indicate that sepsis indeed initiates a more complex&#xD;
      immune response that varies over time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro- and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a resultant, after a short pro-inflammatory phase, septic&#xD;
      patients enter a stage of protracted immunosuppression. This is illustrated in those patients&#xD;
      by reactivation of dormant viruses (cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)) or&#xD;
      infections due to pathogens, including fungi, which are normally pathogenic solely in&#xD;
      immunocompromised hosts. These alterations might be directly responsible for worsening&#xD;
      outcome in patients who survived initial resuscitation as nearly all immune functions are&#xD;
      deeply compromised. New promising therapeutic strategies are currently emerging from those&#xD;
      recent findings such as adjunctive immunostimulation for the most immunosuppressed patients.&#xD;
      The prerequisite for immunostimulation administration (Interferon gama (IFNg), Granulocyte&#xD;
      Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 7 (IL-7)) however relies on&#xD;
      clinicians' capacity to identify patients who could benefit the most from these&#xD;
      immunoadjuvant therapies, as there is no clinical sign of immune dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the main objectives of IMMUNOSEPSIS 4 study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to identify the best biomarkers for sepsis-induced immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate ex vivo candidate treatments which could rejuvenate immune functions after&#xD;
           septic shock&#xD;
