    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional, observational study of EBC H2O2 levels, as measured by a novel device,&#xD;
      'Inflammacheck™', and other markers of disease severity and symptom control in patients with&#xD;
      Asthma and COPD and volunteers with no history of lung disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current tools for assessing airway inflammation and oxidative stress, such as fibre-optic&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with bronchial wall biopsy and bronchial fluid lavage, are mostly invasive&#xD;
      procedures that are not suitable for routine clinical practice or regular repeat sampling.&#xD;
      Sample analysis requires a series of laboratory measurements and results can take over 24&#xD;
      hours to become available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induced sputum analysis is a semi-invasive means of assessing airway inflammation but is not&#xD;
      always well tolerated by patients and again is not suitable for repeat sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive methods of measuring airway inflammation assess exhaled gases. Fractional&#xD;
      exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) measures eosinophilic airway inflammation. However, this test&#xD;
      requires controlled exhalation for at least 6 seconds, making the test unsuitable for&#xD;
      patients with impaired lung function, who are often not able to sustain this length of&#xD;
      breath. Furthermore FeNO does not provide information about neutrophilic airway inflammation,&#xD;
      a recognised component of steroid insensitive asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary&#xD;
      Disease (COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, measurement of Exhaled Breath Condensate Hydrogen Peroxide (EBC H2O2) is&#xD;
      performed during normal tidal breathing, and is well tolerated even in patients with severe&#xD;
      airways obstruction and those unable to perform a consistent controlled exhalation. It is&#xD;
      also not limited to inflammatory cell specific inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the measurement of EBC H2O2 has been used as a research tool only, due to the&#xD;
      complex multiple procedural steps required to deliver a result from the collected exhaled&#xD;
      breath. Exhalation Technology Ltd. have now developed a novel, handheld device&#xD;
      (Inflammacheck™) which can produce an immediate measurement of EBC H2O2 levels at the&#xD;
      patients side. By detecting EBC H2O2 levels immediately, Inflammacheck™ could tell clinicians&#xD;
      and patients the current level of global airway inflammation in a simple, effort independent&#xD;
      manner. This could be used by clinicians to diagnose asthma and COPD, to determine a&#xD;
      patient's phenotype and to guide correct and personalised treatment. It could also measure&#xD;
      increased levels of airway inflammation that may indicate an exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Inflammacheck™' device now requires a study in a clinical setting to determine whether&#xD;
      it can differentiate asthma and COPD from healthy, whether it can distinguish mild from&#xD;
      severe disease and whether it can detect an acute exacerbation of these chronic respiratory&#xD;
      conditions. The acceptability and ease of use of the device also needs to be assessed for&#xD;
      both patients and clinicians.&#xD;

        Three populations of adult patients (all aged ≥18yrs) will be invited to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Asthma patients (n=50, 25 mild, 25 severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. COPD patients (n=50, 25 mild - moderate, 25 severe - very severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Comparator group (n=50) - Volunteers with no previous history of lung disease (our&#xD;
             'healthy' volunteers). These healthy volunteers will be recruited from the hospital&#xD;
             staff. This will be facilitated by the hospital and research communications teams.&#xD;
             Healthcare Professionals, who have assisted patients performing 'Inflammacheck™',&#xD;
             alongside the standard respiratory tests of spirometry and FeNO, will be invited to&#xD;
             participate in an experience outcome questionnaire at the end of the study.&#xD;
