    <textblock>
      fixation of FGG with sutures alone is not sufficient,we use cyanoacrylate beside sutures for&#xD;
      fixation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate zone of attached mucosa around implants, gingival recession, inadequate ridge&#xD;
      width or height despite there is enouph bone for implant placement are problems that face&#xD;
      periodontists and can be treated by soft tissue graft Studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      importance of the tissues stability for the first hours when support is provided by&#xD;
      underlying osseous or dental structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement of the graft during mastication and phonation will disturb healing procedures. Most&#xD;
      of the clinicians prefer a protective device during the healing phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transitional dentures are not stable themselves, and hence are not suitable for stabilizing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circummandibular wiring and impact posts are seemingly very aggressive for patients and need&#xD;
      extra clinical practices, skills, and equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies proved that the maximum tissue shrinkage (approximately 20%-40%) occurs during the&#xD;
      first 3 months post operation and will proceed until 12 postsurgical months with a&#xD;
      persistent, significantly lower rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we give more stabilization for free gingival grafts by using cyanoacrylate&#xD;
      tissue adhesive beside sutures Its autogenous character, maintenance of keratinization,&#xD;
      predictability, ease of technique tlead CTG to be accepted as the golden standard to increase&#xD;
      attached gingival dimensions Cyanoacrylate is a simple, inexpensive haemostatic and&#xD;
      biocompatible material It is used as tissue adhesives in paediatric surgery general surgery&#xD;
      and also dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it has been applied intraorally with different purposes such as periodontal dressing,for&#xD;
      sealing sinus membrane perforations for stabilizing bone fragments during fracture fixation,&#xD;
      and in closing peripheral nerve anastomosis it seems promising in the intraoral field due to&#xD;
      their strong sealing, bacteriostatic, and hemostatic properties. Multiple studies examined&#xD;
      the use of cyanoacrylate glues as an alternative to suturing intraoral and extraoral wounds&#xD;
      concluding that cyanoacrylates are faster, more reliable ,and less painful and cause better&#xD;
      hemostasis .&#xD;
