  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 trial consisting of a 2-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized&#xD;
      phase (Part 1) followed by a single-arm open-label phase (Part 2) to demonstrate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of lixivaptan in participants with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&#xD;
      (ADPKD). Part 1 of the trial is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of lixivaptan in slowing&#xD;
      the decline in renal function as measured by the difference in estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (eGFR) between the lixivaptan-treated and placebo-treated participants. Part&#xD;
      2 of the study is designed to provide confirmation of the durability of this effect.&#xD;
      Additionally, both parts of the study will contribute to understanding the safety of&#xD;
      lixivaptan, particularly any effects on liver chemistry tests.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1: Approximately 2000 participants with ADPKD will be screened in order to qualify the&#xD;
      1200 individuals who will then be randomized to receive lixivaptan or placebo. Each&#xD;
      participant has a 2/3 chance of receiving lixivaptan and a 1/3 chance of receiving placebo.&#xD;
      After meeting entry criteria during screening, participants will begin receiving treatment&#xD;
      with study drug. At some point during Part 1, all participants will receive placebo and all&#xD;
      participants will receive lixivaptan. The dose will be adjusted to the highest level that is&#xD;
      tolerated and that dose will be continued for the rest of Part 1. Similarly, at some point&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to lixivaptan or placebo. Throughout Part 1 the study drug&#xD;
      will look identical regardless of whether it is placebo or lixivaptan. After 58-59 weeks, the&#xD;
      administration of study drug will be paused, and final eGFR assessments for Part 1 will be&#xD;
      obtained during 3 follow-up visits starting over a period of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: All participants entering Part 1 will continue into Part 2 of the study and be&#xD;
      treated with the active drug, lixivaptan, for an additional 54-56 weeks unless study drug was&#xD;
      previously discontinued for a safety reason or a participant withdraws consent. At the end of&#xD;
      that time, study drug will be discontinued, and final eGFR assessments for Part 2 will be&#xD;
      obtained during 3 follow-up visits starting over a period of 28 days.&#xD;
