    <textblock>
      The research study is being conducted to test how a specialized type of Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET/CT) scan could potentially be useful in diagnosing or monitoring treatment in&#xD;
      people with Parkinson's disease. If the subject decide to be in this study he/she will have a&#xD;
      PET/CT scans using an imaging drug called 18F-NOS which will be used to measure inflammation&#xD;
      in the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test whether it is possible to measure inflammation in&#xD;
      subject's brain using an imaging scan called Positron Emission Tomography / Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (PET/CT). There are two groups of people who will participate in this study, a&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) group and a Control group Both groups will have imaging with a&#xD;
      radioactive drug called 18F-NOS which is an experimental radioactive drug used in PET/CT&#xD;
      imaging to measure inflammation in the brain. 18F-NOS has not yet been approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use except in a research study. The use 18F-NOS in this&#xD;
      study is allowed under an Investigational New Drug Application approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subject agree to participate in this study, she/ he will undergo one experimental 18F-NOS&#xD;
      PET/CT scan. During the scan, PET/CT images will be taken of subject head in order to capture&#xD;
      pictures of their brain. The imaging procedures will be explained to subject in more detail&#xD;
      below. Blood samples will be taken at various time points to measure the concentration of the&#xD;
      imaging drug in your blood during the scan and a blood sample will be collected to measure&#xD;
      specialized inflammation markers in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator hopes to compare the PET/CT scans for the two groups to see if there are&#xD;
      differences between Parkinson patients and Controls. Investigator will also compare the&#xD;
      results with other informationgathered about subject during their participation, including&#xD;
      brain MRI and inflammation markers.&#xD;
