  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are the most common brain tumors in children, and a subset of these&#xD;
      tumors are treated definitively with focal radiation therapy (RT). These patients often&#xD;
      survive for many years after receiving RT and experience late deficits in memory. Verbal&#xD;
      recall is an important measure of memory and is associated with other important functional&#xD;
      outcomes, such as problem-solving, independence of every-day functioning, and quality of&#xD;
      life. Decline in memory, as measured by verbal recall, is associated with RT dose to the&#xD;
      hippocampi. Therefore, this phase II study investigates the feasibility of reducing RT doses&#xD;
      to the hippocampi (i.e., hippocampal avoidance [HA]) by using proton therapy for midline or&#xD;
      suprasellar LGGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of HA with proton therapy in suprasellar or midline LGGs.&#xD;
           Feasibility will be established if 70% of plans meet the first or second dose&#xD;
           constraints shown below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. First priority RT dose constraints for bilateral hippocampi: volume receiving 40&#xD;
                CGE (V40CGE) ≤ 25%, dose to 100% of Hippocampus (D100%) ≤ 5CGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Second priority RT dose constraints for bilateral hippocampi: V40CGE ≤ 35%, D100% ≤&#xD;
                10 CGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the 3-year event-free-survival (EFS) for LGGs treated with HA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the change in California Verbal Learning Test short-term delay (CVLT-SD)&#xD;
           from baseline to 3 years and from baseline to 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare CVLT-SD and Cogstate neurocognitive scores in patients with proton therapy&#xD;
           plans that: (1) meet first priority RT dose constraints, (2) meet second priority RT&#xD;
           dose constraints but not first priority RT dose constraints, and (3) that did not meet&#xD;
           either first or second RT priority dose constraints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the change in overall cognitive performance from baseline to 3 years and&#xD;
           from baseline to 5 years with an age appropriate battery, including gold standard&#xD;
           measures shown in the published studies to be sensitive to attention, memory processing&#xD;
           speed and executive function that will afford comparison to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize longitudinal changes in connection strength within brain networks in the&#xD;
           first 3 years after proton therapy and to investigate associations between these changes&#xD;
           and neurocognitive performance with focus on the hippocampi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate the distribution and change in L-methyl-11C-methionine positron emission&#xD;
           tomography (MET-PET) uptake to tumor progression and from baseline to 3 years and to&#xD;
           investigate whether cases of pseudoprogression exhibit a differential pattern of uptake&#xD;
           and distribution compared to cases of true progression after controlling for histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of BRAF alteration, tumor histology and tumor location on PFS&#xD;
           and OS in a prospective cohort of patients treated in a homogenous manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether the methylation profiles of LGGs differ by tumor location&#xD;
           (thalamic/midbrain vs. hypothalamic/optic pathway vs. others) and histologies (pilocytic&#xD;
           astrocytoma vs. diffuse astrocytoma vs. others), which, in conjunction with specific&#xD;
           genetic alterations, may stratify patients into different subgroups and highlight&#xD;
           different therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To record longitudinal measures of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma and correlate&#xD;
           these measures with radiographic evidence of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)/frozen tumors and whole blood from&#xD;
           subjects for subsequent biology studies not currently defined in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify and characterize tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and to characterize&#xD;
           the epigenetics of T cells and the T cell receptor repertoire within the tumor&#xD;
           microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of endocrine deficiencies, vision loss, hearing&#xD;
           loss and vasculopathy after proton therapy and compare these data to those after photon&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive HA proton therapy to 52.2 CGE or 54 CGE in 29 or 30 fractions,&#xD;
      depending on tumor location. Patients will receive weekly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scans during the course of proton therapy to monitor changes in solid tumor or cystic volume.&#xD;
      Such changes may prompt adaptive therapy to improve coverage or minimize the RT dose to&#xD;
      healthy structures. Neurocognitive outcomes, sensitive to measures of memory and learning,&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline and continue to 5 years post therapy. Disease evaluation will&#xD;
      be monitored with brain MRI.&#xD;
