  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how different pre-operative therapeutic approaches&#xD;
      affect quad strength and patient satisfaction after total knee replacements. There are three&#xD;
      treatments groups: standard physical therapy protocol, the use of CyMedica NMES garments, and&#xD;
      a telemedical home therapy program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital and&#xD;
      meet all eligibility criteria will be informed about the study and asked if they would like&#xD;
      to participate. The research assistant (RA) will screen upcoming surgeries and call all&#xD;
      qualifying patients to inform them of the study. Those who show interest will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to discuss with both the RA and Principal Investigator (PI). Upon agreement, the&#xD;
      patient's consent will be obtained and they will be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      treatment groups using a computer-generated randomization.&#xD;

    <description>Use only iGetBetter for the 3 months preceding surgery. After surgery, you will be given a new, Post-Op program to use for 2-3 months.

    <description>You will use iGetBetter starting 3 months out from surgery. You will receive CyMedica's electrical-stimulation garment during the preoperative appointment. In addition to iGetBetter, you will wear the conductive garment two times each day for the last 3 weeks before surgery. After surgery, for the first 3 weeks you will only use the conductive garment, and will not use iGetBetter. After those 3 weeks, you will receive outpatient physical therapy in addition to wearing the brace, approximately twice per week for the next 6-8 weeks. You will not need to return the brace after this time is up, and you may keep the brace, if you so choose, at no cost.</description>

    <description>All the patients in Group 2 will be given the CyMedica Orthopedics e-vive system 3 weeks before the surgery. The patients will begin using the unit after their first pre-intervention measurements are taken.&#xD;
Patients will be instructed to apply the e-vive NMES Strength therapy twice a day, 5 days a week. The NMES Strength program is 20 minutes in length. Treatment intensity (adjustable from 1 to 100 in NMES programs) is required to be set at the highest tolerable limit for the patients.&#xD;
Stimulation from the garment will have the following parameters: frequency of 50 Hz; pulse duration of 5 ms; time on: 12.8 seconds; and time off: 10 seconds. The total contraction time in a 20-minute treatment will be 11 minutes. The waveform will be pulsed and asymmetrical.</description>
