      # Background and Rationale Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare subtype of lymphoma,&#xD;
      accounting for about 3-6% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is clinically prevalent in the&#xD;
      elderly and men, commonly with gastrointestinal tract involvement. Since about 80% of&#xD;
      patients present with advanced stage disease at diagnosis, the prognosis is very poor. Mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma is less frequent in Korean than in Western countries, accounting for about 2%&#xD;
      of all non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases, with very poor treatment outcome as Western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Korea, the clinical information about patients with MCL is very scarce so far and does not&#xD;
      reflect recent treatment patterns. Firstly, the incidence in Korea is relatively lower than&#xD;
      that in Western countries, with only about 100 patients a year. Secondly, due to substandard&#xD;
      national health insurance regulations in Korea, it was not until recently that ibrutinib for&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory MCL was approved for coverage by the National Health Insurance. In this&#xD;
      context, the study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory MCL in Korea.&#xD;
