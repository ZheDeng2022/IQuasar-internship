      Metformin, a traditional antidiabetic medication, exerts glucose lowering effects by&#xD;
      activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical enzyme involved in the lipid and&#xD;
      glucose metabolism. In addition to the antidiabetic effect, metformin has been shown to&#xD;
      inhibit Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation (LPS)-induced inflammation by suppress NF-κB&#xD;
      production, which is also regulated by AMPK. These regulatory effects of AMPK on the&#xD;
      inflammation, immune and fibroblast-like synovial cells have prompted the investigation on&#xD;
      the effects of metformin on rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown&#xD;
      etiology. It is characterized by polyarthritis and systemic inflammation. The inflammation in&#xD;
      the hyperplastic synovium can destruct the structure of affected joints. Although the exact&#xD;
      molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RA remains unknown, it is suggested that T&#xD;
      helper cell (Th) 17 plays a central role. Interleukin (IL)-17, mostly secreted by Th17, has&#xD;
      synergistic effects with tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-α), IL-1β and IL-6 in cases of RA.&#xD;
      Metformin, a traditional antidiabetic medication, exerts glucose lowering effects by&#xD;
      activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical enzyme involved in the lipid and&#xD;
      glucose metabolism. In addition to the antidiabetic effect, metformin has been shown to&#xD;
      inhibit Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation (LPS)-induced inflammation by suppress NF-κB&#xD;
      production, which is also regulated by AMPK . In addition, metformin activated AMPK may&#xD;
      inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which then regulate the differentiation of T&#xD;
      cells in vitro and in vivo. In particular, AMPK has been reported to be associated with the&#xD;
      inhibition of TH17 cells through suppressing the phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream&#xD;
      signal transducers, suggesting the therapeutic potential of AMPK agonists. Besides the&#xD;
      imbalance between Th17 cells and Treg cells is responsible for the chronic inflammation in&#xD;
      RA, synovium hyperplasia also plays a central role in the joint destruction. It has been&#xD;
      reported that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, is able to significantly reduce fibroblastlike&#xD;
      synovial cell invasion in RA via suppressing mTOR signaling pathway. These regulatory effects&#xD;
      of AMPK on the inflammation, immune and fibroblast-like synovial cells have prompted the&#xD;
      investigation on the effects of metformin on rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
