      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of pain on long-term memory and&#xD;
      conditioned physiologic responses in the presence and absence of distinct intravenous&#xD;
      anesthetics. Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be used to identify the neural&#xD;
      correlates of these phenomena The study will occur over 5 visits and involves no long-term&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;

      Purpose: Sedative-hypnotic and analgesic agents (termed &quot;anesthetics&quot;) are routinely used&#xD;
      during medical procedures to prevent or ease suffering, suppressing the conscious experience&#xD;
      of pain and its encoding into memory. While overt awareness under general anesthesia is a&#xD;
      rare clinical event, implicit memory may still form. Further, at sub-hypnotic anesthetic&#xD;
      doses, animals show enhanced fear conditioning and humans may have enhanced amygdala&#xD;
      activity. This motivates the investigator's study, as poorly-contextualized aversive memories&#xD;
      are theorized to initiate anxiety-spectrum disorders, which may explain the high incidence of&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder after anesthetic awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: How anesthetics facilitate or inhibit poorly-contextualized aversive memories is&#xD;
      incompletely understood, with little mechanistic work done in human subjects. Thus, there is&#xD;
      a critical need to understand how anesthetics modulate the memory and threat response systems&#xD;
      during painful stimulation. The overall scientific objective is to determine the&#xD;
      memory-modulating effects of propofol, dexmedetomidine, and fentanyl in the context of&#xD;
      periodic painful stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine how behavioral and physiologic measures of memory are modulated by pain and&#xD;
      the individual effects of three pharmacologically distinct drugs: propofol, dexmedetomidine,&#xD;
      and fentanyl. Hypotheses: Based on previous results, 1a) explicit memory will be&#xD;
      significantly reduced by propofol and dexmedetomidine, but only modestly by fentanyl.&#xD;
      Consistent with my preliminary data, 1b) priming effects will be seen for pain-paired words&#xD;
      under all drugs. Electrodermal activity changes still occur with opioids and propofol, thus&#xD;
      1c) pain-related physiologic responses will persist with these two drugs but be blunted by&#xD;
      the anti-adrenergic effect of dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the brain structures differentially engaged in memory encoding under pain&#xD;
      and drug conditions. Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity for&#xD;
      behavioral measures of explicit or implicit memory will be determined, comparing pain-paired&#xD;
      vs non-pain items across drug and no-drug datasets. Functional connectivity (FC) MRI (fcMRI)&#xD;
      will be compared between task and drug conditions. The entire brain will be explored, but&#xD;
      predictions for key structures follow. Hypotheses: 2a) Hippocampal activity, will be blunted&#xD;
      by propofol and dexmedetomidine, while fentanyl will have minimal effect. 2b) Amygdala&#xD;
      activity, responsible for physiologic responses, will parallel the predictions in 1c across&#xD;
      drug and pain conditions. 2c) Insula activity will be greater for pain-paired items, and this&#xD;
      will be attenuated by fentanyl &gt; dexmedetomidine &gt; propofol, corresponding to their&#xD;
      anticipated analgesic effect. 2d) Pain has been shown to affect fcMRI during a cognitive&#xD;
      task, and thus FC between the key regions in 2a-c will be reduced by all three drugs, in&#xD;
      characteristic patterns.&#xD;

    <description>Recognition memory testing, using the Remember-Know procedure, in which subjects indicate whether they recognize previously experienced experimental items among novel items (not previously in the experiment). This allows calculation of interdependent measures of recollection &amp; familiarity using the signal detection statistic, d'. d' is calculated as the cumulative Gaussian distribution of false positive responses subtracted from the cumulative Gaussian distribution of correctly identified previously-experienced items. d' is on a (theoretically infinite) scale of standard deviation units, with negative values representing performance worse than chance guessing and positive values representing stand deviations of performance above chance.</description>

    <measure>Brain activity in hippocampus and amygdala</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after each experimental item</time_frame>
    <description>Blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) weighted MRI images of the brain will be obtained every 1 second during the drug+pain experimental procedure. Local changes in blood flow, which correlate to increased neuronal activity, can be detected that correlate in time to experimental events. This will allow drug vs. placebo comparisons for brain activity for successful vs unsuccessful memory encoding. The output data will include anatomical localization of brain activity differences, along with the statistical intensity (z-score) of such differences.</description>

    <measure>Heart rate response</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after each experimental item</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate changes (measured by electrocardiogram, EKG) will be determined following experimental stimuli that delivered as part of the experiment. A 1-6 second window of physiologic data will be analyzed for changes in the peak of the EKG response (R-wave), allowing calculation of instantaneous heart rate. Increases in heart rate are well-known to correlate to sympathetic nervous system activity increases.</description>

    <description>Electrodermal activity (galvanic skin) response will be determined following experimental stimuli that delivered as part of the experiment. A 1-6 second window of physiologic data will be analyzed for changes in electrodermal activity, measured from the palm of subjects' hand. this well-established measure indicates sweat gland activity and is correlated to sympathetic nervous system activity increases.</description>
