      The study plans to recruit patients with recurrent miscarriage and detect their niacin,&#xD;
      thiamine, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin D levels in plasma, evaluating if some&#xD;
      lack exists.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dr. Shi Hongjun from West Lake University has confirmed in a mouse model that a decrease in&#xD;
      maternal niacin levels caused by a low niacin diet can lead to stillbirth(HJ Shi, et al.&#xD;
      2017). Due to the lack of a recognized clinical niacin test, it is unclear whether niacin&#xD;
      deficiency is associated with abortion. However, some studies have showed: 1. Nearly&#xD;
      one-third of pregnant women present low niacin level during the first trimester of pregnancy;&#xD;
      2. Insufficient parent niacin intake is positively correlated with the incidence of&#xD;
      congenital heart disease; 3. Vitamin B6 affects niacin metabolism, while maternal B6&#xD;
      deficiency is significantly associated with early abortion. Based on this, the investigators&#xD;
      predict that (1) a certain proportion of recurrent abortion women's niacin levels are lower&#xD;
      than the normal range of women's normal; (2) supplementation of niacin can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      repeated abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many methods for detecting niacin, but so far with no reports for large population.&#xD;
      Dr. Shi Hongjun from West Lake University used the most sensitive QTRAP 6500+ liquid&#xD;
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometer to accurately quantify the concentration of NAD,&#xD;
      nicotinamide, niacin and other niacin metabolites in plasma and have optimized the detection&#xD;
      process, which would be applicated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, studies have shown that pregnant women generally have multiple vitamin&#xD;
      deficiency during pregnancy, including plasma thiamine, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12&#xD;
      and vitamin D. Therefore, in addition to detecting plasma niacin, this study will also&#xD;
      examine the plasma levels of the remaining multivitamins to further explore the impact of&#xD;
      nutritional deficiencies on the probability of recurrent miscarriage.&#xD;
