      This study is a single-group, multi-center and prospective clinical study designed to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of TAF in blocking mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B&#xD;
      virus.Pregnant women whose HBsAg and HBeAg are positive are included in the study.Eligible&#xD;
      hepatitis B pregnant women are given TAF antiviral therapy at 24-28 weeks of gestation to&#xD;
      block mother-to-child transmission and followed up during pregnancy and after delivery.The&#xD;
      study will be initiated with approval by the central ethics committee.Subjects will start&#xD;
      screening after signing the informed consent form. Those who meet the criteria will start&#xD;
      taking TAF (25mg, oral, 1/day) at 24-28 weeks of gestation until one month after delivery.At&#xD;
      that time, chronic hepatitis B carrier will stop taking antiviral therapy, and patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B decide whether to continue the therapy according to the patient's&#xD;
      condition.The babies born are immunized according to the national standard immunization&#xD;
      program,, that is, 100 IU of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and 10 Î¼g/0.5 ml of hepatitis&#xD;
      B vaccine are given within 12 hours after birth. And the same dose of hepatitis B vaccine is&#xD;
      given at 1 month and 6 months of age.&#xD;
