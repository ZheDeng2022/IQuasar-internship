      The Myotubular and Centronuclear Myopathy Patient Registry (also referred to as the 'MTM and&#xD;
      CNM Registry') is an international, patient-reported database specific to these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More details and online registration are available at www.mtmcnmregistry.org.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Myotubular and Centronuclear Myopathy (MTM &amp; CNM) Patient Registry is managed and&#xD;
      operated by the John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Research Centre at Newcastle University, in&#xD;
      partnership with the Myotubular Trust, and is part of the TREAT-NMD Neuromuscular Network.&#xD;
      The registry has been developed in partnership with a number of leading neuromuscular&#xD;
      researchers, and is jointly funded by the Myotubular Trust and Muscular Dystrophy UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants register online and must provide consent before accessing the registry&#xD;
      questionnaire. The clinical data are provided by the participants, and the genetic data are&#xD;
      obtained by the Registry Curator via the genetic report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTM &amp; CNM Registry aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Help identify patients for relevant clinical trials as they become available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage further research into myotubular and centronuclear myopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide researchers with specific patient information to support their research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assist doctors and other health professionals by providing them with up-to-date&#xD;
           information on managing myotubular and centronuclear myopathy, to help them deliver&#xD;
           better standards of care for their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators welcome the registration of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients with a myotubular myopathy or centronuclear myopathy diagnosis, which has&#xD;
           been confirmed via genetic testing or muscle biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any carrier females of x-linked myotubular myopathy, especially if they have manifested&#xD;
           myotubular myopathy type symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any patient who is deceased, but who had a confirmed diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an online registry and is hosted on the RDRF (Rare Disease Registry Framework) by&#xD;
      Murdoch University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More details and online registration are available at www.mtmcnmregistry.org.&#xD;
