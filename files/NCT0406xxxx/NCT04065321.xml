  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of breast cancer in Chinese women has increased year by year, and luminal A&#xD;
      breast cancer commonly occurs in early-stage and postmenopausal women. This type of breast&#xD;
      cancer is not sensitive to chemotherapy, although it has a low mortality rate and distant&#xD;
      metastasis rate. Studies have shown that luminal A breast cancer is sensitive to endocrine&#xD;
      therapy. Patients with breast cancer who undergo excision should be followed up and their&#xD;
      prognosis should be monitored regularly. At present, imaging detection is mainly used in the&#xD;
      conventional follow-up of breast cancer, but the cost of many imaging examinations is high,&#xD;
      so a cost-effective examination is urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have found that circulating tumor cells can be used as a new type of tumor&#xD;
      molecular marker, which can be used to diagnose tumors, judge the prognosis and monitor the&#xD;
      efficacy by detecting the number and characteristic protein expression of circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells. Because circulating tumor cells may develop abnormalities 4-6 months earlier than&#xD;
      conventional imaging examination, as long as circulating tumor cells of patients are&#xD;
      abnormal, timely PET-CT examination will neither miss diagnosis nor delay the condition.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, the cost of hospitalization can be obviously reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-inferiority randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to compare the&#xD;
      differences in postoperative conditions between circulating tumor cell detection and&#xD;
      conventional imaging examination in patients with luminal A breast cancer without lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer ranks first in the incidence of female malignant tumors and second in&#xD;
      mortality. It is mainly classified into luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 2 positive, basal-like and other special types of breast cancer. Epidemiological&#xD;
      studies have shown that the incidence of luminal A breast cancer is 44.5-69.0%, mostly in&#xD;
      early-stage patients and postmenopausal women, with a low mortality rate and distant&#xD;
      metastasis rate. Luminal A breast cancer is usually invasive. Although it is not sensitive to&#xD;
      chemotherapy, luminal A breast cancer is sensitive to endocrine therapy. Therefore, the&#xD;
      treatment of luminal A breast cancer is a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy&#xD;
      and endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgical removal of breast cancer, follow-up should be conducted according to the&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines to monitor the prognosis at any time.&#xD;
      Conventional follow-up is mainly based on imaging examination, but the cost of many imaging&#xD;
      examinations is high, so a cost-effective examination is urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating tumor cells are tumor cells that fall off from solid tumors (primary and&#xD;
      metastatic foci) and enter the peripheral blood. In recent 30 years, circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      have become one of the new tumor molecular markers. Detection of the number and protein&#xD;
      expression of circulating tumor cells can diagnose the disease, judge the prognosis and&#xD;
      monitor the therapeutic effect. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and overexpression of&#xD;
      epithelial cell adhesion molecule in circulating tumor cells suggest that the prognosis of&#xD;
      cancer patients is not good. By comparing the number of circulating tumor cells in blood&#xD;
      before and after surgery or radiotherapy and chemotherapy,whether the treatment is effective&#xD;
      or not can be judged, which has important clinical research and application value. Currently,&#xD;
      many clinical trials have used circulating tumor cells to monitor the prognosis in breast&#xD;
      cancer. Circulating tumor cells may develop abnormalities 4-6 months earlier than&#xD;
      conventional imaging examination, and PET-CT can only find subclinical lesions 4-6 weeks in&#xD;
      advance. Thus, as long as circulating tumor cells of patients are abnormal, timely PET-CT&#xD;
      examination will neither miss diagnosis nor delay the condition. Simultaneously, the cost of&#xD;
      hospitalization can be obviously reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-inferiority randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to compare the&#xD;
      differences in postoperative conditions between circulating tumor cell detection and&#xD;
      conventional imaging examination in patients with luminal A breast cancer without lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
