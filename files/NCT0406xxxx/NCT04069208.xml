  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease&#xD;
      characterized by the clonal expansion of undifferentiated myeloid precursors. Although&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin/Idarubicin, typically called &quot;7+3&quot;,&#xD;
      has not changed for several decades, the best dosage of anthracycline is still unknown.&#xD;
      Several prospective trials have demonstrated that intense dosage of anthracycline improved&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS). Idarubicin 12mg/m2 (IA12) has been shown&#xD;
      to be equal to dose intense daunorubicin (90 mg/m2 ) for achieving CR. Dose-intense&#xD;
      daunorubicin 90 mg/m2 (DA90) has been shown to improve CR compared to standard dose&#xD;
      daunorubucin 45mg/m2 in newly diagnosed AML patients. In our previous study, CR rate of&#xD;
      induction with daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/d (3 days) and cytarabine 200 mg/m2/d days 1-7 was about&#xD;
      67%. Benefit of intensification seems limited to the patients without adverse cytogenetics.&#xD;
      Wheher ultra high dose idarubicin 14mg/m2 (IA14) could further improve CR rate, give patients&#xD;
      with adverse cytogenetics a chance to do allo-stem cell transplantation? This phase 2,&#xD;
      prospective, single-center study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction&#xD;
      with idarubicin 14mg/m2/d (3 days) and cytarabine 200 mg/m2/d days 1-7 in young newly&#xD;
      diagnosed AML patients.&#xD;
