    <textblock>
      Knowledge on the changes in myocardial function in the last weeks before birth and during the&#xD;
      first year of life is limited. Through fetal and post-natal echocardiography we intend to&#xD;
      describe these changes using myocardial tissue recognition techniques (Speckle tracking&#xD;
      echocardiography and Tissue Doppler echocardiography) in healthy neonates, born to term of&#xD;
      healthy women after uncomplicated pregnancies. We will compare the findings in this cohort to&#xD;
      a cohort of neonates born to term of women with severe pre-pregnancy obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sick neonates in intensive care units with various cardiac and non-cardiac conditions are&#xD;
      often exposed to treatment that may affect both their cardiac function and important&#xD;
      echo-variables per se. Using echocardiography, we will examine these changes in neonates&#xD;
      treated with blood transfusion, catecholamines and in those treated with ibuprofen due to a&#xD;
      haemodynamic significant arterial duct.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before, during and after birth major changes take place in the cardiovascular system. The&#xD;
      last weeks prior to birth there is an oxidative stress and after birth, there is normally a&#xD;
      large step up in blood oxygen tension when the lungs take over oxidation of the blood.&#xD;
      Simultaneously there are changes in the vascular resistance in both the pulmonary- and&#xD;
      systemic part of the circulation and ductus venous, the arterial duct, and foramen ovale&#xD;
      close. Combined these will significantly alter the physical conditions under which the&#xD;
      myocardium is supposed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will have five arms, all based on measurements of myocardial function and&#xD;
      coronary perfusion by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in the last trimester of the&#xD;
      pregnancy and in newborns with different gestational age and in sick newborns where&#xD;
      myocardial function is affected by medical treatment or is an important part of the clinical&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtaining normal values for strain during the last trimester of the pregnancy and the&#xD;
           first days after birth in child born to term.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: After birth, there will be higher STE values in the left ventricle than&#xD;
           before birth. This will increase further the first days post-partum in parallel with an&#xD;
           altered hemodynamic situation and oxygen demand of the infant. The STE changes will take&#xD;
           place at the same time, as there is an increased Doppler velocity in the aorta, the&#xD;
           pulmonary artery and the coronary arteries&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mothers (N= 150) will be recruited when they are coming to a routine fetal ultrasound&#xD;
           scan. It will be made an echo-examination once per week from week 37 until birth. After&#xD;
           birth the degree of placental transfusion (late cord clamping or not) will be noticed.&#xD;
           Ventricular size, Doppler velocities in the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery, STE&#xD;
           and coronary flow during the first three days of life and one year of age will be&#xD;
           assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effect of maternal obesity on cardiac function in newborns up to one year&#xD;
           of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Maternal sever obesity will result in reduced cardiac function in their&#xD;
           neonates. However, cardiac function will normalize within the first year of life. A&#xD;
           reduction in afterload will reduce strain measured by STE and coronary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mothers (N=75) with sever obesity will be recruited from the outpatient clinic for obese&#xD;
           women. First day after birth, the newborn will have a comprehensive echocardiographic&#xD;
           examination within the first few hours, then the two following days, at the day&#xD;
           equivalent to gestational age 42+0 weeks and finally at 1 year of age. Cardiac&#xD;
           morphology, ventricular sizes and Doppler velocities in the ascending aorta and&#xD;
           pulmonary artery as well as a strain measured by STE for both ventricles will be&#xD;
           assessed. Fetal malformations or diseases will result in exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measuring deformation when preload is increased by intravenous fluid treatment and blood&#xD;
           transfusion Hypothesis: Increased preload in the form of saline infusion or blood&#xD;
           transfusion will result in a temporary increase of STE and coronary blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Newborns (N=25 blood transfusion and 25 NaCl-infusion) who need infusion of sodium&#xD;
           chloride (NaCl 9mg) / ml or transfusion of packed red blood cellssuspended in 100 mL of&#xD;
           saline- adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGMAN) will be recruited. To obtain rehydration or&#xD;
           optimization of intravascular volume it is common to provide NaCl 9 mg/ml, 10-20 ml/kg&#xD;
           in 10-120 minutes. Blood transfusion is used in severe anemia and hemolytic diseases.&#xD;
           The regular blood transfusion dose is SAGMAN packed red blood cells10-15ml/ kg body&#xD;
           weight over 2-3 hours. Children requiring exchange transfusion, with heart failure or&#xD;
           congenital heart defects will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measuring deformation when afterload and heart rate are increased during infusion of&#xD;
           catecholamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Dopamine, epinephrine and/ or nor-epinephrine will increase heart rate and&#xD;
           blood pressure and due to this increase the strain measured by STE, coronary blood flow,&#xD;
           and Doppler velocity in the aorta pulmonary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Newborns (N=25) who need dopamine (2.5 to 15 ug/kg /min iv.) and or epinephrine /&#xD;
           nor-epinephrine to maintain an adequate blood pressure will be recruited. Only children&#xD;
           where an echo-exam before starting treatment is possible will be recruited. If the&#xD;
           treatment does not achieve a rise in the blood pressure above the 2.5 percentile for&#xD;
           gestational age, the baby will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measuring deformation when afterload (volume) is reduced following pharmacological&#xD;
           closure of a patent ductus arteriosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A reduction in afterload will reduce strain measured by STE and coronary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (N=25) with a suspected patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) are always referred to&#xD;
      echocardiography before starting treatment with Indomethacin and after the treatment has&#xD;
      stopped. Present clinical procedures for closure of the ductus will be followed, . Time of&#xD;
      echocardiography will be standardized to just before and at least 12 hours after the last&#xD;
      dose of Ibuprofen has been provided (t½ ≈ 2.5-11 hrs.).&#xD;
