  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the utility of Guanfacine Extended&#xD;
      Release (GXR) in the management of patients with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) who have&#xD;
      significant aggression or self-injury. The purpose of this trial is to establish the safety&#xD;
      of GXR with a specific focus on metabolic effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder due to loss of function of specific genes. In&#xD;
      newborns, symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development. Beginning in&#xD;
      childhood, the person becomes constantly hungry, which often leads to obesity and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Also, mild to moderate learning disability and behavioral problems are typical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guanfacine Extended Release (GXR), the investigational drug in this study would be the first&#xD;
      study to evaluate the drug in patients with Prader Willi Syndrome. &quot;Investigational&quot; means it&#xD;
      is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Prader Willi Syndrome.&#xD;
      However, Guanfacine Extended Released (GXR) is an FDA approved drug used to treat children&#xD;
      and adolescents with hypertension and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). GXR is&#xD;
      thought to respond to parts of the brain that lead to strengthening working memory, reducing&#xD;
      distraction, improving attention and impulse control. GXR is generally considered safe for&#xD;
      children as long as it is used according to the dosing instructions (up to 4mg) of a&#xD;
      qualified medical professional.&#xD;

    <description>SHI scores of 5 or greater were found to be indicative of borderline personality disorder. Part 1 is ranking based on the number of wounds 1=one would (common in a mild SIB but rare in a severe case) 2=two or four wounds (common) and 3=five or more wounds (rare). Injury severity is scored on a subjective basis with labels such as &quot;mild&quot; &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;severe&quot; accompanied by descriptions of the observed state of the anatomy. Part 3 is the Estimate of Current Risk.</description>

    <description>The starting dose for all subjects will be 1 mg per day. If the medication is well-tolerated, the dose can be raised to 2 mg until day 28 and increased to 3mg for the remaining 4 weeks in the trial. The dose schedule will not be fixed; the treating clinician can delay a planned increase or lower the dose to manage adverse effects. At week 8, the study will be unblinded and subjects will continue treatment for 8 more weeks.</description>
