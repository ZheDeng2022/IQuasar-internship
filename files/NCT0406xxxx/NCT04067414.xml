  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to determine the safety and antitumor&#xD;
      activity of BZ019 in adult patients with R/R large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL),including: DLBCL,&#xD;
      not otherwise specified (NOS), transformed DLBCL, high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and&#xD;
      BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL).The safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of a single dose of different target doses of BZ019 will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable BZ019 product generation. A&#xD;
      baseline tumor biopsy (in subjects with accessible disease) and bone marrow aspirate and&#xD;
      biopsy will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon successful BZ019 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase and receive&#xD;
      BZ019 infusion. A completed treatment program will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy with&#xD;
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (flu/cy) followed by single-dose of BZ019 infusion. BZ019&#xD;
      will be administered 2 to 14 days after the completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the infusion of BZ019, subjects will be in the follow-up period upon 12 months for&#xD;
      evaluation the safety and efficacy of BZ019. Subjects will be followed for long-term safety,&#xD;
      overall survival even after disease progression.&#xD;
