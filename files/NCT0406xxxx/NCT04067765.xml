    <textblock>
      This study uses techniques from an area of research known as neuroeconomics, which integrates&#xD;
      concepts and methods from psychology, neuroscience, and economics to better understand how&#xD;
      people make decisions and how these decisions are supported by the brain. One neuroeconomic&#xD;
      concept that is especially relevant in the area of addictions is substance demand, or how&#xD;
      consumption of a commodity (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, or drugs) is influenced by price and&#xD;
      other factors. Previous studies have shown that alcohol demand is related to severity of&#xD;
      alcohol misuse, drinking quantity/frequency, and treatment outcomes. In addition, we know&#xD;
      that alcohol demand can also fluctuate in response to environmental cues such as&#xD;
      alcohol-related stimuli or external contingencies such as important responsibilities the&#xD;
      following day. These increase and decreases in consumption and value are clinically&#xD;
      significant because they help us understand how people with alcohol use disorders are able to&#xD;
      successfully or unsuccessfully modulate their drinking behaviors. This study is examining how&#xD;
      the brain responds in these situations and whether these responses differ as a function of&#xD;
      severity of alcohol misuse. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      to understand brain activity patterns associated with changes in the value of alcohol in the&#xD;
      presence of alcohol-related beverage cues relative to neutral-related beverage cue.&#xD;
      Participants will be non-treatment-seeking adult heavy drinkers who are recruited from the&#xD;
      community to participate in an fMRI scan. During the scan, participants will make decisions&#xD;
      about how many alcohol beverages they would consume (hypothetically) at various prices while&#xD;
      their brain activity during those decisions is measured. The first experimental manipulation&#xD;
      involves an in-scanner alcohol cue exposure task in which the drinking decisions will be made&#xD;
      after viewing high-quality images of alcoholic (beer/wine/liquor) beverages or neutral&#xD;
      (water/juice/soft drinks) beverages.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neuroeconomics integrates concepts and methods from psychology, economics, and cognitive&#xD;
      neuroscience to understand the neurobiological foundations of decision making, and has been&#xD;
      increasingly applied to understanding alcohol use disorder (AUD). A novel application of&#xD;
      neuroeconomics is the study of alcohol demand, or the value of alcohol as measured by&#xD;
      cost-benefit preferences. Alcohol demand paradigms have considerable ecological validity by&#xD;
      measuring the impact of internal and external influences on alcohol decision-making, such as&#xD;
      price, environmental cues, affective states, or external contingencies. Behaviorally, alcohol&#xD;
      demand is elevated among individuals with higher levels of alcohol misuse and predicts&#xD;
      treatment response. Alcohol demand also exhibits state-like properties, including increases&#xD;
      following exposure to alcohol-related cues. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to&#xD;
      characterize the neural activity that subserves these established behavioral findings using a&#xD;
      novel functional MRI paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to examine the patterns of neural activation underlying increases in the&#xD;
      value of alcohol in response to alcohol cues. To do so, the first study will use a&#xD;
      within-subjects design to identify differences in neural activity associated with demand&#xD;
      decisions following a validated in-scanner cue exposure protocol consisting of exposure to&#xD;
      neutral beverage cues and exposure to alcohol beverage cues in a sample of adult heavy&#xD;
      drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a novel neuroeconomics approach, this study combines a highly ecologically-valid&#xD;
      alcohol demand paradigm with two experimental manipulations that model clinically-relevant&#xD;
      influences on drinking decisions. Studying these contextual influences may help clarify the&#xD;
      neural signatures that underlie drinking moderation vs. unconstrained drinking, and how these&#xD;
      processes are impacted by AUD. If successful, these studies will provide a foundation for&#xD;
      examining neural predictors of successful recovery or response to treatment vs. relapse. More&#xD;
      broadly, findings from this study have high potential to significantly enhance the clinical&#xD;
      relevance of alcohol neuroscience.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will report how many standard drinks they would consume at varying prices using a hypothetical Alcohol Purchase Task (APT) procedure. The APT is a validated self-report measure of alcohol consumption (in standard drink units) at escalating prices (18 price intervals, ranging from $0 to $80/drink). Responses on APT are analyzed to generate observed and derived indices of alcohol demand, including: intensity (consumption at free price); breakpoint (maximum price for spent for a single drink); Omax (maximum expenditure on alcohol); and Elasticity (proportionate slope of the alcohol demand curve)</description>
