      Prospective, Double-Blinded, Randomized, Multi-Center Study for Evaluation of Two Doses of&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide (NO) Given Intermittently Via Inhalation to Subjects With Bronchiolitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study judiciously expands these observations for use of NO treatment in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with bronchiolitis aged less than 12 months. The intermittent dosing&#xD;
      strategy used in this study has been selected to minimize the potential for adverse effects.&#xD;
      The inclusion of two doses in the proposed pilot study is intended to determine a dose&#xD;
      response effect and select a dose that is optimally safe and effective. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      evaluation of time to fit for discharge will provide an effective objective measurement for&#xD;
      the treatment effectiveness compared to standard supportive treatment of bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Assess whether Nitric Oxide (NO) administered intermittently in 2 concentrations (via&#xD;
      inhalation for 40 minutes 4 times per day for up to 5 consecutive days) in addition to&#xD;
      Standard Supportive Treatment (SST) shortens the recovery time of infants with bronchiolitis,&#xD;
      compared to SST alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to achieve O2 saturation of ≥ 92 % sustained for at least 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in hospital Length of Stay (LOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to achieve mTal score of ≤ 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety objectives: Characterize the safety of 2 doses of NO intermittent inhalation treatment&#xD;
      therapy as measured by Adverse Events (AE) - number and percentage of subjects that&#xD;
      experience AEs - and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive the study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment administration: Treatment blindness will be kept by designation of blinded and&#xD;
      un-blinded team members.The blinded staff will be performing the study assessment procedures&#xD;
      and the un-blinded team will be administering the actual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' parents/legal guardian will be contacted for a follow up phone call at days 14+5&#xD;
      and 30+5 from the date of enrollment of the subject into the study.&#xD;

      Prospective, Double-Blinded, Randomized, Multi-Center Study for Evaluation of Two Doses of&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide (NO) Given Intermittently Via Inhalation to Subjects With Bronchiolitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiolitis is a viral disease, widely spread amongst young children with significant&#xD;
      mortality in some cases and no specific treatment available, besides supportive treatment of&#xD;
      O2 and hydration; therefore, there is an identified unmet medical need to develop a treatment&#xD;
      strategy for children with bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the immune system's NO generating ability is overwhelmed or compromised, infection and&#xD;
      disease occur. Increasing the body's ability to produce more NO through gene therapy or&#xD;
      synthetic NO donor drugs is of interest in medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NO, by itself, is an essential part of the innate defense mechanism of the human immune&#xD;
      system which becomes up-regulated by the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) during various&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions and during microbial and viral infections. This suggests that NO&#xD;
      treatment in appropriate concentrations is highly relevant for children with bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two previous pilot studies conducted by Beyond Air (formerly known as AIT) found that&#xD;
      intermittent exposure to was safe and well tolerated in pediatric subjects with acute&#xD;
      bronchiolitis age 0-12 months and showed a trend in reduction in the length of&#xD;
      hospitalization. The overall frequency of adverse events was found to be similar between the&#xD;
      control and NO treated groups and intermittent exposure at 160 ppm did not result in exposure&#xD;
      to unsafe Nitric Dioxide (NO2) levels or had a cumulative effect on MetHb levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study judiciously expands these observations for use of NO treatment in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with bronchiolitis aged less than 12 months. The intermittent dosing&#xD;
      strategy used in this study has been selected to minimize the potential for adverse effects.&#xD;
      The inclusion of two doses in the proposed pilot study is intended to determine a dose&#xD;
      response effect and select a dose that is optimally safe and effective. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      evaluation of time to fit for discharge will provide an effective objective measurement for&#xD;
      the treatment effectiveness compared to standard supportive treatment of bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NO therapy can be cost effective, technologically simple and easily adaptive for use in&#xD;
      inhaled pulmonary infections. Ultimately, therapeutic use of NO could be the initial&#xD;
      treatment by mimicking the body's natural first line method to fight infections. Together,&#xD;
      these results and rationale warrant the need to accelerate research of NO as a potential&#xD;
      solution for front line treatment for bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Assess whether Nitric Oxide (NO) administered intermittently in 2 concentrations (via&#xD;
      inhalation for 40 minutes 4 times per day for up to 5 consecutive days) in addition to&#xD;
      Standard Supportive Treatment (SST) shortens the recovery time of infants with bronchiolitis,&#xD;
      compared to SST alone.&#xD;
