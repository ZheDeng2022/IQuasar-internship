  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PERCEPTION study aims to assess the correlation between blood cell counts (Leucocytes,&#xD;
      Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Platelets, NLR (Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio) and PLR&#xD;
      (Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio)) and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), at baseline and&#xD;
      after surgery, for patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. It also aims to&#xD;
      assess these circulating elements and circulating tumor DNA as predictive factor of&#xD;
      metastatic recurrence in triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast cancer. Because of&#xD;
      the limited therapeutical strategies, early TNBC relapses are quite common during the five&#xD;
      years following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at baseline is&#xD;
      related to good pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, the presence&#xD;
      of a high quantity of TILs in the residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is related to&#xD;
      better survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood circulating elements, such as peripheral blood cells or circulating tumor DNA, could be&#xD;
      of interest in predicting response to treatment and in the prediction of metastatic&#xD;
      recurrences in different types of cancer, including breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the correlation of these markers in triple negative breast cancer has not yet been&#xD;
      thoroughly studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PERCEPTION study aims to assess the correlation between blood cell counts (Leucocytes,&#xD;
      Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Platelets, NLR (Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio) and PLR&#xD;
      (Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio)) and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), at baseline and&#xD;
      after surgery, for patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. It also aims to&#xD;
      assess these circulating elements and circulating tumor DNA as predictive factor of&#xD;
      metastatic recurrence in triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
