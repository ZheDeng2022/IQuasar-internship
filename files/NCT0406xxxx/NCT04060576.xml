  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical hyperalgesia areas, also known as myofascial trigger points, are treated by manual&#xD;
      therapy or invasive technics. Dry needling achieves an improvement of the symptomatology in&#xD;
      70% of the subjects, being the acute patients the most benefited. However, bruising,&#xD;
      bleeding, pain during treatment or post-needling soreness. Plantar fasciitis is the most&#xD;
      common cause of interior heel pain, affects approximately 10% of the general population and&#xD;
      is one of the most benefited pathologies in the long term by the application of dry needling&#xD;
      The gauge of the needle chosen for the treatment can influence post-needling soreness&#xD;
      intensity and pressure pain threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To evaluate the relation between post-needling soreness intensity and needle&#xD;
      diameter on the treatment of the most hyperalgesic point of the internal gastrocnemius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Post-needling soreness intensity and pressure pain threshold depend on needle&#xD;
      diameter applied in the treatment of the most hyperalgesic point of the internal&#xD;
      gastrocnemius.&#xD;

      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two zones are established:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zone 1: where researcher nº 1 controls the data management and sample randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zone 2: where researcher nº 2 locates the most hyperalgesic area and measures pressure&#xD;
           point threshold variable and researcher nº 3 performs dry needling puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher nº 1 explains to the subjects how the study works, collects the confidential&#xD;
      documents and scores the independent variables (sex, age and BMI). Every subject receives an&#xD;
      identification code and is randomly assign to a intervention group (A, B or C) Researcher nº&#xD;
      2 makes delivery of the document where the variables pressure pain threshold and&#xD;
      post-needling soreness intensity will be written down. Firstly, the visual analogue scale&#xD;
      compliance prior to the intervention is requested. After that, the subject is placed in prone&#xD;
      position on the stretcher with a slight knee flexion and the most hyperalgesic area in the&#xD;
      internal gastrocnemius of the lower limb with plantar fasciitis is located and marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher nº 2 performs the algometry at the most hyperalgesic area (3 measurements with 30&#xD;
      seconds between them), writes down the results of pressure pain threshold variable and leaves&#xD;
      the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher nº 3 receives a needle from researcher nº 1 ignoring its diameter (colour tab is&#xD;
      removed). Firstly, contamination is prevented by disinfection, then, 10 insertions are made&#xD;
      at the marked point (the number of local twitch response are counted) and the needle used is&#xD;
      thrown in the sanitary waste container. Ischemic compression is performed for 60 seconds&#xD;
      followed by an analytical stretch of the internal gastrocnemius for 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once researcher nº 3 has finished the intervention leaves the room and researcher nº 2&#xD;
      returns to repeat the measurements (post-needling soreness intensity, by filling in VAS, and&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold, performing algometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researcher nº 2 reminds the subject to complete VAS at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours (suggesting&#xD;
      setting an alarm) and makes an appointment 48 hours after to perform the third measure of&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all the data needed for the study has been collected, researcher nº1 gathers results and&#xD;
      exports them for statistical interpretation.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators use a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to determine the intensity of the patient's post-needing pain after and for 72 hours after DN.The VAS is a 100-mm line, oriented horizontally, with one end representing &quot;no pain&quot; and the other end representing &quot;worst pain.&quot; Subjects will be asked to rate their current pain with a mark on the scale.</description>

    <description>The PPT serves to determine the sensitivity of hiperalgesic focus. The investigators will done it with one algometer. A lower threshold is a worse result. A higher threshold is a better result.</description>
