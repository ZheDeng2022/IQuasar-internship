  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a transoral endoscopic procedure that creates a&#xD;
      tubular sleeve along the lesser curvature with a gastric volume of approximately 30%.&#xD;
      Summarizing the available literature published since its introduction in 2013, ESG was&#xD;
      capable to achieve &gt; 10% of sustained total body weight loss in a majority of mildly to&#xD;
      moderately obese patients with the caveat of only minor adverse events. Besides weight loss,&#xD;
      little is known about the metabolic effects of ESG. The present study seeks to measure&#xD;
      markers of glucose homeostasis during oral glucose tolerance tests before and subsequently&#xD;
      after application of ESG in 12 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a transoral endoscopic procedure that utilizes&#xD;
      full-thickness sutures extending from the prepyloric antrum to the gastroesophageal junction,&#xD;
      creating a tubular sleeve along the lesser curvature with a gastric volume of approximately&#xD;
      30%. After the first feasibility study was available in 2013, multiple investigators&#xD;
      published data on safety and efficacy of ESG. A recent meta analysis of novel endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures revealed four observational studies on ESG. At 6, 12 and 24 months pooled&#xD;
      excessive weight loss (EWL) was 52%, 53%, and 60% while pooled total body weight loss (TBWL)&#xD;
      was 16%, 17%, and 20%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from its efficacy in terms of body weight loss, only a small number of investigations&#xD;
      addressed metabolic changes in response to ESG so far. In a large retrospective analysis,&#xD;
      which observed the outcomes of 1000 patients following ESG, 13 of 17 cases of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM), all 28 cases of hypertension, and 18 of 32 cases of dyslipidemia were in&#xD;
      complete remission by the third month of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarizing the available literature, knowledge about effects of ESG on metabolism and&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis is scarce. Available studies are subject to significant limitations in&#xD;
      terms of sample size and or generalizability of results. The present study aims at a&#xD;
      comprehensive determination of changes in hormonal regulators of glucose homeostasis after&#xD;
      ESG in comparison to the preoperative state. Up to date, there are no structured and detailed&#xD;
      analyses available that investigate glucose homeostasis following ESG. Proper glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis yields a significant impact on a patients' quality of life and may - if&#xD;
      deteriorated - be accompanied by a plethora of somatic and psychological constraints. The&#xD;
      results of the present study seeks to investigate glucose homeostasis following ESG in&#xD;
      detail. This may help to identify patients in need for further assistance regarding their&#xD;
      post-interventional lifestyle in order to avoid e.g. hypoglycemia, and to further&#xD;
      characterize patients' cohorts that will likely benefit from ESG.&#xD;
