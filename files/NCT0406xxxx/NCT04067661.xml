    <textblock>
      This project seeks to test the efficacy of a couples-based HIV prevention program in&#xD;
      large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to reduce HIV risk among transgender woman and&#xD;
      their partners. This project involves enrolling a racially diverse sample of transgender&#xD;
      women and their partners and randomizing 100 couples to either the couples-based HIV&#xD;
      prevention intervention or an enhanced standard of care (SOC) control condition. Couples will&#xD;
      be followed quarterly over 12-months. Analysis of study outcomes will utilize both&#xD;
      individual- and dyadic-level data. The primary outcome is a composite measure of risk for HIV&#xD;
      transmission which encompasses validated behavioral indicators of HIV risk as well as&#xD;
      biomedical confirmation of viral suppression and PrEP adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transgender women (trans women; individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity who&#xD;
      were assigned male at birth) are disproportionately affected by HIV. One of the most&#xD;
      consistently reported contexts for HIV transmission among trans women is within a primary&#xD;
      partnership. In this partnership context, trans women report low condom use, difficulty&#xD;
      disclosing their HIV status and negotiating HIV prevention strategies, poor communication&#xD;
      about whether they permit sex outside of the relationship, and low rates of routine HIV&#xD;
      testing. Likewise, research among males who have sex with trans women has found high HIV&#xD;
      prevalence, inconsistent condom use with trans women, and low engagement with HIV prevention&#xD;
      services.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the past 10 years the investigators have conducted research to identify intervention&#xD;
      targets for reducing HIV transmission in trans women and their partner using qualitative,&#xD;
      survey, and intervention adaptation methodologies. Based on these conceptual and empirical&#xD;
      understandings of HIV transmission in these dyads, the investigative team developed and pilot&#xD;
      tested the first known couples-based HIV prevention program for trans women and primary&#xD;
      partners (called &quot;Couples HIV Intervention Program&quot; or CHIP). CHIP was feasible, acceptable,&#xD;
      and produced significant reductions in condomless sex acts with primary and casual partners&#xD;
      and in number of casual partners at 3-month follow-up compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project seeks to test the efficacy of the CHIP intervention on reductions in a Composite&#xD;
      Risk for HIV (CR-HIV) outcome. CR-HIV is a binary indicator of couple HIV risk using&#xD;
      validated measures of sexual behavior (defined as condomless anal or vaginal sex with a&#xD;
      serodiscordant or unknown HIV status primary or outside partner), as well as PrEP use among&#xD;
      HIV-negative participants and viral suppression among HIV-positive partners. The study&#xD;
      involves two-arm prospective RCT in which 100 trans women and their partners (200&#xD;
      participants) will complete a Baseline assessment and then complete assessments every 3&#xD;
      months for 12 months. Recruitment and study activities will occur in San Francisco,&#xD;
      California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary specific aim is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Evaluate the efficacy of CHIP on CR-HIV compared to an enhanced standard of care control&#xD;
      condition. Hypothesis: It is hypothesize that couples in the CHIP condition will have lower&#xD;
      CR-HIV at 12-month follow-up compared to couples in the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the effect of CHIP on theory-based mediators (i.e., communication, joint&#xD;
           problem-solving).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore partner gender (trans woman vs. male partner and couple HIV status&#xD;
           (seroconcordant negative vs. serodiscordant) as potential moderators of the effect of&#xD;
           CHIP on CR-HIV.&#xD;

    <description>CR-HIV is a couple-level binary indicator of any HIV risk (e.g., yes=1 vs. no=0), which is an algorithm based on whether one or both partners report condomless anal or vaginal sex with a HIV serodiscordant or status-unknown primary or other partner in the past 3 months. If one or both partners in the dyad report condomless sex with a serodiscordant or status-unknown primary or other partner, then the couple is coded as 1 if (i) the HIV-negative participant is not adherent to PrEP and/or (ii) the HIV-positive participant is not virally suppressed.</description>
