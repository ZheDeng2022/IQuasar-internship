      1. Advantages of albumin-bound paclitaxel Paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding type)&#xD;
      uses human serum albumin (HAS) as a carrier, and paclitaxel and HSA are made into&#xD;
      paclitaxel-bound albumin nanoparticles by a high-pressure homogenization technique. After&#xD;
      injection of paclitaxel (albumin-binding) into the blood, it rapidly disintegrates and&#xD;
      disperses into a smaller albumin-paclitaxel complex, which binds and activates the gp60&#xD;
      albumin receptor on vascular endothelial cells, interacts with Caveolin on the cell membrane,&#xD;
      and then is transported to the tumor intercellular substance by transcytosis. Tumor cells can&#xD;
      secrete a SPARC protein with a specific affinity for albumin, which actively captures the&#xD;
      albumin-paclitaxel complex in the tumor stroma and accumulates around the tumor cells. Since&#xD;
      tumor neovascular endothelial cells highly express gp60 receptor and the SPARC protein is&#xD;
      also highly expressed in the tumor region, the special transport mechanism of &quot;gp60- Caveolin&#xD;
      / caveola -SPARC protein&quot; makes the paclitaxel for injection (albumin binding) have unique&#xD;
      targeting and penetrating properties toward tumor tissues, hence the drug is highly&#xD;
      concentrated in the tumor tissue, which can better increase the therapeutic effect and reduce&#xD;
      the damage to normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding type) has the following advantages: (1) it is&#xD;
      unnecessary to pre-administer anti-allergic drugs, the infusion time is within 30 min, and&#xD;
      patients have good compliance; (2) due to its higher safety, the dosage can be given as high&#xD;
      as 260-300 mg/m2; (3) it makes full use of gp60 / cysteine acid secretory protein (SPARC&#xD;
      protein) channel to make the drug enrich toward the tumor area, and the effect is good; (4)&#xD;
      as the dosage is within 80 ~ 300 mg/m2, the AUC increase proportionally with the administered&#xD;
      dose, ]the body is linearly metabolized., the half-life period does not prolong with the&#xD;
      dose, and the clinical medication is safe and controllable. Currently, the drug has been&#xD;
      approved for breast cancer treatment in China; approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer treatment;&#xD;
      approved for gastric cancer treatment in Japan; and NCCN guidelines recommend it for the&#xD;
      treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, based on the biological advantages of albumin-binding paclitaxel such as&#xD;
      high-distribution, high-dose, high-efficiency, and low-toxicity, the reported good clinical&#xD;
      benefit and safety for hepatobiliary and malignant tumors, and the limited data about&#xD;
      albumin-bound paclitaxel + oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment for advanced hepatobiliary&#xD;
      and pancreatic malignancies, especially in Chinese patients, our center believes that is&#xD;
      feasible and necessary to explore the effectiveness and safety of paclitaxel for injection&#xD;
      (albumin-binding) combined with oxaliplatin as the first-line drugs for treatment of advanced&#xD;
      oxaliplatin-based malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Purposes To evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel (albumin-bound) combined with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin as the first-line drugs for treatment of advanced hepatobiliary and malignant&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) Secondary study endpoints: disease control&#xD;
      rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and incidence and severity of adverse events (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;

      clinical trial, which plans to recruit 57 patients.&#xD;
