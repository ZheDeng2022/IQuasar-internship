  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The practice of checking gastric residuals is not evidence based. The amount of gastric&#xD;
      residual volume (GRV) does not correlate with either feeding intolerance or development of&#xD;
      NEC. We hypothesize that not monitoring GRV in infants with birth weights &lt; 1,250 g, and who&#xD;
      are being fed intermittently by gastric tube, will result in earlier attainment of full&#xD;
      feeding. This is an unblinded randomized controlled trial where GRV will not be checked&#xD;
      routinely in the intervention group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term &quot;gastric residuals&quot; in neonates refers to aspiration of gastric contents before each&#xD;
      feeding in an infant receiving enteral feeding using an intermittent feeding tube. The&#xD;
      presence of significant gastric residual volume (GRV) (Greater than 50% of the feeding&#xD;
      volume) is a manifestation of delayed gastrointestinal maturation in a preterm neonate. The&#xD;
      presence of GRV and its characteristics usually delays advancement of enteral feedings in&#xD;
      premature infants because a large volume of undigested milk usually prompts the clinicians to&#xD;
      hold the feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advancement of early enteral nutrition is delayed or discontinued for &gt;24 hours in nearly 75%&#xD;
      of all extremely preterm infants. This is despite clinical evidence showing that early&#xD;
      establishment of enteral nutrition is associated with reductions in the severity of critical&#xD;
      illness, and long-lasting benefits on linear growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The magnitude and characteristics of GRV combined with specific findings based on abdominal&#xD;
      examinations are usually considered by clinicians in decisions to continue with the scheduled&#xD;
      enteral feeding plan. There are no studies to establish the normal volume of gastric&#xD;
      residuals, its characteristics and whether routinely checking for them prior to each feed&#xD;
      prevents necrotizing enterocolitis. A recent cohort study using retrospective controls showed&#xD;
      that not monitoring GRV is associated with earlier attainment of full feeding in very low&#xD;
      birth weight infants. Two small randomized studies conducted outside the United States and&#xD;
      one study conducted in the United States showed no difference in outcomes when GRV are not&#xD;
      checked routinely in preterm infants. These studies have several drawbacks and the practice&#xD;
      of checking GRV continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective/Aim/Goal/Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that not monitoring GRV in infants with&#xD;
      birth weights &lt; 1,250 g, and who are being fed intermittently by gastric tube, will result in&#xD;
      earlier attainment of full feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preterm infants, changing the clinical practice from routine gastric residuals evaluation&#xD;
      to no aspiration for gastric residuals will decrease the number of days to reach full enteral&#xD;
      feeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective/Aim/Goal/Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to show that there will be no difference in the incidence of NEC&#xD;
      (necrotizing enterocolitis) in the experimental vs the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our NICU database shows that for infants &lt;1,250 g the days to full feeding was 16.4 ±7.3&#xD;
      days. To detect a relative decrease of 20% in the experimental group will require 73 infants&#xD;
      in each group with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome analysis is the number of days to reach full feeding volume, defined as&#xD;
      volume &gt; 120 ml/kg/d. This time will be compared between the two groups using analysis of&#xD;
      variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis will be focused the frequency of feeding interruptions, incidences of NEC&#xD;
      between the two groups using analysis of variance.&#xD;
