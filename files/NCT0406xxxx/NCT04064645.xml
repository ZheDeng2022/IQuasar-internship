  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a Respiratory Rate accuracy validation comparing the&#xD;
      BORA BAND™ Wristband Monitoring System to the Reference. Respiratory Rate will be compared to&#xD;
      an FDA cleared End Tidal Carbon Dioxide monitor (GE Datex-Ohmeda). The testing will be&#xD;
      conducted in two phases. The first phase will be an initial data collection to assist in the&#xD;
      algorithm development of respiration rate. Upon a successful Phase one performance, the&#xD;
      second phase will be the Respiratory Rate Validation conducted at a different period in time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For phase 1, there will be 5 to 6 volunteer test subjects. For the final validation phase,&#xD;
      there will be a minimum of 20 volunteer test subjects. All subjects will be 18 or older and&#xD;
      selected to represent a range of body types including small, average, muscular, and large&#xD;
      with a range of BMI's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be connected to a commonly used, FDA cleared ECG Impedance monitor (to be&#xD;
      used for informational purposes) and an End Tidal Carbon Dioxide monitor (GE Datex-Ohmeda)&#xD;
      and BiOSENCY BORA BAND™ wristband monitoring system. The end tidal CO2 monitor will be&#xD;
      attached to the patient to determine performance of respiratory rate metrics (Reference).&#xD;
      Each subject will be instrumented with a mouthpiece that allows for measurement of the end&#xD;
      tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) respiratory rate (Reference) and tidal volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of stable respiratory rates will be elicited from each volunteer test subject. The&#xD;
      rates will be approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 breaths per minute; with&#xD;
      some natural variation from these exact numbers. Paced breathing app will be used. Not all&#xD;
      subjects will be able to breathe at a constant level for every rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respiratory rate will be measured simultaneously with EtCO2 (Reference) and the Devices&#xD;
      Under Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the data analysis, the EtCO2 monitor will be used to assess the stability of the data. If&#xD;
      the respiratory rate varies by more than +3 bpm during a one-minute period of the target&#xD;
      respiration rates, then the data for that period will be considered unstable and removed from&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To 'Pass' this test the BiOSENCY BORA BAND™ wristband (Device Under Test) must demonstrate a&#xD;
      Respiratory Rate of ≤3 when compared to the Reference End tidal carbon dioxide monitor.&#xD;

    <description>The subject will follow the paced breathing app, once a stable Respiration Rate at the natural rate (without the breathing app) is captured. The breathing pattern on the app will be set to begin near the normal Respiration Rate of the subject and continue to go down by five intervals until reaching the Respiration Rate of 5 bpm. After that, we will pick back up at the rate above the subject's normal Respiration Rate and continue upwards until reaching 50 bpm or as high as the subject can tolerate up to 50 bpm.&#xD;
The respiratory rate will be monitored simultaneously with an EtCo2 (Reference) and the BORA BAND™ wristband monitoring system, Device Under Test. These data will be continuously recorded electronically. Additional study notes that describe conditions of the test as well as deviations, device issues and any adverse events will be recorded in written documentation.</description>
