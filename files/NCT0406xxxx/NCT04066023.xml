    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects who meet the entry criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized o receive one of three blinded treatments [C213 1.9 mg patch and placebo patch;&#xD;
      C213 3.8 mg (1.9 mg x 2 patches), two placebo patches] on Day 1 and will have up to 48 weeks&#xD;
      to confirm and treat a cluster headache. Subjects will self-administer the patches and&#xD;
      respond to questions in the electronic diary (eDiary) until 1-hour post treatment&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Approximately 120 subjects&#xD;
      who meet the entry criteria will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of three blinded&#xD;
      treatments [C213 1.9 mg patch and placebo patch; C213 3.8 mg (1.9 mg x 2 patches), two&#xD;
      placebo patches].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified subjects will randomize to the double-blind treatment period at Day 1 and will have&#xD;
      up to 48 weeks to confirm and treat a cluster headache. Using the eDiary to confirm they are&#xD;
      experiencing a cluster headache, subjects will self-administer the patches and continue to&#xD;
      respond to questions in the eDiary until 1-hour post treatment administration.&#xD;
