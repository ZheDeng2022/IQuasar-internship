      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysfunctional body image is a strong predictor of maintenance and relapse in anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa, making treatment of such clinically and financially important. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that cognitive behavioural based group therapies and mirror exposure interventions are&#xD;
      effective in improving body image in adults with eating disorders; however research into&#xD;
      individual body image treatments for adolescents with anorexia nervosa is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical Body Image (PBI) is a novel, manualised, individual treatment designed for&#xD;
      adolescents with anorexia nervosa for which the evidence base is not yet established. This&#xD;
      research will therefore contribute to the evidence base for the treatment of body image in&#xD;
      adolescents with anorexia nervosa and inform the effectiveness of a new treatment. The&#xD;
      research will be funded by Newbridge House, an inpatient unit for children and adolescents&#xD;
      with eating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does Practical Body Image improve body image and psychological wellbeing in adolescent&#xD;
      inpatients with anorexia nervosa?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does a mirror exposure intervention improve body image and psychological wellbeing in&#xD;
      adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa after completion of the rest of the programme?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 11-18, fulfilling DSM-V criteria for anorexia nervosa and receiving treatment&#xD;
      at Newbridge House will be recruited for participation in the research study. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to either a case or control group. Allocation will be based on a&#xD;
      non-blind randomised controlled trial. Cases will receive PBI in addition to treatment as&#xD;
      usual and will be compared with controls who just receive treatment as usual. Both groups&#xD;
      will complete a set of questionnaires at baseline, 7 weeks and 10 weeks.&#xD;

      PRINCIPAL NULL HYPOTHESIS PBI will have no impact on body image or psychological wellbeing in&#xD;
      adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa compared to just TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY NULL HYPOTHESIS Mirror exposure will have no effect on body image or psychological&#xD;
      wellbeing in adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa after completion of the rest of PBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRINCIPAL ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS PBI will improve body image and psychological wellbeing in&#xD;
      adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa compared to just TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS Mirror exposure will improve body image and psychological&#xD;
      wellbeing in adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa after completion of the rest of PBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative hypotheses were chosen based previous research which shows that cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural techniques and mirror exposure are effective in improving body image disturbance&#xD;
      and psychological wellbeing in adults with anorexia nervosa. This study aims to generate&#xD;
      hypotheses about which specific elements of body image (i.e. body avoidance, body acceptance,&#xD;
      body anxiety or weight and shape concern) and psychological wellbeing (i.e. self esteem,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression) change after completion of PBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal hypothesis will be tested using a between subjects design (PBI vs no PBI) with&#xD;
      treatment as the independent variable. The case group will receive TAU as well as PBI and the&#xD;
      control group will receive just TAU. The outcomes from self-report measures completed at 10&#xD;
      weeks will be compared between the case and control groups to answer the principal research&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis will be tested using a within subjects design (before mirror&#xD;
      exposure vs after mirror exposure) with mirror exposure as the independent variable. The case&#xD;
      group will complete self-report measures at week 7 before commencing mirror exposure in&#xD;
      addition to week 10. This will allow comparison of outcomes before mirror exposure to after&#xD;
      mirror exposure to answer the secondary research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dependent variables are body image (including body avoidance, acceptance, anxiety and&#xD;
      weight and shape concerns) and psychological wellbeing (including self-esteem, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression) as measured by self-report questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experimental design has been chosen as it allows for the comparison of PBI vs no PBI as&#xD;
      well as a comparison between outcomes before mirror exposure and outcomes after mirror&#xD;
      exposure. The choice of this design was influenced by a desire to provide an evidence base&#xD;
      for this novel treatment and to determine whether mirror exposure has any additional benefit&#xD;
      for adolescents with anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be inpatients, aged 11 - 18, fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa and receiving treatment at Newbridge House child and adolescent inpatient eating&#xD;
      disorder unit. A convenience sampling method will be used and participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either a 'case' group to complete TAU plus PBI or a 'control' group to complete&#xD;
      only TAU using an Excel formula. A control group (TAU) was included in order to compare&#xD;
      outcomes of those who complete PBI with outcomes of those who do not. This is because the&#xD;
      principal aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel treatment and there&#xD;
      is insufficient evidence to support the introduction of PBI without conducting a study of&#xD;
      this kind. This is especially necessary given that the research site is an inpatient unit and&#xD;
      all participants will be receiving other therapies alongside the treatment being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty participants will be recruited in total (twenty in each group). As this is a pilot&#xD;
      study no power calculation could be conducted and this sample size was agreed as sufficient&#xD;
      to generate data to inform a power calculation for future research. Participants will be&#xD;
      identifiable by a unique code created using the letters 'TAU+PBI' or 'TAU' followed by a&#xD;
      number relating to the order in which they were recruited (1-20). Participants will be&#xD;
      approached to take part in the research when they reach 90% of their healthy weight. All&#xD;
      patients on the unit who fulfill the framework of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      asked for their informed written consent to participate after reading a research information&#xD;
      sheet. For patients under age 16, parents will also be given a research information sheet and&#xD;
      consent form and asked to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIMETABLE&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stages will take place on site at Newbridge House.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 0 (Recruitment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited as described above and an Assistant Psychologist will meet with&#xD;
      them to read through the research information sheet and request informed written consent. For&#xD;
      patients under 16, written parental consent will also be sought and parents will be given an&#xD;
      information sheet and consent form prior to commencement of the study. Patients and parents&#xD;
      will be given 7 days to consider their decision to consent to participate in the research.&#xD;
      Patients for whom we receive consent will then be randomly allocated to either the case or&#xD;
      control group using an Excel formula. Patients who do not consent, or for whom parental&#xD;
      consent is not received, will not be included in the study and will receive TAU which will be&#xD;
      identical to that delivered to controls. Patients declining to participate will be asked for&#xD;
      permission to use demographic and routine clinical data to test if there are any significant&#xD;
      differences between participants versus non-participants, and to examine whether the sample&#xD;
      is representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 (Week 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete a set of self-report measures in week 1&#xD;
      (baseline). For participants in the case group, PBI will then commence and take place over 7&#xD;
      weeks alongside TAU. For participants in the control group TAU will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 2 (Week 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 will take place 7 weeks after completion of baseline measures in between session 7&#xD;
      and 8 of PBI. At this stage the same measures will be completed by participants in the case&#xD;
      group only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the case group, the mirror exposure part of PBI will commence and take&#xD;
      place twice a week, over 3 weeks alongside TAU. For participants in the control group TAU&#xD;
      will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 3 (Week 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 will take place 10 weeks after completion of baseline measures. At this stage those&#xD;
      in the case group will have completed the PBI intervention. The same measures will be&#xD;
      completed for the last time by participants in both the case and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant feedback about their experiences of the programme will also be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 4 (Data analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will input raw data from completed outcome measures onto an SPSS spreadsheet.&#xD;
      Data will then be analysed and interpreted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 5 (Report write up)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final report will be written for publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION The intervention will comprise of 14 sessions of individual body image therapy&#xD;
      using a cognitive behavioural approach over a 10 week period. The therapy has been&#xD;
      protocolised into a treatment manual known as PBI, and will be administered by Assistant&#xD;
      Psychologists employed at Newbridge House receiving weekly supervision from a Clinical&#xD;
      Psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBI is based on a cognitive behavioural model of body image addressing thoughts, feelings,&#xD;
      behaviours and misperceptions. PBI is designed to be administered over 6 weekly sessions&#xD;
      followed by 8 twice weekly sessions over 4 weeks. Therapists delivering the programme will&#xD;
      have time to read through the manual and attend weekly peer supervision to support adherence&#xD;
      to the protocol. Therapists will require some background knowledge of the nature of body&#xD;
      image in eating disorders and some knowledge of basic CBT principles. They will also receive&#xD;
      weekly clinical supervision by a trained CBT therapist. The sessions are structured and laid&#xD;
      out in the following overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1, Session 1: My Body Image&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2, Session 2: Body Perception&#xD;
