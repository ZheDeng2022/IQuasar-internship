      This study is a dose verification, pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment of products derived from&#xD;
      two manufacturing processes and scales (500L-FMP and 2000L-FMP; FMP: Final Manufacturing&#xD;
      Process) and indication expansion clinical study of monoclonal antibody conducted in Chinese&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid tumors, with a purpose of exploring the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy. This study is carried out on the basis of a Phase&#xD;
      IA multi-dose and dose-escalation study in Australia. All subjects will receive tislelizumab&#xD;
      until they have no evidence of continued clinical benefits, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of informed consent in the discretion of the investigator. Paraffin-embedded tumor&#xD;
      tissue will be collected for purpose of biomarker analysis.&#xD;
