  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of poor bone&#xD;
      and muscle health through a variety of factors, including underlying disease processes,&#xD;
      nutritional deficits, and reduced physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel disease can also delay the onset of puberty in children, and pubertal&#xD;
      development in adolescents, resulting in sub-optimal adult bone mass, therefore increasing&#xD;
      future risk of fractures and osteoporosis. High impact exercise may be a useful additional&#xD;
      therapy for adolescents with IBD, as the mechanical strains produced during this type of&#xD;
      exercise, through high force muscular contractions and ground reaction forces, can promote&#xD;
      bone formation and gains in muscle mass. There have been no previous studies assessing the&#xD;
      effects of high impact exercise in IBD, so it is unknown if this type of exercise is feasible&#xD;
      in this population. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a short term&#xD;
      jumping based exercise intervention for improving muscle and bone outcomes in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will incorporate a pilot/feasibility design, aiming to recruit a cohort of 15&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease patients of child and adolescent age (10 - 17.9 years). No control&#xD;
      group will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After potential recruits have contacted the study team to signal their interest in&#xD;
      participation, a member of the team will contact them to discuss details of the study in more&#xD;
      depth, and assess their suitability for participation against the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. If eligible, and willing to participate, they will be asked to attend a baseline&#xD;
      session (&lt;28 days prior to exercise intervention) during which they will be afforded the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask any questions they may have regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will last approximately 1.5 hours. Parent/guardian will also be encouraged to ask&#xD;
      any questions they may have. Fully informed written consent with be obtained from the&#xD;
      participant's parent/guardian if aged under 16 years, and written informed consent (or&#xD;
      assent, depending on competence) will also be taken from the participant. A baseline blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected at this session by a research nurse. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      range of questionnaires regarding quality of life (IMPACT III, PedsQL Generic Core Scale),&#xD;
      fatigue (PedsQL Multidimensional fatigue scale), self-efficacy for exercise. A member of the&#xD;
      study team will measure disease activity using a clinical questionnaire (wPCDAI, PUCAI).&#xD;
      Demographic and disease history data, and physical measurements including height, sitting&#xD;
      height, weight, body composition (bio-electrical impedance) will also be collected.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided a wrist-worn accelerometer to measure their habitual physical&#xD;
      activity for the proceeding seven days, which they will be instructed to return in a provided&#xD;
      pre-paid envelope. A kit will be given for participant to provide a stool sample, to be&#xD;
      brought to the following study visit. The exercise intervention will consist of four weeks of&#xD;
      three jumping based exercise sessions per week. These sessions will involve basic jumping&#xD;
      movements, with approximately 50-100 jumps per session; incorporating 20-30 minutes of&#xD;
      exercise. Participants will be requested to attend a one hour face-to-face session at the&#xD;
      beginning of each intervention week so a member of the study team can teach them safe and&#xD;
      correct execution of each of the prescribed movements for that week. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with an exercise log diary in which they can record adherence to each session, and&#xD;
      detail if they have experienced any pain or falls (adverse events), or if anything has&#xD;
      prevented them from participating in the prescribed session. Should they be unable to attend&#xD;
      any face-to-face session, the exercise diary contains details of the prescribed exercises,&#xD;
      and how to perform them. A member of the research team will make telephone contact with&#xD;
      research participants and their parent/guardian once per week throughout the four weeks, on&#xD;
      any week that they do not attend a face to face exercise session. As a minimum, participants&#xD;
      will be expected to attend their first exercise session face-to-face with a member of the&#xD;
      research team. Participants will be requested to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer throughout&#xD;
      the intervention period, which will be routinely downloaded at each face-to-face session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be completed &lt;14 days post-intervention, at which all of the&#xD;
      measurements from the baseline visit will be conducted again (excluding height, habitual&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
