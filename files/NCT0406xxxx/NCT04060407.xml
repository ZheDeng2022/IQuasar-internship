  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II clinical trial to test safety and efficacy of combining CD24Fc with&#xD;
      ipilimumab and nivolumab to decrease irAE, with built-in interim analyses, and safety and&#xD;
      response stopping rules.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/II clinical trial using a fixed recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CD24Fc&#xD;
      to explore the safety and efficacy of combining CD24Fc with ipilimumab and nivolumab to&#xD;
      reduce the toxicity of immunotherapy combination, in patients who are naïve to anti-PD1/L1&#xD;
      based checkpoint inhibitors. The dosing of nivolumab and ipilimumab will be fixed at FDA&#xD;
      approved levels for each indication. Dosing of the drugs will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other discontinuation criterion is met. Patients&#xD;
      who complete 12 months on study treatment and demonstrate clinical benefit with manageable&#xD;
      toxicity will be given the opportunity to continue treatment for another 12 months upon&#xD;
      agreement between investigator and drug manufacturers.&#xD;

&#xD;

             that can be adequately documented with a picture and a ruler even if they do not meet&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients must have lesion accessible for sequential biopsy (core needle biopsy or&#xD;

             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

             unstable, symptomatic lesions). However, patients treated with stereotactic therapy or&#xD;
             surgery are eligible if they remain without clinical evidence of disease progression&#xD;
             in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to C1D1.&#xD;
