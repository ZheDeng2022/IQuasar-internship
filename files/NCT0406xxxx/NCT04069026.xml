  <brief_title>A First-in-Humans Dose Finding Study for an Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Inhibitor (AhRi) in Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to gather relevant information regarding the safety of&#xD;
      BAY2416964 and how well the drug works in participants with a type of solid tumors that&#xD;
      cannot be cured by currently available drugs. Researchers want to find the highest dose of&#xD;
      BAY2416964 that participants could take without having too many side effects, how the drug is&#xD;
      tolerated and the way the body absorbs, distributes and gets rid of the study dug. BAY2416964&#xD;
      is a small molecule which blocks the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (a protein involved in immune&#xD;
      cell reaction to tumor cells) allowing the body to use its immune response against the tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
