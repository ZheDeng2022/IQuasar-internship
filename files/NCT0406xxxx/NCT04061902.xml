      Patients that are involved in their health care is associated with improved treatment&#xD;
      outcomes, rehabilitation and recovery. In this research project we aim to assess patient&#xD;
      participation among patients who had surgery for liver, bile duct (cholangiocarcinoma) and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer and follow a fast-track recovery program.&#xD;

      Implementation of Fast-track surgery programs for patients with tumors in the upper GI-tract&#xD;
      are steadily increasing because of the decreased costs, shorter hospital stays and a decrease&#xD;
      in morbidity, mortality and post-operative complications associated with Fast-track programs.&#xD;
      The health care team follows a standardized care program consisting of a check list with&#xD;
      day-to-day evidence based procedures which reduces postoperative complications. Postoperative&#xD;
      recovery is described as a process in which patients strive for a return to a normalized&#xD;
      daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major surgeries are associated with pain, nausea, postoperative ileus , fatigue,&#xD;
      post-operative complications such as wound infections , heart or lung dysfunctions and&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications. In the last 20 years perioperative care, anesthesia and surgery&#xD;
      for patients suffering from tumors has developed greatly. This has led to development and&#xD;
      evaluation of concepts to enhance the patients recovery after different types of surgery.&#xD;
      Fast-track surgery concepts results in decreased morbidity and enhanced recovery by&#xD;
      implemented evidence based principles in analgesia, anesthesia, fluid management, nutrition,&#xD;
      ambulation, minimal invasive surgery and reduction of surgical stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there's been a shift in focus of patient care. Patients are moving from a&#xD;
      passive role to being more participant in their care. In Sweden, patients have the legal&#xD;
      right to participate in their own care, and health care should be individualized for each&#xD;
      patient's needs and abilities. Being involved in your own health care contributes to&#xD;
      increased motivation and an improvement of the situation. This may in some cases lead to&#xD;
      better treatment outcomes and greater satisfaction with the given care. A severe symptom&#xD;
      burden can make the patient a passive recipient of health care without initiative or strength&#xD;
      to be involved in the care. In patients with malignancies of the upper gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      monitoring and symptom relief of importance to stimulate opportunities for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate and describe patient participation among patients who had surgery for liver,&#xD;
      bile duct (cholangiocarcinoma) and pancreatic cancer and follow a fast-track recovery&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and describe patient participation in patients who follow a fast track-care&#xD;
           concept&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore patients experiences of patient participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify, describe and evaluate patient assessed health related quality of life; and&#xD;
           relations with patient participation&#xD;

    <description>Higher clinical significant score in the subscale Treatment planning in a questionnarie to measure patient participation (Arnetz et al). All scale items ask the patient to rate a specific statement on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (no, not at all) to 4 (yes, to a great degree). For all scales, higher scores indicate more positive ratings.</description>
