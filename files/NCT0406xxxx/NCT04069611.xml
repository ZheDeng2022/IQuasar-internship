  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and microbiological performance of a&#xD;
      probiotic formulation (Sunstar GUM Periobalance) as adjunctive to non-surgical periodontal&#xD;
      therapy in patients with diabetes. The null hypothesis is that the adjunctive use of this&#xD;
      probiotic formulation would not have any additional benefit over scaling and root planning in&#xD;
      the number of residual pockets or in the microbiological impact of the treatment. Conversely,&#xD;
      the alternative hypothesis is that the adjunctive use of this formulation would improve the&#xD;
      clinical results of non-surgical periodontal therapy when compared to scaling and root&#xD;
      planing alone, through a modification of the subgingival biofilm composition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes patients will be consecutively selected among those attending the Faculty of&#xD;
      Odontology, University Complutense (Madrid, Spain). Patients fulfilling the required criteria&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the study, will be informed on the study purposes, and will&#xD;
      be invited to sign and IRB approved informed consent.The study will be designed as a&#xD;
      doubled-blind, placebo controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial with a 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. The patients will be examined for clinical parameters and microbiological&#xD;
      sampling, and randomised into two different groups.The following study visits will be&#xD;
      scheduled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit Potential patient eligibility will be based on the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria already presented. Patients will be informed about their periodontal condition and&#xD;
      treatment needs. Patients willing to participate in the study will be given additional&#xD;
      information about the study and upon signing a consent form, they will be appointed for the&#xD;
      graduate clinic of Periodontology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit Patients will undergo a comprehensive oral and periodontal examination.&#xD;
      Full-mouth clinical measurements of PPD and clinical attachment level (CAL) will be taken at&#xD;
      6 sites per tooth, excluding third molars, and will be rounded to the nearest millimetre&#xD;
      using a UNC-15 probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). Panoramic radiographs and/or full-mouth&#xD;
      periapical radiographs will also be taken, as standard procedures of the postgraduate clinic.&#xD;
      Microbiological samples will be taken. The patient smoking history will be recorded and&#xD;
      participants will be categorized as: current smokers (those who smoked at least one cigarette&#xD;
      per day); never smokers (those who had never smoked in their life); and former smokers (those&#xD;
      who had stopped smoking at least 1 year previously). Other relevant aspects of the medical&#xD;
      history will be also collected, including the evaluation of the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)&#xD;
      levels by means of standard laboratory procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment visits Subjects will receive non-surgical periodontal therapy in the form of&#xD;
      full-mouth SRP, in two consecutive days, in combination with 0.12% chlorhexidine (Gum&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine Oral Rinse, Etoy, Switzerland) application by means of rinsing prior to and at&#xD;
      the end of each SRP session. All patients will receive standardized oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions, including the use of a manual toothbrush (GUM® Activital Toothbrush), and&#xD;
      interdental brushers (GUM® Trav-ler and GUM® Soft Picks). Instructions will be periodically&#xD;
      reinforced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after oral hygiene instructions, patients will be randomly allocated to the test&#xD;
      or control groups. One investigator before patient recruitment will generate the&#xD;
      randomization sequence by blocks. Random assignment into two groups will be carried out with&#xD;
      the use of a computer program. Containers will be designed to maintain examiner blinding. The&#xD;
      patients will be randomly allocated, with the help of a computer, in two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test group: Subjects in the test group will take two probiotic lozenges per day for 3&#xD;
           months (one in the morning and one in the afternoon after brushing their teeth),&#xD;
           starting after the last session of SRP. Lozenges will contain L. reuteri (2 x 108 colony&#xD;
           forming units/tablet of strains ATCC 55730 and ATCC PTA 5289; Sunstar GUM Periobalance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo group: Subjects assigned to the placebo group will take lozenges exactly like&#xD;
           the test ones but without bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits after 3 and 6 months Follow up visits will have the objective to monitor the&#xD;
      clinical and microbiological changes in the periodontal condition and to evaluate the&#xD;
      bacterial re-colonization pattern in the subgingival niche. This phase will include two&#xD;
      recall visits, at which clinical measurements will be repeated and microbiological samples&#xD;
      will be collected. Oral hygiene will be reinforced. Glycated haemoglobin levels will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
