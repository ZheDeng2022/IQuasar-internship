  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few medications are currently Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and those that are have, on average, modest effects on drinking.&#xD;
      &quot;Precision medicine&quot; research has explored whether patient-level variables, such as genetic&#xD;
      variation, may identify subgroups of individuals with larger medication effects, but few&#xD;
      findings have been replicated. A promising novel medication for AUD is brexpiprazole (BREX),&#xD;
      a serotonin/dopamine activity modulator (SDAM). The investigators conducted a prior study in&#xD;
      which the effects of another SDAM, aripiprazole, were influenced by genetic variation in the&#xD;
      gene encoding the dopamine transporter (DAT1). This study will evaluate the effects of two&#xD;
      doses of BREX, relative to placebo, among non-treatment-seeking individuals with AUD, and&#xD;
      will test whether DAT1 genotype influences these effects. Primary outcomes are drinking under&#xD;
      natural conditions and in a laboratory paradigm. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      will be used to explore whether BREX effects on brain activation associated with cognitive&#xD;
      control or elicited by alcohol cues accounts for its effects on drinking. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that BREX, relative to placebo, will reduce drinking under natural conditions and&#xD;
      in the lab, and will do so to a greater extent among individuals who carry the DAT1 9-repeat&#xD;
      allele, relative to those homozygous for the 10-repeat allele. If these hypotheses are&#xD;
      supported, BREX may represent a novel pharmacogenetic treatment for AUD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis of this study is that brexpiprazole (BREX) (2 or 4 mg/day),&#xD;
      relative to placebo, will reduce alcohol consumption and modulate the neural substrates of&#xD;
      moderate-severe Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and that genotype at a variable number tandem&#xD;
      repeat polymorphism (VNTR) in the DAT1/SLC6A3 gene will predict BREX effects. Participants&#xD;
      will be non-treatment-seeking AUD individuals, and will be prospectively randomized to&#xD;
      medication on the basis of their DAT1 VNTR genotype. Since BREX affects both cortical and&#xD;
      striatal neurophysiology, the investigators will use functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) to test its effects on cortical (right inferior frontal gyrus; rIFG) activation&#xD;
      associated with response inhibition and on striatal activation elicited by alcohol cues, and&#xD;
      will explore whether either of these measures mediates BREX effects on drinking in the&#xD;
      natural environment vs. a bar-lab setting, which may reflect different aspects of lost&#xD;
      control over drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test BREX effects on inhibition-related cortical activation and alcohol cue-elicited&#xD;
      striatal activation, and evaluate whether DAT1 VNTR genotype predicts these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: There will be a linear effect of BREX dose, relative to placebo, in increasing&#xD;
      inhibition-related rIFG activation and reducing cue-elicited ventral striatum (VS)&#xD;
      activation, and these effects will be greater among DAT1 9R carriers than 10R homozygotes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test BREX effects on drinking in the natural environment and alcohol&#xD;
      self-administration in the bar lab, and evaluate whether DAT1 VNTR genotype predicts these&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: There will be a linear effect of BREX dose, relative to placebo, in reducing&#xD;
      natural drinking and alcohol self-administration, and these effects will be greater among&#xD;
      DAT1 9R carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test inhibition-related cortical activation and cue-elicited VS activation as&#xD;
      mechanisms of action for BREX's effects on natural and bar-lab drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Cue-elicited VS activation will mediate BREX effects on natural drinking, while&#xD;
      inhibition-related rIFG activation will mediate its effects on bar-lab drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit up to 250 study participants with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) who are&#xD;
      not seeking treatment for AUD. Individuals will complete an initial phone screen to assess&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria that can be determined over the phone, and eligible participants&#xD;
      will subsequently be scheduled for an in-person screening session. After giving informed&#xD;
      consent, participants will complete a medical screening and psychiatric assessment, and&#xD;
      biological samples (blood and urine) will be collected. Participants who remain eligible&#xD;
      after this screening session will be randomly assigned to take one of two doses of&#xD;
      brexpiprazole (2 milligram (mg) or 4 mg per day) or matched placebo for 14 days. Both&#xD;
      investigators and participants will be blind to medication group assignments. After the&#xD;
      in-person screening session, there are five study visits. 1) Day 1 of study medication:&#xD;
      participants will complete a one-hour-long functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain&#xD;
      scan and take the first dose of study medication. 2) Day 7: participants will return to the&#xD;
      lab for a brief check-in at which medication side effects will be assessed. 3) Day 13: blood&#xD;
      and urine samples will be collected again; participants will take that day's dose of&#xD;
      medication in the lab and then complete another one-hour-long fMRI brain scan. 4) Day 14:&#xD;
      participants will take the last dose of medication in the lab and then complete a day-long&#xD;
      procedure in which alcohol will be administered. 5) Day 15: participants will be debriefed&#xD;
      and compensated $600 for study participation.&#xD;
