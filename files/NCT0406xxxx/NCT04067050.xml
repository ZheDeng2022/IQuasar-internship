      The aim of this work is to investigate the clinical performance and subjective acceptance of&#xD;
      the comfilcon A asphere contact lens when compared to single-vision spectacles in subjects&#xD;
      who have never worn contact lenses and who use digital devices (such as phones, tablets,&#xD;
      laptops, desktop computers) for at least 4 hours per day on at least 5 days per week.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are between 18 and 35 years of age (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to sign a&#xD;
             Statement of Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are willing and able to follow the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are a 'neophyte' (i.e. someone who has not worn contact lenses previously, with&#xD;
             the exception for the purposes of a trial fitting, lasting up to one week).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a contact lens spherical prescription between -1.00 to -6.25D (inclusive)&#xD;
             based on the ocular refraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a cylindrical correction of -0.875DC or less in each eye based on the ocular&#xD;
             refraction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They own and habitually wear single vision spectacles used for both distance and near&#xD;
             vision, including computer and digital device use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Their single vision spectacles have a mean sphere equivalent within ±0.50D of that of&#xD;
             the refraction found in the study for each eye (after having taken lens effectivity&#xD;
             into account).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are willing to be fitted with contact lenses and understand they may be&#xD;
             randomized to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are willing to wear the contact lenses (if relevant) or spectacles for at least 8&#xD;
             hours per day, 5 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They typically use digital devices for a minimum of 4 hours per day, 5 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They agree not to change the spectacles they will wear for digital device use for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are using any topical medication such as eye drops (including comfort drops) or&#xD;
             ointment on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The spectacles they use for digital device viewing on the study have been made with&#xD;
             specialist features for computer use, digital eye fatigue or are multifocal/bifocal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are aphakic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have had corneal refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or&#xD;
             have keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any&#xD;
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic&#xD;
             reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have evidence of a heterotropia or decompensating heterotropia on cover test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a history of having been prescribed prism in their spectacles (by self&#xD;
             report).&#xD;
