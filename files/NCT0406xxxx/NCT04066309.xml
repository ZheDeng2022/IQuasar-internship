  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prospectively collect clinical data to confirm the safety and&#xD;
      clinical performance of Neodent Titanium Base Abutment and Pro PEEK Abutment in daily dental&#xD;
      practice setting, by means of a randomized clinical study of prosthetic rehabilitation using&#xD;
      these devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 48 healed implant sites (at least 4 months post-extraction) shall be included&#xD;
      during the sample enrollment (24 patients), which will be randomly divided into two groups,&#xD;
      so that each patient receives one implant from each group (removal and non-removal of the&#xD;
      abutment placed at the time of surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 24 months after implant loading. It is expected that there is&#xD;
      no difference in peri-implant bone level change between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study protocol was reviewed and approved by an Ethics Committee (EC) in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated based on an alpha level of 5% and beta of 20% to detect a mean&#xD;
      intergroup difference of 0.2mm, with a standard deviation of 0.2mm, in peri-implant bone&#xD;
      level change 24 months after implant loading. Sample size calculation showed that a sample of&#xD;
      17 implants is needed for each group. With rate of 2 implants per patient and a &quot;worst-case&quot;&#xD;
      drop-out rate of 20%, a sample size of 24 patients resulting in an estimated number of 24&#xD;
      implants, in each group, is thought to be sufficient to allow statistical analysis of&#xD;
      clinical outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 48 healed implant sites (at least 4 months post-extraction) shall be prospectively&#xD;
      and consecutively selected during the sample enrollment (24 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning the studied variables will be collected in the following stages: Screening&#xD;
      (First visit); TP - Implant placement; TT - Impressions for temporary prosthesis confection&#xD;
      (2 ± 1 days prior to T0); T0 - Implant Loading (temporary prosthesis placement - 21 ± 1 days&#xD;
      after implant placement); TF - Impressions for final prosthesis confection (10 ± 1 business&#xD;
      days prior to T6); T2 - Final prosthesis placement (2 months ± 1 week after loading); T12 and&#xD;
      T24 - 12 and 24 months ± 1 month, respectively, after loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study groups, 4.0x10 mm Neodent GM Helix Implants will be placed 2mm subcrestally (in&#xD;
      relation to the buccal bone plate) in the posterior region of the maxilla, under local&#xD;
      anesthesia and with adequate bone bed preparation, as recommended by the manufacturer, using&#xD;
      the guided surgery technique. Two implants (one of each group) will be placed in the same&#xD;
      individual, to be restored by single prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 1, customizable healing abutments will be placed at the time of implant placement.&#xD;
      Twenty-one days later, the implants will be loaded by means of placement of temporary single&#xD;
      prostheses (early loading), fabricated with centric and eccentric occlusal contacts [1], over&#xD;
      temporary abutments (Pro PEEK Abutment). The final prosthesis will be delivered after a&#xD;
      2-months period of implant loading. Thus, digital models will be obtained (intraoral scanning&#xD;
      or conventional impression and model scanning) 10 ± 1 business days prior to T2 (TF) for the&#xD;
      confection of the final prostheses, to be placed over Titanium Bases and Zirconia Copings,&#xD;
      following the digital workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transgingival height of the Titanium Base shall be selected by the clinician so as to&#xD;
      leave, preferably, a distance greater than or equal to 2mm between the cementation line of&#xD;
      the Zirconia Coping over the Titanium Base and the cementation line of the prosthesis over&#xD;
      the Zirconia Coping due to assure better esthetics of the final prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 2, the final abutment will be placed at the time of surgery and will not be replaced&#xD;
      during the rehabilitation process. A Titanium Base and a Zirconia Coping will be placed over&#xD;
      the implant at TP, without loading (placement of an acrylic cap, without occlusal contact, to&#xD;
      cover the coping), planned using the initial intraoral scans. Implants will be restored&#xD;
      following the same time interval of Group 1, with temporary prosthesis placement in 21 days&#xD;
      after surgery, and with final prosthesis placement 2 months thereafter. The clinician shall&#xD;
      evaluate the need to re-prepare the Zirconia Coping edge line before obtaining the digital&#xD;
      models (intraoral scanning or conventional impression and model scanning) for prostheses&#xD;
      confection, in order to obtain the proper distance between the previously mentioned&#xD;
      cementation lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, prostheses' passivity, occlusal and interproximal adjustments shall be&#xD;
      checked, to avoid compromising the implant/prosthesis set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized digital periapical radiographs and close-up view photographs will be taken in an&#xD;
      usual daily practice frequency, as determined by the investigator to verify prostheses&#xD;
      setting and the osseointegration process. Computed tomography Scans will be obtained, in&#xD;
      addition to pre-surgery, at T2 for evaluation of clinical parameters and comparison with the&#xD;
      implant position planned by guided surgery.&#xD;
