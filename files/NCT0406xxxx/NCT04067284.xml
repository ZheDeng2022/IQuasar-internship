  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stunting contributes substantially to child mortality and disease burden in low-income&#xD;
      countries. In Bangladesh the prevalence of stunting among children &lt;5-years of age is high&#xD;
      (36%) reaching 50% in slum areas. The pathogenesis of stunting is multifaceted, yet&#xD;
      nutritional inadequacy and repeated infections are established risk factors of stunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three-arm randomized controlled trial in Dhaka's slum area is proposed. The children will&#xD;
      be recruited from vaccination clinics. Infants at risk of stunting (-1 SD length-for-age&#xD;
      z-score, LAZ) aged around 5 months are eligible for the study. Eligible children will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive: 1) nutrition education on dietary diversity; 2) a combination of&#xD;
      similar education plus daily supplementation of homemade yogurt; 3) a 'usual care' (control)&#xD;
      group. The investigators will recruit 120 children (40 per arm). Intervention will be&#xD;
      initiated a month before starting of complementary feeding with an educational session and&#xD;
      will last 7 months during which a monthly educational session will be delivered at&#xD;
      participant's household. The homemade yogurt supplementation will start a week after&#xD;
      beginning of 6 months of age once the child is introduced to solid foods of the mother's&#xD;
      choice. The yogurt will be supplied to the mothers every day at time of feeding. Feeding&#xD;
      behaviors will be self-monitored using a pictorial calendar. Primary outcome (LAZ) and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (fecal bio-markers, WAZ, head circumference, and food diversity scores),&#xD;
      will be measured at baseline (6 months), 9 months and 12 months of child age. Supplementation&#xD;
      with homemade yogurt is a novel approach with the potential to improve infant gut&#xD;
      environment, improve food absorption and thus potentially prevent stunting.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that, continued breastfeeding, adequate complimentary feeding&#xD;
      and supplementation with homemade yogurt have the potential to reduce stunting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is aimed to assess the impact of low-cost nutritional strategies to prevent&#xD;
      childhood malnutrition in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare differences in growth pattern (length-for-age z-score, weight-for age&#xD;
           z-score, head circumference) of children at risk of stunting age 6-months between&#xD;
           infants receiving educational program only, infants receiving education plus homemade&#xD;
           yogurt supplementation and those receiving the &quot;usual-care&quot; (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate whether amount of gut microbiota necessary to improve gut health was&#xD;
           associated with weight gain and growth in these children to support the casual mechanism&#xD;
           behind this approach.&#xD;
