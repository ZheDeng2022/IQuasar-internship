      In situ fenestration (ISF) could represent an alternative in the treatment of aorto-iliac&#xD;
      disease when usual techniques are not available. The aim of this study was to present the&#xD;
      results of ISF in aorto-iliac disease. Data will retrospectively be analyzed. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be: a surgical abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with an unsuitable anatomy for a&#xD;
      standard endograft, aorto-iliac occlusion with narrow distal aorta (&lt;14mm). Technically,&#xD;
      after placement of the endograft, a transjugular intrahepatic access set was used to perform&#xD;
      ISF. The hole was secondary enlarged using a cutting or non-compliant balloon. Finally, a&#xD;
      kissing stent was performed to the aorto- uni-iliac into a bifurcated endograft.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ISF are mainly described at the level of the aortic arch. Different means are reported to&#xD;
      perforate the graft: the mechanical (needles, transjugular intra hepatic access needles or&#xD;
      guidewires) or physical (laser and radiofrequency catheters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISF could be an alternative in the endovascular treatment of aorto iliac disease including&#xD;
      both occlusive and aneurysmal pathologies. In this cases, when a narrow distal aorta is&#xD;
      present conventional technique as CERAB, bifurcated endograft are challenging. In situ&#xD;
      fenestrations allows conversion of an aorto-uni-iliac endograft into a bifurcated endograft,&#xD;
      thereby avoiding crossover femorofemoral bypass and its complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to report the results of ISF technique at the level of the abdominal&#xD;
      aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will be: a surgical abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with an unsuitable&#xD;
      anatomy for a standard endograft, aorto-iliac occlusion with narrow distal aorta (&lt;14mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients had a preoperative CT scan to assess the anatomy of the abdominal aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received an oral antiplatelet agent(aspirin(75-250md/dl) or clopidogrel&#xD;
      (75md/dl) and a statin before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In situ fenestration technique The procedure was performed under general anesthesia and&#xD;
      guided with a mobile C-arm (Siemens). The less diseased and tortuous iliac axis was used to&#xD;
      introduce the endograft and the contralateral side as used for the in situ fenestration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever possible, the procedure was carried out percutaneously with the preclosure technique&#xD;
      using Proglide vascular devices for the two common femoral artery retrograde punctures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step consisted in placing an endograft from a retrograde femoral access. The&#xD;
      endograft was deployed in a standard fashion. The distal security wire was not released to&#xD;
      maintain the control on the distal part of the endograft and keep the graft straight while&#xD;
      performing the fenestration. A transjugular intrahepatic access needle was introduced in a 9F&#xD;
      Flexor introducer through a contralateral femoral access. When the top of the introducer was&#xD;
      at the level of the aortic bifurcation, the dilatator of the introducer was removed, and the&#xD;
      introducer was pushed up to the endograft. Contact between the introducer and the endograft&#xD;
      was ensured by observing a slight deformation of the endograft while pushing the introducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle was advanced and the endograft is punctured at the level of the aortic&#xD;
      bifurcation. The hole created was secondary enlarged using cutting or high pressure balloon.&#xD;
      A long sheath is advanced intro the fenestration to control the success of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A kissing stent using balloon expandable covered stents is finally performed to stabilize the&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control angiography confirm the patency of the stents and the absence of early endoleak in&#xD;
      case of endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm.&#xD;
