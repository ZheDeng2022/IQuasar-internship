  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a lymphangioproliferation associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8)&#xD;
      promoted by immunosuppression. HIV-related KS and iatrogenic posttransplantation KS are&#xD;
      treated by immune restoration, in association with local or systemic therapies as&#xD;
      chemotherapies if required. Conversely in classic and endemic KS, the underlying relative&#xD;
      immunosuppression cannot be directly targeted. Treatment is poorly codified, mostly based on&#xD;
      surgery or radiotherapy for localized KS. Most aggressive forms with visceral involvement are&#xD;
      treated with chemotherapies or interferon, which give at best 30-60% of transient responses&#xD;
      and may not be well tolerated in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talimogene laherparepvec is the first oncolytic immunotherapy approved by the FDA, in&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable melanoma with injectable nodal or cutaneous lesions. It is&#xD;
      designed to induce tumor regression of injected lesions through direct lytic effects, and of&#xD;
      uninjected lesions through induction of systemic antitumor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), another virus-induced tumor, treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 axis&#xD;
      inhibitors have proven efficacy, thus providing a proof of principle that immunotherapy could&#xD;
      be effective in virus-induced tumors. Two cases of metastatic MCC successfully treated with&#xD;
      talimogene laherparepvec were recently reported, suggesting that talimogene laherparepvec may&#xD;
      also be an effective therapeutic option. Considering the high immunogenicity of viral&#xD;
      epitopes in KS tumors, the role of the immune evasion in the development of KS, and the&#xD;
      cutaneous manifestations (&gt;90% of patients) that can be easily injected, classic and endemic&#xD;
      KS is a good tumor model to be targeted with talimogene laherparepvec. The main objective is&#xD;
      to assess whether talimogene laherparepvec is clinically inactive (partial+complete response&#xD;
      probability π0&lt;10%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1&gt;40%) in classic&#xD;
      and endemic Kaposi sarcoma.&#xD;
