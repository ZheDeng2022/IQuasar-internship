  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to determine feasibility and tolerance of the human body&#xD;
      to RFA associated with local immunomodulation carried out using a thermoreversible hydrogel&#xD;
      combined with 2 immunomodulators, GMCSF and Mifamurtide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint of the study is the feasibility, the frequency and the nature of per and&#xD;
      post-operative adverse events of the in situ injection of an immunomodulatory hydrogel after&#xD;
      radiofrequency of unresectable colorectal liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is one-year progression free survival rate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Early clinical trials of immunotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) have provided first&#xD;
      evidence of activity of adoptive cell vaccines combining inactivated autologous tumor cells&#xD;
      and BCG, a Toll Like Receptor (TLR) agonist. RFA induces tumor cell necrosis and apoptosis,&#xD;
      leading to the activation of anti-tumoral immunity through the release, exposure or&#xD;
      denaturation of tumor antigens, which are captured by dendritic cells. Associated&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory effects increase the anti-tumoral immune response but remain insufficient to&#xD;
      avoid recurrence. In a preclinical study in an aggressive rectal cancer model, complete and&#xD;
      long-lasting tumor responses were achieved after RFA combined with in situ injection of an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory hydrogel combining a TLR agonist and GM-CSF. These results were obtained&#xD;
      without further adjuvant therapy after complete clearance of macroscopic liver lesions by&#xD;
      RFA(1,2). BCG, bacteria Protein Derivatives can be used as TLR or NOD2 agonists. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of the study is that local immunotherapy may reduce recurrence rates after RFA in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable liver metastases from CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal ablation by RFA may be used as an inducer of anti-tumor immune response and the&#xD;
      combination with immunomodulators such as a TLR or NOD2 agonists and GM-CSF may improve its&#xD;
      efficacy. In the recent preclinical study, the efficacy has been demonstrated on distant&#xD;
      lesions (so-called abscopal effect) of two immunomodulators combined in a muco-adherent&#xD;
      hydrogel, injected in a RFA-treated tumor. The treatment was safe. Complete macroscopic&#xD;
      ablation by RFA combined with in situ immunomodulators may be able to prime an effective&#xD;
      immune response capable of eradicating the microscopic residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label, quasi-experimental, non-randomized, single-arm trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be included patients with unresectable colorectal hepatic metastases, without extra&#xD;
      hepatic localization. A complete clearance of lesions must be obtained by the use of&#xD;
      radiofrequency alone or combined with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will have complete destruction, by laparotomy, by radiofrequency alone or&#xD;
      associated with surgery of all the liver metastases detectable at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 patients meeting inclusion criteria and not exclusion ones will be included and expected&#xD;
      to be valuable patients. 3 subgroups of 4 patients each will receive an immunogel injection&#xD;
      in 1, 2 and 3 metastases respectively as dose escalation. The primary endpoints will be&#xD;
      collected in post-operative course until 3 months however, the patients will be followed in&#xD;
      the trial until 12 months after RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiofrequency of one, two or three lesions (dose escalation) selected on preoperative&#xD;
      imaging, will be followed by injection, under ultrasound control via a coaxial device, of 5&#xD;
      ml (lesion &lt; 2 cm) or 10 ml (lesion ≥ 2 cm) of thermoreversible gel vectorising 2&#xD;
      immunomodulators, mifamurtide (8 µg / ml) and GMCSF (25 µg / ml). The choice of mifamurtide,&#xD;
      the liposomal form of the smallest synthetic immunogenic derivative of the wall of&#xD;
      mycobacteria, is justified by the need to replace BCG, used in preclinical studies, by an&#xD;
      inert immunomodulator. This compound has demonstrated its clinical efficacy in anti-tumor&#xD;
      immunotherapy. GMCSF was largely used in antitumor immunotherapies studies and platforms.&#xD;
