  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of cervical cancer with cervical screening (gynecological cell test) is one of the&#xD;
      most successful screening activities in medicine. In Sweden screening has taken place since&#xD;
      the 1960s and prevented tens of thousands of women from having cervical cancer. There are&#xD;
      strong reasons why it is especially important to promote that invitations to sampling really&#xD;
      is reaching out. The women who regularly attend screening after the invitation reduce their&#xD;
      risk of cervical cancer by as much as 90%. Of the women who currently have cervical cancer&#xD;
      (about 550 women per year in Sweden), as many as 38% did not participate in the screening.&#xD;
      Invitations for screening are sent to the entire population in Sweden aged 23-70. Current&#xD;
      national estimate of how many in the population participating as recommended is 82.9% of the&#xD;
      population. In addition, many women sometimes participate (they then get some reduced cancer&#xD;
      risk). The highest cancer risk is among those women who have never participated as well as&#xD;
      women who have had cell changes but have not participated. Cervical cancer is the first form&#xD;
      of cancer for which there are approved molecular screening tests (HPV test). Unlike the older&#xD;
      screening method (cytology), it works great to take a cervical sample at home if the sample&#xD;
      is to be analyzed for HPV (the analysis method is so sensitive that it does not matter if the&#xD;
      sample is not optimally taken).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitations and reminders about cervical screening are today sent out with physical letters&#xD;
      (about 3 million letters per year in Sweden). These dispatches involve waste of resources and&#xD;
      has a negative environmental impact. Regarding reminders, we have seen in previous research&#xD;
      that the effect is not optimal. When sending a physical reminder letter to women who have not&#xD;
      participated in more than 10 years (current routine), only 2% of the women recalled came for&#xD;
      sampling. Reminders with SMS are now standard for many businesses in society, such as car&#xD;
      testing or dental appointments. It is inexpensive, saves the environment and there are&#xD;
      studies that suggest it is more effective than sending physical letters. In this study, we&#xD;
      intend to investigate whether SMS reminders for screening lead to increased participation and&#xD;
      thus to a higher proportion of detected, treatable precursors of cervical cancer compared to&#xD;
      before.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-participation in the cervical screening program is the main risk factor for cervical&#xD;
      cancer. Therefore it is important to reduce barriers to screening and facilitate&#xD;
      participation in the screening program of cervical cancer. Offering self-sampling kits for&#xD;
      human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been examined in several research studies as a way to&#xD;
      reach women who have not responded to screening invitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether SMS reminders for screening attendance&#xD;
      will increase participation compared to the current method where reminders are sent out with&#xD;
      physical letters. In this study, approximately 20,000 women with high risk of developing&#xD;
      cervical cancer, due to not fully participating in screening, will be invited. The women&#xD;
      receive an SMS offer to request a self-sampling kit via the internet. The self-sampling kit&#xD;
      comes with an instruction on how to take the sample and a postage-free answer envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submitted samples are analyzed with an approved and accredited method (Cobas 4800, Roche)&#xD;
      that analyzes for HPV 16, HPV18 and other carcinogens HPV types.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For those women who are at the highest risk (previous glandular cell changes without&#xD;
           follow-up), all HPV-positive women are referred via SMS directly to a women's clinic for&#xD;
           investigation. HPV-negative women in this group have no increased risk and receive a&#xD;
           text message with a calming message.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women of an age above the screening program but who have either had a cell change that&#xD;
           is not followed up or who have not participated at all in the last 10 years are treated&#xD;
           in the same way as in paragraph 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finally, the women of screening age who have not taken a cell sample for more than 15&#xD;
           years are identified. This group receive an SMS and HPV-positive women are referred, via&#xD;
           SMS, for renewed sampling by a specially trained so-called dysplasia midwife. The sample&#xD;
           is now being analyzed for both cytology and HPV. If the woman is HPV positive in both&#xD;
           tests and in the case of deviating cytology, the woman is referred to a women's clinic.&#xD;
           In other cases a text message with a reassuring message is sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the usual level of confidence (p &lt;0.05 two-sided) and statistical power (80%)&#xD;
      the ability to demonstrate an increase of participation by 3 times or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be piloted in the Region of Sk√•ne in 2019 and then rolled out nationally in&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
