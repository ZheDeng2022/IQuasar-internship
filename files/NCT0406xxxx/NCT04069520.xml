      The purpose of this proposal is to determine the neural mechanisms of augmented neuromuscular&#xD;
      training (aNMT). Participants will complete a 6-week course of neuromuscular training with&#xD;
      either aNMT biofeedback or sham biofeedback. An MRI will be performed before and after the&#xD;
      training program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common and debilitating knee injury affecting&#xD;
      over 350,000 children or young adults each year, drastically reducing their chances for an&#xD;
      active and healthy life. Annual direct costs exceed $13 billion, and the long-term indirect&#xD;
      costs far exceed that figure, as ACL injury is also linked to accelerated development of&#xD;
      disabling osteoarthritis within a few years after injury. The National Public Health Agenda&#xD;
      for Osteoarthritis recommends expanding and refining evidence-based ACL injury prevention to&#xD;
      reduce this burden. The investigators have identified modifiable risk factors that predict&#xD;
      ACL injury in young female athletes. This neuromuscular training targets those factors and&#xD;
      shows statistical efficacy in high-risk athletes, but meaningful transfer of low-risk&#xD;
      mechanics to the field of play has been limited, as current approaches are not yet decreasing&#xD;
      national ACL injury rates in young female athletes. The key gap is how to target mechanisms&#xD;
      that allow transfer of risk-reducing motor control strategies from the intervention to the&#xD;
      athletic field. The mechanisms that ultimately make such transfer possible are neural, but&#xD;
      thus far injury prevention training focusing on neuromuscular control has not utilized neural&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators published and new preliminary data on neuroplasticity related to&#xD;
      injury and neuromuscular training demonstrate the proficiency to capture these neural&#xD;
      outcomes and future capability to target these neural mechanisms to improve the rate of motor&#xD;
      transfer. The data support this proposal's central hypothesis that increased sensory, visual&#xD;
      and motor planning activity to improve motor cortex efficiency is the neural mechanism of&#xD;
      adaptation transfer to realistic scenarios. The ability to target the neural mechanisms to&#xD;
      increase risk-reducing motor transfer from the clinic to the world could revolutionize ACL&#xD;
      injury prevention. The transformative, positive impact of such innovative strategies will&#xD;
      enhance the delivery of biofeedback to optimize training and increase the potential for sport&#xD;
      transfer. This contribution will be significant for ACL injury prevention and associated&#xD;
      long-term sequelae in young females. This unique opportunity to enhance ACL injury prevention&#xD;
      by targeting neural mechanisms of neuromuscular adaptation and transfer will reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of injuries that cause costly and long-term disabling osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from the parent study &quot;Real-time Sensorimotor Feedback for Injury Prevention&#xD;
      Assessed in Virtual Reality&quot; will be eligible to participate in this study. In the parent&#xD;
      study, participants are randomized to receive augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT) or sham&#xD;
      biofeedback training. Enrolled participants will complete MRI testing before and after the&#xD;
      study training program. The entire MRI protocol will include high resolution T1-weighted 3D&#xD;
      images, a 61 direction diffusion tensor imaging sequence, resting state functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI), and task-based fMRI. The fMRI tasks will be focused on motor&#xD;
      function, participants will be asked to complete lower extremity movements including knee&#xD;
      flexion and extension and a combined hip and knee flexion and extension.&#xD;

    <description>aNMT biofeedback is created by calculating kinematic and kinetic data in real-time from the athlete's own movements. These values determine realtime transformations of the stimulus shape the athlete views via augmented-reality (AR) glasses during movement performance. The athlete's task is to move so as to create (&quot;animate&quot;) a particular stimulus shape that corresponds to desired values of the biomechanical parameters targeted by the intervention. The aNMT biofeedback occurs during neuromuscular training sessions. The neuromuscular training is a 12-week, pre-season training program occurring over 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>Sham biofeedback provides a similar phenomenological experience to aNMT biofeedback for athletes-both groups experience a shape that changes with their movements-but the sham biofeedback will not provide usable information to modify movement parameters during critical movement phases. The sham biofeedback occurs during neuromuscular training sessions. The neuromuscular training is a 12-week, pre-season training program occurring over 6 weeks.</description>
