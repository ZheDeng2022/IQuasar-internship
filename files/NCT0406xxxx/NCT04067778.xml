  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if random biopsies can be safely eliminated from screening of average risk&#xD;
      persons with IBD, the investigators propose to carry out a pilot randomized control trial in&#xD;
      which targeted biopsies in combination with random biopsies will be compared to targeted&#xD;
      biopsies alone in terms of pre-cancerous lesion capture rate, side-effects and CRC risk. The&#xD;
      pilot study will aim to capture 20% of the overall study population in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of recruiting the needed number of participants in the specified time frame,&#xD;
      while maintaining high quality of data collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), including crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a&#xD;
      group of diseases characterized by acute and chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract.&#xD;
      Persons with IBD are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) and require&#xD;
      frequent CRC screening with colonoscopy. Current IBD screening guidelines recommend the&#xD;
      taking of biopsies of any lesions suspected to be pre-cancerous (targeted biopsies), as well&#xD;
      as the taking of 30 to 40 random biopsies throughout the colon. The recommendations for&#xD;
      random biopsies are based on historical practice and the theory that they would capture&#xD;
      &quot;invisible lesions&quot;, but are not supported by strong scientific evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, recent evidence has shown that random biopsies capture a very small number of&#xD;
      pre-cancerous lesions and that they capture such lesions only in persons with additional risk&#xD;
      factors for CRC. In addition, new colonoscopy practices and technology have made 80-90% of&#xD;
      pre-cancerous lesions visible. Random biopsies also carry potential risks for patients,&#xD;
      including lower gastrointestinal bleeding and bowel perforation, and substantially increase&#xD;
      procedural costs and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, there is a strong impetus to conduct a well-powered non-inferiority Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trial (RCT) on this topic in a Canadian setting. With the support of a&#xD;
      pan-Canadian IBD clinical trials alliance (the Canadian IBD Research Consortium (CIRC)), and&#xD;
      the high prevalence of IBD in Canada, Canadian investigators are well-positioned to undertake&#xD;
      such a trial. Before embarking on a large multi-center trial, a one-year pilot feasibility&#xD;
      trial will be conducted to ensure that patients can be enrolled efficiently with excellent&#xD;
      protocol compliance. A feasibility trial will also provide a crude estimate of the neoplasia&#xD;
      detection rate (primary outcome) among persons with colon IBD (cIBD) in Canada, which will&#xD;
      allow refinement of the sample size, recruitment period and budget for a definitive trial.&#xD;
      To-date, no well-powered or North American RCTs have evaluated random biopsies as an&#xD;
      intervention to guide our estimates for a definitive trial.&#xD;
