      Our proposed study will: provide a novel exploration of facilitators and barriers to PrEP;&#xD;
      allow us to target hard to reach populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM) and&#xD;
      substance users (both of which are top funding priority groups for the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health) who experience intersecting markers of HIV risk; and inform regional, and possibly&#xD;
      national, intervention approaches to combat the overlapping epidemic of HIV and&#xD;
      incarceration.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project associated with this protocol are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Perform a qualitative assessment of facilitators and barriers to PrEP uptake among&#xD;
      high-risk jail detainees, systems and interactor levels. To achieve this aim the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct qualitative interviews with three distinct groups of stakeholders:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systems interviews (n=6);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interactor interviews (n=8); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Individual Key Informant interviews (n=20). Within each of these strata, the&#xD;
           investigators aim to collect data representing diverse perspectives with respect to&#xD;
           interest, knowledge, attitudes, and barriers (including substance use) to PrEP uptake.&#xD;
           The investigators will also explore the acceptability and feasibility of an intervention&#xD;
           to link individuals being released from the Pulaski County jail to PrEP services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this protocol, Aims 2 and 3 are identical in terms of participant&#xD;
      recruitment, enrollment and all study procedures (including data collection and participant&#xD;
      follow up). The primary objective of Aim 2 is to conduct a small pilot of the intervention&#xD;
      study in order to make any necessary changes to any aspect of the study procedures. If any&#xD;
      changes are made, those changes will be submitted to the IRB for further review and approval&#xD;
      prior to initiating Aim 3. If no changes are made, this IRB protocol will serve as the&#xD;
      protocol for both Aims 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Develop the PrEP-LINK intervention and perform an open-label evaluation with AA&#xD;
      high-risk HIV negative individuals being discharged from the Pulaski County Jail. Directly&#xD;
      informed from formative work (Aim 1), the investigators will develop the PrEP-LINK&#xD;
      intervention, which will include the use of a community health worker (CHW) and adherence&#xD;
      counseling (based on ADAPT-ITT) approach to enhance PrEP care and overcome barriers to uptake&#xD;
      in this population. The investigators will then perform an open pilot with jail detainees&#xD;
      recently released from the Pulaski County Jail to evaluate the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Conduct a pilot RCT of the PrEP-LINK intervention among high-risk HIV negative&#xD;
      individuals being released from the Pulaski County Jail. Based on the formative work in Aim 1&#xD;
      and open pilot evaluation in Aim 2, participants will be randomized to either the PrEP-LINK&#xD;
      intervention, or enhanced standard of care arm. Both arms will receive education about PrEP&#xD;
      and referral to a community PrEP provider which exceeds the standards of care these&#xD;
      individuals would otherwise receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the investigators will develop the CHW intervention as part of Aim 2, this will be&#xD;
      informed by work the investigators have already completed through Aim 1, which was approved&#xD;
      under a separate IRB protocol (#207297). Once the investigators have finalized the&#xD;
      intervention content, the investigators will conduct the Aim 2 open-label evaluation in the&#xD;
      exact same way as the investigators will conduct the Aim 3 pilot RCT. To reiterate, the&#xD;
      rationale of the open-label evaluation proposed in Aim 2 is to ensure that the intervention&#xD;
      is appropriate and does not need additional revision prior to conducting the Aim 3 RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Community Health Worker (CHW) Intervention (Aims 2 and 3): The&#xD;
      intervention arm in both Aims 2 and 3 will receive additional support by a community health&#xD;
      worker (CHW) who will assist with healthcare and social service navigation and will utilize&#xD;
      adherence counseling techniques. The CHW the investigators are employing is Ms. Ruby Welch,&#xD;
      who is a trained CHW with a strong knowledge base of both healthcare and social service&#xD;
      systems in the greater Little Rock area. As per the model our intervention is based upon (the&#xD;
      national Transitions Clinic Network [TCN], which has 14 sites across the country), Ms. Welch&#xD;
      has a history of incarceration. Therefore, she can serve as a true peer to individuals who&#xD;
      are enrolled into the study. The national TCN sites employ formerly incarcerated CHWs because&#xD;
      these individuals are often able to develop close relationships with their peers who have&#xD;
      also been formerly incarcerated thereby building a strong foundation of trust among a&#xD;
      population with high levels of distrust of the medical system. Ms. Welch has received&#xD;
      training from the national TCN coordinating center in San Francisco. In addition, Ms. Welch&#xD;
      has been certified in HIV testing and risk reduction counseling. She has also received&#xD;
      training from an Arkansas Department of Health consultant who is an expert in HIV PrEP&#xD;
      adherence. For participants randomized to the intervention group, Ms. Welch will assist&#xD;
      individuals with employment, housing (if needed), referrals to mental health or substance use&#xD;
      treatment, keeping track of medical appointments and medication adherence. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that Ms. Welch will be in contact with intervention arm participants at least once&#xD;
      per week but the exact amount of contact for each participant will vary based on needs. Ms.&#xD;
      Welch will be available during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 9 AM until 5 PM). If&#xD;
      participants present to Ms. Welch in crisis, she will refer them immediately to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department, in the event of a medical or behavioral health emergency or the Pulaski County&#xD;
      Regional Crisis Stabilization Center, which is operated by the UAMS Psychiatric Research&#xD;
      Institute (PRI). Ms. Welch will be directly supervised by PI Dr. Zaller through weekly&#xD;
      supervision meetings and biweekly phone check-ins. Frequency of check-in may increase or&#xD;
      decrease, as needed, during the course of the study period. Ms. Welch is considered research&#xD;
      staff and has been trained in human subjects through the UAMS CITI program.&#xD;
