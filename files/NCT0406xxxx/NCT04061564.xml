      This is a proof of concept randomised placebo controlled crossover trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation on a stress model of increased intestinal&#xD;
      permeability in healthy human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal permeability perturbation is a phenomenon which is being increasingly recognised&#xD;
      as a contributing factor to a multitude of diseases - including inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
      (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There are currently limited effective treatment&#xD;
      methods known to improve this intestinal permeability perturbation and the use of vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation would present itself as an inexpensive, non-invasive and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      method of reversing this dysfunction. Vagal nerve stimulation efficacy in reversing stress&#xD;
      related intestinal barrier dysfunction is available from proof of concept animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mechanistic project is an important first step in this field of research and will serve&#xD;
      as a basis for further research into the role of vagal nerve stimulation in intestinal&#xD;
      barrier dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress - a state which evokes a 'fight or flight' or sympathetic response from the human&#xD;
      organism - has been implicated in the propagation of inflammation in patients with&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Indeed, the risk of relapse in both Crohns disease (CD) and&#xD;
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) increases in the presence of both acute and chronic stress. The&#xD;
      mechanism proposed for this phenomenon includes the ability of stress to induce a breakdown&#xD;
      in intestinal barrier function via mast cell- and corticotropin releasing hormone&#xD;
      (CRH)-dependent pathways. This intestinal barrier perturbation has been demonstrated&#xD;
      experimentally in humans using stress paradigms which could be equated to the relatively mild&#xD;
      stressful events experienced in every-day life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autonomic nervous system (ANS) appears to be playing a crucial role in stress-induced&#xD;
      changes in intestinal permeability. Multiple in vitro and in vivo murine model studies have&#xD;
      confirmed that both acute and chronic stress (induced in a mouse by various stress paradigms&#xD;
      such as restraint and water emersion) can promote increased intestinal permeability. The&#xD;
      underlying mechanism seems to be via the disruption of tight junction proteins along the&#xD;
      paracellular space of the intestinal epithelium. The disruption of tight junctions in these&#xD;
      stress paradigm models are dependent on acetylcholine and CRH. This effect on intestinal&#xD;
      permeability appears to recover within 4 days in murine models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar changes have been described in human models of acute stress. Barclay and Turnberg&#xD;
      first showed that intestinal absorption of salt and water was reduced in healthy participants&#xD;
      in response to acute stress induced by a short-term stressor paradigm. In this study, they&#xD;
      used dichotomous listening as the physiological stressor, whereby the participant is asked to&#xD;
      listen to two types of different genres of music in each ear whilst they completed a mentally&#xD;
      challenging task. These physiological absorption changes to the intestine's barrier function&#xD;
      were found to be mediated by a cholinergic-dependent mechanism. The same authors later showed&#xD;
      similar effects with the physical stress paradigm of cold-induced pain in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Although actual intestinal permeability changes were not measured at the time, one likely&#xD;
      mechanism of permeability changes related to these alterations in electrolyte flux is via the&#xD;
      claudin-2 paracellular channel, which has since been described. The configuration of this&#xD;
      channel is related to ionic flux across the intestinal epithelium and, therefore, would&#xD;
      render the epithelium more permeable in times of electrolyte flux. In more recent studies&#xD;
      utilising the same cold-pain paradigm, changes in intestinal permeability were paralleled by&#xD;
      the release of products of mast cell degranulation, tryptase and histamine. Such changes in&#xD;
      intestinal permeability induced by acute stress were mimicked by peripheral administration of&#xD;
      CRH and could be reversed by the administration of mast cell stabilisers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key role for the parasympathetic nervous system in the perturbation of intestinal&#xD;
      permeability by severe physiological stress was derived from the effects of vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation in animal models. Stimulation of the cervical vagal nerve for 10 minutes prior to&#xD;
      giving mice a severe burn protected them from intestinal barrier perturbation and increased&#xD;
      intestinal glial fibrillary acidic protein (FGAP) expression, a marker of enteric nervous&#xD;
      system glial activation, in vitro and in vivo.This effect was likely, at least in part, due&#xD;
      to an Î±7 acetylcholine receptor dependent mechanism that was demonstrated in both cultured&#xD;
      intestinal epithelial cells as well as in enteric glial cells. Further studies have since&#xD;
      supported this protective effect of vagal nerve stimulation, suggesting a role for the&#xD;
      preservation of the number of dendritic cells in the mesenteric lymph as another potential&#xD;
      mechanism.Moreover, the protective effect on the epithelial lining seemed to be via a&#xD;
      locally-induced mechanism on the intestine rather than being dependent on a splenic-mediated&#xD;
      process as the protective effect held true in splenectomised mice. Stimulation of the&#xD;
      parasympathetic nervous system via the vagal nerve therefore seems to play a protective role&#xD;
      in modulation of the intestinal barrier function with experimental evidence hinting at its&#xD;
      ability to reverse stress induced changes in intestinal permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results are of significant interest given that the last decade has seen a number of&#xD;
      studies supporting the theory of intestinal barrier perturbation in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      IBD.Additionally, the detection of antibodies directed against microbial antigens (such as&#xD;
      'ASCA' - epitopes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Flagellin CBir1) are found in the serum of&#xD;
      patients prior to the development of IBD - indicating a disruption of the intestinal barrier&#xD;
      function prior to the onset of disease. Furthermore, a genetic predisposition to intestinal&#xD;
      barrier perturbation is considered to be a predisposing factor in the development of IBD.&#xD;
      Given that it seems that the ANS has a significant role to play in the maintenance of the&#xD;
      intestinal barrier function, it would be reasonable to conclude that alterations within the&#xD;
      ANS in a susceptible individual may, at least in part, be implicated the development and&#xD;
      flares of IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several serological and urinary markers have been validated as useful tools in measuring&#xD;
      intestinal permeability changes in vivo. These include lipopolysaccharide-binding protein&#xD;
      (LBP), CD-14 and intestinal-type fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) in the serum, as well as&#xD;
      an orally-administered dual sugar solution and its by-products in serum and urine. Soluble&#xD;
      CD-14 and LBP are part of the LPS inflammatory signalling pathway, thus their levels in serum&#xD;
      have been shown to be objective markers for systemic immune activation and damage to gut&#xD;
      epithelium. I-FABP is an intracellular protein expressed in the epithelial cells of the&#xD;
      mucosal layer of the small and large intestine tissue and is prone to leakage into the blood&#xD;
      stream from the enterocytes when intestinal mucosal damage occurs. The oral dual sugar test&#xD;
      uses lactulose and rhamnose that are differentially absorbed in the intestine and excreted in&#xD;
      the urine. The ratio of lactulose to rhamnose in the urine and serum can be used as a measure&#xD;
      of small intestinal permeability when the urine is collected for two hours post ingestion of&#xD;
      the test solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic effect of vagal nerve stimulation in intestinal barrier dysfunction is an&#xD;
      important area of study as it could lead to a novel and in-expensive method of treatment of&#xD;
      conditions associated with intestinal barrier perturbation. In humans, the auricular branch&#xD;
      of the vagus nerve is located directly under the skin, making it a suitable target for&#xD;
      transcutaneous stimulation. A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device is&#xD;
      thus a suitable non-invasive tool for the investigation of transcutaneous vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (tVNS) for reduction of intestinal permeability in humans and has been used in a&#xD;
      number of studies utilizing the technique of tVNS in our laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is naturally secreted from the healthy human&#xD;
      hypothalamus during periods of stress. Intravenously administered CRH possesses the advantage&#xD;
      of having a short half-life and is routinely clinically utilised in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Cushing's syndrome. Recent evidence has shown that injecting CRH intravenously reliably and&#xD;
      significantly increases intestinal permeability in healthy volunteers with no significant&#xD;
      adverse effects.This model will be used to induce increased intestinal permeability in&#xD;
      healthy human volunteers in order to test the hypothesis that pre-treatment with vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation can reduce the degree of intestinal permeability induced by CRH.&#xD;
