  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been launched to collect spectral raman data paired with validated&#xD;
      glucose reference values in private homes of subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects enrolled in this protocol will dedicate 30 days of home-based measurement,&#xD;
      scheduled within a 40 days' time frame. For reference measurements, subjects will be equipped&#xD;
      with a blood glucose meter (Contour Next One, Ascenia). Optical measurements are collected&#xD;
      with the investigational medical device. Each day of measurements consists of four sessions&#xD;
      each comprising two capillary blood glucose measurement with a blood glucose meter and two&#xD;
      investigational medical device measurements.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects enrolled in this protocol will dedicate 30 days of home-based measurement, scheduled within a 40 days' time frame. For reference measurements, subjects will be equipped with a BG-meter (Contour Next One, Ascenia). Optical measurements are collected with the IMD. Each day of measurements consists of four sessions each comprising two capillary blood glucose measurement with a BG-meter and two IMD measurements. IMD measurements will be performed within 3 minutes after the BG measurement using the thenar of the right hand of the subject.</description>
