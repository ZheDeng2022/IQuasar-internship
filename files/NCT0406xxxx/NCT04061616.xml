  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Physical Activity Scale for Individuals With Physical Disabilities (PASIPD) is a scale&#xD;
      that has been developped and validated in English to quantify the level of physical activity&#xD;
      for people with physical disabilities. The investigators aimed to translate and validate a&#xD;
      French transcultural version of the PASIPD (PASIPD-Fr) through a rigourous process following&#xD;
      international recommendations for cross-cultural translation and adaptation of&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the translation, permission to proceed was obtained, and translation was conducted in&#xD;
      consultation with the developers. The investigators proceed to a first translation of the&#xD;
      initial scale from English to French with two French native bilingual physicians that&#xD;
      resulted in a unique french translation. An English native bilingual physicians proceeded to&#xD;
      a back translation from French to English. This version have been sent to the developers who&#xD;
      agreed that this back translated version was faithful to the original scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the validation, the investigators used the international recommendations for&#xD;
      cross-cultural translation and adaptation of questionnaires. Population was individuals with&#xD;
      neurological disease (stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease and neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorders) with significant in physical disability. Patients were invited in an ambulatory&#xD;
      setting. Data collected for every participant included demographic and general variables&#xD;
      (age, sex, level, cause and time since neurological disease, walking capacities and aid),&#xD;
      scores of a physical performance tests (10 Meter Walking Test, 10 MWT) and the 4&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaires: the Dijon Physical Activity Scale (PAS) the&#xD;
      Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 12 &quot;&#xD;
      (MOS SF-12) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Face validity was assessed using verbal feedbacks from physician and patients, and the mean&#xD;
      time to fill-out the scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criterion validity was assessed with correlation and discrimination analysis between the&#xD;
      scores for the PASIPD-Fr and the Dijon PAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construct validity was assessed using the correlation with scores of instruments that measure&#xD;
      various aspects related to and physical activity (convergent validity) such as the&#xD;
      self-reported questionaires ABC, SF-12 and HAD scales and also the 10 MWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For consistency and reliability, the investigators calculated the Cronbach Î± coefficient and&#xD;
      calculated the ICC between 2 completions at a 2-week interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample calculation was based on an expected ICC &gt; 0.9, which required 50 participants to&#xD;
      reject the hypothesis that the actual ICC is &lt; 0.6, which corresponds to the lower limit for&#xD;
      a &quot;good&quot; reproducibility.&#xD;
