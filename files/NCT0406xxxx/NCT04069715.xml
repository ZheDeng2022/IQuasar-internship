      In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel study in human participants&#xD;
      with elevated LDL-C and elevated BP described here, the clinical benefits of Farlong&#xD;
      NotoGinseng™ (Farlong Ginseng Plus® Panax Notoginseng extract), a product made of highly&#xD;
      concentrated pharmaceutical grade notoginseng root extract, and containing high potency&#xD;
      bioactive components, notoginsenoside, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rg1, will be&#xD;
      investigated for its efficacy on LDL-C and blood pressure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health statistics include data on health disparities, global impact of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (CVDs) and risk factors including smoking, physical activity, body weight,&#xD;
      cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure (BP) (1). Based on this, it is estimated that 33%&#xD;
      of US adults had high blood pressure in 2009-2012 and during the same period, 43% of&#xD;
      Americans had total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic, elevated BP, defined as systolic BP (SBP) greater than 140 mmHg and diastolic BP&#xD;
      (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg is clinically known as hypertension (3). Notably, hypertension is&#xD;
      a strong, consistent, and independent risk factor for CVD and renal disease, including&#xD;
      stroke, coronary heart disease, and kidney failure (4). Epidemiological evidence indicates&#xD;
      that there is a log-linear relationship between elevated &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol, or low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration, and relative risk of CVD (5). Lifestyle&#xD;
      factors known to modify BP and cholesterol levels, including a balanced diet and exercise are&#xD;
      not always met, highlighting the potential for nutritional supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of nutritional supplements, which might be effective in the reduction of high BP&#xD;
      (hypertension) and hypercholesterolemia, is rapidly growing. However, most of the products&#xD;
      available on the market have not been clinically evaluated for their effectiveness. Common&#xD;
      ingredients found in cholesterol-lowering supplements include plant sterols. Plant sterols&#xD;
      have been shown to reduce hypercholesterolemia in numerous experimental studies and in&#xD;
      clinical trials, and are associated with lowering LDL-C by 10-15% (6;7). It has been&#xD;
      estimated that consumption of at least 1.3 g of plant sterols/day may help to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol (8). Previous pre-clinical work reported that&#xD;
      in addition to reduced cholesterol, supplementation with plant sterols can lower BP in&#xD;
      hypertensive animals, although studies in humans are in early phases of development (9).&#xD;
      Plant sterol supplementation may also improve vascular function, as one human trial found an&#xD;
      association with sterol intake and lower levels of carotid wall thickness in older Amish&#xD;
      participants (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine has been used to treat cardiovascular diseases for thousands of&#xD;
      years and species of the genus Panax plant are widely used in China and all over the world.&#xD;
      Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen, is one of about 12 species in the Panax genus of the&#xD;
      Araliaceae. Due to its sensitivity to light, P notoginseng is restricted to narrow geographic&#xD;
      regions growing at an altitude of 1200-2000 m, primarily in the Wenshan mountains of Yunnan&#xD;
      province in the People's Republic of China. The plant grows to a height of 30-60 cm and has&#xD;
      dark green leaves branching from the stem where it typically bears a cluster of berries in&#xD;
      the middle (11). The root of P notoginseng has a 400-year old history as a tonic and&#xD;
      hemostatic drug; over 200 compounds have been isolated from this plant, exhibiting a variety&#xD;
      of pharmacological effects, and appropriately enough the genus name &quot;Panax&quot; is derived from&#xD;
      the Greek word (Pan = all + axos = medicine) meaning 'cure all' (12). Historically, Chinese&#xD;
      medicine ascribes Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer to tonifying &quot;qi&quot;, while P notoginseng nourishes&#xD;
      the blood by dissipating blood stasis, inhibiting bleeding, enhancing circulation and&#xD;
      alleviating pain. While the radix and rhizome of P notoginseng are used for bleeding&#xD;
      disorders, the flower of this plant has been noted for several properties, including but not&#xD;
      limited to, treating hypertension, and rejuvenating the liver (11). In the literature,&#xD;
      extracts from P notoginseng have been referred to as Sanchitongshu, Xueshuantong, Sanqi or&#xD;
      Tianqi and these ginsenosides from P notoginseng have collectively been referred to as Panax&#xD;
      Notoginsenoside Saponins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary bioactive ingredients in notoginseng plants are saponins, of which more than 60&#xD;
      have been identified (13). Saponins from notoginseng plant exert angiogenic effects by&#xD;
      activating vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor in downstream signaling&#xD;
      pathways (14;15). Further, ginsenoside Rg5, a compound newly synthesized during the steaming&#xD;
      process of notoginseng was found to promote angiogenesis and improve hypertension in animal&#xD;
      models without adverse effects in the blood vasculature (16). Rg5 specifically increased&#xD;
      phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) resulting in stimulation of&#xD;
      nitric oxide pathways to enhance angiogenesis (16). These studies suggest that notoginseng&#xD;
      may have beneficial clinical applications in the management of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a lack of well-controlled trials evaluating the doses and effects of&#xD;
      notoginseng (17). In this context, it is imperative to conduct well-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials that may unravel the mechanism (s) of action as well as evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      potential of notoginseng as a natural health product and dietary supplement. In this&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel study in human participants with&#xD;
      elevated LDL-C and elevated BP described here, the clinical benefits of Farlong NotoGinseng™&#xD;
      (Farlong Ginseng Plus® Panax Notoginseng extract), a product made of highly concentrated&#xD;
      pharmaceutical grade notoginseng root extract, and containing high potency bioactive&#xD;
      components, notoginsenoside, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rg1, will be investigated for&#xD;
      its efficacy on LDL-C and BP.&#xD;

        <title>10. The Difference in Endothelial Vasodilation, as Measured by the EndoPAT, From Baseline to Week 8 Between Farlong Notoginseng and Placebo</title>
        <description>10. The difference in endothelial vasodilation (LnRHI), as measured by the EndoPAT, from baseline to week 8 between Farlong Notoginseng and placebo. The reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is a measure of endothelial function and LnRHI is a similar index after natural log transformation (Normal: LnRHI &gt; 0.51 Abnormal: LnRHI ≤ 0.51). An increase in LnRHI is indicative of improvement in endothelial function.</description>
