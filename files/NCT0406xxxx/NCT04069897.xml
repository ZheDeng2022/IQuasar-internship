  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of botox treatment of the sphenopalatine&#xD;
      ganglion as an add-on treatment in drug resistant migraine. An injection targeting the&#xD;
      ganglion is made possible by an image-guided device developed specifically for this purpose&#xD;
      (MultiGuide) Study participants will be randomized to either placebo or botox after a 4 week&#xD;
      run-in period. First, one injection will be given towards both the right and the left&#xD;
      ganglion. After that there will be a follow-up of 12 weeks for efficacy and safety&#xD;
      evaluation. The main efficacy measure is change in number of moderate to severe headache days&#xD;
      before and after injection.&#xD;
