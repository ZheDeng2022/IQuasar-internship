      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      paricalcitol oral solution in pediatric participants of ages 0 to 9 years with SHPT&#xD;
      associated with stage 5 CKD receiving Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) or Hemodialysis (HD). The&#xD;
      24-week study is divided into two 12-week dosing periods (Dosing Period 1 followed by Dosing&#xD;
      Period 2).&#xD;
