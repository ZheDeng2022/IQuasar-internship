  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the mass balance recovery in expired air, urine and&#xD;
      faeces after a single oral dose of 400 mg 14C-labeled BIA 5-1058; to provide plasma, urine&#xD;
      and faecal samples for metabolite profiling and structural identification; and determine the&#xD;
      routes and rates of elimination of [14C]-BIA 5-1058&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-dose, single-centre, single period, open-label, absorption,&#xD;
      distribution, metabolism and excretion study in 8 healthy adult male subjects. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single oral dose of 400 mg [14C]-BIA 5-1058, containing not more than (NMT) 4.6 MBq&#xD;
      (124 µCi) 14C, as an oral capsule. Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate&#xD;
      in the study between 28 and 2 days before dosing. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the&#xD;
      clinical unit on the morning of Day -1 prior to investigational medicinal product (IMP)&#xD;
      administration. Subjects will be dosed on the morning of Day 1 after an overnight fast of at&#xD;
      least 10 hours and will remain resident in the clinic until up to 336 h after dosing (up to&#xD;
      Day 15). Blood, urine, faeces and expired air will be collected at predefined time points for&#xD;
      mass balance and PK analysis. It is planned that subjects will be released as a group when&#xD;
      all subjects have achieved a mass balance cumulative recovery of &gt;90% or if &lt;1% of the dose&#xD;
      administered has been collected in urine, faeces and expired air within 2 separate,&#xD;
      consecutive 24 h periods. This may result in the subjects being discharged as a group prior&#xD;
      to completion of the planned residency period. Once the discharge criteria or the planned&#xD;
      residency period has been achieved, collection of all samples (blood, urine, faeces, and&#xD;
      expired air) will be stopped and the subjects will undergo discharge assessments. Subjects&#xD;
      who have not met the mass balance discharge criteria on Day 15 will return to the clinical&#xD;
      unit for up to five further 24-hour residency periods (Days 21-22 [±1 day], 28-29 [±1 day],&#xD;
      42-43 [±2 days], 56-57 [±2 days] and 77-78 [±3 days]) to collect blood samples for PK&#xD;
      analysis and urine and faeces samples for analysis of total radioactivity. If the parent and&#xD;
      metabolite are below the limit of quantification at any of these visits, subsequent return&#xD;
      visits may be cancelled. If by Day 78, levels are not below the limit of quantification or if&#xD;
      the additional 24 h residency periods are not considered appropriate or necessary, then home&#xD;
      collections of urine and/or faeces may be requested at the discretion of the investigator for&#xD;
      individual subjects.&#xD;
