  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial evaluates the impact of providing comprehensive, community-based and peer-led&#xD;
      sexual and reproductive health services to adolescents and young people aged 15 to 24 on&#xD;
      their knowledge of their HIV status. The trial includes 20 clusters in two communities, half&#xD;
      the clusters receive the intervention. After 18-months of implementation, a cross-sectional&#xD;
      survey will be conducted to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the primary outcome:&#xD;
      knowledge of HIV status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through a cluster-randomised trial, this study will address the research question: Do&#xD;
      community-based peer-led interventions increase knowledge of HIV status and coverage of&#xD;
      sexual and reproductive health services among adolescents and young people in Lusaka, Zambia,&#xD;
      compared to current standard of care? To address this question, the study aims to build a&#xD;
      rigorous evidence-base of the effectiveness of community-based, peer-led HIV services&#xD;
      designed with and for adolescents and young people living in Lusaka, Zambia, and evidence of&#xD;
      the process of delivering such an intervention to support replication and scale-up if the&#xD;
      intervention is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention, called Yathu Yathu (For us, by us), was designed with adolescents and young&#xD;
      people in a formative research study. The Yathu Yathu intervention includes: 1) delivery of&#xD;
      comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services by peer support workers, lay&#xD;
      counsellors and a nurse at community-based hubs, and 2) an innovative &quot;prevention points&#xD;
      card&quot; system. The prevention points cards are intended to incentivise service use by allowing&#xD;
      adolescents and young people to accrue points for accessing services and redeem rewards using&#xD;
      these points. At the start of the intervention period, trained enumerators will&#xD;
      systematically visit and enumerate all households in the 20 study clusters. For household&#xD;
      members aged 15 to 24, the enumerators will offer the individual a prevention points card. A&#xD;
      third component is mobile phone-based support groups. These groups will initially be set-up&#xD;
      among HIV-positive pregnant women, as a means to offer psychosocial support, with expansion&#xD;
      of this portion of the intervention to other groups planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of the Yathu Yathu intervention, a cross-sectional survey among a&#xD;
      random sample of approximately 2000 adolescents and young people will be conducted 18-months&#xD;
      after implementation of the intervention. An embedded mixed-method process evaluation will&#xD;
      provide evidence of service acceptability, feasibility, and of adolescents and young people's&#xD;
      experiences with services. An economic evaluation will provide evidence of the costs and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention package. Through these methods, this study will&#xD;
      provide a rigorous and comprehensive evidence-base of whether Yathu Yathu can increase&#xD;
      adolescents and young people access to sexual and reproductive health services, thereby&#xD;
      contributing to their health and well-being.&#xD;
