      Single site study to assess the feasibility of prostate cancer screening using an invitation&#xD;
      for a prostate MRI scan via GP practices. This feasibility study will assess the&#xD;
      acceptability of an MRI as a prostate cancer screening assessment and assess the prevalence&#xD;
      of MRI defined suspicious lesions and cancer in men across a spectrum of PSA results.&#xD;

      ReIMAGINE Prostate cancer screening is a single site screening study to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of MRI as a screening tool for prostate care and determine the prevalence of MRI&#xD;
      defined suspicious lesions and cancer in men across a spectrum of PSA results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men with no previous prostate cancer diagnosis, but deemed suitable based on age will be&#xD;
      identified through general practitioner (GP) practices who will act as participant&#xD;
      identification centres (PIC's). Potential participants will be identified through screening&#xD;
      of existing patient databases at multiple London GP surgeries participating in the study, and&#xD;
      randomly selected for invitation. The ReIMAGINE study team will link with London cancer&#xD;
      networks and Noclor research support (https://www.noclor.nhs.uk/) who will make first contact&#xD;
      with potentially eligible men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personalised invitation letter from each man's own GP will be sent to him. Invitation&#xD;
      letters will be sent in batches so to limit the time between the invitation and their study&#xD;
      visit. Batched invitations will be prepared using an iterative process so to allow the study&#xD;
      team to assess uptake rates and limit the gap between invitation and study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invitation letters will include contact details for the ReIMAGINE study team who will&#xD;
      coordinate bookings for research visits for all responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consented men will have a blood test for PSA and a screening MRI scan. This will take a&#xD;
      maximum of 20 minutes, and will include T2, diffusion and research specific sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two radiologists will report the MRI blinded to the PSA result, with a third reviewer when&#xD;
      there is disagreement between reporters. Men in whom a suspicious lesion is seen (MRI screen&#xD;
      positive) or who have a suspicious PSA density (&gt;0.12ng/ml) will be recommended to have an&#xD;
      National Health Service (NHS) referral for suspected prostate cancer as per National&#xD;
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen negative men will at this point exit the study. Screen positive men will be followed&#xD;
      up to gather data from any investigations (mpMRI +/- prostate biopsy) that may occur as a&#xD;
      result of the NHS referral. No formal visits will be required to collect this data.&#xD;
      Participant consent will be sought to approach GP or other secondary care centre.&#xD;
