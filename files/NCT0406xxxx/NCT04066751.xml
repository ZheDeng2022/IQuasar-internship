  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to test the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator, ivacaftor in&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis. This&#xD;
      project will investigate the hypothesis that ivacaftor can augment CFTR activity in&#xD;
      individuals with COPD who exhibit chronic bronchitis, resulting in meaningful improvements in&#xD;
      epithelial function and respiratory health. The study is a multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified study of orally-administered ivacaftor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Like CF, COPD is characterized by small airway mucus obstruction that is associated with&#xD;
      accelerated loss of lung function and mortality. Our preliminary data indicate that cigarette&#xD;
      smoke exerts deleterious effects on airway epithelial function including the reduction of&#xD;
      CFTR activity, enhanced mucus expression, and a pronounced reduction in mucociliary transport&#xD;
      (MCT). Preliminary data also indicate that approximately 50% of patients with COPD have&#xD;
      reduced CFTR activity, as detected in the upper airways, lower airways, and sweat glands.&#xD;
      Furthermore, CFTR dysfunction is independently associated with chronic bronchitis, can&#xD;
      persist despite smoking cessation, and can be reversed by the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor&#xD;
      (VX-770) in vitro by activating wild-type CFTR, resulting in a robust increase in MCT.&#xD;
      Combined with unprecedented clinical improvement via augmented mucociliary clearance in CF&#xD;
      patients with a responsive CFTR mutation treated with ivacaftor, these data indicate that&#xD;
      CFTR represents a viable therapeutic target to address mucus stasis in a large subset of COPD&#xD;
      patients (potentially representing over 4 million patients in the U.S. alone). This project&#xD;
      will investigate the hypothesis that ivacaftor can augment CFTR activity in individuals with&#xD;
      COPD who exhibit chronic bronchitis, resulting in meaningful improvements in epithelial&#xD;
      function and respiratory health. Our initial pilot study in patients with COPD and chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis demonstrated that ivacaftor was safe, demonstrated stable pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      exhibited a trend towards efficacy in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and sweat chloride.&#xD;
      The current trial will test the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ivacaftor&#xD;
      in a larger number of COPD patients with chronic bronchitis and for a longer treatment&#xD;
      period, evaluating the potential of CFTR potentiator therapy to address acquired CFTR&#xD;
      dysfunction in this population and set the stage for larger and longer-term trials in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
