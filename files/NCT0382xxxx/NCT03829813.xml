      acute neurologic or inpatient rehabilitation units.&#xD;

      Objective: Does music therapy improve mood, pain and patient satisfaction on adult inpatient&#xD;
      neurological units? Is music therapy an acceptable and feasible intervention in an adult&#xD;
      inpatient neurological unit based on patient, family, and care provider satisfaction&#xD;
      measures?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Foothills Medical Centre (FMC) acute neurological and neurorehabilitation units&#xD;
      (i.e., 111, 112, 101, 58 Neurorehab), ages &gt;18&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Music therapy is the therapeutic application of music to rehabilitate cognitive,&#xD;
      motor, and sensory dysfunction due to disease. Its treatment techniques are based upon&#xD;
      scientific knowledge of music perception, production and its effects on nonmusical brain and&#xD;
      behavior functions like gait, balance, speech, mood and motivation. Music is also known to&#xD;
      have a wide range of physiological effects on the human body including changes in heart rate,&#xD;
      respiration, blood pressure, skin temperature, and muscle tension. Music provokes emotions&#xD;
      mediated via neuro-hormones such as serotonin and dopamine, and is experienced as joyous or&#xD;
      rewarding through activity changes in the amygdala, ventral striatum and other parts of the&#xD;
      limbic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy has been applied across a broad range of clinical conditions from inpatients to&#xD;
      outpatients, cardiac, diabetes and cancer care to surgical and ICU settings, and in pediatric&#xD;
      through adult and geriatric populations. The majority of clinical studies focus on&#xD;
      neurological patients with sensorimotor, speech and gait impairments, however, music has been&#xD;
      shown to improve mental state and functioning in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      including depression, anxiety, and dementia, as well as reducing anxiety in patients with&#xD;
      asthma, osteoarthritis, those undergoing dental procedures or perioperative anesthesia. There&#xD;
      is some research to support its mood benefits in stroke and brain injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy has been found to be an effective complementary treatment for cancer-related&#xD;
      pain, lithotripsy, labor, and fibromyalgia. Recent reviews have demonstrated reductions in&#xD;
      postoperative pain and anxiety, decreased consumption of sedatives and analgesics and&#xD;
      increased patient satisfaction. The reductions in anxiety were equal or greater than&#xD;
      midazolam/benzodiazepines. This may be particularly beneficial in neurological patients who&#xD;
      may be more susceptible to adverse effects from psychoactive, sedating and analgesic&#xD;
      medications. Music can provide a filter for unpleasant, unfamiliar sounds common to the&#xD;
      hospital environment and improve sleep quality. These positive effects may greatly assist the&#xD;
      common issues of fatigue in cognitively impaired, confused or agitated neurological&#xD;
      inpatients. Furthermore, Chlan has recently demonstrated cost-effectiveness of music therapy&#xD;
      interventions in reducing anxiety in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy may also have beneficial effects for staff and families. Some studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated cost-effectiveness with less staff time required for procedures, administering&#xD;
      sedatives and pain medications, and fewer days on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.&#xD;
      Perez-Cruz studied patients, relatives, and healthcare workers' preference for background&#xD;
      music in patient areas with an average 71% in all three groups. Lower perceived stress level,&#xD;
      cortisol, heart rate and mean arterial pressures were also observed in voluntary first-line&#xD;
      nurses and students while listening to music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will expand the research base in the inpatient neurological population and explore&#xD;
      staff perceptions and satisfaction with music therapy. The aim of this mixed methods study is&#xD;
      to explore immediate pre and post music therapy intervention effects on mood, pain, and&#xD;
      satisfaction in the inpatient neurological population and to explore perceived caregiver and&#xD;
      staff satisfaction with music therapy on inpatient neurological units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 20-40 min treatment sessions 1:1 within acute neurological patient rooms, or&#xD;
      private room by qualified music therapist once weekly and/or group music therapy sessions&#xD;
      maximum 6-8 patients &lt; or = 1 hour. This includes a variety of music therapy techniques used&#xD;
      to target mood, pain, socialization, expressive speech, attention/cognitive or sensorimotor&#xD;
      functional goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Mixed methods study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Qualitative measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Semi-structured patient +/- family satisfaction questionnaire and interview post&#xD;
                music therapy session&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Semi-structured inpatient unit staff questionnaire and interview (exploring themes&#xD;
                of: self-perceived stress, workload, barriers, relationships, mood, pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Focus groups of patients, families, staff addressing above areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantitative measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Visual analog scale, mood pre- and post- music therapy session&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Visual analog scale, pain pre- and post- music therapy session&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients (and their families when available) referred to Music therapy on Acute&#xD;
      Neuro, Neurorehab units would be invited to participate in research study with informed&#xD;
      consent obtained prior to interviews, focus groups and data collection. Unit Staff would also&#xD;
      be invited to participate in interviews and focus groups with informed consent prior to data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
