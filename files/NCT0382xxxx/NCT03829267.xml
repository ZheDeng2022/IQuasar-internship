      eFIT is a technology-enabled internet based psychosocial intervention to increase physical&#xD;
      activity in persons with multiple sclerosis, who are at unique risk for sedentary behaviors&#xD;
      and for whom exercise and physical activity hold many benefits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of an internet-based intervention to increase physical&#xD;
      activity in persons with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common&#xD;
      non-traumatic neurological cause of disability in young adults. Sedentary behavior, now&#xD;
      recognized as a major contributor to increased morbidity is seen at higher rates and related&#xD;
      to adverse health outcomes for persons with MS (PwMS). Prominent symptoms of MS (motor&#xD;
      impairment, fatigue, depressed mood, pain), place this population at unique risk for&#xD;
      increased sedentary behavior. And importantly, with increased age comes increased risk:&#xD;
      patients over 60 are significantly more sedentary than middle-aged patients. On a positive&#xD;
      note, current disease modifying therapies prolong time to disease progression, widening the&#xD;
      window of opportunity for implementing behavioral interventions that support health and&#xD;
      successful aging. Behaviors adopted early in life are more likely to be maintained into later&#xD;
      adulthood. Physical activity is beneficial for PwMS on multiple levels: improved gait and&#xD;
      balance, improved cognition, reduced depression and fatigue. Finding ways to increase&#xD;
      physical activity is a key research priority for MS. Behavioral change is difficult to adopt&#xD;
      and even more difficult to maintain. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral intervention to&#xD;
      increase physical activity, eFIT, a technology-enabled (i.e., internet-delivered) support&#xD;
      group-based treatment that leverages accountability to motivate and sustain behavioral&#xD;
      change. Accountability constitutes the bedrock underlying the single most pervasive,&#xD;
      successful, and widely embraced behavioral intervention known: Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).&#xD;
      Through sponsors and support groups, AA utilizes accountability partners to deliver,&#xD;
      reinforce, and sustain life-saving behavioral change. Here, we leverage accountability&#xD;
      partners to motivate enduring behavioral change in physical activity participation, one of&#xD;
      the single most difficult health behaviors to implement and maintain.&#xD;

    <measure>Completion rate: Percentage of enrolled participants who complete follow-up questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assess feasibility of the program: to retain and obtain completed questionnaires at immediate follow-up from two-thirds of enrolled participants meeting the criteria of two-thirds attendance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) total score (self-reported physical activity level)</measure>
    <time_frame>12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-Long form includes 27 items divided into 5 subscales. For this trial, the total minutes/hours/days for items 1-25 will be calculated. Higher scores indicate more time spent engaged in physical activity. Items 26 and 27 will be excluded in the variable because they query about time spent sitting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assess efficacy of the program to improve mood as defined by an increase in total score on PHQ-9. The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. Total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating worse depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>UCLA Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assess efficacy of the program to decrease loneliness as defined by a decrease in total score on UCLA Loneliness Scale. This name never appears as anything other than UCLA Loneliness Scale, i.e. Russell 1996). Total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating worse loneliness.</description>

They will also receive the same psychoeducational materials online as the eFIT participants are presented in group.</description>
