  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy is a set of diseases of pregnancy coexisting&#xD;
      with elevated blood pressure. The incidence of it is approximately 5-12%. Pregnancy-induced&#xD;
      hypertension is a pregnancy-specific disorder, severely impairing both maternal and fetal&#xD;
      health, and the major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality rate increased. But so far,&#xD;
      the specific etiology is still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has emerged as key endocrine regulators of the&#xD;
      metabolism of vitamin D and calcium and phosphorus by combining FGFR-α- Klotho receptor&#xD;
      complex. Current studies showed that α- Klotho involved the development of gestational&#xD;
      hypertension via the production of endothelial nitric oxide, angiogenesis, and the formation&#xD;
      of antioxidant enzymes. On the other hand, vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy has an&#xD;
      adverse impact on maternal and fetal health, including gestational hypertension. Therefore,&#xD;
      the relationship of the expression of FGF23 and the development of gestational hypertension&#xD;
      has attracted the attention of relevant scholars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to detect the difference of the expression of FGF23 between the&#xD;
      hypertensive women and normal pregnant women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      100 pregnant women with hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy and 200 normal pregnant&#xD;
      control women matched for maternal and gestational age were enrolled in the study. All the&#xD;
      subjects underwent antepartum screening in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen&#xD;
      University. Blood samples were obtained after overnight fasting at the first, second and&#xD;
      third trimester respectively. Serum FGF23 levels were determined by enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were correlated with anthropometric, metabolic, and endocrine&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 database. The results were expressed as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviations or median with interquartile range. Differences between groups were assessed by&#xD;
      Student's unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Chi-square test as appropriate.&#xD;
      Correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman rank correlation method. To identify&#xD;
      independent relationships and adjust the effects of covariates, multiple linear regression&#xD;
      analyses were performed. P values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant.&#xD;
