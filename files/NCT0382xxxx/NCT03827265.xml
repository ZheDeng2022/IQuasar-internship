  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if brain stimulation using repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) directed at different parts of the brain can decrease feelings of&#xD;
      cigarette craving and symptoms of cigarette withdrawal, and also if men and women have&#xD;
      different responses to rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) five times: First,&#xD;
      for in-person screening, then for four rTMS sessions, stimulating three different brain&#xD;
      regions and also a sham control stimulation. The sham procedure is similar to a placebo, and&#xD;
      will use a lower-intensity stimulation than the active stimulations. Everyone in the study&#xD;
      will be assigned to all four treatment arms (one sham stimulation, and active stimulation of&#xD;
      three different brain regions), and they will take place in a random order.Before and after&#xD;
      each rTMS session, a brief MRI will be performed, and participants will be asked to fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires that describe how they are feeling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the initial telephone screening, potentially eligible candidates will meet with staff&#xD;
      and receive a lay-language explanation of the study. Candidates will review, ask about, and&#xD;
      sign the informed consent form for the study. Those who have difficulty understanding the&#xD;
      information will be able to review and ask questions to a staff member, who will help clarify&#xD;
      the requirements, potential risks and benefits of participation. Any participant who is&#xD;
      unable to demonstrate understanding of the information presented despite assistance will be&#xD;
      excluded. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time. They may also be withdrawn at&#xD;
      the discretion of the investigators for inability to comply with procedures or if continuing&#xD;
      participation is unsafe or not in their best interest. Any participant expressing a desire&#xD;
      for smoking cessation treatment, at any point during screening or while engaged in the study,&#xD;
      will be referred to appropriate counseling services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the informed consent is obtained, participants will undergo a psychological evaluation&#xD;
      (SCID) by a trained diagnostician to rule out any psychiatric diagnoses. Participants will&#xD;
      provide a urine sample to be used for pregnancy and toxicology tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will complete a series of questionnaires to provide demographic information, and&#xD;
      complete the Fagerstr√∂m Test for Nicotine Dependence, Smoking History Questionnaire, Timeline&#xD;
      Follow Back (TLFB) to report smoking over the month before testing, Substance Use Inventory,&#xD;
      the Shipley Hartford Vocabulary Test to document English language fluency, as well as the&#xD;
      Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Positive and Negative Affect Scale&#xD;
      (PANAS) to measure mood state and traits before beginning the study. Daily smoker status will&#xD;
      be tested at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Day Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of wakefulness. Due to the possibility that sleep deprivation may reduce the&#xD;
           seizure threshold, wakefulness will be self-reported via the Stanford Sleepiness Scale.&#xD;
           Participants who score below a 5 will be asked to reschedule their appointment and&#xD;
           return when they are better rested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abstinence from Drug and Alcohol Use. Each study will begin with a urine test to verify&#xD;
           abstinence from drugs of abuse and a Breathalyzer test to verify abstinence from&#xD;
           alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Smoking Abstinence. Expired air will be sampled for CO to verify overnight abstinence.&#xD;
           Participants who are not abstinent will be allowed to return for testing on another day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pregnancy Testing. Female participants will each have a urine test to confirm absence of&#xD;
           pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Self-report of Spontaneous Craving. Data will be obtained on the 10-item Urge to Smoke&#xD;
           Scale. Self-reports for each item are given on a scale from 1-7, with 1 = definitely not&#xD;
           and 7 = definitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Self-report of Withdrawal. Participants will complete the Shiffman-Jarvik Withdrawal&#xD;
           Scale, a 25-item questionnaire comprised of five scales: Craving; Psychological&#xD;
           Withdrawal; Physiological Withdrawal; Stimulation/Sedation; and Appetite. Each question&#xD;
           is rated on a 7-point scale (1 = definitely not to 7 = definitely) to indicate the&#xD;
           respondent's feeling state. Scores are calculated as the mean response to each question&#xD;
           on each particular subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Self-report of Mood. Participants will complete the Positive and Negative Affect&#xD;
           Schedule (PANAS), a 20-item questionnaire comprising two mood scales (positive and&#xD;
           negative). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very slightly or not at&#xD;
           all) to 5 (extremely) to indicate their feeling state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. fMRI. Resting-state fMRI data will be collected while participants lie in the scanner&#xD;
           with eyes open viewing a black screen.The scan duration is 13 min, which was found to&#xD;
           produce optimally reliable RSFC results. We plan for a single, long-duration run because&#xD;
           single-session resting state scans produce more reliable results than combining two&#xD;
           shorter sessions and the short TR (800 ms) used offers flexibility in eliminating&#xD;
           motion-related images. Identical scanning procedures will be performed once before rTMS,&#xD;
           and once after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. rTMS. Subjects will first undergo Motor Threshold (MT) determination using single pulses&#xD;
           applied to the left motor cortex, with motor response determined using electromyography&#xD;
           (EMG) electrodes applied to the right hand (standard clinical procedures). On active&#xD;
           test days, rTMS will be performed using 10 Hz stimulation, a treatment paradigm that has&#xD;
           previously reduced craving, with 3000 pulses administered over 37.5 min at 120% MT with&#xD;
           4 sec pulse trains and 26 sec inter-train interval. Participants will receive this&#xD;
           stimulation to the left PPC, dlPFC, and SMA on separate test days. All participants will&#xD;
           undergo sham stimulation (10% of MT) on the first test day due to evidence that sham&#xD;
           stimulation may have low participant blinding success; therefore, sham stimulation will&#xD;
           occur first to minimize the impact of this problem (i.e., participants will be unaware&#xD;
           that they received sham stimulation until after the sham test day is complete). The&#xD;
           order of the active stimulation targets will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Repeated self-reports of craving, withdrawal, and mood (items 4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Repeat fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Smoking. Participants will be permitted to smoke a cigarette.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Blood sampling. Approximately 4mL of blood will be collected by venipuncture for assay&#xD;
           of nicotine metabolite ratio (ratio of 3'hydroxycotinine to cotinine) to determine&#xD;
           participants' rate of nicotine metabolism, and, in female participants, ovarian hormone&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the 4 TMS study visits will be scheduled approximately 1 week apart to minimize&#xD;
      carryover effects.&#xD;

    <description>A rTMS system is an electromagnetic device that non-invasively delivers a rapidly pulsed magnetic field to the cerebral cortex in order to activate neurons within a limited volume without inducing a seizure. The device is intended to be used to treat patients meeting clinical criteria for MDD as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). This guidance is issued in conjunction with a Federal Register notice announcing the classification of rTMS systems for the treatment of MDD.</description>
