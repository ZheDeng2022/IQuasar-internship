      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that real-life benefits of microprocessor knees&#xD;
      (MPK) are largely underappreciated because of the lack of sensitive and ecologically valid&#xD;
      methods for evaluating motor performance. This makes it difficult to justify MPKs for many&#xD;
      amputees who could benefit from it. Using recently developed outcome measures shown to be&#xD;
      more effective in evaluating prosthesis users than commonly employed metrics, 7 transfemoral&#xD;
      prosthesis users who exclusivity utilize a non-microprocessor mechanical knee were evaluated&#xD;
      as they transitioned to and from an MPK in an ABA/BAB single subject design protocol.&#xD;
      Subjects were also evaluated with existing clinical measures established for lower limb&#xD;
      amputees.&#xD;

      Research Hypothesis The central hypothesis of this proposal is that real-life benefits of&#xD;
      microprocessor knees (MPK) are largely underappreciated because of the lack of sensitive and&#xD;
      ecologically valid methods for evaluating motor performance. This makes it difficult to&#xD;
      justify MPKs for many amputees who could benefit from it. The investigators' recent research&#xD;
      on the stride length-cadence relationship and dual-task gait analysis offers a new direction&#xD;
      to overcome some of these limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why stride length-cadence relationship for MPKs? Because stride length and cadence form a&#xD;
      strong linear relationship over a range of gait velocities, examining the strength of their&#xD;
      association offers a unique way to characterize natural gait. The investigators found that&#xD;
      the stride length-cadence relationship is disrupted in prosthesis users. Also, the step&#xD;
      length-cadence relationship is disrupted bilaterally, indicating altered neurocontrol of&#xD;
      gait. Unlike a mechanical knee, MPKs adjust properties to accommodate changes in velocity,&#xD;
      resembling more natural gait pattern. Thus, the stride length-cadence relationship is&#xD;
      expected to be tighter for MPKs than a mechanical knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why dual-task gait for MPKs? Dual-task gait is the act of walking while performing an&#xD;
      additional task (talking, texting, etc.). The additional load imposed on the nervous system&#xD;
      alters gait. Thus, &quot;walking while talking&quot; better reflects real-life gait than standard gait&#xD;
      analysis. Dual-task gait studies in prosthetic users are rare. The classic outcome measure in&#xD;
      dual-task studies is a standard deviation divided by the mean for each gait parameter&#xD;
      separately, which ignores their dependence on changes in speed. The investigators recently&#xD;
      developed a new method for analyzing dual-task gait based on the linear relationship that&#xD;
      stride length and cadence have with velocity. The standard deviations of the difference&#xD;
      between the actual data point for stride length or cadence from the point predicted by the&#xD;
      line that represents the best fit with velocity are compared between the free walking and&#xD;
      dual-task walking. This calculation of variability in stride length or cadence accounts for&#xD;
      their trial-to-trial changes with the velocity that can influence results. Previous studies&#xD;
      indicate that MPKs require less additional thought during gait. If indeed the case, the users&#xD;
      should be able to shift motor and cognitive resources from gait to other activities and, at&#xD;
      the same time, have less variable gait under dual-task condition. Since decreased gait&#xD;
      variability has been related to better neurocontrol of gait and lesser risk for falls, the&#xD;
      proposed proof-of-principle study will be the first step toward providing critical missing&#xD;
      evidence for justifying the use of MPKs in a broader population of amputees, particularly in&#xD;
      K2 users or persons with cognitive impairments as a result of vascular disease or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Evaluate differences in gait and function between an MPK (RheoKnee®, Ossur) and a&#xD;
      mechanical knee in K2 and K3 prosthesis users in an A-B-A and B-A-B single-subject design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Assess the stride length-cadence relationship during gait with the MPK&#xD;
      compared to the mechanical knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: The stride length-cadence linear relationship will significantly improve&#xD;
      after wearing the MPK. Hypothesis 1.2: The linearity of the stride length-cadence&#xD;
      relationship will be significantly higher for the MPK than the mechanical knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the changes in dual-task cost while walking with the MPK compared&#xD;
      to the mechanical knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: Under the dual-task condition, the variability in stride length and cadence&#xD;
      will be significantly smaller while wearing the MPK than the mechanical knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Compare the performance between the MPK and the mechanical knee on clinical&#xD;
      measures of mobility, balance, and user preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.1: Measures of functional mobility will improve more while wearing the MPK than&#xD;
      the mechanical knee Hypothesis 3.2: Balance measures will improve more while wearing the MPK&#xD;
      more than the mechanical knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.3: Joint range of motion and ground reaction force symmetry will improve while&#xD;
      wearing the MPK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use an A-B-A and B-A-B single-subject design (A- the subject's current&#xD;
      mechanical knee; B- MPK: RheoKnee®). The purpose of B-A-B design is to control for a learning&#xD;
      effect due to multiple repetitions of cognitive tasks during dual-task gait, which may&#xD;
      contribute to hypothesized improvements in phase B of the A-B-A design. Each phase will last&#xD;
      4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects who signed the consent form will be randomly allocated to the A-B-A or&#xD;
      B-A-B group. The proper fit/alignment of the current mechanical knee will be verified, and,&#xD;
      if fine, the 3D gait analysis and functional assessment (Full Evaluation) will be performed&#xD;
      at baseline. Walking at up to 5 self-selected speeds (very slow to very fast) and dual-task&#xD;
      gait (Gait Evaluation) will also be evaluated at baseline and then on a weekly basis&#xD;
      throughout each phase. At the end of each phase, Gait Evaluation and Full Evaluation are&#xD;
      repeated. The end of each current phase and the beginning of a new phase are separated by a&#xD;
      transition period. The transition period starts with the alignment of a new device followed&#xD;
      by 2 weeks of accommodation during which up to 6 gait training sessions are provided by a&#xD;
      physical therapist (PT) and the alignment is checked. All efforts will be made to maintain&#xD;
      the subject's current socket style and suspension system. The B-A-B design is identical to&#xD;
      the A-B-A design except for an additional transition period at the very beginning since the&#xD;
      naive subjects are fit for the first time with the MPK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Users of a mechanical prosthetic knee will be recruited from the population served by&#xD;
      Methodist Rehabilitation Center if they meet the enrollment criteria. After signing the&#xD;
      consent form, the subjects will be allocated to the A-B-A or B-A-B group using a random&#xD;
      number sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Selected Speeds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal and spatial footfall data will be collected by an electronic walkway (20 ft) as the&#xD;
      subject walks at five self-selected speeds (very slow, slow, normal, fast, very fast). An&#xD;
      area at each end of the walkway will allow for acceleration and deceleration so that only&#xD;
      steady-state gait is recorded. Subjects will complete a minimum of 4 passes at each speed,&#xD;
      which they will freely select to achieve the most natural walking pattern. The normal gait&#xD;
      speed will always be collected first. The order of slower/faster speed categories will be&#xD;
      randomized with the very slow/fast speed collected last in each category. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to modulate the speed within safety limits and encouraged to complete all speeds,&#xD;
      to the extent possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-Task Gait:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four cognitive tasks will be used for dual-task gait; backward spelling, serial subtraction,&#xD;
      digit span, and category listing. Three tasks will be used at each assessment point to curb&#xD;
      the effect of learning. Tasks will be selected at random so that each is given an equal&#xD;
      number of times in each phase. All four tasks will be used at baseline. Different prompts&#xD;
      will be given to ensure no task is presented the same way twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each assessment, the subject will practice the selected tasks while seated to&#xD;
      familiarize with the protocol. For the dual-task gait, the subject will be instructed to walk&#xD;
      at a comfortable pace and simultaneously perform cognitive tasks without specific&#xD;
      instructions on prioritization. The cognitive tasks will be block randomized with each block&#xD;
      containing 4 walking trials. At the end, the subject will be asked to rate the task&#xD;
      difficulty on a 7-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional prosthetic assessment (Amputee Mobility Predictor, L-test, 6-minute Walk&#xD;
           Test, Berg Balance Scale, Physiological Cost Index,Temporal/Spatial Gait Assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  User evaluation of the prosthesis (Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire, study specific&#xD;
           knee preference evaluations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computerized 3D gait assessment (3D gait kinematics and kinetics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognition/mood (Modified Mini-Mental State Exam, Trails A &amp; B, Patient Health&#xD;
           Questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Stride-length cadence relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main outcome: coefficient of determination (R2) of the linear regression line&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes: peak velocity &amp; range of velocities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Cost of dual-task gait&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main outcome: variability (standard deviation) of stride length and cadence under&#xD;
           unconstrained and dual-task conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes: peek/range of velocities under the two conditions; the rating of&#xD;
           difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Comparison of change between K2 and K3 users&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main outcomes: scores from the Berg Balance Scale, Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire,&#xD;
           Amputee Mobility Predictor, L-test, 6-minute Walk Test, Physiological Cost Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes: Temporal/Spatial Gait Assessment, 3D joint range of motion, joint&#xD;
           angles at critical instants, the ground reaction force&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the single-subject design, the data will be evaluated both qualitatively&#xD;
      and with small-n design statistical methods.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At baseline and end of each phase (5 weeks) for the duration of the study, approximately 15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physiological Cost Index (PCI) is a measure of energy cost and can serve as a proxy measure of oxygen cost. Subject's heart rate will be measured manually before (resting heart rate) and within 30 s of completion of the 6-Minute Walk Test (exertion heart rate). PCI was calculated as the difference between the exertion heart rate and resting heart rate divided by the average walking speed (m/s) of the 6-minute Walk Test. A lower PCI value represents less energy cost during walking.</description>
