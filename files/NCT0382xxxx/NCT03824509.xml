      The goal is to review patients with known atrial fibrillation who suffered a stroke or&#xD;
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) to incorporate any structural heart abnormalities into the&#xD;
      overall clinical picture. A better understanding of the additional risk of a stroke or TIA in&#xD;
      patients with specific structural abnormalities may be beneficial in guiding future treatment&#xD;
      decisions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder seen in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk for stroke. This risk is determined&#xD;
      by several factors. Congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, female sex,&#xD;
      previous history of heart attack or vascular disease, and previous history of stroke all&#xD;
      increase a patients' risk for clot formation and stroke. These risk factors have been&#xD;
      formulated into a scoring system called the CHA2DS2-VASc score. A score of greater than 2 on&#xD;
      this scale indicates a moderate to high risk for clot formation and stroke. Anticoagulation&#xD;
      medications are recommended in these patients. Non-traditional risk factors such as left&#xD;
      atrial size and left ventricular hypertrophy have also been associated with increased stroke&#xD;
      risk. These factors have not yet been routinely incorporated into treatment decisions&#xD;
      regarding anticoagulation and stroke prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an expansion of an initial pilot conducted at Pen Bay Medical Center of patient&#xD;
      records from 2014-2017. This pilot found 19 patients with a recorded stroke or TIA, history&#xD;
      of atrial fibrillation, and CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or lower within that time period. This&#xD;
      study will be an expansion of that pilot to include patient data from Maine Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to look at these non-traditional risk factors in patients who have an&#xD;
      otherwise low stroke risk based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess left atrial volume using volumetric measurements and left ventricular septal and&#xD;
           posterior wall thickness from 2-D transthoracic echocardiography studies in patients&#xD;
           with known atrial fibrillation who suffered a stroke or TIA. The investigator would then&#xD;
           compare these data to control patients with atrial fibrillation with matched&#xD;
           CHA2DS2-VASc scores, age (+/- 5 years), and gender who have no history of stroke or TIA.&#xD;
           The goal is to identify higher risk patients with alternate anatomy who otherwise would&#xD;
           be considered lower risk using traditional risk scoring methods. Identifying these&#xD;
           individuals may lead to more aggressive interventions and subsequently may help in&#xD;
           reducing the risk of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess stroke outcome as measured by NIH Stroke Scale and/or Modified Rankin Scale&#xD;
           score, in the population of patients with atrial fibrillation who suffered a stroke to&#xD;
           identify any potential differences associated with structural changes. If structural&#xD;
           changes are associated with stroke severity, echocardiogram findings again may aid in&#xD;
           guiding treatment decisions for patients with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or TIA will have&#xD;
      alternate anatomy when compared to patients with atrial fibrillation with matched&#xD;
      CHA2DS2-VASc scores who have not had a stroke or TIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective matched case-control study of data collected at Pen Bay Medical&#xD;
      Center (PBMC) and Maine Medical Center (MMC) from 2014-2017. Patient records that met the&#xD;
      criteria as a case from PBMC have already been collected from existing data housed in the&#xD;
      American Heart Association's &quot;Get with the Guidelines&quot; registry as a pilot project. These&#xD;
      data will be included in this study and combined with controls identified from PBMC, and&#xD;
      cases and controls identified from existing EPIC data for MMC patients.&#xD;
