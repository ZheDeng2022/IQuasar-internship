      receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched breast cancer.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of using&#xD;
      durvalumab with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in participants with HER2-enriched breast cancer.&#xD;
      The standard or usual pre-surgery treatment for this type of disease are drugs called&#xD;
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab that target HER2. Studies have shown that trastuzumab and&#xD;
      pertuzumab treatment can stimulate the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells.&#xD;
      Durvalumab is a drug that also activates the immune system. The use of durvalumab together&#xD;
      with trastuzumab and pertuzumab treatment may allow the immune system to work harder to kill&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
