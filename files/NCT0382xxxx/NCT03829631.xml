  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain accounts for billions of dollars in health care expenditures. Most cases of&#xD;
      back pain do not have a clear cause. Thus, low back pain management methods usually rely on&#xD;
      targeting people' pain and discomfort. Painkillers, including opioids, are usually prescribed&#xD;
      in the emergency departments for people with low back pain. But, like all medications,&#xD;
      painkillers can have side effects, and some of those can be serious. There are also serious&#xD;
      concerns about the overuse of painkillers. Thus, newer pain management methods are needed to&#xD;
      reduce the use of painkillers in people with low back pain. Lumbar braces are one of the&#xD;
      underutilized low back pain management methods in the emergency departments. Like crutches&#xD;
      for leg and ankle injuries, they can minimise movements of the spine. This may decrease&#xD;
      people pain and improve their function. This may also reduce the use of painkillers. In&#xD;
      support of this approach, two recent studies conducted in a primary-care setting observed a&#xD;
      reduction in the use of painkillers in people with low back pain who wore lumbar braces. The&#xD;
      investigators are conducting this study to determine if wearing a lumbar brace for 4 weeks&#xD;
      following emergency department presentation will reduce people's pain and discomfort and&#xD;
      increase spine function. This may decrease the use of painkiller and future use of healthcare&#xD;
      resources. This research study may also assist emergency-department staff with offering new&#xD;
      recommendations to improve the quality of clinical decisions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND/SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global point prevalence of activity-limiting low back pain was 7.3% in 2015, implying&#xD;
      that 540 million people were affected at one time. Although people with acute or chronic low&#xD;
      back pain usually improve in the first six weeks, they usually suffer from low to moderate&#xD;
      levels of pain and disability in the first year. Low back pain is an urgent global public&#xD;
      health concern, accounting for billions of dollars in health care expenditures. Much of this&#xD;
      spending is for high-cost, low-value care such as evaluating low back pain in the emergency&#xD;
      department; only 3% of persons with low back pain attending the emergency department are&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital while those who are discharged leave without effective pain control.&#xD;
      This low-value approach is thought to increase use of additional health-related resources&#xD;
      including repeat use of the emergency department for future low back pain complaints and use&#xD;
      of opioids. This reduces limited available resources that should more appropriately be used&#xD;
      for other health care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While emergency departments routinely recommend analgesics for low back pain (paracetamol,&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, etc.), current guidelines do not support this&#xD;
      approach; only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended as second-line/adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment. As such, there is a critical need to provide emergency-department staff with&#xD;
      better short-term pain control solutions. One underutilized pain-control solution in&#xD;
      emergency departments is lumbar orthoses. Like crutches for leg or ankle injuries, lumbar&#xD;
      orthoses can minimise lumbar spine movements, which can reduce pain and discomfort while&#xD;
      preserving important aspects of daily function. In support of this approach, two recent&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials conducted in a primary-care setting observed a reduced analgesic&#xD;
      consumption in low back pain patients who received lumbar orthoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Wearing a semi-rigid lumbar brace for 4 weeks following emergency department&#xD;
           presentation will reduce participant pain and discomfort;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The same bracing protocol will improve spine function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The same bracing protocol will decrease analgesic consumption including opioids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The same bracing protocol will decrease future use of healthcare resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PRIMARY: To determine if lumbar bracing for 30 days after the emergency department&#xD;
           presentation will reduce low back pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SECONDARY: To determine if this same bracing protocol will improve spinal function and&#xD;
           quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SECONDARY: To establish if this same bracing protocol will reduce prescription and/or&#xD;
           consumption of analgesics;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. EXPLORATORY: To establish if this same bracing protocol will reduce back pain-related&#xD;
           use of health resources (e.g., emergency department, primary care, imaging, and&#xD;
           non-prescription management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a prospective, superiority, 1:1 allocation, randomised controlled trial with&#xD;
      concealed allocation. Specifically, the investigators will recruit people with benign low&#xD;
      back pain presenting to the Emergency Department. Superiority will be based on a minimally&#xD;
      clinically significant difference of our primary outcome measure (Numerical Pain Rating&#xD;
      Scale, a 0-10-point scale). Statisticians will be blinded to group allocation. The&#xD;
      investigators will exclude those with a confirmed cause of low back pain (e.g. trauma),&#xD;
      significant compression of the spinal cord/nerves and on-going workers' compensation or&#xD;
      litigation cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining approval from the University of Alberta's Health Research Ethics Board, the&#xD;
      investigators will invite people with benign low back pain presenting to Emergency Department&#xD;
      (to be determined) to consent and take part in the study. After enrolment, each participant&#xD;
      will be given a study number to maintain and track her/his records. The participant will be&#xD;
      then provided with a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) secure web address to complete&#xD;
      various data collection surveys (e.g. demographics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline session&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect demographics, comorbidities, medication, and self-reported&#xD;
      histories of imaging and treatment. Participants will use self-reported outcome tools to&#xD;
      quantify pain (Numerical Pain Rating Scale) and function (Roland-Morris Disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire). The investigators will then randomize participants to one of two arms: brace&#xD;
      or no brace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be instructed that the current study will not substitute their current&#xD;
      back pain management program. Participants in the intervention arm will be fitted with a&#xD;
      semi-rigid prefabricated lumbar brace (Horizon 627 Lumbar Brace, Aspen Medical Company, Oak&#xD;
      Canyon, Irvine, CA 92618). The brace is a one-size adjustable design to fit waists ranging&#xD;
      from 24-70 inches. Participants will be instructed to wear the brace for six weeks. As this&#xD;
      brace is semi-rigid, it does not prevent motion - only reduces motion in the lumbar areas.&#xD;
      Our prior work and that of others have shown that this type of bracing does not reduce spinal&#xD;
      function and is not associated with atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: the investigators will deploy the REDCap randomisation tool to assign&#xD;
      participants evenly into the intervention and control groups. The tool uses a defined&#xD;
      parameter (subject ID in this study) to create a template allocation table. The on-site&#xD;
      research assistant will enter each participant's REDCap record and then click the &quot;Randomize&quot;&#xD;
      button. This will trigger REDCap to check the allocation table and display the group to which&#xD;
      the participant should be assigned. The assignment is permanent and not editable within the&#xD;
      participant record and, like all other activity within REDCap, is tracked and not modifiable&#xD;
      in the audit log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported questionnaires: the investigators will measure participants' pain level using&#xD;
      the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. the investigators will use the Roland-Morris Disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire and the Oswestry Disability Index to measure participant function and&#xD;
      disability level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after wearing the brace (only the intervention group): To assess the immediate&#xD;
      impact of the brace, participants will use self-reported outcome tools on the REDCap to&#xD;
      quantify pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) immediately after wearing the brace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the quality (how tightly the brace has been worn) and quantity (how much time the&#xD;
      brace has been worn) of brace usage, a low-powered portable heat and load monitoring system&#xD;
      will be embedded within the pressure pad of the brace. The force measurement part of the&#xD;
      monitoring system is sensitive to the forces normal to the brace surface, but not to shear&#xD;
      forces, and can be deployed to monitor the quality of the brace wear by participants.28 The&#xD;
      temperature part of the monitoring system gives an accurate and stable output over the&#xD;
      temperature range from 5 °C to 50 °C,29 and can be deployed to monitor how long the brace has&#xD;
      been worn during the brace treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (both groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a series of short message service (SMS) text messages 3&#xD;
      times/week for 4 weeks to evaluate Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Roland-Morris Disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire, brace usage, and analgesic consumption. The investigators will also collect a&#xD;
      series of outcomes and interview questions by SMS at 2 and 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use participant healthcare numbers (obtained at baseline with consent)&#xD;
      to perform an exploratory analysis through the Alberta Bone and Joint Health Network of&#xD;
      health care resource utilization in the year before and during the trial (e.g. prescriptions&#xD;
      filled, primary care or emergency department visits, imaging usage, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of each intervention, blinding will not be feasible for participants.&#xD;
      However, the outcomes assessor, outcome adjudicators, and the statistician will be blinded to&#xD;
      the actual allocation. The investigators will develop two interpretations of our results&#xD;
      based on a blinded review of the primary outcome data (intervention A vs. intervention B).&#xD;
      One scenario will assume intervention A was brace and the other will assume intervention A&#xD;
      was routine recommendations. Only after our team has agreed that there will be no further&#xD;
      changes in the interpretation of the scenarios will the randomisation code be broken, and the&#xD;
      correct interpretation used in manuscript preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will employ a repeated model of analysis of variance to compare pain level&#xD;
      between groups. The investigators will use age, gender, and pain severity as potential&#xD;
      covariates if randomization does not result in group equivalence. The investigators will also&#xD;
      estimate the effect size of differences between and within the groups for pain using Cohen's&#xD;
      d.&#xD;
