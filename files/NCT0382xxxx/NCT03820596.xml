  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma(ENKTCL) is a distinct lymphoid neoplasm with&#xD;
      aggressive course and poor outcomes. Optimal treatment strategies for advanced ENKTCL have&#xD;
      not been fully defined.Patients with disseminated or relapsed disease have a very poor&#xD;
      outcome,and there is no standard management for relapsed or refractory disease.Combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment.In small retrospective studies have observed&#xD;
      very good response and survival rates in patients treated with L-asparaginase.In several&#xD;
      prospective study that examined relapsed/refractory patients treated with SMILE outside a&#xD;
      trial setting,the efficacy sounds good. But treatment related mortality was 7%. The regimen&#xD;
      has toxicity, with careful attention to adverse effects and skill acquired through&#xD;
      experience. Chidamide, a oral subtype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor monotherapy was&#xD;
      effective on the patients with relapsed or refractory ENKTCL in our study. Objective response&#xD;
      rate was 50.0% (6/12) with complete response(CR) rate 33.3 %( 4/12).All four CR patients were&#xD;
      still in disease-free more than 6.9 months (6.9-10.5). ENKTCL are invariably infected by&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus(EBV).EBV-infected lymphoma cells upregulate programmed death ligand 1&#xD;
      (PDL1), ligand of the inhibitory receptor programmed death 1(PD1) on T cells.Ligation of PDL1&#xD;
      on lymphoma cells with PD1 on effector T cells suppresses T-cell cytotoxicity. The PDL1/PD1&#xD;
      axis is therefore a potential mechanism for ENKTCL to avert effector T-cell targeting.PD1&#xD;
      blockadewith pembrolizumab was a potent strategy for ENKTCL failing L-asparaginase regimens&#xD;
      in several reports.We carried out a single, open-label, multicenter clinical trial enrolled&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory ENKTCL to safety and efficacy of sintilimab in&#xD;
      combination With chidamide.&#xD;
