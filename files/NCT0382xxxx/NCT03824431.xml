  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have a normal upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy. Attempts have been made to define new endoscopic techniques for&#xD;
      identification of abnormalities non detected in standard endoscopic exam. The high definition&#xD;
      endoscopy with NBI could achieve a more detailed mucosal evaluation, allowing distal&#xD;
      esophageal microerosions identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective was validate the presence and the meaning of distal esophageal mucosal&#xD;
      microerosions using high definition endoscopy and NBI through esophageal biopsy in&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease symptomatic patients and the association with GERD&#xD;
      physiopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy patients were selected from the gastroenterology outpatient clinic (University of Sao&#xD;
      Paulo Hospital) Endoscopic evaluation was sequentially performed after the pHmetry and&#xD;
      esophageal manometry. Esophageal mucosal biopsies were obtained following established&#xD;
      protocol for histological and immunohistochemical study.&#xD;

      In this study the investigators focused the attention on patients with symptomatic GERD&#xD;
      according to inclusion criteria and used high definition endoscopy with NBI in an attempt to&#xD;
      increase the possibility of esophageal microerosion identification. The study was&#xD;
      complemented with examinations of esophageal phmetry. During endoscopy, esophageal biopsies&#xD;
      were obtained in patients with microerosions and controls (without microerosion). The&#xD;
      collected material was evaluated by histopathological and immunohistochemical methods&#xD;
      (interleukins-IL6, IL8 and IL1β) in an attempt to identify inflammatory alterations. The&#xD;
      results of this investigation could contribute to the evaluation of microerosions as an early&#xD;
      and significant abnormality with possible participation in the pathophysiology of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objectives To validate the presence and clinical significance of endoscopic&#xD;
      microerosions in patients submitted to esophageal mucosal biopsies, with typical symptoms of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux, using high definition endoscopy with (NBI), prolonged pHmetry,&#xD;
      histopathological and immuno- histochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate the presence of microerosions in the distal esophagus, as found in&#xD;
           high-resolution endoscopy with NBI, in patients with typical symptoms of&#xD;
           Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verify the association of microerosions in the distal esophagus in high-resolution&#xD;
           endoscopy exams with NBI, with the manometric findings of esophageal perfusion&#xD;
           manometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To observe the changes in the prolonged pHmetry in patients with microerosions in the&#xD;
           distal esophagus through high definition endoscopy with NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the significance of the histological and immunohistochemical changes of&#xD;
           tissue specimens obtained in esophageal biopsies of patients with microerosions in the&#xD;
           distal esophagus, in high definition endoscopy with NBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, descriptive and cross-sectional study that included 90 patients, with&#xD;
      GERD complaints. Seventy patients were selected as the object of study according to&#xD;
      previously established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected patients were informed&#xD;
      about their participation and signed an informed consent term. The histopathology and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry studies were carried out in the Department of Pathology of the same&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study patients were evaluated after selection according to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria on two occasions. On the first day, the examinations of esophageal manometry and&#xD;
      phmetria were performed. The next day the pHmetry probe was removed and then the high&#xD;
      definition endoscopy with NBI and the biopsies in the distal esophagus were performed. This&#xD;
      approach facilitated patient adherence, especially in relation to logistics in performing the&#xD;
      tests, and could represent more accurately the association of the tests performed. It was&#xD;
      previously established that incomplete data from the exams would lead to the exclusion of the&#xD;
      patient from the study.&#xD;
