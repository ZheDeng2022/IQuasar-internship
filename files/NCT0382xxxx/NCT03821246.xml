    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab works alone or in combination with&#xD;
      tocilizumab in treating men with localized prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. IL-6 is expressed by&#xD;
      prostate cancer and within the tumor microenvironment and shown to enhance prostate cancer&#xD;
      and disease progression. Treatment with an anti-IL-6 antibody such as tocilizumab may inhibit&#xD;
      cancer progression. Giving atezolizumab in combination with tocilizumab may work better in&#xD;
      treating prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the composition and&#xD;
      function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab-based combination therapy in&#xD;
      localized prostate cancer (PC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the clinical efficacy of atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized&#xD;
      PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize changes in the frequency and number of circulating immune cells following&#xD;
      atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the composition and&#xD;
      phenotype of the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the circulating and&#xD;
      intratumoral T cell repertoire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the role of novel imaging modalities to understand the immunologic and&#xD;
      clinical impact to immunotherapeutic approaches in localized PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To characterize changes in the gut microbiome associated with each therapeutic&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned sequentially to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive one cycle of atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1 of a 14 day cycle prior to radical prostatectomy (RP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients will receive 1 cycle of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and tocilizumab prior to&#xD;
      RP; atezolizumab will be administered in an identical fashion as Cohort A. Tocilizumab will&#xD;
      be administered at a dose of 6 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two more groups consisting of treatment with atezolizumab in combination with other drugs may&#xD;
      be added in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RP will occur 21 days (+/- 7 days) following treatments on Cycle 1 Day 1. No further study&#xD;
      therapy will be administered following RP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following RP, subjects will be followed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (from&#xD;
      date of RP), or until disease progression, whichever occurs sooner&#xD;
