      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia rates are increasing worldwide and consequently burden global healthcare resources&#xD;
      to a serious degree. However, there is a declining number of caregivers to provide care. It&#xD;
      is for this reason that many new technologies, such as socially assistive robots, have been&#xD;
      developed because of their potential to support caregivers in promoting the independence of&#xD;
      people with dementia. Most of the (socially assistive) robots have so far been tested for&#xD;
      people without dementia in mainly laboratory or institutional settings, like nursing homes.&#xD;
      Consequently, there is a lack of knowledge about the possible uses of robots from the&#xD;
      perspective of those affected by dementia in real-life/care situations (e.g. at home).&#xD;
      Testing in a laboratory setting cannot capture the complexity and high variability of&#xD;
      everyday situations occurring during the care of persons with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a mixed method intervention study of a refined socially assistive humanoid&#xD;
      robot. In total, three people with dementia, three relatives, three dementia trainers and&#xD;
      three professional caregivers were included in the study. Quantitative data of technology&#xD;
      acceptance were collected using the &quot;Technology Usage Inventory&quot;. Qualitative data (main&#xD;
      focus: experiences with the robot and handling the robot) were collected by means of&#xD;
      observation and qualitative interviews. Movement data of people with dementia were collected&#xD;
      by means of the eye camera of the robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study helps to further refine and test a socially assistive robot for people with&#xD;
      dementia living at home.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire &quot;Technology Usage Inventory&quot; measures technology acceptance. It captures technology-specific and psychological factors contributing to the use of a technological device. The questionnaire has 8 dimensions (curiosity:4 items, anxiety:4 items, interest:4 items, usability/user-friendliness: 3 items, immersion:4 items, utility:4 items, skepticism:4 items and accessibility:3 items) with 30 items (7-point Likert scale). For every dimension 1- 21 or 28 points can be obtained. For all dimensions, higher levels on the respective dimension indicate a higher level of expression in the respective construct.</description>
