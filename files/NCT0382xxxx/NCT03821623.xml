  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the number one cause of&#xD;
      death in developed societies. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) increase with age and is a key&#xD;
      intermediary factor linking aging to increased CVD risk. The primary mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      the age-associated increase in SBP is stiffening of the large elastic arteries, which is&#xD;
      mediated by increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular smooth muscle tone.&#xD;
      Regular caloric restriction is effective at lowering SBP in middle-aged and older adults;&#xD;
      however, adherence to caloric restriction is poor and may be detrimental to normal weight&#xD;
      older adults due to reduced skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density. Therefore,&#xD;
      identification of more practical alternative interventions that mimic the beneficial effects&#xD;
      of caloric restriction, with stronger adherence and less risk of adverse consequences, is of&#xD;
      significant biomedical importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotinamide riboside is a naturally occurring precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#xD;
      (NAD+), a critical mediator of the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, and therefore a&#xD;
      novel caloric restriction mimetic compound. We recently completed the first pilot study of&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside supplementation in healthy middle-aged and older adults and&#xD;
      demonstrated that 6 weeks of supplementation decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 8&#xD;
      mmHg in individuals with baseline SBP of 120-139 mmHg (elevated SBP/stage 1 hypertension)&#xD;
      compared with placebo, and lowered arterial stiffness, a strong independent predictor of CVD&#xD;
      and related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a next translational step, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      clinical trial to further assess the safety and efficacy of oral nicotinamide riboside (3&#xD;
      months vs placebo) for decreasing SBP and arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older men and&#xD;
      women with SBP between 120 and 139 mmHg at baseline.&#xD;

      Study Overview: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design,&#xD;
      single site phase IIa clinical trial assessing the efficacy of nicotinamide riboside&#xD;
      supplementation to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and aortic stiffness in middle-aged to&#xD;
      older (MA/O) adults (50-79 years) with elevated to stage-1 systolic hypertension (SBP:&#xD;
      120-139 mmHg). Nicotinamide riboside is an endogenously occurring precursor of NAD+ and a&#xD;
      novel caloric restriction mimetic in humans that is now commercially available as a dietary&#xD;
      ingredient/supplement. We have recently demonstrated that chronic supplementation with&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside lowers SBP and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV;&#xD;
      gold-standard measure of aortic stiffness and independent risk factor for cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases) in a small pilot study of healthy MA/O adults; the greatest reductions in SBP were&#xD;
      observed in a subgroup with baseline SBP in the elevated/stage-1 hypertension range. As a&#xD;
      next translational step, the present study proposes to assess the efficacy of 3 months of&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside supplementation for decreasing SBP (primary outcome) and aortic&#xD;
      stiffness (secondary outcome) in a larger cohort of MA/O men and women with SBP in the&#xD;
      elevated/stage-1 hypertension range. As secondary aims, we will also assess safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of long-term nicotinamide riboside supplementation, and the effects of&#xD;
      nicotinamide riboside supplementation vs. placebo on NAD+ metabolites and circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers of vasoconstriction, oxidative stress and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Enrollment and Screening: Potential participants will be made aware of the proposed&#xD;
      study through described recruitment efforts (see Recruitment and Retention section).&#xD;
      Interested participants will contact a staff research assistant via phone or email (contact&#xD;
      information supplied with recruitment materials) and will complete a general screening form&#xD;
      online through the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system to determine eligibility.&#xD;
      REDCap is a secure web-based application designed to support data capture for research&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hearing a thorough study description and having all questions answered by the staff&#xD;
      research assistant, those eligible and interested in participating in the study will provide&#xD;
      written and verbal informed consent, and undergo in-person screening at the CU Boulder&#xD;
      Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC). Informed consent will only be obtained by&#xD;
      members of the research team who have been observed and approved by the CTRC Research Subject&#xD;
      Advocate (see Protection of Human Subjects). We plan to consent 148 subjects in order to meet&#xD;
      our enrollment targets (to account for an ~25% rate of exclusion base on in-person&#xD;
      screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-person screening will include: review of medical history; physical exam; resting heart&#xD;
      rate; resting blood pressure; blood draw for metabolic profile, lipid profile, complete blood&#xD;
      count, and thyroid stimulating hormone; measurement of ankle-brachial index; and a 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG at rest and during graded exercise testing (see the Eligibility Criteria section for&#xD;
      detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting blood pressure will be measured on a second occasion within one week of the initial&#xD;
      screening to establish baseline blood pressure status; SBP measured on the two separate days&#xD;
      will be averaged and must be in the elevated to stage-1 hypertension range (120-139 mmHg) for&#xD;
      enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Randomization and Subject/Investigator Blinding: After completing screening,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will be randomized to either the nicotinamide riboside or placebo group. A&#xD;
      randomized block design will be used to balance groups for sex, age (mid-life: 50-64 years&#xD;
      vs. older: 65-79 years) and hypertension status (elevated vs. stage-1 systolic hypertension).&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out by an unblinded staff research assistant who is not&#xD;
      involved in data collection or analysis. Subjects will be categorized based on the block&#xD;
      randomization scheme and then a random number generator will be used to assign subjects to&#xD;
      either nicotinamide riboside or placebo treatment. Researchers involved in collection of&#xD;
      outcome data will be blinded to the assigned intervention. Subjects will be blinded to their&#xD;
      assigned intervention and will receive capsules in coded blister packs; nicotinamide riboside&#xD;
      and placebo capsules will appear identical. CTRC clinical staff involved with subject&#xD;
      check-in visits and/or data collection will also be blinded (in the case of a serious adverse&#xD;
      event, blinding of the CTRC staff will be broken, as necessary to ensure appropriate medical&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Study Outcomes: All subjects will undergo baseline testing for all primary,&#xD;
      secondary, and other outcome measures. All measurements will be made after a 12 hour fast&#xD;
      from food and caffeine (water allowed) and 24 hours after abstaining from alcohol and&#xD;
      exercise. All tests will take place in the CU Boulder CTRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol for baseline testing is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample collection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of casual SBP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placement of IV in an antecubital vein followed by 30 minutes of rest in a supine&#xD;
           position; - Collection of blood samples by a trained CTRC provider;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of aortic stiffness by CFPWV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of outcome measure testing, the below non-outcome measures will be made&#xD;
      in order to ensure that participant characteristics known to affect cardiovascular function&#xD;
      are unaltered during the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-day diet records to ensure that daily fluid and caloric intake remain stable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire will&#xD;
           be completed and physical activity will be assessed by accelerometers (ActiGraph, 3-day&#xD;
           recordings) to document stability of physical activity levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal oxygen consumption using indirect calorimetry during incremental treadmill&#xD;
           exercise (Balke protocol) will be measured to document unchanged aerobic fitness; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition will be assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and&#xD;
           anthropometry to confirm unaltered body composition; body mass will also be determined&#xD;
           during safety and check in visits with CTRC nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following all CTRC testing procedures, subjects will be outfitted with an ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor pre-programmed to automatically measure blood pressure every 20 minutes. A&#xD;
      study team member will provide the subject with written and verbal instructions on how to&#xD;
      operate the monitor. Subjects will wear the monitor for 24 hours before returning it to the&#xD;
      investigators. Ambulatory blood pressure data will be evaluated for completeness immediately&#xD;
      upon return of the monitor; if an inadequate number of blood pressure measurements (&lt;67% of&#xD;
      expected) were made to properly characterize 24-hour SBP the subject will be re-outfitted&#xD;
      with the ambulatory monitor, be re-instructed on its use, and wear it for a second 24-hour&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Strategy and Outcome Measures sections provide a more detailed description of&#xD;
      these procedures. Similar protocols and procedures are well established in the Seals&#xD;
      laboratory and the CU Boulder CTRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of the Intervention: After completing baseline testing, subjects will begin their&#xD;
      assigned intervention (nicotinamide riboside or placebo). Subjects will be instructed to take&#xD;
      2 x 250 mg capsules in the morning and 2 x 250 mg capsules in the evening (4 capsules/day).&#xD;
      This will result in a dosing of 500 mg nicotinamide riboside 2x/day in the nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside group (1000 mg/day total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the CU Boulder CTRC once every two weeks for check-in and to receive&#xD;
      capsules. Capsules will be prepared by the manufacturer in blister packs to promote adherence&#xD;
      and will be stored and dispensed by the CTRC pharmacist (unblinded) and distributed by a CTRC&#xD;
      nurse (blinded). Subjects will return their blister packs at each check-in visit and after&#xD;
      follow-up testing to assess adherence to the intervention. During each visit to the CTRC,&#xD;
      subjects will be monitored for treatment-emergent adverse events by blinded CTRC clinical&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Testing: After completing 3 months of treatment with either nicotinamide riboside or&#xD;
      placebo, subjects will return to the CU Boulder CTRC for reassessment of all outcome&#xD;
      measures, including: casual SBP, 24-h ambulatory SBP, CFPWV, venous blood draw, and urine&#xD;
      sample. Non-outcome control measures (3-day diet record, CHAMPS survey, activity monitor,&#xD;
      maximal oxygen consumption test, body composition) will also be reassessed. These measures&#xD;
      will be made under the same experimental conditions, in the same order, and with the same&#xD;
      techniques as baseline testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Duration and Study Sample Size: The expected duration for a participant to&#xD;
      complete the entire protocol from screening to follow-up testing is 18 weeks. Based on our&#xD;
      power analysis, we need to complete the entire protocol on a total of 94 participants&#xD;
      (47/group) to detect a significant difference between treatment conditions in our primary&#xD;
      outcome measure (SBP). We intend to enroll 118 subjects (59/group) to account for an ~20%&#xD;
      dropout rate. Based on this, we will enroll 2-3 subjects per month, which will allow for&#xD;
      completion of data collection by month 55 of this award; this rate of testing is achievable&#xD;
      based on previous pharmacological interventions carried out in the Seals laboratory and the&#xD;
      availability of the CTRC facilities and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Analysis (including blinding): Collection of primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures will be performed by postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Craighead, with the assistance&#xD;
      of members of the laboratory. IV placement and blood draws will be performed by experienced&#xD;
      CTRC clinical staff. Data analysis will be performed by Dr. Craighead. Having a single&#xD;
      investigator perform all data collection and analysis will remove the potential for&#xD;
      inter-investigator variation. Dr. Craighead and other research and clinical staff involved in&#xD;
      data acquisition will remain blinded throughout data collection and analysis. All data will&#xD;
      be analyzed as outlined in the Research Strategy section and Outcome Measures section; data&#xD;
      analysis and dissemination of results will be completed by the end of this award.&#xD;
