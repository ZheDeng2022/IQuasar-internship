    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Bone Healing Accelerant (BHA) product when applied to tibia (leg bone) fractures with an&#xD;
      external wound or skin break (also called open tibia fractures). It is hypothesized that by 6&#xD;
      months, the number of subjects with successful bone healing will be greater in the&#xD;
      BHA-treated group compared to subjects treated with standard of care alone. Open tibia&#xD;
      fractures were chosen for this study because healing rates are typically longer than for&#xD;
      other bone fractures due to the limited vascular supply, limited soft tissue coverage, and&#xD;
      higher risk of infection.&#xD;

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is between the ages of 18-75 inclusive at time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has an acute open Gustilo-Anderson Type IIIA or IIIB fracture of the tibia&#xD;
             shaft, with or without a fibula fracture, secondary to trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient received antibiotic treatment within 2 hours of presentation at initial&#xD;
             medical facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient underwent their first operative debridement within 24 hours of presentation at&#xD;
             initial medical facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is scheduled to have DWC within 14 days of initial injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The tibia fracture requires open fracture reduction and internal fixation with&#xD;
             intramedullary (IM) nailing;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IM nailing has been cross-locked for stability with a 4-5mm interlock, with a&#xD;
                  minimum of 1 static screw above the fracture site and 1 static screw below the&#xD;
                  fracture site, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All IM nails have a diameter between 8.5-12mm with 1.0-1.5mm over-reaming of the&#xD;
                  canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The temporary use of external fixation prior to IM rodding and DWC is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Upon stabilization of the tibia fracture, the patient has a cortical deficit of less&#xD;
             than or equal to 1.0cm involving no more than 50% of the tibia circumference. The&#xD;
             cortical deficit of the residual 50% circumference must be less than 1.0cm. Gap&#xD;
             assessments to be made with calibrated radiographs or visual inspection. In addition,&#xD;
             patients are not likely to require a secondary procedure(s) to promote bone healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. BHA is able to be applied through existing soft tissue defects created by the injury&#xD;
             or those created during surgical treatment. No new incisions should be required&#xD;
             specifically for application of BHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient is willing and able to comply with all study procedures including all&#xD;
             pre-operative, post-operative and rehabilitation requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient is able to give voluntary IC to participate and has signed an IC form specific&#xD;
             to this study prior to study treatment and DWC.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients of childbearing potential must use adequate methods of contraception during&#xD;
             the duration of follow-up (12-months). Adequate methods include abstinence, female and&#xD;
