  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Majority of patients after allo stem cell transplantation have malnutrition and decrease of&#xD;
      physical activities. This state impacts on quality of life and on outcome of some&#xD;
      complications like infections, graft versus host disease and could decrease the overall&#xD;
      survival. In this study, the investigators propose cooking education and adapted physical&#xD;
      activity to improve that. Cooking education and adapted physical activity at home will be&#xD;
      performed by two famous chefs for the first one and by a sportive coach for the second every&#xD;
      twice week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow transplantation is the main strategy to cure leukemia and others hematopoietic&#xD;
      malignancies. It includes a first step of chemotherapy during several days (combined&#xD;
      sometimes to radiotherapy), a second step of stem cells infusion and a third step of&#xD;
      management of complications during several months: side effects, infections or graft versus&#xD;
      host disease (GvHD). Symptoms are cutaneous, hepatic and digestive (nausea, diarrhea,&#xD;
      vomiting) and could be unfortunately followed by the death of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional status is known to be important during the treatment of all cancers. After bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation, patients could have some digestive disorders that could induce&#xD;
      malnutrition that could have an impact of time of hospitalization, intensity of complications&#xD;
      and outcome of these ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients go back home after allo stem cell transplantation, they take several medicines,&#xD;
      they have digestive side effects of past treatments could alter mucous, taste and all&#xD;
      digestive tracts. During at least 100 days, patients take immunosuppressive therapies and&#xD;
      they are going to develop new immune system. Therefore, they must follow some food rules to&#xD;
      avoid infectious diseases. Patients feel some difficulties to eat good food and refuse often&#xD;
      social activities. All of these have an impact on quality of life and induce an increase of&#xD;
      malnutrition observed already directly after allo stem cell transplantation. Some&#xD;
      complications could also increase malnutrition like digestive GvHD or digestive infections.&#xD;
      Malnutrition could also induce physical troubles. Patients need until one year to recover&#xD;
      physical conditions before the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to improve nutritional status and physical activity of patients&#xD;
      after allo stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose at all patients included in the study cooking education and adapted&#xD;
      physical activity every twice week in alternance. Cooking education will be performed by two&#xD;
      famous chefs in their kitchens. Patients (until 3 months after bone marrow transplantation)&#xD;
      and one member of their family are invited to cook and taste. They will receive lot of advice&#xD;
      to make several recipes at home and will adapt their cooking methods to respect food rules.&#xD;
      Adapted physical activity will be performed by a sportive coach at home. The coach will give&#xD;
      them some physical exercises to do between two sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, aged more than 18 years old and signing the consent form, are included in the study&#xD;
      before allo stem cell transplantation. Nutritional status evaluation will be performed by a&#xD;
      nutritionist using some tests: sit up test, hand grip, bioelectrical impedance analysis, mid&#xD;
      upper arm circumference, analogic evaluation of appetite, blood tests: C reactive protein,&#xD;
      transthyretin, albumin. The nutritionist will analyze also body mass index, the weight loss&#xD;
      percent, the subjective global assessment, the health quality of life assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation will be performed before allo stem cell transplantation, at day 0, 30, 100 and&#xD;
      300.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to observe an improvement of nutritional status, quality of life, a&#xD;
      decrease of the number of infections and GvHD and at the end an increase of overall survival.&#xD;
