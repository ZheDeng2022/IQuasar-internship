  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental models have linked lipid lowering therapies with systemic inflammation; however,&#xD;
      relatively little is known about this network in clinical populations and specifically how it&#xD;
      changes with PCSK9 inhibition. The eligible subjects will have 6 visits in 13 to 16 weeks and&#xD;
      will have Repatha/placebo 140mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks for 3 times since randomization&#xD;
      visit, blood tests will be done in each visit to evaluate the effects of evolocumab upon&#xD;
      biocellular markers potentially altered by PCSK9 inhibition in a population of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes patients with microvascular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the ACUTE and SHORT-TERM effects of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab on biocellular&#xD;
      markers of inflammation, immune mediated thrombosis and rheology. The data from this trial&#xD;
      will be used to support a clinical trial to assess the role of PCSK9 inhibition in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes patients with cardiac microvascular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define the association between PCSK 9 concentrations and immune-related phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To define the association between Lp(a) concentrations, oxidized phospholipids (OxPL),&#xD;
           ApoB, biocellular markers of inflammation, tissue factor and immunothrombosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase IV study&#xD;
      with two treatment arms: evolocumab SC 420 mg/dL QM or matching placebo. The population will&#xD;
      include 40 participants with documented Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease (CAD, Stroke, PAD)&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes who receive treatment with maximal tolerated statin therapy and stable&#xD;
      doses of anti-hyperglycemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 12 weeks during the treatment phase, maintaining the&#xD;
      double-blind throughout. Assessments of ACUTE and SHORT-TERM effects of PCSK9 inhibition with&#xD;
      evolocumab on biocellular markers of endothelial function will be measured at baseline, Week&#xD;
      2, and Week 12. Safety assessments will be undertaken at each study visit.&#xD;

    <description>The Seattle Angina Questionnaire is a quality-of-life measure for patients with coronary artery disease. The SAQ is a self-report instrument with 19 items that yields five subscale scores: physical limitation, angina stability, angina frequency, treatment satisfaction, and disease perception. The possible range of scores for each of the five subscales is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. There is no summary score generated.</description>
