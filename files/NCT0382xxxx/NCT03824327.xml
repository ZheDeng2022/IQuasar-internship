    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well papaverine hydrochloride and&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation therapy body (SBRT) work in treating patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer. Papaverine hydrochloride may help radiation therapy work better by making tumor cells&#xD;
      more sensitive to the radiation therapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special&#xD;
      equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This&#xD;
      method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to&#xD;
      normal tissue. Giving papaverine hydrochloride with SBRT may work in treating patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of concurrent papaverine hydrochloride (PPV), and&#xD;
      lung SBRT in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or lung metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess primary tumor control rate, local control rate, local-regional recurrence&#xD;
      free-survival (LRRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS),&#xD;
      and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) studies can predict which patients may respond best to PPV + SBRT, and detect&#xD;
      changes in oxygenation before and after PPV administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess whether blood-based micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) biomarkers can predict&#xD;
      which patients may respond best to PPV + SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of papaverine hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and receive papaverine&#xD;
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1. Within 30-90 minutes, patients undergo a second&#xD;
      BOLD fMRI. Patients then receive papaverine hydrochloride IV and within 30-90 minutes after&#xD;
      dose undergo SBRT for a up to 4-5 sessions over 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, 1&#xD;
      and 2 years, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
