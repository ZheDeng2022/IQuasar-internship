  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent autism spectrum disorder subjects with associated GI symptoms will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive oral dosing of CP101 capsules in Treatment Group I or matching placebo capsules in&#xD;
      Treatment Group II. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of CP101 in subjects with ASD and associated GI symptoms.&#xD;
