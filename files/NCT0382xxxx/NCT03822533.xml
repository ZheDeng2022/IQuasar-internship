  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Almost half of the Swedish population are overweight or obese. This will probably&#xD;
      affect the incidence of osteoarthritis since overweight is a strong risk factor.&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis consultations is expected to increase with 30-50% within the next 20 years.&#xD;
      Today, in Swedish primary care, both physicians and physical therapists are primary assessors&#xD;
      for patients with suspected knee osteoarthritis. A task shifting with physiotherapists as the&#xD;
      only primary assessor could increase the access rate to physicians in primary care for&#xD;
      patients with more severe disorders. Yet, it is unclear what effects these different&#xD;
      healthcare processes have and the costs of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The overall purpose of this study is to perform an economic evaluation of two&#xD;
      healthcare processes, where a healthcare process initiated by a physiotherapist is compared&#xD;
      with when it is initiated with a physician for patients with suspected knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 100 patients will be randomized either to a physical therapist or to a physician for&#xD;
      first assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Measurements of health-related quality of life and&#xD;
      costs for visits to physical therapist, physician or other healthcare provider, drug&#xD;
      prescriptions and sick-leave will be collected. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted, presenting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and a non-parametric&#xD;
      bootstrapping will be conducted to demonstrate the uncertainties surrounding the ICER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: It is expected that this randomized controlled study will show the effects&#xD;
      on quality adjusted life years, cost-efficiency and cost-utility of two different primary&#xD;
      assessors for patients with suspected knee osteoarthritis consulting primary care. The&#xD;
      results could clarify which profession that is most appropriate to be the primary assessor&#xD;
      for patients with suspected knee osteoarthritis in primary care.&#xD;

      Problem statements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the difference in cost efficiency between a healthcare process with a physical&#xD;
      therapist as primary assessor and a physician as primary assessor for patients with suspected&#xD;
      KOA?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Which effect does a clinical pathway with a physical therapist as primary assessor for&#xD;
      patients with suspected knee osteoarthritis have on quality adjusted life years compared with&#xD;
      a physician as primary assessor?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the differences in costs between the two healthcare processes initiated by either a&#xD;
      physiotherapist or a physician set against the differences in effects?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some data has already been collected for another clinical trial (ID: NCT03715764), which will&#xD;
      be used in this study too. The patient recruitment is finished, while data collection&#xD;
      regarding cost variables has not started yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recruited from primary care centers and rehabilitation centers in southwestern&#xD;
      Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses and administration personnel at the recruitment units got information about the study&#xD;
      and the screening protocol from the data collector and project leader. Each recruiting unit&#xD;
      had a contact person that were responsible for the protocols and to contact the data&#xD;
      collector when an eligible patient was found. It was regular contact between the project&#xD;
      leader and the contact persons at the recruiting units. All screening protocols were sent to&#xD;
      the data collector. All participants got orally and written information about the study from&#xD;
      the data collector, and patients provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated list of random numbers was used, where participants were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to being assessed, diagnosed and treated either by a physiotherapist or a physician&#xD;
      first. The project coordinator managed the sequence generation, allocation concealment,&#xD;
      enrolment and assignments of participants and kept the concealed randomization scheme and&#xD;
      sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes in a locked cupboard (in the same building where the&#xD;
      enrolment will be), only available for the project coordinator. The project coordinator&#xD;
      revealed the allocation to the participant shortly after the baseline measurement and to the&#xD;
      health care providers. Data collector, data analyst and statistician were blinded of&#xD;
      allocation until completion of data collection for the primary outcome measures at the 12&#xD;
      months follow up for the last recruited patient. Group allocation was revealed when analysing&#xD;
      data for the other clinical trial (ID: NCT03715764).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project coordinator was not involved in the screening procedure nor the data collection,&#xD;
      and was included among the healthcare providers in the study. The blinded data collector and&#xD;
      analyst, whom is a physical therapist, were not involved in assessing, diagnosing and&#xD;
      treating patients with knee osteoarthritis while the first study (ID: NCT03715764) was&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data and measurements of HrQoL has already been collected for another clinical&#xD;
      trial (ID: NCT03715764). These data will also be used for the cost-efficiency analysis.&#xD;
      Demographic data were collected at baseline. Measurements of HrQoL were measured with EuroQol&#xD;
      5 dimensions 3 levels (EQ5D-3L) and collected at baseline (before randomization), 3- , 6- and&#xD;
      12 months follow ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New data collection will be made for cost variables. Data regarding costs for the healthcare&#xD;
      processes will be extracted from patient journals. The costs for visits to physical&#xD;
      therapist, physician or other healthcare provider will be collected from the healthcare&#xD;
      organization. The drug prices will be collected from the Swedish Association of Local&#xD;
      Authorities and Regions for the time period the drugs were prescribed. Production loss due to&#xD;
      sick-leave and health care visits will be valued according to mean gross salary (including&#xD;
      taxes and social fees).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculating total costs (number of contacts per patient * costs ) for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiotherapy contacts in primary care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician contacts in primary care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral to x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referrals to other healthcare givers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sick-leave days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be coded and managed according to the General Data Protection Regulation. All&#xD;
      data will be confidential and only authorized will have access to the patient registry. No&#xD;
      individual information can be identified since the results will be presented at group level.&#xD;
      Data will be saved for at least 10 years to enable audit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 50 patients per group will be necessary to detect a minimal clinical&#xD;
      improvement of 0.121(SD 0.2) on the EQ5D-3L-index, given an anticipated dropout rate of 14%.&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was calculated with a two-sided 5% significance level and a power&#xD;
      of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed descriptively and presented as numbers and percent, mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation or median and 25th to 75th percentiles. Statistical analysis will be made in SPSS&#xD;
      Windows and the analysis will be applied with intention-to-treat (ITT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The economic evaluation will be developed together with a health economist. The method will&#xD;
      be a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the clinical trial comparing costs and effects for&#xD;
      the two alternatives based on collected data from the trial. The EQ5D-3L measurements will be&#xD;
      used for analyzing quality adjusted life years. The result will be presented as an&#xD;
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and a non-parametric bootstrapping will be&#xD;
      conducted to demonstrate the uncertainties surrounding the ICER.&#xD;
