  <brief_summary>

      The aim of the study is to determine the proportion of patients with change in brain&#xD;
      perfusion during the acute phase of migraine attack with aura.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a benign and frequent disorder. Migraine aura consists in reversible focal&#xD;
      neurological symptoms developing gradually during attack. Its diagnosis relies mainly on&#xD;
      patient's history, clinical examination and exclusion of other possible secondary causes to&#xD;
      explain transient neurological signs. Thus it can be difficult particularly during first&#xD;
      attack or during attack without headache to differentiate migraine aura from transient&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. Considering the difference of care management and prognosis, an early&#xD;
      distinction of migraine aura based on imaging techniques will have a particular interest. MRI&#xD;
      with diffusion, SWI, Flair 2D, ARM 3D TOF, ASL sequences' are routinely performed for the&#xD;
      management of acute neurological deficit. Arterial spin labeling (ASL), as a MR perfusion&#xD;
      method, will be used to describe brain perfusion during migraine aura. The study hypothesis&#xD;
      is that hyperperfusion occurs in brain territories corresponding to the neurological symptoms&#xD;
      during migraine aura.&#xD;
