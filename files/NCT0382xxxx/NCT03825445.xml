      This study aims to compare clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) in patients who are administered&#xD;
      either Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)&#xD;
      for ovulation trigger in intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles. A prospective randomized&#xD;
      comparative study was conducted at Hue University Hospital in Vietnam. Total of 197 infertile&#xD;
      women were randomly assigned to receive either GnRHa trigger (n=98 cycles) or hCG trigger (n=&#xD;
      99 cycles) for ovulation trigger. Patients returned for ultrasound monitoring 24 hours after&#xD;
      IUI to confirm ovulation. A clinical pregnancy was defined as the presence of gestational sac&#xD;
      with fetal cardiac activity.&#xD;

      Study design A prospective randomized comparative study was conducted at Hue University&#xD;
      Hospital in Vietnam from April 2016 to June 2017 in 197 infertile women undergoing IUI. The&#xD;
      study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Hue University of Medicine and Pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population A total of 217 women were recruited into the sample at the first stage.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were women with bilateral tubal patency, at least one follicle ≥ 18mm in&#xD;
      diameter on the day of trigger, and men with more than five millions total motile sperm after&#xD;
      preparation. Only the first cycles of IUI were studied and there were 197 infertile women who&#xD;
      obtained at least 1 mature follicle at the first cycle were included in analysis. Patients&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to receive either GnRHa trigger (n=98 cycles) or hCG trigger (n= 99&#xD;
      cycles) for ovulation trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All patients included in the study were subjected to complete history and&#xD;
      physical. Patients with a history of abnormal menstrual cycles (amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea)&#xD;
      underwent ovarian stimulation. Stimulation was started on cycle day eight with 75 IU Menogon&#xD;
      (Ferring Pharm Co, Switzerland) daily. Ultrasound monitoring was required after every 2-3&#xD;
      days of stimulation and adjustments to dose and duration were tailed according the patient's&#xD;
      response. Ovulation was triggered when at least one and no more than 3 follicles reached&#xD;
      ≥18mm in diameter. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive either two doses of GnRH-a&#xD;
      (Fertipeptil 0.1mg x 2 vial; Ferring Pharm Co, Switzerland) or hCG (Pregnyl 5000IU; Organon&#xD;
      Pharm Co, Nertheland) for ovulation trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IUI was then performed with sperm preparation by radiant centrifugation 36 hours after the&#xD;
      trigger. Luteal phase support with progesterone 200mg daily (Utrogestan; Besins Health Care&#xD;
      Com, Belgium) was started in the day of IUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of outcomes Patients returned for ultrasound monitoring 24 hours after IUI to&#xD;
      confirm ovulation which is determined by the accumulation of free fluid in peritoneum at&#xD;
      Douglas sac and disappearance of the previous mature follicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) was collected 14 days after insemination. A&#xD;
      biochemical pregnancy was defined by βhCG concentration &gt; 25 mIU/ml (Shapphire 350; Cork Com,&#xD;
      Ireland). Two weeks after a positive βhCG test, the patient returned for an ultrasound&#xD;
      appointment. A clinical pregnancy was defined as the presence of gestational sac with fetal&#xD;
      cardiac activity.&#xD;
