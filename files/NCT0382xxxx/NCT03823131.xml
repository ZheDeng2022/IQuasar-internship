      This phase II trial studies how well tavokinogene telseplasmid with electroporation,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, and epacadostat work in treating patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      head and neck that cannot be removed by surgery. Tavokinogene telseplasmid with&#xD;
      electroporation is a gene therapy that may delay of tumor growth and which may have less&#xD;
      toxicity than other methods of gene delivery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such&#xD;
      as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Epacadostat may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving tavokinogene telseplasmid with&#xD;
      electroporation, pembrolizumab, and epacadostat may work better in treating squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether the combination of tavokinogene telseplasmid (tavo)-electroporation&#xD;
      (EP), pembrolizumab, and epacadostat increases the best overall response rate (BORR) in&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) compared with historical data for&#xD;
      pembrolizumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety of tavo-EP and pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat (Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the durability of clinical benefits in patients treated with tavo-EP,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, and epacadostat as assessed by time to progression, median progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), median overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether the combination of tavo-EP, pembrolizumab, and epacadostat increases the&#xD;
      objective response rate in SCCHN compared with emerging data for pembrolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with epacadostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the effects of combination therapy on treated and untreated lesions by&#xD;
      examining paired biopsy specimens for changes in inflammatory gene expression, relative&#xD;
      proportion of effector versus regulatory T cells, evaluation of inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      T-cell activation, clonality, and other hallmarks of immune activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore systemic markers of immune activation by examining circulating T-cell&#xD;
      populations for changes in the frequency and effector function of short-lived effector cells&#xD;
      and memory T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore changes in functional immune responses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot&#xD;
      (Elispot) and other assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore biomarkers that inform scientific understanding of this therapeutic treatment&#xD;
      through analysis of specimens retained for Future Biomedical Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, open label, 2-stage, double-arm, clinical trial in which patients in&#xD;
      Stage 1 will receive either tavo-EP with pembrolizumab, and epacadostat (Arm A) or tavo-EP&#xD;
      and pembrolizumab (Arm B) after a dose escalation safety lead-in phase. Stage 2 will open&#xD;
      pending additional clinical and translational data emerging from Stage 1.&#xD;

    <description>The best overall response (BORR) is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurement recorded since the treatment started). The percentage of patients who attain a confirmed complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) over the trial with the triplet treatment with a 4-week confirmatory scan per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 will be reported and percentage calculated will be relative to all patients who received the study therapy, and 95% confidence interval is calculated by the Clopper-Pearson (exact binomial) method. Only the confirmed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) lesion will be included in RECIST evaluation.</description>
