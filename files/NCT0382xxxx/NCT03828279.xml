  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this international hereditary angioedema (HAE) register is to collect&#xD;
      homogeneous clinical and laboratory data on patients with HAE type I and II gathering better&#xD;
      information on the natural course of the disease and detecting therapeutic options to manage&#xD;
      it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an international multicenter disease registry, the principal investigator at each&#xD;
      center is responsible for competent ethic committee/institutional review board approval and&#xD;
      for identifying co-investigators, who collect patients' informed consent and insert patients'&#xD;
      data. Participating patients own their data. Upon acceptance of the informed consent, the&#xD;
      treating physician transfers data of the case report form (CRF) to a specifically designed&#xD;
      electronic support (eCRF) and the patients enter data on attacks. Physicians at center&#xD;
      fill-in the eCRF with data for demography, diagnosis, prophylaxis and associated diseases.&#xD;
      Plasma levels of C1 inhibitor antigen and function and of C4 antigen document laboratory&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria. Each patient has a national identifier code. Patients fill-in attack&#xD;
      reports that encompass duration, severity and treatment of each angioedema episode. C1&#xD;
      inhibitor coding gene (SERPING1) genotype is entered according to the last Hugo nomenclature.&#xD;
      Yearly update of information is recommended, patients with follow up above two years are&#xD;
      moved in a separate area and excluded from analysis. Each patient prospectively fills data on&#xD;
      attacks. On a specific informed consent, the patient can agree on storing biological material&#xD;
      (plasma and nucleic acids) for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data processor is an innovative start-up (Cloud-R s.r.l. Milan, Italy) that manages all&#xD;
      data according to a specific contract and in compliance with current regulation on sensitive&#xD;
      data security and processing. The Registry, delivered in the mode of Registry-as-a-Service&#xD;
      (RaaS), is designed following General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines, and&#xD;
      issues regular software and infrastructure enhancements as a part of the normal operational&#xD;
      mode. The system generates statistics of aggregated anonymized data following the&#xD;
      participating centers' hierarchy levels and Global Registry governance rules. Patients supply&#xD;
      data on attacks either on paper support or using a Web form or a mobile application. These&#xD;
      data will flow into a staging area for physician validation before being considered valid for&#xD;
      statistics. For each entry the system updates in real-time all the statistics and dashboards.&#xD;
      The platform has configurable functionalities to support data quality management. It provides&#xD;
      data format validation, integration to external qualified libraries, alerts, dashboards,&#xD;
      automatic index calculations, advanced filters and queries, data change log. This open&#xD;
      architecture, allows integration of the system, via standard API's, to external or&#xD;
      sub-registries, registries, biobanks and clinical bioinformatics tools, i.e. for specific&#xD;
      trial studies leveraging a specific cluster of patients already present in the Global&#xD;
      Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent non-profit foundation (HGRF) made of representatives of patients' associations&#xD;
      is in charge for funding and delegates all the management to the HAE Global Registry Board&#xD;
      (HGRB). The HGRB is in charge for operational, assisted by the HAE Global Registry Scientific&#xD;
      Committee (HGRSC) for topics of competence. No registry member, center, group or board can&#xD;
      access the entire set of data. All registry members, as single or group, can propose studies&#xD;
      based on aggregated data by addressing the request to the HGRSC. Analysis and studies of data&#xD;
      at local centers can occur at any time. Members of HGRB and HGRSC are elected to be&#xD;
      representative of different cultural and geographic backgrounds. Their offices have a&#xD;
      two-year term with no more than one consecutive renewal. Angioedema centers can join the&#xD;
      Registry upon request to the HGRB . The registry quality control system periodically checks&#xD;
      Registry entries and compliance of eCRF with the source data. For each information, the&#xD;
      system will grant traceability of time and author.&#xD;
