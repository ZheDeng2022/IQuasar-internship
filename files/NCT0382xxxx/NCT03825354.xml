  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a significant public health concern and causes approximately 1.5 % of all deaths&#xD;
      in the general population in Canada. Suicide is a multi-faceted issue that is often comorbid&#xD;
      with psychiatric illness and associated with diverse sociodemographic risk factors.&#xD;
      Consequently, there are several domains of suicide risk management. The proposed&#xD;
      intervention, the brief intervention, and contact (BIC) model will be tested for feasibility&#xD;
      using a pilot pragmatic randomized trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brief contact interventions are distinct from other treatments for suicide and suicidal&#xD;
      behaviour, in that the goals include maintaining long-term contact with patients, and through&#xD;
      this, provide opportunities for them to re-engage with mental health services when needed.&#xD;
      Additionally, brief interventions are not required to be carried out by mental health&#xD;
      professionals (i.e. psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers), and they are provided over&#xD;
      a structured schedule over a prolonged period post discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brief intervention and contact (BIC) model followed in this study is based on the BIC&#xD;
      model that was utilised by the WHO as part of the Multisite Intervention Study On Suicidal&#xD;
      Behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). A sub-project of the SUPRE-MISS study involved the implementation of&#xD;
      a brief intervention that included an hour-long information session about suicide and&#xD;
      suicidal behaviour around the discharge period, and nine periods of follow up through an&#xD;
      in-person visit or phone call to assess the patient's well-being and provide referrals to&#xD;
      clinical services as needed. Following implementation, an analysis of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the BIC model in five different countries, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, Islamic Republic of&#xD;
      Iran, and China, outline its potential utility. Compared to patients in the control group,&#xD;
      there was a reduction in suicide rates in patients who received the BIC intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of implementing the BIC protocol in a large&#xD;
      multisite trial. We will, however, provide the objective of the main study to provide an&#xD;
      overview of the study and the intended outcomes in addition to the pilot study objectives as&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study question and hypothesis of the main study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with suicidal behaviour admitted to inpatient units of acute and tertiary&#xD;
      hospitals, does the addition of a brief intervention and contact program decrease suicide&#xD;
      re-attempts, reduce depressive symptoms, improve social connectivity, and reduce further ER&#xD;
      visits, compared to treatment as usual after 18 months of follow-up? The pilot study will be&#xD;
      for 6 months only. We hypothesize that brief intervention and contact is an effective&#xD;
      intervention for reducing suicidal behaviour in patients who have attempted suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive the BIC intervention, alongside treatment as&#xD;
      usual. BIC consists of a 1-hour information session about the epidemiology and presentation&#xD;
      of suicide and suicidal behaviour at the time of discharge, along with follow-up with&#xD;
      patients at 1, 2, 4, 6 weeks, and 3, 4, 5, and 6 months. The intention of the frequency of&#xD;
      follow up is to increase the time between follow up visits as per the original protocol and&#xD;
      eventually discontinue. Follow-up contact will involve assessing how patients feel and&#xD;
      whether they need additional support. The WHO protocol that contains all questionnaires to be&#xD;
      used for follow-up is attached to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will receive treatment as usual. Pilot Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of pilot phase is to enhance the success of the full trial by testing the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      brief intervention and contact program for suicide delivered through a face to face, phone or&#xD;
      text-based intervention in addition to treatment as usual to reduce suicide attempts,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and ER visits, and improve social connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot primary objectives are therefore summarized after Thabane and colleagues (cite the&#xD;
      ref here):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the feasibility of the study process in terms of recruitment, retention, number&#xD;
           of follow-ups completed, and data completion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess resources needed including the use of mobile phones for contacting patients,&#xD;
           interview spaces for initial intake questionnaire and consent processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess reduction in subsequent suicide attempts and completed suicides through access to&#xD;
           medical records over 6 months post discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the change in depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory between and&#xD;
           within the intervention and control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the change in sense of social connectivity and social support using the&#xD;
           Bille-Brahe Social Support Questionnaire, the Sarason Social Support Questionnaire&#xD;
           (short form), and two questions pertaining to the places and activities the patient&#xD;
           engages in most often between and within the intervention and control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the reduction in ER visits between and within the intervention and control groups&#xD;
