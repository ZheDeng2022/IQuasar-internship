    <textblock>
      Radioligand therapy (RLT) using Lu-177 labelled PSMA is a promising new therapeutic approach&#xD;
      to treat metastatic prostate cancer. This tumor-specific treatment is directed against&#xD;
      prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells.&#xD;
      In the last few years, several lutetium-177 (177Lu, β emitter) labeled PSMA ligands have been&#xD;
      developed and are currently applied to treat metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCRPC) patients. However, there are no prospective studies published so far using this&#xD;
      treatment approach in hormone sensitive setting. In this pilot study patients with hormone&#xD;
      sensitive prostate cancer who did not undergo hormonal treatment will be treated with Lu-177&#xD;
      PSMA-617.&#xD;

      Radioligand therapy (RLT) is a promising new therapeutic approach to treat metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer. This tumor-specific treatment is directed against prostate-specific membrane&#xD;
      antigen (PSMA), which is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells. In the last few years,&#xD;
      several lutetium-177 (177Lu, β emitter) labeled PSMA ligands have been developed and are&#xD;
      currently applied in nuclear medicine departments world-wide to treat metastatic castrate&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large retrospective study reported an overall biochemical response rate of 45% following&#xD;
      multiple 177Lu-PSMA RLT cycles in mCRPC patients, while 40% of patients already responded&#xD;
      after a single cycle. RLT with PSMA ligand PSMA-617 was generally well tolerated and 12% of&#xD;
      the patients suffered grade 3 to 4 hematological toxicity. In addition, mild and often&#xD;
      transient xerostomia occurred in 8%. These results were confirmed in a smaller scale&#xD;
      prospective study published recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these results are very promising, it is noteworthy that all currently&#xD;
      Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT only has been evaluated in end stage prostate cancer patients to date. In&#xD;
      theory, RLT could be more effective in low volume disease because of the very high tumor&#xD;
      uptake of radioligands in small lesions. There are no published data so far evaluating the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT in an earlier stage of the disease. Because of the&#xD;
      difference in tumor load between mCRPC patients and patients with low volume metastatic&#xD;
      disease, dosimetry and toxicity in these patients need evaluation. Here a clinical trial to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT in patients with low volume metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer, prior to the hormone insensitive state is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the dosimetry and toxicity of Lu-177-PSMA-617&#xD;
      RLT, in patients with low volume, hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer under&#xD;
      treatment condition. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to stabilize previously&#xD;
      progressive disease in these patients and to improve the quality of life by postponing the&#xD;
      need for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).&#xD;
