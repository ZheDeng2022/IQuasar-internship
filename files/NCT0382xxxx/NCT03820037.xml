      the purpose assess the relative bioavailability and bioequivalence of two active&#xD;
      pharmaceutical ingredient (API) sources of opicapone (OPC, Ongentys® and BIA 9-1067)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase I, open label, randomized, partial-replicate, three-period,&#xD;
      three-sequence crossover study to investigate the relative bioavailability and bioequivalence&#xD;
      of 2 API sources of OPC (BIA 9-1067 [Test] and Ongentys® [Reference]) in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized in a 3-period, 3-sequence crossover design; each subject will&#xD;
      receive 2 single oral 50 mg doses of the Reference API source of OPC, and a single 50 mg dose&#xD;
      of the Test API source of OPC under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28&#xD;
      days prior to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit (CRU) on Day 1 and be confined to the CRU until discharge on Day 3. There will&#xD;
      be a washout period of at least 14 days between each dose. A follow-up visit will be&#xD;
      performed 7 to 14 days after dosing in the last treatment period or early discontinuation.&#xD;
