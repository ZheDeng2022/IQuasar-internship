      This study will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, preliminary clinical impact, and&#xD;
      preliminary behavioral impact of NDURE (Navigation for Disparities and Untimely Radiation&#xD;
      thErapy), our multi-level, theory-based navigation intervention to improve timely, equitable&#xD;
      post-operative radiation treatment (PORT) among Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) patients. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that NDURE will be feasible, acceptable, improve the timeliness of PORT for white&#xD;
      and African American (AA) HNC patients and decrease disparities in delay between the two&#xD;
      groups by improving system-, interpersonal-, and individual-level health behavior constructs.&#xD;

    <measure>Percent of Patients With a Delay Starting Post-Operative Radiation Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of patients who start PORT &gt;6 weeks after surgery. Initiation of postoperative PORT &gt; 6 weeks after surgery is defined as more than 42 calendar days from the time of the definitive surgical resection to the initiation of radiation therapy. In situations in which the surgical management of the primary tumor and the neck are staged (i.e. occur on two different calendar days), the date of the surgery for the primary tumor will be used. In situations in which an additional surgical resection is required (e.g. re-resection of positive margins to clear residual disease), the date of the earlier (i.e. attempted definitive) surgical procedure will be used to determine the target start date for PORT.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Care Transition Measure-15 (CTM-15) is a validated, psychometrically sound 15-item, unidimensional measure of care transitions across the healthcare system that is consistent with the concept of patient-centeredness and useful from an organization perspective for the purpose of performance measurement and quality improvement. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 'Strongly Disagree' (1) to 'Strongly Agree' (4). The CTM-15 score is calculated as the mean score (the summed score from each question divided by the total number of questions) with a linear transformation to 100. Scores range from 0-100; higher scores reflect more care integration and better care transitions.</description>

    <description>NDURE is a theory-based, multi-level patient navigation (PN) intervention consisting of clinic-based sessions of manualized PN to reduce barriers to care, increase HNC care delivery, and improve clinical outcomes (timely, equitable PORT). NDURE will be delivered from surgical consultation to PORT initiation (~3 months). The three in-person NDURE sessions, which are expected to take 30-60 minutes each, will coincide with the presurgical consult, hospital discharge, and 1st postoperative clinic visit. During the first session, the navigator will 1) elicit barriers and facilitators to timely PORT, 2) develop the personalized barrier reduction plan (BRP), review the BRP with the patient, caregiver, and provider, and 3) implement the BRP. At the two subsequent sessions, the navigator will review and update the BRP in an iterative, dynamic fashion, identifying new barriers and systematically tracking resolution of prior barriers until the start of PORT.</description>

          <title>NDURE (Patient Navigation)</title>
          <description>NDURE is a theory-based, multi-level patient navigation (PN) intervention consisting of clinic-based sessions of manualized PN to reduce barriers to care, increase HNC care delivery, and improve clinical outcomes (timely, equitable PORT). NDURE will be delivered from surgical consultation to PORT initiation (~3 months). The three in-person NDURE sessions, which are expected to take 30-60 minutes each, will coincide with the presurgical consult, hospital discharge, and 1st postoperative clinic visit. During the first session, the navigator will 1) elicit barriers and facilitators to timely PORT, 2) develop the personalized barrier reduction plan (BRP), review the BRP with the patient, caregiver, and provider, and 3) implement the BRP. At the two subsequent sessions, the navigator will review and update the BRP in an iterative, dynamic fashion, identifying new barriers and systematically tracking resolution of prior barriers until the start of PORT.</description>

In situations in which the surgical management of the primary tumor and the neck are staged (i.e. occur on two different calendar days), the date of the surgery for the primary tumor will be used. In situations in which an additional surgical resection is required (e.g. re-resection of positive margins to clear residual disease), the date of the earlier (i.e. attempted definitive) surgical procedure will be used to determine the target start date for PORT.</description>

It is a psychometrically sound tool that may provide new information on important mediating factors of cancer care. The response scale ranges from 1 to 4 points (1= strongly disagree, 2=slightly disagree, 3=slightly agree, 4=strongly disagree). The twelve question scale is divided into 3 domains with 4 questions each. Scores from these subscales are added to compute a total score ranging from 12-48. Higher values represent a more positive attitude.</description>

            <description>Patient Navigation: NDURE is a theory-based, multi-level patient navigation (PN) intervention consisting of clinic-based sessions of manualized PN to reduce barriers to care, increase HNC care delivery, and improve clinical outcomes (timely, equitable PORT). NDURE will be delivered from surgical consultation to PORT initiation (~3 months). The three in-person NDURE sessions, which are expected to take 30-60 minutes each, will coincide with the presurgical consult, hospital discharge, and 1st postoperative clinic visit. During the first session, the navigator will 1) elicit barriers and facilitators to timely PORT, 2) develop the personalized barrier reduction plan (BRP), review the BRP with the patient, caregiver, and provider, and 3) implement the BRP. At the two subsequent sessions, the navigator will review and update the BRP in an iterative, dynamic fashion, identifying new barriers and systematically tracking resolution of prior barriers until the start of PORT.</description>

            <description>Patient Navigation: NDURE is a theory-based, multi-level patient navigation (PN) intervention consisting of clinic-based sessions of manualized PN to reduce barriers to care, increase HNC care delivery, and improve clinical outcomes (timely, equitable PORT). NDURE will be delivered from surgical consultation to PORT initiation (~3 months). The three in-person NDURE sessions, which are expected to take 30-60 minutes each, will coincide with the presurgical consult, hospital discharge, and 1st postoperative clinic visit. During the first session, the navigator will 1) elicit barriers and facilitators to timely PORT, 2) develop the personalized barrier reduction plan (BRP), review the BRP with the patient, caregiver, and provider, and 3) implement the BRP. At the two subsequent sessions, the navigator will review and update the BRP in an iterative, dynamic fashion, identifying new barriers and systematically tracking resolution of prior barriers until the start of PORT.</description>

        <description>Care Transition Measure-15 (CTM-15) is a validated, psychometrically sound 15-item, unidimensional measure of care transitions across the healthcare system that is consistent with the concept of patient-centeredness and useful from an organization perspective for the purpose of performance measurement and quality improvement. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 'Strongly Disagree' (1) to 'Strongly Agree' (4). The CTM-15 score is calculated as the mean score (the summed score from each question divided by the total number of questions) with a linear transformation to 100. Scores range from 0-100; higher scores reflect more care integration and better care transitions.</description>

          <title>Change in Perceived Barriers Score From Baseline to End-of-study</title>
          <description>The Perceived Barriers Questionnaire is a self-report measure of the presence/absence of pre-specified barriers to cancer care (yes/no). The questionnaire has been used extensively to assess perceived barriers in prior PN studies. Scores range from 0-29; higher scores reflect a greater number of barriers to care</description>

          <title>Patient Navigation</title>
          <description>Patient Navigation: NDURE is a theory-based, multi-level patient navigation (PN) intervention consisting of clinic-based sessions of manualized PN to reduce barriers to care, increase HNC care delivery, and improve clinical outcomes (timely, equitable PORT). NDURE will be delivered from surgical consultation to PORT initiation (~3 months). The three in-person NDURE sessions, which are expected to take 30-60 minutes each, will coincide with the presurgical consult, hospital discharge, and 1st postoperative clinic visit. During the first session, the navigator will 1) elicit barriers and facilitators to timely PORT, 2) develop the personalized barrier reduction plan (BRP), review the BRP with the patient, caregiver, and provider, and 3) implement the BRP. At the two subsequent sessions, the navigator will review and update the BRP in an iterative, dynamic fashion, identifying new barriers and systematically tracking resolution of prior barriers until the start of PORT.</description>
