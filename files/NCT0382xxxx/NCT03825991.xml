      Introduction: Studies focusing on back pain do not compare different types of back pain&#xD;
      diagnosis in relation to a specific psychiatric comorbidity, nor if the presence of&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity affects treatment. There are limited knowledge on pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment of back pain disorders,and especially if the presence of psychiatric comorbidity is&#xD;
      an ad-on to the dosage of medication prescribed. Investigating the use of opioids and other&#xD;
      pain medication in back patients and the potential effect of concomitant psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidity as well as taking psychiatric medication under consideration is therefore&#xD;
      relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This aim of this PhD thesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in patients with back pain disorders&#xD;
      (BPD) compared to patients with no back pain. 2) Investigate if psychiatric comorbidity&#xD;
      affects the type of treatment given. 3) Examine if the presence of psychiatric comorbidity&#xD;
      affects the levels of pharmacological treatment given with a focus on both pain medication,&#xD;
      such as opioids, as well as treatment with psychotropic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:The association between back pain disorders and psychiatric comorbidity will be&#xD;
      investigated using population-based registry data. The population will be defined as adult&#xD;
      patients (+18) with a relevant back pain disorder using The National Danish Patient Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following registries will be also utilized: A subdivision of the DNPR, the National&#xD;
      Patient Registry - Psychiatry (NPD-Psych), The Danish National Prescription Database, The&#xD;
      Danish National Health Service Register and the DREAM database. By using the Danish Civil&#xD;
      Registry and the unique personal identification number assigned to all Danish citizens at&#xD;
      birth, data across registries can be linked on an individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:The Region of Southern Denmark is the data controller for this project, and it is&#xD;
      included in their records of personal data processing activities (file no. (18/3337).).&#xD;
      Additional approvals or consents were not needed for this project based exclusively on&#xD;
      national registries according to Danish law. The data processing was conducted according to&#xD;
      EU and Danish legislation on processing of sensitive personal information and, as complies&#xD;
      with internal regulations from the Region of Southern Denmark.&#xD;

      Aim of the thesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this PhD thesis is to use population-based registry data to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Estimate the occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity in a Danish nationwide population of&#xD;
      patients with back pain disorders (BPD) diagnosed in 2010-2014; 2) Investigate whether&#xD;
      presence of psychiatric comorbidity affects utilization of pharmacological, surgical and&#xD;
      other types of treatment for patients with back BPD; 3) Investigate whether presence of&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity affects utilization and dosages of pharmacological treatment for&#xD;
      patients with BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical contributions of this PhD: This PhD study will contribute with new knowledge on the&#xD;
      association between different types of back pain disorders (BPD) and psychiatric comorbidity.&#xD;
      As BPD affects a large part of the population, this is a very important area of research from&#xD;
      a public health and clinical perspective. Access to nationwide registries facilitates a&#xD;
      comprehensive and population-based dataset, ensuring the ideal circumstances for&#xD;
      investigating the association between BPD and potential psychiatric comorbidity. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the results can be used to increase clinical awareness of vulnerable patients in the&#xD;
      intersection between rheumatology and psychiatry and subsequently improve prevention and&#xD;
      clinical management for a complex and resource-demanding patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and study population: This PhD project includes a population-based nationwide cohort&#xD;
      based on data from Danish health registries. Danish health registries, including The Danish&#xD;
      National Patient Registry (DNPR), a subdivision of the DNPR, the National Patient Registry -&#xD;
      Psychiatry (NPD-Psych), The Danish National Prescription Database and The Danish National&#xD;
      Health Service Register, contains complete data on hospital contacts, prescription drug use&#xD;
      and services provided by health contractors. By using the Danish Civil Registry and the&#xD;
      unique personal identification number assigned to all Danish citizens at birth, data across&#xD;
      registries can be linked on an individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be defined as all adult patients (18+) identified in the DNPR,&#xD;
      covering all inpatient and outpatient services in Denmark, in the time period 1th of January&#xD;
      2010 to 31th of December 2014 with a diagnosis of BPD according to the ICD-10 Classification&#xD;
      of Disease (DM*).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric comorbidity will be defined as the presence of any of the following diagnosis,&#xD;
      according to ICD-10 classification, obtained from the National Patient Registry - Psychiatry&#xD;
      (NPD-Psych), covering all inpatient and outpatient psychiatric services in Denmark in the&#xD;
      time period 1th January 2007 to 31th December 2017: Organic, including symptomatic, mental&#xD;
      disorders (F00-DF09), Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use&#xD;
      (F10-F19), Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (F20-F29), Mood [affective]&#xD;
      disorders (F30-F39), Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (F40-F48), Behavioral&#xD;
      syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors (F50-F59),&#xD;
      Disorders of adult personality and behavior (F60-F69), Mental retardation (F70-F79),&#xD;
      Disorders of psychological development (F80-F89), Behavioral and emotional disorders with&#xD;
      onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90-F98) and, Unspecified mental&#xD;
      disorder (F99). To qualify as a psychiatric comorbidity to back pain disorder, we define that&#xD;
      the psychiatric diagnosis must be given no earlier than three years prior to back pain&#xD;
      disorder diagnosis and no later than three years after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1) Occurrence of Psychiatric comorbidity in back pain disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 1) To estimate occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity in patients with BPD compared to&#xD;
      the background population and 2) occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity in patients with&#xD;
      unspecific BPD compared to patients with specific BPD in a Danish nationwide cohort from&#xD;
      2010-2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 1) There is a higher occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity in BPD patients&#xD;
      compared to the background population and 2) patients with unspecific BPD have a higher&#xD;
      occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity compared to patients with specific BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study will be a nationwide register-based matched cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Selected BPD patients with the following diagnosis will be identified via the&#xD;
      DNPR: Spondylopathies DM45-49, Other dorsopathies DM 50-54 and Segmental and somatic&#xD;
      dysfunction DM99. Each patient will be matched 1:5 on age and sex with patients without back&#xD;
      disorders by random at Statistics Denmark. The selection of diagnosis is to be able to match&#xD;
      the population with non-BPD patients in the Danish registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on somatic comorbidity for calculation of Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI) at&#xD;
      time of BPD diagnosis, will be retrieved from the DNPR. Data on psychiatric comorbidity will&#xD;
      be identified using NPD-Psych. Information on marital status, vital status, and immigration&#xD;
      status will be retrieved from the Civil Registration System (CPR). Patients that are not&#xD;
      alive or have emigrated within three years after BPD diagnosis are considered lost to&#xD;
      follow-up and excluded from the cohort. Descriptive data on the socioeconomic status,&#xD;
      education level and equivalent available income will be retrieved from Statistics Denmark.&#xD;
      All data comprising each variable will be retrieved from 1th of January 2007 to 31th of&#xD;
      December 2017 (three years before and after study period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: We will use Fisher's exact test and t-test to compare baseline characteristics&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values. Crude risks of psychiatric comorbidity will&#xD;
      be calculated and logistic regression model will be used, to investigate differences between&#xD;
      the distribution of risk in BPD patients and the background population. A logistic regression&#xD;
      model will also be used to investigate differences between the distribution of psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidity in the unspecific and specific BPD group compared to the background population.&#xD;
      The logistic regressions will be reported using 95% CI and adjusted for the following&#xD;
      confounders: age, sex, equivalent available income, educational level, CCI, marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2) The effect of psychiatric comorbidity on type of treatment for BPD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 1) To investigate whether treatment of BPD in patients with psychiatric comorbidity&#xD;
      differ from treatment of patients with BPD without psychiatric comorbidity; 2)To investigate&#xD;
      whether treatment of BPD differs in the following subgroups: a) specific BPD and no&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity; b) specific BPD with psychiatric comorbidity; c) unspecific BPD with&#xD;
      no psychiatric comorbidity; d) unspecific BPD with psychiatric comorbidity. Investigation&#xD;
      will be performed in a nationwide Danish cohort in 2010-2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 1) Psychiatric comorbidity affects type of treatment in BPD patients and 2)&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity affects type of treatment in subgroups of BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and study population: The study will be a nationwide register-based cohort study. The&#xD;
      study population consists of patients with BPD and in the sub-analysis the study population&#xD;
      consists of patients with BPD and psychiatric comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: BPD patients with any BPD diagnosis (DM*) will be identified via the DNPR.&#xD;
      Surgical treatment will be defined as the presence of any procedure code for back surgery&#xD;
      retrieved from DNPR (NOMESCO: KNA-W). Pharmacological treatment of BPD will be defined as any&#xD;
      treatment with the following drugs: NSAID (ATC: N01A*), acetominophen (ATC: N02BE01), opioids&#xD;
      (N02A*), antiepileptica (ATC: N03A) and tricyclic antidepressants (ATC: N06AA)13 identified&#xD;
      using the Register of Medicinal Products Statistics. Data on other types of treatment&#xD;
      (defined as any treatment not surgical or pharmacological) such as physiotherapist,&#xD;
      psychologist, chiropractor or occupational therapist (covered via tax-funded health&#xD;
      insurance) will be obtained via The Danish National Health Insurance Service Register (SSR).&#xD;
      All BPD treatment-related information will be retrieved up to three years after the date of&#xD;
      BPD diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on somatic comorbidity for calculation of Charlson Comorbidity index(CCI) at time&#xD;
      of BPD diagnosis, will be retrieved from the DNPR. Data on psychiatric comorbidity will be&#xD;
      identified using NPD-Psych. Information on psychiatric comorbidity will be used to define&#xD;
      whether each patient had a psychiatric diagnosis prior to BPD diagnosis, after BPD diagnosis&#xD;
      or no psychiatric diagnosis. If a psychiatric diagnosis occurs both prior to and after BPD&#xD;
      diagnosis, the patient will be defines as having a psychiatric comorbidity prior to BPD&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on marital status, vital status, and immigration status will be retrieved from&#xD;
      the Civil Registration System (CPR). Patients that are not alive or have emigrated within&#xD;
      three years after BPD diagnosis are considered lost to follow-up and excluded from the&#xD;
      cohort. Descriptive data on the socioeconomic status, education level and equivalent&#xD;
      available income will be retrieved from Statistics Denmark. All data comprising each variable&#xD;
      will be retrieved from 1th of January 2007 to 31th of December 2017 (three years before and&#xD;
      after study period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: We will use Fisher's exact test and t-test to compare patients' baseline&#xD;
      characteristics with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values. For each treatment type we&#xD;
      will use logistic regression model to investigate differences in outcome distribution between&#xD;
      patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity.The logistic regressions will be performed&#xD;
      with 95% CI adjusted for the following confounders: age, sex, CCI, level of education,&#xD;
      equivalent available income, type of BPD (IBD, DBD or UBP) and marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3) Effect of psychiatric comorbidity in pharmacological treatment of BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 1) To compare dosages of pharmacological treatment in BPD patients with and without the&#xD;
      presence of psychiatric comorbidity in a nationwide Danish cohort study in 2010-2014. 2) To&#xD;
      compare high vs. low dosages of pharmacological treatment for BPD in patients with BPD and&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 1) Patients with BPD and psychiatric comorbidity are prescribed a higher dosage&#xD;
      of pain medication for BPD compared with BPD patients without psychiatric comorbidity. 2) BPD&#xD;
      patients with a psychiatric comorbidity with a high (defined as above the 50th percentile)&#xD;
      vs. low (defined as below the 50th percentile) dosage of pain medication are also prescribed&#xD;
      higher dosages of psychiatric medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and study population: The study will be a nationwide register-based cohort study. The&#xD;
      study population consists of patients with BPD that received pharmacological treatment for&#xD;
      BPD. In the secondary analysis the study population consists of patients with BPD and a&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity, who received pharmacological treatment for BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: BPD patients with any BPD diagnosis (DM*) will be identified via the DNPR.&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment of BPD will be defined as any treatment with the following drugs:&#xD;
      NSAID (ATC: N01A*), Acetominophen (ATC: N02BE01), Opioids (N02A*). Pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      for psychiatric comorbidity will be defined as any treatment with the following drugs:&#xD;
      Antipsychotics (ATC:N05A), Antidepressants (ATC: N06A), Selective Serotonin Reuptake&#xD;
      Inhibitors (SSRI) (ATC: N06AB), and anxiolytics (ATC: N5B*) Pharmacological treatment that&#xD;
      can be used in the treatment of both BPD and psychiatric disorders will be defined as any&#xD;
      treatment with the following drugs: Antiepileptica (ATC: N03A) and Tricyclic antidepressants&#xD;
      (ATC: N06AA). All data on pharmacological treatment will be identified using the Register of&#xD;
      Medicinal Products Statistics. From time of BPD diagnosis and the following three years,&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment for both somatic illness and psychiatric comorbidity in Daily&#xD;
      Defined Dosage (DDD) per year will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on somatic comorbidity for calculation of Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI) at&#xD;
      time of BPD diagnosis, will be retrieved from the DNPR. Data on psychiatric comorbidity will&#xD;
      be identified using NPD-Psych. Information on marital status, vital status, and immigration&#xD;
      status will be retrieved from the Civil Registration System (CPR). Patients that are not&#xD;
      alive or have emigrated within three years after BPD diagnosis are considered lost to&#xD;
      follow-up and excluded from the cohort. Descriptive data on the socioeconomic status,&#xD;
      education level and equivalent available income will be retrieved from Statistics Denmark.&#xD;
      All data comprising each variable will be retrieved from 1th of January 2007 to 31th of&#xD;
      December 2017 (three years before and after study period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: We will use Fisher's exact test and t-test to compare patients' baseline&#xD;
      characteristics with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values. Time dependent Cox&#xD;
      regression will be performed separately for patients with specific and unspecific BPD to&#xD;
      examine dosage of pharmacological treatment over time comparing patients with and without&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity. The analysis will be performed with 95% CI and adjusted for the&#xD;
      following confounders: age, sex, CCI, level of education, equivalent available income,&#xD;
      marital status and the presence of psychopharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine dosage of psychopharmacological treatment over time comparing patients with&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidity and low vs high dose of pharmacological treatment of BPD, time&#xD;
      dependent Cox regression will be performed reporting 95% CI and adjusting for the following&#xD;
      confounders: age, sex, CCI, level of education, equivalent available income and marital&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
