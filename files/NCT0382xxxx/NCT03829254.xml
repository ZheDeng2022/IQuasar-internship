  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, Phase I, dose-escalation study of NUC-7738 administered by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion across two administration schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumours to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of NUC-7738, in addition to establishing the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) and dose administration schedule of NUC-7738 for further exploration in Part 2 of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will further evaluate the selected RP2D and designated dosing schedule in an expansion&#xD;
      cohort of approximately 40 additional patients with advanced solid tumours and approximately&#xD;
      12 patients with lymphoma.&#xD;
