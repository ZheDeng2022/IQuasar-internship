  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: despite developments a substantial part of patients with depression will only&#xD;
      recover slowly. Light therapy from light boxes has shown antidepressant effects but have&#xD;
      several limitations: time consuming, only allowing a fixed spectral distribution, only&#xD;
      delivered at a specific time-point, and often with inadequate light intensity delivered at&#xD;
      the retina. Therefore, we developed a new dynamic lighting system using light fixtures that&#xD;
      are built into the room and can change intensity and spectral distribution of light during&#xD;
      the 24-hour day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: the objective of this trial is to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of a&#xD;
      newly developed dynamic lighting system using Light Emitting Diodes (LED) -light armatures&#xD;
      aiming to mimic sunlight, when installed in the patient rooms of a psychiatric inpatient&#xD;
      ward, compared with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: the design is a randomised controlled trial with two arms: an active dynamic light&#xD;
      trial arm and a usual care arm with blinding of depression outcome, and data analyses.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: a current episode of a major depressive episode as part of a unipolar or&#xD;
      bipolar disorder. Patients with bipolar depression should be in current and recent (minimum&#xD;
      two months before admission) mood stabilising treatment, age &gt; 18 years, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: severe suicidality, abuse of alcohol and / or drugs, actual psychotic&#xD;
      state, Young Mania Rating score above 7 or fulfilling diagnostic criteria for a current&#xD;
      hypomanic or manic episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: the experimental intervention is a dynamic LED-light system in 10 separate&#xD;
      patient single rooms with three dynamic lamps: a window jamb built-in light panel, two&#xD;
      ceiling mounted lamps, and a wall mounted lamp. The usual care is constant standard&#xD;
      LED-light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 6 item version (HAM-D6) scale&#xD;
      at week 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: score on the Suicidal Ideation Attribution Scale (SIDAS ) scale at week&#xD;
      3, and score in the Hamilton. Depression Rating Scale 17 item version (HAM-D17) scale at week&#xD;
      3, and score on the World Health Organisation Quality Of Life questionaire abbreviated&#xD;
      version (WHOQOL-BREF) at week 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial size: in total, 150 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule: the trial will be submitted for regulatory approvals January 2019, the first&#xD;
      participant will be included April 2019, the expected last follow-up of the last participant&#xD;
      will be December 2020, the expected last follow-up after 6 months will be June 2021, data&#xD;
      will be analysed from June 2021 till September 2021, manuscripts will be prepared from&#xD;
      December 2020, and we expect to submit first manuscript December 2021.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The participant population: depression is a common disorder with a prevalence of about&#xD;
      150,000 in Denmark. According to WHO depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide&#xD;
      and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Society suffers large direct and&#xD;
      indirect losses in terms of lost work, sickness and early retirements. In Denmark, the costs&#xD;
      of depression alone amount to an estimated 14 billion DKK per year. Depression can affect an&#xD;
      individual to the extent that everyday activities and chores are insurmountable, and can&#xD;
      ultimately lead to despair, hopelessness, and suicidal behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment: the current treatment of a depressive episode, whether it is part of a&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or of a Bipolar Disorder (BD), involves as first line&#xD;
      treatment psychotherapy /psychoeducation, mood stabilisers, and antidepressants. Second line&#xD;
      treatments include neurostimulation (Electroconvulsive treatment), and complementary options&#xD;
      include exercise, chronotherapeutics (light therapy, sleep deprivation), neurostimulation and&#xD;
      other therapies. Recent drug development has not been able to produce compounds with better&#xD;
      antidepressant effect, and despite the ongoing development of new psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      approaches, improvement from depression is often slow and with 10-25% ending up being&#xD;
      treatment resistant. Relapse, readmission, and suicide are also major treatment challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial interventions: the present efficacy trial investigates the possible antidepressant&#xD;
      effect of a new form of dynamic lighting in the treatment of a major depressive episode&#xD;
      either as part of a MDD or a BD. The Light-Emitting-Diode (LED) technology provides new&#xD;
      potentials to adjust frequency distribution and intensity of light during the 24 hour-day.&#xD;
      LED-lighting can be adjusted to supply light rich in the blue, short waved region of the&#xD;
      spectral composition in the first part of the day, and warmer light with less blue later in&#xD;
      the day and in the evening. This regulation should, according to our current chronobiological&#xD;
      knowledge, entrain and regulate the sleep-wake cycle, and thereby improve and stabilize mood,&#xD;
      providing an added non-pharmacological treatment of in-patients suffering from depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental intervention specifically consists of implementation of a dynamic LED-light&#xD;
      system in patient rooms with three modules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a dynamic &quot;sunlight therapy LED-lighting&quot; that mimics the spectral composition and&#xD;
           intensity of daylight coming through a southeast (SE) facing window at equinox with 12&#xD;
           hours of sunlight and 12 hours of darkness. The fixture is built into the window jamb&#xD;
           (vertical side of the window) and cannot be switched off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two LED-lighting lamps mounted horizontally in the ceiling providing dynamic spectral&#xD;
           composition and intensity dynamic. Can be switched on/off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A reading LED-light mounted vertically on the wall adjacent to the bed providing dynamic&#xD;
           spectral composition and intensity. Can be switched on/off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual care intervention is standard, constant LED-Light with two elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two LED-Lighting lamps mounted horizontally in the ceiling. Spectral composition and&#xD;
           intensity are constant. The ceiling lamps can be switched on/off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A reading LED-lighting lamp mounted vertically on the wall adjacent to the bed. Spectral&#xD;
           composition and intensity are constant. The reading lamp can be switched on/off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bright Light Therapy: the effect of light therapy in the treatment of non-seasonal depression&#xD;
      has been studied for several decades. In 2004, Tuunainen and colleagues published the&#xD;
      Cochrane systematic review &quot;Light therapy for non-seasonal depression&quot;. The conclusion was&#xD;
      that light therapy must be regarded as a promising treatment method, but because of the&#xD;
      heterogeneity among the studies, methodological problems and a lack of systematic collection&#xD;
      of adverse events (AE's), the recommendation of light therapy as treatment of depression&#xD;
      should be considered with some caution. In 2007, Even et al found, in a systematic review, an&#xD;
      added antidepressant effect of light therapy when used as augmentation to antidepressant&#xD;
      therapy. In 2016, Perara et al in a systematic review including 20 RCT's using light therapy&#xD;
      for non-seasonal depression. found an overall small antidepressant effect (SMD -0.41; 95% CI&#xD;
      -0.64 to -0.18), but with a high risk of bias and inconsistency between studies. None of the&#xD;
      included subgroup analyses were significant (stand-alone light therapy versus adjunctive&#xD;
      light therapy; morning light therapy versus evening light therapy or other times of day;&#xD;
      light therapy for in- versus outpatients; placebo conditions using some form of light versus&#xD;
      using non-light-based placebo). However, when analysed separately some support was found for&#xD;
      better effect of light when used as monotherapy; in the morning; for outpatients, and when&#xD;
      using non-light-based placebos. Only four of the 20 studies had low risk of bias on all items&#xD;
      on the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The Martiny et al study found a statistically significant&#xD;
      better effect of light therapy plus sertraline compared to placebo light and light therapy,&#xD;
      in 102 outpatients. The Lam et al study compared, in 122 outpatients in four groups: (a)&#xD;
      active light plus active fluoxetine, (b) active light plus placebo fluoxetine, (c) inactive&#xD;
      negative ion generator plus active fluoxetine, (d) inactive negative ion generator plus&#xD;
      placebo fluoxetine. They found a statistically significant better effect in the group&#xD;
      receiving the combination of active light plus active fluoxetine, and in the group receiving&#xD;
      the combination of active light and placebo fluoxetine compared to the group receiving the&#xD;
      combination of inactive negative ion generator plus placebo fluoxetine. The Lieversee et al&#xD;
      study found, in 84 elderly (&gt; 60 years) outpatients with non-seasonal depression, a&#xD;
      statistically significant better effect of active versus placebo light treatment. The Loving&#xD;
      et al study found, in 81 elderly outpatients (&gt; 60 years) with non-seasonal depression,&#xD;
      treated with bright or placebo light (administered at three different time-points), no&#xD;
      difference between groups and a low reduction in depression severity across groups, of 16 %.&#xD;
      A more recent study showed effect of bright light treatment (BLT) compared to dim light&#xD;
      treatment, in 46 patients with bipolar depression, when used as augmentation in patients&#xD;
      receiving mood stabilising medication. A recent review, from Benedetti et al, showed that the&#xD;
      risk of switch from depression to mania, in BP patient treated with light therapy, was no&#xD;
      higher than with antidepressant drug therapy. With conventional light therapy, patients are&#xD;
      placed in front of a light box for 30-60 minutes in the morning. With dynamic lighting,&#xD;
      LED-light is built into the room. This enables the system to provide light in the daytime&#xD;
      that can phase advance the circadian rhythms and provide an alerting effect. During evening&#xD;
      and night, the light system provides low intensity light with low blue wavelength content&#xD;
      with minimal impact on the circadian system. Dynamic lighting has, in some studies, been&#xD;
      found to provide more stable mood and better sleep quality in people suffering from dementia&#xD;
      and a more stable circadian rhythm in patient suffering from depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Architecture at Hospitals: the discovery of the non-visual, light sensitive ganglionic cells&#xD;
      in the human retina (the intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells, ipRGCs), with a&#xD;
      maximum sensitivity for blue light (460 nm - 480 nm), has stimulated research on the effect&#xD;
      of using light with different spectral composition in humans. The ipRGC has been shown to&#xD;
      function as the prime connection to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the master clock in the&#xD;
      hypothalamus, and to a range of brain structures known to be involved in depression. The&#xD;
      impact of the signals from the ipRGC is thought to be responsible for the ability of light to&#xD;
      time and stabilise the sleep-wake cycle, and to adjust the seasonal regulation of serotonin.&#xD;
      LED-light can be particularly rich in the blue wavelength spectrum in contrast to&#xD;
      conventional compact fluorescent light (CFL). Thus, LED-light can be tuned to impact the&#xD;
      regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. The dynamic steering of LED-light is important as blue&#xD;
      light in the evening will delay the sleep-wake cycle, which may cause difficulty falling in&#xD;
      sleep (sleep onset insomnia). Blue light in the morning, on the other hand, will advance&#xD;
      sleep and increase alertness, and as patients with depression tend to be late chronotypes,&#xD;
      this should provide a better sleep regulation. Nonresponse in depression has also been linked&#xD;
      to late chronotype, and blue light should help to correct the drift in the sleep-wake cycle&#xD;
      that patients with depression often experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies confirm ancient architectural principles about exposure to morning sun, such&#xD;
      as the late 19th century Nightingale pavilions facing SE aiming at optimising exposure to the&#xD;
      morning sun in the darkest winter season. In a previous pilot project, we documented extreme&#xD;
      differences in daylight exposure between hospital wards facing SE and hospital wards facing&#xD;
      northwest (NW). Measured on a clear day, these differences were 57.000 Lux at summer&#xD;
      solstice, 38.000 Lux at autumn equinox and 19.000 Lux at winter solstice. Also, the spectral&#xD;
      composition of the morning light was richer in the blue region towards SE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At psychiatric units in hospitals there will always be &quot;a dark side of the building&quot; where&#xD;
      facades will receive very little - if any - morning sun during wintertime. Dynamic&#xD;
      LED-lighting can be an effective alternative to natural sunlight. Today, there is not enough&#xD;
      knowledge on how LED-light can be implemented and used or about the potentially beneficial&#xD;
      effects of LED-light on patients with depression. We lack practical research knowledge in&#xD;
      this field, which combines medical science, architecture, and engineering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data on the control intervention: the control intervention as applied in the usual&#xD;
      care arm consists of standard hospital LED lighting fixtures without dynamic or spectral&#xD;
      changes. The lighting setup in the control intervention consists of two ceiling lamps and one&#xD;
      reading lamp, all with LED standard technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling risks: LED-lights and armatures are approved for use in the psychiatric ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected side effect: most common side effects are headache, eyestrain, nausea, and&#xD;
      agitation. Evening administrations of very bright light have been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      sleep disturbances and bipolar patients may switch into hypomania during BLT. The risk of&#xD;
      hypomania is, however, considered small, as all patients will be in mood stabilizing drug&#xD;
      therapy, and the risk of switch from depression to mania, with light therapy, has been found&#xD;
      to be small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits: we expect the dynamic LED-lighting system to provide a larger&#xD;
      antidepressant effect than the standard LED-light, better sleep and less use of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical justification and trial rationale: it is in the public and in the patients shared&#xD;
      interest to investigate how and if light administration in patient rooms has a potential in&#xD;
      the treatment of depression. The intervention in not expected to expose participants to&#xD;
      unnecessary risks, because the treatment in the ward will continue as usual and there will be&#xD;
      close monitoring as the intervention runs. The potential side effects of dynamic LED-light&#xD;
      are expected to be mild and rare. The risk of switch from depression to manic state, due to&#xD;
      light therapy is considered small because all participants will receive adequate mood&#xD;
      stabilizing treatment, and because the risk of switch to mania from depression with light&#xD;
      therapy has been shown to be small. We will exclude all patients with manic symptoms. To find&#xD;
      any emergent manic symptoms during the trial, we will rate weekly for manic symptoms and&#xD;
      alert the staff to look out for emergence of manic symptoms.&#xD;
