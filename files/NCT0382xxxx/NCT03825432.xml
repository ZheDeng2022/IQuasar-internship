  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amputation affects the quality of life of the individual; It is an important surgical&#xD;
      intervention that can lead to functional, psychological and social isolation. The prevalence&#xD;
      and incidence of amputation is difficult to determine precisely at the international&#xD;
      level.The etiology of amputation varies depending on geographical location.Peripheral&#xD;
      vascular diseases are the most common causes of amputation in developed countries and trauma&#xD;
      in developing countries.Limitations in body composition and function after amputation&#xD;
      decrease the activity level, so the participation of amputees is negatively affected.Physical&#xD;
      activity refers to any activity involving body movement and increasing the heart rate and&#xD;
      respiratory rate of the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the lower extremity amputated patients had low levels of physical activity and&#xD;
      participation in sports activities; It was also found that individuals with lower extremity&#xD;
      amputations were less active than those without lower extremity amputation.However, there are&#xD;
      few studies that have shown that individuals with lower extremity amputation are regularly&#xD;
      active, and the amputation of amputated individuals in these studies has mostly caused&#xD;
      traumatic amputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower extremity amputation; Although there is significant evidence showing that the risk of&#xD;
      developing a number of chronic degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, obesity and osteoarthritis significantly increases, there are few&#xD;
      studies investigating and investigating physical activity after amputation.Despite these&#xD;
      investigations, relatively little is known about the components or models of physical&#xD;
      activity necessary to provide protection against chronic diseases and to improve metabolic&#xD;
      health in these specific population groups. Therefore, accurate measurement and estimation of&#xD;
      the level of physical activity and energy expenditure is critical in the prevention and&#xD;
      prevention of chronic diseases in individuals with lower extremity amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A higher level of physical activity is associated with better perceived quality of life in&#xD;
      individuals with lower extremity amputation.Therefore, it is important to develop physical&#xD;
      activity in individuals with lower extremity amputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are studies investigating the physical activity in individuals with lower&#xD;
      extremity amputation as a result of our literature review, no study has been found&#xD;
      investigating factors related to physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the physical activity and related factors of&#xD;
      individuals with lower extremity amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 1: What is the level of physical activity in individuals with lower extremity&#xD;
      amputation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 2: What are the factors associated with the level of physical activity in amputees&#xD;
      of the lower extremity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE UNIVERSE AND THE SAMPLING OF RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individuals to be included in the study will be selected from voluntary amputees who&#xD;
      apply to the Prosthesis-Orthotics Biomechanics Unit of the Department of Physiotherapy and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation of the Eastern Mediterranean University Faculty of Health Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the sample volume in the study was to be linear regression analysis by using G-Power&#xD;
      program, it was determined that the total determinant factor number would be 8 and 108 people&#xD;
      as alpha, 0.05, beta: 0.80 and effect size as 0.15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD OF RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study who have signed a voluntary consent form will be informed about the&#xD;
      study first.Then, demographic information form will be started to be recorded in order to&#xD;
      inform the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants and the information about&#xD;
      amputation and prosthesis.The participants will be given the Timed Up and Go Test, L Test,&#xD;
      Functional Reach Test and 2 Minute Walk Test. Following these tests, participants will&#xD;
      continue with the scales to be answered by the participants themselves.These are&#xD;
      respectively; Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis&#xD;
      Experience Scale and Amputee Body Image Scale.Before the data is collected, individuals will&#xD;
      be informed about the equipment to be used in the tests.An adequate number of trials will be&#xD;
      conducted before the evaluation and use of the equipment in order to be familiar with the&#xD;
      equipment. All assessments will be made by the same physiotherapist.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  18 years to 85 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent walking distance of 30 meters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with unilateral amputation will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATIONS IN THE RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, age, gender, height, body weight, body mass index, educational status, marital&#xD;
      status, profession, socio-demographic characteristics of the dominant side, as well as the&#xD;
      history of amputation, cause of amputation, amputation side and level, stump shape, phantom&#xD;
      pain Factors related to amputation, such as phantom sensation, type of prosthesis and&#xD;
      duration of use will be recorded with the form prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed Up and Go Test: Timed Up and Go Test will be used to measure the risk of functional&#xD;
      mobility and fall.The participant seated on the chair without clinging to his arms 3m from&#xD;
      the ground, 3m after walking without touching a place to return, the chair will be asked to&#xD;
      go back to the sitting position and the time will be recorded in seconds..&#xD;
&#xD;
      L Test: The L test will be used to assess functional mobility. In the L-shaped direction, the&#xD;
      participants will be carried out on the ground where the long edge of L is 7 meters and the&#xD;
      short edge will be 3 meters. At the beginning of the test, the participants will sit in a&#xD;
      chair without arms and stand up from the chair with the start command, complete the L shape&#xD;
      at the preferred speed and return to the chair without interruption. Thus, a total distance&#xD;
      of 20 meters will be completed at the end of the test. The completion time of the test will&#xD;
      be recorded.The intrarater reliability of the test was found to be 0.97 and the interrater&#xD;
      reliability was 0.96, and it was shown to have a very high validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Reach Test: The Functional Reach Test will be done to evaluate the stability&#xD;
      limits and fall risks of individuals.For the test, individuals will be asked to stand upright&#xD;
      on their shoulders with their shoulders wide open.In this position, the acromion level of&#xD;
      individuals will be marked on the wall.Individuals will be asked to lift their arms forward&#xD;
      to the marked level and to reach forwards without moving their feet.The distance between the&#xD;
      start and end position will be measured and recorded in cm.The test will be repeated 3 times&#xD;
      and the measurements will be averaged.The test will be repeated if individuals touch the wall&#xD;
      or take steps during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-Minute Walk Test: 2 Minute Walk Test will be used to evaluate the functional capacity of&#xD;
      individuals.The patient will be seated in the chair at the 25-meter track where the test will&#xD;
      be done and the distance within 2 minutes will be measured in meters.Before and after the&#xD;
      test, the patient's pulse and oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry will be measured and&#xD;
      recorded using the Borg Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale: In order to evaluate the reliability of the&#xD;
      balance, the Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, which has been validated for Turkish&#xD;
      reliability and validity, will be used.There are 16 functional activities in the scale. Each&#xD;
      individual will have 16 different activities and the reliability will be evaluated&#xD;
      accordingly.Measurement results from 0% to 100% are given.0% ir 'no trust' 'and 100% 100'&#xD;
      completely sure ''.If this scale gives a score above 80%, then it is mentioned that the&#xD;
      balance is reliable.For internal consistency, the Cronbach's alpha value was 0.9649 for the&#xD;
      test and 0.9648 for the retest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scale: In order to evaluate the quality of life,&#xD;
      the Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scale which is a validity and validity scale&#xD;
      in amputees will be used. Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scale two consists of&#xD;
      parts.In the first part; psychosocial adjustment, activity restriction and prosthesis&#xD;
      satisfaction.In the second part; questions about how many hours the prosthesis is worn,&#xD;
      general health and physical capacity. For internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha value for&#xD;
      psychosocial adjustment; 0.862 for activity restriction; 0.894 and 0.915 for prosthetic&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amputated Body Image Scale: The Amputee Body Image Scale, which has been validated for&#xD;
      Turkish validity and reliability, will be used to assess body image disorders in amputees.&#xD;
      This 20-item scale evaluates the situations that the amputee perceives and feels about the&#xD;
      body. The score obtained varies between 20-100. A high score indicates a poor body image. The&#xD;
      Cronbach alpha value was 0.939.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Physical Activity: Sociodemographic data such as age, height, weight and gender&#xD;
      from subjects will be recorded on the accelerometer profile using Stay Healthy software&#xD;
      (Research Tracker 6, Version 3.1, Stay Healthy, Inc., Monrovia, USA). The data will be&#xD;
      collected in computer environment as total calorie and efficiency count (VM; X axis, Y axis,&#xD;
      Z axis).The total calories will be recorded in kilocalories, while the data count will be&#xD;
      recorded in terms of acceleration.&#xD;
