  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth, or birth before 37 weeks' gestation, is increasingly common, occurring in 8&#xD;
      percent of pregnancies in Canada. Preterm birth is associated with many health complications,&#xD;
      particularly when the birth happens before 29 weeks' gestation. At this gestational age, the&#xD;
      lungs are not fully developed and it is not uncommon for infants to have problems breathing&#xD;
      at the time of birth. One complication that can arise is when an infant stops breathing and&#xD;
      needs to be resuscitated. When preterm babies need to be resuscitated doctors must take&#xD;
      special care because of the small infant size and the immaturity of the brain and lungs.&#xD;
      Oxygen is used to resuscitate babies who need it, but unfortunately there is disagreement&#xD;
      about the best oxygen concentration to use. Oxygen concentration is important because both&#xD;
      too much and too little oxygen can cause brain injury. This research aims to fill this&#xD;
      knowledge gap by participating in an international clinical trial to compare the effects of&#xD;
      resuscitating babies less than 29 weeks' gestational age with either a low oxygen&#xD;
      concentration or a high oxygen concentration. The oxygen concentrations have been selected&#xD;
      using the best available knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a cluster randomized trial where each participating hospital will be randomized&#xD;
      to either 30 or 60 percent oxygen for the recruitment of 30 infants, and afterwards&#xD;
      randomized to the other group for the recruitment of another 30 infants. After the trial, the&#xD;
      investigator will determine whether the babies resuscitated with low oxygen or those&#xD;
      resuscitated with high oxygen have better survival and long-term health outcomes. This&#xD;
      research fills a critical knowledge gap in the care of extremely preterm babies and will&#xD;
      impact their survival both here in Canada and internationally.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Purpose: Over the last 10 years, recommendations regarding the ideal level of oxygen for&#xD;
      resuscitation in preterm infants have changed from 100 percent, down to low levels of oxygen&#xD;
      (&lt;30 percent), up to moderate concentration (30-65 percent). In addition, in 2010, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation targeting was recommended as standard of care and this contributed to a change in&#xD;
      clinical practice as clinicians were more likely and comfortable to start resuscitation at&#xD;
      either 21percent (room air) or titrated levels of oxygen such as 30-40 percent. When the&#xD;
      guidelines were again revised in 2015, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation&#xD;
      (ILCOR) acknowledged that a critical knowledge gap continued to exist for the resuscitation&#xD;
      of the preterm infants &lt;37 weeks, highlighting the need to provide more concrete guidelines.&#xD;
      This leaves clinicians in a challenging position. Despite the advances that have been&#xD;
      achieved in perinatal and neonatal care, neonates are still vulnerable to the consequences of&#xD;
      the oxidative effects from hyperoxia as well as the deleterious effects from hypoxia. A&#xD;
      large, multi-centre international trial of sufficient sample size that is powered to look at&#xD;
      safety outcomes such as mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes is required to&#xD;
      provide the necessary evidenced to guide clinical practice with confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: the null hypothesis for this study is that the incidence of mortality or abnormal&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-24 months corrected age will be no different by using&#xD;
      either higher initial oxygen concentration of 60 percent compared to using lower initial&#xD;
      oxygen concentration of 30 percent for resuscitation of preterm infants of 23 0/7- 28 6/7&#xD;
      weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of supplementary oxygen may be crucial, but also potentially detrimental to premature&#xD;
      infants at birth. High oxygen levels may lead to organ damage through oxidative stress, while&#xD;
      low oxygen levels may lead to increased mortality. Excess oxygen exposure during the early&#xD;
      post-birth period is associated with many complications and morbidities of preterm birth.&#xD;
      Preterm infants have lower levels of anti-oxidant pathways consistent with their expected&#xD;
      fetal environment of low oxygen exposure. Excess of oxygen free-radicals in infants&#xD;
      intrinsically deficient in enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants may&#xD;
      contribute to these morbidities. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity, through the generation of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in excess of antioxidant defenses, is believed to be a&#xD;
      major contributor to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Using lower oxygen&#xD;
      concentrations at birth results in decreased oxidative stress markers and a decrease risk of&#xD;
      developing BPD compared to higher oxygen concentrations. Other organs that may be damaged by&#xD;
      such oxidative stress include kidneys, myocardium and the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is equally growing evidence that using lower oxygen concentrations will lead to lower&#xD;
      oxygen saturation levels and bradycardia, which may lead to increased rates of mortality in&#xD;
      this vulnerable group of infants. An individual patient analysis of clinical trials reported&#xD;
      that 46% of preterm infants resuscitated with initial low oxygen concentration did not reach&#xD;
      SpO2 of 80% at 5 min. This was associated with increased risk of major intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage (IVH), and an almost five times higher risk of death in this vulnerable group of&#xD;
      infants. These data provide a warning note for the use of higher vs. lower initial oxygen&#xD;
      concentration during delivery room resuscitation. As the investigator proceed in determining&#xD;
      a safe range for resuscitation of ELBW/ELGA infants, it is highly likely that the optimum&#xD;
      level of oxygen concentration is between the two extremes of 21 percent and 100 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine whether initial resuscitation of preterm neonates with 60 percent&#xD;
      versus 30 percent oxygen results in better neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method/Procedures: This will be a cluster crossover design, unmasked randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) comparing two oxygen concentrations at initiation of resuscitation.&#xD;
      Infants will be placed on the resuscitation table with the initial steps of resuscitation&#xD;
      carried out as per standard of care at each centre which usually follows current&#xD;
      resuscitation guidelines. All centres will make every effort to establish adequate lung&#xD;
      expansion using CPAP or positive pressure ventilation as needed. Enrolled infants will have a&#xD;
      pulse oximeter sensor placed on the right arm in the first minute of life. Their&#xD;
      resuscitation will be initiated with an oxygen concentration of 30 or 60 percent depending on&#xD;
      the randomization sequence at the centre at the given time. Infants in the 30 percent group&#xD;
      will remain in 30 percent oxygen until 5 min of age unless the infant's heart rate (HR)&#xD;
      remains 100/min or less and does not show a tendency towards progressive increase before&#xD;
      reaching 5 min of age or infant needs chest compression and/or epinephrine. No alteration in&#xD;
      oxygen concentration will be made for an infant who is responding to resuscitation efforts&#xD;
      with HR progressively increasing as minutes go by. At 5 min of age, the clinical team will&#xD;
      assess oxygen saturation. If the saturation is less than 85 percent, oxygen should be&#xD;
      increased by 10-20 percent every 60 sec to achieve saturations of 85 percent or greater or a&#xD;
      saturation of 90-95 percent at 10 min of age. If saturations are greater than 95 percent at&#xD;
      or before 5 min of age, oxygen should be decreased stepwise (every 60 sec) with an aim to&#xD;
      maintain saturations of 85 percent or greater during 5-10 min of age or 90-95 percent at and&#xD;
      beyond 10 min of age. The procedure for infants in the 60 percent group will be identical.&#xD;
      The intervention duration for the trial will be the first 5 min after birth followed by&#xD;
      initial monitoring/action for the next 5 min where titration in oxygen concentration will be&#xD;
      made to achieve stability making a total of 10 min for study intervention. Titration of&#xD;
      oxygen before 5 min after birth will only be made if the infant remains bradycardic (HR less&#xD;
      than 100) and does not show a tendency towards a sustained increase in HR or if the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation exceeds 95 percent. If the infant does not respond to ventilation with increasing&#xD;
      HR in the first 5 min after birth, steps to ensure effective ventilation should be done&#xD;
      before oxygen is titrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis: Generalized linear mixed model with binary outcome and maximum&#xD;
      likelihood estimate will be used to evaluate the effect of an oxygen concentration on the&#xD;
      primary outcome (as a composite between 18 and 24 months corrected age of all-cause mortality&#xD;
      or the presence of a major neurodevelopmental outcome). To account for cluster crossover&#xD;
      design of the study, effects of centers (clusters) and a period (oxygen concentration) within&#xD;
      center will be considered random, and effects of a period (oxygen concentration) will be&#xD;
      entered as a fixed effect. This hierarchical model allows for the correlation of patients&#xD;
      within periods and within clusters. The model will be adjusted for gestational age and&#xD;
      whether or not infant required mask ventilation as potential confounding variables. Similar&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed models will be performed to evaluate the effect of group on&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. In addition, three subgroup analysis will be performed: i) Gestational&#xD;
      age will be categorized into 2 categories: 23+0- 25+6 vs. 26+0-28+6 weeks; ii) Breathing&#xD;
      support will be categorized by infants supported only with CPAP vs. received mask&#xD;
      ventilation; iii) Sex/Gender will be categorized into 2 categories: female vs. male. For&#xD;
      subgroup analysis baseline characteristics will be compared using linear and generalized&#xD;
      linear mixed models. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to analyze the missing data;&#xD;
      however, a very low number of missing values are expected due to the design of the study.&#xD;
