      Introduction: The muscle contractile effectiveness is influenced by the neural activation of&#xD;
      the motor units, as well as its architecture and the elasticity of the myotendinous junction.&#xD;
      In addition, tendinous properties also affect the production of muscle strength and function.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a wide-used tool in rehabilitation for motor&#xD;
      relearning, to reduce muscular atrophy, pain control and to improve functional performance.&#xD;
      Although studies have demonstrated the efficacy of NMES in various clinical situations, the&#xD;
      best joint angle (ideal muscle length) to enhance neuromuscular and tendinous adaptations&#xD;
      induced by NMES has to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the effect of NMES on different hip and knee angles on knee&#xD;
      extensor torque, quadriceps muscle electromyographic activity, architecture, and&#xD;
      tendon-aponeurosis complex elongation, and tendinous properties of the patellar tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: This is a crossover study with healthy males, aged 18-35 years. The&#xD;
      independent variables will be: 1) NMES in different lower limb positions: knee joint&#xD;
      angulation at 20º or 60º with hip at 0º or 80º (four combinations). The dependent variables&#xD;
      will be: knee extensor torque, surface muscle electrical activity, muscle architecture&#xD;
      (muscle thickness, pennation angle and fascicular length), the elongation of the&#xD;
      tendon-aponeurosis complex of the quadriceps muscle components, and the properties&#xD;
      (stiffness, Young's modulus and cross-sectional area) of the patellar tendon. The descriptive&#xD;
      and analytical statistics will be carried out with measures of central tendency and&#xD;
      dispersion, inference tests, tables and graphs. The normality of the data will be verified&#xD;
      with the Shapiro-Wilk test. For the data that present normal distribution, the Two-Way ANOVA&#xD;
      will be applied to verify differences among the measurements, with post-hoc of Bonferroni.&#xD;
      The non-parametric option will be the Friedman test. Correlation coefficients will be&#xD;
      calculated using the Pearson (parametric) or Spearman (non-parametric) correlation test. The&#xD;
      level of statistical significance will be p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The effect of an NMES session on the neural, muscular and tendon&#xD;
      adaptations related to the angular specificity of the hip and knee, indicating greater&#xD;
      potential for strength and muscle mass gains, will be shown, which is fundamental in the&#xD;
      prescription of electrostimulation in rehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is used in various contexts due to its benefits&#xD;
      related to motor learning, preservation of denervated muscles, training in non-cooperative /&#xD;
      sedated individuals, pain control and relief, and improvement of athletes, young, and elderly&#xD;
      functional performance, besides people with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Even with the&#xD;
      solid accumulated knowledge about NMES, its potential is not fully understood, with questions&#xD;
      to be clarified for the achievement of greater effectiveness by clinicians and scientists in&#xD;
      the various possibilities of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of NMES have not been determined yet in quadriceps femoris muscle in different&#xD;
      lengths, which can be accomplished by changing the angle of the joint or joints it crosses&#xD;
      (hip and knee). There is probably only one trial (Fahey et al., 1984) addressing this issue.&#xD;
      In the study, two positions were compared: knee and hip extended versus knee (65º) and hip&#xD;
      (angle not mentioned) flexed, although the purpose of the study was to evaluate only the&#xD;
      influence of knee position. Authors found that NMES can increase isometric and isokinetic&#xD;
      strength, but that it may be more effective to improve isokinetic performance if knee is&#xD;
      flexed during treatment. Questions are then raised because groups were tested only with knee&#xD;
      flexed and not also extended, and because the change in hip angle probably influenced the&#xD;
      results. This study was also the only one found by Bax et al. (2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justificative: NMES is an established tool applied as the main or an supplementary treatment&#xD;
      in rehabilitation programs. It is necessary to establish the influence of lower limb position&#xD;
      in the outcomes. Therefore, this study will address for the first time the effects of NMES on&#xD;
      quadriceps voluntary and evoked strength, electrical activity, architecture, and tendon&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In healthy young adults, the variation of the hip and knee joint angle for NMES&#xD;
      may affect the knee extensor torque, quadriceps muscle electromyographic activity,&#xD;
      architecture, and tendon-aponeurosis complex elongation, and tendinous properties of the&#xD;
      patellar tendon. These factors will be facilitated when the participants are seated with the&#xD;
      knee at 60º flexion. On the other hand, when the quadriceps is more elongated (lying with&#xD;
      knee at 60º) or shortened (dorsal decubitus or sitting with knee extended (0º), such&#xD;
      adaptations will not be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a crossover trial with healthy young male subjects. The procedures will be&#xD;
      performed in the Neuromuscular Performance Laboratory of the Faculty of Ceilândia /&#xD;
      University of Brasília and in the Force Laboratory of the Faculty of Physical Education /&#xD;
      University of Brasília. Subjects will perform 5 visits to the laboratory (the first visit&#xD;
      will be a familiarization session to test NMES in each position), with a minimum interval of&#xD;
      48 hours between visits. Volunteers will be informed of all the procedures, purposes,&#xD;
      benefits, and risks of the study and will sign an informed consent form before participation&#xD;
      (the project was approved by the University Research Ethics Committee N 99221818.9.0000.0029)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC): An isokinetic dynamometer will be used&#xD;
           for recording torque. The equipment axis will be visually aligned with the axis of the&#xD;
           knee (lateral epicondyle of the femur). The lever arm of the force transducer will be&#xD;
           firmly attached 2-3 cm above the lateral malleolus with a strap. Angulations of hip and&#xD;
           knee will be adjusted with a goniometer. Subjects will be firmly stabilized to the chair&#xD;
           with belts across the chest and pelvic girdle to minimize body movement. Individuals&#xD;
           will be instructed to cross their arms with hands on shoulders and extend the knee&#xD;
           against the strap &quot;by pushing gradually for 3 s (ramping contraction) up to the maximum&#xD;
           force, maintaining it for 4 s, and then decrease de amount of force gradually for more 3&#xD;
           s&quot;. The number of contractions will correspond to the number of ultrasound evaluations:&#xD;
           4 muscles (rectus femoris and the three vastus) + proximal patellar tendon + distal&#xD;
           patellar tendon x 3 measurements for each = 18, each one separated by 1 min of rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES): NMES will be used to produce a maximal&#xD;
           electrically evoked isometric torque, which will be assessed in the familiarization and&#xD;
           will be generated (15-18 times) after the end of the voluntary contractions protocol of&#xD;
           the subsequent sessions. An electrical stimulator device will be used. Parameters will&#xD;
           be verified using a digital oscilloscope. The device will be connected to cables that&#xD;
           will be connected to two pairs of 25 cm2 adhesive electrodes. The first distal electrode&#xD;
           will be placed at 80% of the line between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and&#xD;
           the space where the medial ligament is located. The proximal electrode will be placed in&#xD;
           the corresponding motor point, identified with a pen type electrode, in the vastus&#xD;
           medialis. The other distal electrode will be positioned 2/3 of the line that forms from&#xD;
           the ASIS to the lateral side of the patella, while the proximal electrode will be placed&#xD;
           at the motor point, identified with a pen type electrode, in the muscular belly of the&#xD;
           vastus lateralis. It will be used a pulsed current: frequency = 100 Hz, pulse duration =&#xD;
           400 μs, rise time = 3 s, ON time = 4 s, decay time = 3 s, and off time = 1 min. The&#xD;
           intensity used will be the one obtained in the familiarization, or greater if tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electrical activity and activation level: Surface electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
           activity of vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris will be recorded&#xD;
           bipolarly by two rounded electrodes of silver chloride, each measuring 20 mm in diameter&#xD;
           and having a recording diameter of 10 mm and separated by an inter-electrode distance&#xD;
           (center to center) of 20 mm. The electrodes will be positioned longitudinally in the&#xD;
           muscle belly, and a reference electrode will be attached to the patella of the&#xD;
           contralateral lower limb. As in the case of NMES electrodes, a marking will be made to&#xD;
           ensure that in the following sessions the electrodes will be placed accordingly. The&#xD;
           impedance reduction (&lt;5 kΩ) between the two electrodes will be obtained by abrasion of&#xD;
           the skin with emery paper and cleaning with alcohol. EMG signals will be amplified with&#xD;
           a bandwidth frequency of 15 Hz to 5.0 kilohertz (common mode rejection rate = 90&#xD;
           decibels, impedance = 100 milliohms, gain = 1000).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle architecture: Muscle thickness, pennation angle and fascicular length will be&#xD;
           obtained in rest and during MVIC and NMES using a portable ultrasound in B mode with a&#xD;
           linear transducer of 7.5 megahertz . Depth, gain, compression and ultrasound settings&#xD;
           will be kept constant between assessments and from one patient to another. For each&#xD;
           muscle, three videos will be obtained and the mean values will be used for statistical&#xD;
           analysis. For better reproducibility, the evaluator will remove and reposition the&#xD;
           transducer at the marked location. The videos will be stored on the device and then&#xD;
           transferred to a computer for processing in specific softwares. The videos will be&#xD;
           obtained with the transducer positioned in the longitudinal plane of the muscle, keeping&#xD;
           it in parallel with the direction of the fascicles. Proper alignment of the transducer&#xD;
           will be achieved when multiple fascicles are showed without interruption. Rectus&#xD;
           femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis will be evaluated,&#xD;
           respectively, in the percentages 50%, 60% and 75% (proximal to distal) of the distance&#xD;
           between the medial aspect of the anterior superior iliac spine and the superior border&#xD;
           of the patella, as adapted from Blazevich et al. (2006). The rectus femoris and the&#xD;
           vastus intermedius will be visualized on the anterior aspect of the thigh, the vastus&#xD;
           lateralis will be visualized by moving the transducer 5 cm in the lateral direction from&#xD;
           the midline and the vastus medialis will be visualized with the transducer 3 cm onto the&#xD;
           medial direction of the thigh. The pennation angle is the angle formed between the echo&#xD;
           of the deep aponeurosis of the muscles and the echo of the space between the fascicles,&#xD;
           as measured 3 to 4 mm above the deep aponeurosis of the muscles. The fascicular length&#xD;
           will be considered as the total length of the muscle fiber, however, because the&#xD;
           fascicles are too long to be measured from the origin to the insertion, the estimated&#xD;
           length will be obtained from the formula of Blazevich et al. (2006), which uses as&#xD;
           variables the muscle thickness, the angle of the fascicle and the angle between the&#xD;
           superficial and deep aponeurosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tendon-aponeurosis complex elongation: The myotendinous elongation will be estimated by&#xD;
           the displacement of the deep aponeurosis. For the calculation will be used the&#xD;
           recordings acquired for analysis of the muscular architecture. However, unlike the&#xD;
           static nature of the data of the previous topic, this variable uses a dynamic approach,&#xD;
           since the point (P) will be used as the contact point (insertion) of a fascicle in the&#xD;
           deep aponeurosis at rest and the displacement of P when considering its final position&#xD;
           during a maximum contraction. Therefore, the displacement of P (dL) is considered an&#xD;
           indication of the elongation of the deep aponeurosis and the distal tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tendon properties: The resting length of the patellar tendon will be measured by tracing&#xD;
           its path with the ultrasound transducer in the longitudinal (sagittal) plane, starting&#xD;
           from the patellar insertion to the insertion at the tibia, along the posterior surface&#xD;
           of the tendon. The central region of the transducer will be placed in each of the tendon&#xD;
           insertions (considering its posterior surface) and then a mark on the skin will be made&#xD;
           at that point and a measuring tape will be used for the tendon length measurement. The&#xD;
           cross-sectional area of the patellar tendon will be calculated from axial plane images&#xD;
           at 25%, 50% and 75% of its length (at rest). The calculation of tendon force will use&#xD;
           the ratio of the estimated total knee extension moment (corrected for the activation of&#xD;
           the biceps femoris muscle obtained by electromyography) by the internal moment arm,&#xD;
           which will be estimated by individually measuring the length of the femur, according to&#xD;
           the equation of Visser et al (1990). Tendon stress will be calculated by the force ratio&#xD;
           applied to the tendon by its cross-sectional area. The strain in the tendon will be&#xD;
           calculated using the change in length over the original length (ΔL / Lo) and will be&#xD;
           expressed as a percentage. The Young's modulus, or elastic modulus, will be obtained by&#xD;
           dividing the stress by the strain. The tendinous stiffness will be calculated by&#xD;
           dividing the force applied to the tendon by the elongation generated in its length. As&#xD;
           the length of the transducer does not allow the entire visualization of the patellar&#xD;
           tendon, a hypoallergenic echo-absorbent adhesive tape will be placed in the center of&#xD;
           the tendon for reference. Thus, images will be obtained from the tape to the proximal&#xD;
           insertion and then departing from the tape to the distal insertion. Images will be&#xD;
           reconstructed for measurement. The deformation will be defined as the change in the&#xD;
           length between the patella and the tibia, which will be measured frame-by-frame.&#xD;
