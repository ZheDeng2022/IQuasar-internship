  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry-based study is to evaluate the ongoing, real-world clinical&#xD;
      performance and safety of commercially available DyeVert Systems during typical clinical use&#xD;
      for patients undergoing coronary or peripheral angiography for diagnostic and/or&#xD;
      interventional procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) occurs in 3-19% of patients undergoing coronary&#xD;
      angiography and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.&#xD;
      Patients with chronic kidney disease have greater odds of developing CI-AKI. Guidelines for&#xD;
      CI-AKI prevention include screening for risk, volume expansion, and minimizing contrast media&#xD;
      volume (CMV) to the patient during angiography; however, hospitals face barriers to&#xD;
      implementation in the real-world setting and therefore consistent care delivery for at-risk&#xD;
      patients remains a modern clinical challenge. DyeVert Systems provide real-time CMV&#xD;
      monitoring and minimization during angiography procedures thereby reducing total CMV to the&#xD;
      patient and total CMV relative to baseline renal function, two known risk factors for CI-AKI.&#xD;
      The DyeMINISH Registry is designed to evaluate ongoing real-world clinical performance and&#xD;
      safety of commercially available DyeVert Systems among a large, real-world population of&#xD;
      patients undergoing coronary and peripheral angiography.&#xD;

    <description>Osprey Medical DyeVert™ Contrast Reduction Systems (DyeVert Systems) provide fluid pathway resistance modulation such that excess contrast media (CM) (i.e. CM that is not needed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes) is minimized in the patient's vasculature and total contrast media volume (CMV) reduction occurs, while maintaining adequate image quality.</description>

        DyeVert Systems are indicated for patients undergoing angiographic procedures requiring&#xD;
        injection of contrast media. Patients at risk for developing contrast-induced nephropathy&#xD;
        (CIN) represent the target population for these devices.&#xD;
