  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single site, study of the SENSE device in up to 20 study subjects, (five&#xD;
      healthy controls and five each with ICH, AIS with LVO and AIS without LVO) in whom SENSE can&#xD;
      be applied within 24 hours of stroke symptom onset. LVO will be defined as occlusion of the&#xD;
      internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (M1 or M2). All images in stroke&#xD;
      patients will be reviewed by an independent neuroradiologist and final diagnoses ascertained&#xD;
      by an independent neurologist. The treating clinicians will be blinded to the data collection&#xD;
      and SENSE device scanning as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A history and physical examination will be performed by the treating physician, and routine&#xD;
      evaluations (including a diagnostic head CT/CT angiogram or MR/MR angiogram). All eligible&#xD;
      subjects must have the diagnostic head CT/MR scan and clinical diagnosis of a stroke (ICH,&#xD;
      AIS with LVO or AIS without LVO) performed within 24 hours of symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects or legally authorized representatives will be approached for enrollment.&#xD;
      Prior to obtaining informed consent, concurrence of patients' eligibility for this study and&#xD;
      an assertion that the patient is clinically stable will be obtained from the treating team&#xD;
      and its attending physician prior to obtaining informed consent. After obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study, the SENSE device will be placed on the subject and&#xD;
      monitoring will proceed over 45 minutes. A research coordinator will be present at the&#xD;
      bedside for the 45 minutes of SENSE monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, routine clinical management will ensue in the emergency department (ED),&#xD;
      hospital ward or intensive care unit (ICU) as appropriate. A standard of care head CT with or&#xD;
      without CT angiography or MR with or without angiography performed prior to diagnosis will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed. All enrolled AIS subjects must have a CT or MR angiography performed&#xD;
      within 24 hours to establish absence or presence of LVO. Study procedures shall not delay,&#xD;
      detract or interfere with medically necessary care or with planned treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SENSE device will be placed on the subject's head, and two small ink dots will be marked&#xD;
      on the head corresponding to a known location on the device to allow for the device to be&#xD;
      removed and replaced consistently throughout the 45 minutes of testing.&#xD;
