  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aged long-term care receivers are affected by various adverse skin conditions like pressure&#xD;
      ulcers, incontinence-associated dermatitis, dryness, intertrigo and many more. Prevention of&#xD;
      these skin problems and the provision of general hygiene and skin care activities are key&#xD;
      areas of nursing practice. Numerous condition specific guidelines are available and are&#xD;
      implemented separately. The more guidelines exist, the more difficult it is for nurses to&#xD;
      implement them all. On the other hand, there is a huge overlap in terms of aetiology,&#xD;
      pathogenesis and prevention of aforementioned skin conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this trial is to test the feasibility and to estimate possible effects of&#xD;
      a comprehensive skin care package targeting main nursing relevant skin problems at the same&#xD;
      time. Therefore a study will be performed in nursing homes of the state of Berlin comparing&#xD;
      the skin care package to standard care. Residents' safety and subjective wellbeing will&#xD;
      increase combined with improvements in professional competence of nurses. An advisory board&#xD;
      consisting of international experts agreed already to supervise the trial.&#xD;

      Objectives and aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aged and care dependent patients suffer from many adverse skin conditions like xerosis cutis&#xD;
      (including pruritus), pressure ulcers, skin tears, intertrigo and incontinence-associated&#xD;
      dermatitis. Separate preventive strategies for these particular risks and diseases are&#xD;
      available and partly implemented. Although distinct clinical diagnoses, there are substantial&#xD;
      overlaps in terms of etiology (e.g. skin fragility, immobility) pathophysiology, prevention&#xD;
      (e.g. safe handling, off-loading) and treatment (e.g. skin protection and care). Facilities&#xD;
      are challenged to implement fragmented, condition-specific guidelines, neglecting shared&#xD;
      etiologies and prevention and treatment principles, which has been shown to be an important&#xD;
      barrier for implementation of evidence-based practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently an evidence-based comprehensive skin care algorithm was developed. The objective of&#xD;
      this trial is to investigate the feasibility of the implementation of this skin care package,&#xD;
      to describe context factors for implementation, to estimate effect sizes and intracluster&#xD;
      coefficients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory cluster randomized trial in aged nursing home residents will be conducted. The&#xD;
      cluster design was chosen to avoid contamination between groups. A total of n = 500 residents&#xD;
      from n = 20 nursing homes (randomly selected from the population of nursing homes of the&#xD;
      state of Berlin) will be included in the study. In the intervention group (n = 10 nursing&#xD;
      homes), the developed evidence-based algorithm will be implemented. The control group (n = 10&#xD;
      nursing homes) receives the usual standard care of the respective nursing home.&#xD;

    <measure>Stratum Corneum Hydration (SCH) measurements on right lower leg lateral, right midvolar forearm</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 12 ± 1, Week 24 ± 1</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Stratum Corneum Hydration. SCH was measured using the Corneometer CM 825 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). This measurement is based on the differences of the dielectric constant of water and other substances. With this device, only the moisture content in the stratum corneum is measured. The arbitrary units (a.u.) range from 0 to 120 where as higher readings indicate higher stratum corneum hydration.&#xD;
Means of triplicate measurements per skin area in arbitrary units at right lower leg lateral, right midvolar forearm&#xD;
If measurements are not possible at right leg/arm (e.g. due to amputation) they will be conducted at contralateral skin areas</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 12 ± 1, Week 24 ± 1</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Transepidermal water loss. TEWL was measured with the Tewameter TM 300 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). The probe captures the constant permeation of water through the stratum corneum in gram per hour per m2. The measuring probe contains a pair of sensors that are located in different distances to the skin surface to determine temperature and relative humidity above the skin surface. The humidity gradient between both sensors is used for calculating the transepidermal water loss. Higher values indicate a higher transepidermal water loss.&#xD;
Means of duplicate measurements per skin area in g/m2/h at right lower leg lateral, right midvolar forearm&#xD;
If measurements are not possible at right leg/arm (e.g. due to amputation) they will be conducted at contralateral skin areas</description>

    <measure>Skin Surface pH on right lower leg lateral, right midvolar forearm</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 12 ± 1, Week 24 ± 1</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Skin surface pH. Skin surface pH was measured with the Skin-pH-Meter PH 905 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany), a planar glass electrode. The pH is a measure of acidity and alkalinity of a solution and it indicates the concentration of the hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution. Reference values of human skin have been reported to range from 4 to 6.&#xD;

    <description>Self-completion of the WHO-Five Well-being Index by residents without cognitive impairment. The German version of the WHO-Five Well-being Index questionnaire published by the World Health Organization in 1998 will be used.
