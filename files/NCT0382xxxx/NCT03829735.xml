  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of death in adults in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Prior to the introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine, main modes of&#xD;
      transmission in SSA were perinatal transmission from mother-to-child (MTCT) (10%) and&#xD;
      horizontal transmission during early childhood (90%). MTCT occurs through contact with&#xD;
      maternal fluids during passage through the birth cana; transplacental transmission and&#xD;
      transmission through breastfeeding are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, WHO recommended the administration of hepatitis B vaccination to all newborns within&#xD;
      24 hours of birth to prevent perinatal and early transmissions. In Senegal, the government&#xD;
      introduced the monovalent vaccine that can be used within 24 hours after birth in the&#xD;
      Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in March 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we present a study protocol for a sero-epidemiological study of pairs of children aged&#xD;
      9 to 12 months and their mothers, identified through the demographic study, to assess the&#xD;
      impact of monovalent vaccine introduced by the national program for prevention of&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission in Senegal. We will also assess the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) to identify people with high viral&#xD;
      replication (HBV DNA ≥200,000 IU/ml), compared to a conventional reference test (PCR).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of death in adults in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Each year, about 61,000 people are estimated to die of&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cirrhosis secondary to chronic infection with HBV. Prior to&#xD;
      the introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine, main modes of transmission in SSA were perinatal&#xD;
      transmission from mother-to-child (MTCT) (10%) and horizontal transmission during early&#xD;
      childhood (90%). MTCT occurs through contact with maternal fluids during passage through the&#xD;
      birth cana; transplacental transmission and transmission through breastfeeding are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a relatively low frequency of perinatal transmission in SSA, prevention of this type&#xD;
      of transmission is important, because this mode of transmission results in higher risk of&#xD;
      becoming chronic HBV carriers, and developing chronic liver disease, including HCC, than&#xD;
      horizontal transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, WHO recommended the administration of hepatitis B vaccination to all newborns within&#xD;
      24 hours of birth to prevent perinatal and early transmissions. In Senegal, the government&#xD;
      introduced the monovalent vaccine that can be used within 24 hours after birth in the&#xD;
      Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in March 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this context that the NeoVac study started in 2016 in Senegal, Burkina Faso and&#xD;
      Madagascar. The general objective is to develop a long-term strategy adapted to the local&#xD;
      context to vaccinate newborns against hepatitis B in the first 24 hours of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NeoVac 1, a population-based epidemiological survey to estimate the coverage of this&#xD;
      newly introduced monovalent hepatitis B vaccine started in Senegal in 2018. Here, we present&#xD;
      a study protocol for a sero-epidemiological study of pairs of children aged 9 to 12 months&#xD;
      and their mothers, identified through the demographic study, to assess the impact of&#xD;
      monovalent vaccine introduced by the national program for prevention of mother-to-child&#xD;
      transmission in Senegal. We will also assess the diagnostic performance of loop-mediated&#xD;
      isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) to identify people with high viral replication (HBV DNA&#xD;
      ≥200,000 IU/ml), compared to a conventional reference test (PCR).&#xD;
