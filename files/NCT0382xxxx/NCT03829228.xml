      According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principle, Protective Qi (PQi) is a one&#xD;
      specific concept of Qi that provides the vital energy of the body. It works primarily on the&#xD;
      body surface as a defensive barrier. In this context, PQi is analogous to anatomical barriers&#xD;
      of the innate immune system located for example, at the skin surface and the mucosal surfaces&#xD;
      of the respiratory and digestive tract. Individuals with PQi Insufficiency are predisposed to&#xD;
      frequent cold and other symptoms caused by invasion of external pathogens (&quot;Wai Xie&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;external evil&quot; in TCM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ß-glucan is a polysaccharide that activates macrophage (Dectin-1) and neutrophil (CR3)&#xD;
      receptors, and therefore enhances immune defense at digestive and respiratory mucosa.&#xD;
      Clinical trials have shown its immune activity such as preventing upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection (URTI) and Traveler's diarrhea. Notably, ß-glucan is a component of Ganoderma&#xD;
      Luciderm (or Reishi / Lingzhi), one TCM ingredient well-known for improving Qi. Based on this&#xD;
      connection, investigators hypothesized that ß-glucan is the active ingredient in Reishi that&#xD;
      at least partially accounts for Reishi's activity on Qi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis, investigators have conducted an uncontrolled pilot trial that&#xD;
      investigated the effect of a commercially available, high ß-glucan containing product,&#xD;
      Proglucamune®, on PQi status. Proglucamune contains ß-glucan from three different natural&#xD;
      sources: Reishi mushroom, Shiitaki mushroom, and Bakers' yeast, each providing ß-glucan that&#xD;
      differs slightly in their molecular structure. Through this pilot investigators sought to&#xD;
      obtain an estimate of the effect size of Proglucamune on PQi that would allow us, via&#xD;
      statistical methods, to estimate the necessary sample size for more definitive future trials.&#xD;

      Unlike mainstream Western medicine (WM), alternative medicines (AM) such as Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese Medicine (TCM), emphasizes individually-differentiated therapies. As such, AM&#xD;
      therapies are normally not tested in clinical studies that statistically demonstrate the&#xD;
      efficacy at the populational level for applicable patients, and this makes it difficult to&#xD;
      objectively evaluate and compare different therapies. The lack of clinical studies stands as&#xD;
      a barrier for the advance of AMs as well as their engagement with WM. In fact, most&#xD;
      researchers view AMs primarily as untapped sources of &quot;active ingredients/compounds&quot; for drug&#xD;
      development, but disregard the rationales under which the therapies were developed. A&#xD;
      &quot;One-Way-Traffic&quot; research paradigm is thus created wherein AM therapies are investigated for&#xD;
      their efficacy by WM standards, whereas the vast potential of employing WM therapies for AM&#xD;
      therapeutics is ignored. In light of this, investigators set up a novel strategy that bridges&#xD;
      TCM and WM, i.e., testing a WM-based therapy by TCM standards through clinical&#xD;
      trial/statistics- based method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qi is a central concept of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and was first documented in the&#xD;
      oldest TCM writings more than 2000 years ago. Generally speaking, Qi refers to the vital&#xD;
      energy of the body and is derived from two primary sources: 1) inborn Qi (that may be&#xD;
      construed as genetics), and 2) pectoral Qi (can be construed as metabolism). Moreover, Qi&#xD;
      manifests itself in two forms: Nutritive Qi and Protective Qi, which can be understood to&#xD;
      reflect an individual's nutritional state and immune health, respectively. Regarding the&#xD;
      latter, protective Qi functions to defend the body from the invasion of external pathogens.&#xD;
      TCM also emphasizes that Protective Qi works primarily on the body surface as a defensive&#xD;
      barrier. In this context, Protective Qi is analogous to anatomical barriers of the innate&#xD;
      immune system located for example, at the skin surface and the mucosal surfaces of the&#xD;
      respiratory and digestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TCM has developed a number of methods to strengthen the Qi. Prominent among these is the use&#xD;
      of Reishi, either alone or in combination with other TCM remedies. The use of Reishi was&#xD;
      described in detail in the first TCM pharmacopeia &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; published in&#xD;
      year 1,600. Nonetheless, although Protective Qi is part of the general Qi, the specific&#xD;
      effect of Reishi on Protective Qi is less documented. Anecdotal reports are available that&#xD;
      claim significant improvement of Protective Qi with Reishi or Reishi-containing formulas&#xD;
      within days. Notably, Western medicine has identified immune-boosting properties of Reishi,&#xD;
      which may explain the Qi enhancing effects of this plant. Specifically, beta-glucan - a&#xD;
      component of Reishi - has been shown to activate macrophage (large white blood cells in the&#xD;
      immune system that destroy bacteria and other harmful substances), neutrophil (type of white&#xD;
      blood cells that are important for protection against infections), and other immunocytes (a&#xD;
      type of cells capable of producing an immune response), and may exhibit particular benefits&#xD;
      among macrophage-rich organs such as the lung, liver and spleen. In fact, ß-glucans from&#xD;
      sources other than Reishi, such as baker's yeast, are able to initiate the same immune&#xD;
      response and clinical benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overlap of TCM and western medicine concerning the beneficial effects of Reishi for its&#xD;
      Qi enhancing and immune-modulating effects, respectively, has prompted us to investigate&#xD;
      whether or not Reishi, in conjunction with other natural products used in TCM, can enhance an&#xD;
      individual's Protective Qi. More specifically, the objective of the current protocol is to&#xD;
      determine if a commercially available dietary supplement (Proglucamune®, USANA Health&#xD;
      Sciences) containing powdered Reishi and Shitake mushrooms as well as baker's yeast extract,&#xD;
      and which is comprised of 11% ß-glucans by weight, will improve Protective Qi in subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed by practitioners of TCM as having low or insufficient Protective Qi. Specifically,&#xD;
      in this a pilot study, investigators sought to obtain an estimate of the effect size of&#xD;
      Proglucamune on PQi that would allow us, via statistical methods, to estimate the necessary&#xD;
      sample size for more definitive future trials. The trial also aimed to provide information on&#xD;
      individuals who are responsive to Proglucamune treatment (responder), and subsequently&#xD;
      recruit targeted individuals for the follow-up trials.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Given the small sample size in this pilot study and the potential drop-out rate, we did not include a placebo group to control for the placebo effect. Nonetheless, we implemented a &quot;deceptive&quot; double-blinding design, i.e., all on-site care-providers and investigators and all participants were told that this study was placebo controlled, and that each participant had a 50/50 chance of receiving treatment or placebo. This masking helps decreasing the expectation bias from the participants that confound the study result.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change of Protective Qi Score (PQS) Determined by a Standardized Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>The change of PQS was obtained by assessment of PQS at each follow-up visit from the baseline (start date). The follow-up visit was conducted every two weeks throughout the study, i.e., on the 14th, 28th, 42nd, and 56th day from the baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Protective Qi of each participant at baseline and each follow-up visit will be measured by an on-site investigator (licensed TCM practitioners) through a standardized quantitative assessment. The evaluation includes 3 health conditions relevant to PQD (cold frequency, symptoms, and signs). Each condition will be scored on a 1-10 scale based on a set of standardized criteria. The sub-scores will be weighted to arrive at a final PQS. So this PQS will be on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being the most healthy state. The change of the PQS from baseline, indicating the treatment effect, will be calculated and analyzed by statistical means.</description>

    <measure>Change of Generic Qi Score (GQS) Determined by a Standardized Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>The change of GQS was obtained by deduction of GQS at each follow-up visit from the baseline (start date). The follow-up visit was conducted every two weeks throughout the study, i.e., on the 14th, 28th, 42nd, and 56th day from the baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Generic Qi of each participant at baseline and each follow-up visit will be measured by an on-site investigator (licensed TCM practitioners) through a standardized quantitative assessment. The evaluation includes 5 sets of criteria indicative of Generic Qi insufficiency (cold history, symptoms of PQD, symptoms of Lung Qi Deficiency, symptoms of Heart and Spleen Deficiency, and signs of GQD). Each set will be scored on a 1-10 scales, with 10 being the most healthy state. The sub-scores will be averaged to arrive at a final GQS. So this GQS will be on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being the most healthy state.

        <title>Change of Protective Qi Score (PQS) Determined by a Standardized Assessment</title>
        <description>Protective Qi of each participant at baseline and each follow-up visit will be measured by an on-site investigator (licensed TCM practitioners) through a standardized quantitative assessment. The evaluation includes 3 health conditions relevant to PQD (cold frequency, symptoms, and signs). Each condition will be scored on a 1-10 scale based on a set of standardized criteria. The sub-scores will be weighted to arrive at a final PQS. So this PQS will be on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being the most healthy state. The change of the PQS from baseline, indicating the treatment effect, will be calculated and analyzed by statistical means.</description>
        <time_frame>The change of PQS was obtained by assessment of PQS at each follow-up visit from the baseline (start date). The follow-up visit was conducted every two weeks throughout the study, i.e., on the 14th, 28th, 42nd, and 56th day from the baseline.</time_frame>

        <title>Change of Generic Qi Score (GQS) Determined by a Standardized Assessment</title>
        <description>Generic Qi of each participant at baseline and each follow-up visit will be measured by an on-site investigator (licensed TCM practitioners) through a standardized quantitative assessment. The evaluation includes 5 sets of criteria indicative of Generic Qi insufficiency (cold history, symptoms of PQD, symptoms of Lung Qi Deficiency, symptoms of Heart and Spleen Deficiency, and signs of GQD). Each set will be scored on a 1-10 scales, with 10 being the most healthy state. The sub-scores will be averaged to arrive at a final GQS. So this GQS will be on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being the most healthy state. The change of the GQS from baseline, indicating the treatment effect, will be calculated and analyzed by statistical means.</description>
        <time_frame>The change of GQS was obtained by deduction of GQS at each follow-up visit from the baseline (start date). The follow-up visit was conducted every two weeks throughout the study, i.e., on the 14th, 28th, 42nd, and 56th day from the baseline.</time_frame>

Proglucamune: Following screening and enrollment, participants were treated with 2 tablets of Proglucamune per day for a total duration of 8 weeks. Each Proglucamune tablet contained ~100 mg ß-glucan derived from Baker's Yeast extract (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell wall), Reishi mushroom powder (Ganoderma lucidum), and Shitake mushroom powder (Lentinula edodes).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Study limitations: First, this was not a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, so the observed effect size likely was inflated by uncontrolled confounders. Second, most participants were receptive to the healing effects of TCM, which may have lead to an overestimate of treatment effect. Lastly, the clinical trial started when flu season had passed its peak. This may have decreased the chance of subjects catching the flu and thereby have led to improved PQi independent of Proglucamune treatment.</limitations_and_caveats>
