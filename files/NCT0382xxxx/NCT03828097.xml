  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are examining how the daily consumption of a multi-vitamin/mineral&#xD;
      supplement affects the following variables in 21-40 year old women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. blood levels of various micronutrients (assessed from blood draws using mass&#xD;
           spectrometry-based assays)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. blood cell gene expression patterns (assessed from blood draws and real-time PCR assays)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. mood (assessed via questionnaires) Blood and questionnaires will be collected prior to&#xD;
           supplementation, and 12 weeks into supplementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of a multi-vitamin/mineral/omega-3 complex on&#xD;
      psychological and physiological measures in pre-menopausal women (21-40 years old) over a&#xD;
      12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention. Briefly, subjects will&#xD;
      be screened for inclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will then undergo a pre-testing battery&#xD;
      (i.e., T1) and will then be randomly assigned to one of two groups including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental group (anticipated n=50)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group (anticipated n=50) Subjects will then consume 2 capsules per day for 12&#xD;
           weeks and perform a post-testing battery (i.e., T2) that includes tests performed during&#xD;
           the pre-testing battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome (dependent) variables between treatments will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. blood levels of various micronutrients (assessed from blood draws using mass&#xD;
           spectrometry-based assays)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. blood cell gene expression patterns (assessed from blood draws and real-time PCR assays)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. mood (assessed via questionnaires) Blood and questionnaires will be collected prior to&#xD;
           supplementation, and 12 weeks into supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics used to assess differences between conditions over time will include two-way&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVAs. When significant group*time interactions are observed, the&#xD;
      statistical model will be decomposed using LSD post hoc tests.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum concentrations of micronutrients</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood serum will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention and assessed for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25OHD), and folate as well as 6 associated metabolites [folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MeTHF), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-FoTHF), homocysteine (Hcy), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)]. Overall changes in these metabolites will be compared to pre-intervention values to determine if the experimental intervention was more effective at increasing one or multiple micronutrient levels in serum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Red blood cell omega-3 and omega-6 concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Red blood cells will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention and assayed for red blood cell omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content. Overall changes in these metabolites will be compared to pre-intervention values to determine if the experimental intervention was more effective at altering these fatty acid levels in red blood cells.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood red blood cell concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention and assessed using a CBC test. The CBC test provides red concentration. Results from these tests will be compared to reference range values for apparently healthy female individuals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>White blood cell concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention and assessed using a CBC test. The CBC test also provides white blood cell concentration. Results from these tests will be compared to reference range values for apparently healthy female individuals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum cholesterol concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Whole blood will be collected at PRE and POST-intervention, and serum will be extracted and assessed using a chem-20 test. The chem-20 test provides serum lipid concentrations (i.e., LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol). Results from these tests will be compared to reference range values for apparently healthy female individuals.</description>
