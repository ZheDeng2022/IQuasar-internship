    <textblock>
      Background: To tackle the high burden of undernutrition, the government of Bangladesh has&#xD;
      identified growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) as a priority activity in the National&#xD;
      Nutrition Services operational plan. Till date, no evidence are available from Bangladeshi&#xD;
      studies to identify the effectiveness of GMP in improving the nutritional status of&#xD;
      Bangladeshi children under 2 years of age. During 2013-14, two Bangladeshi studies looking at&#xD;
      implementation issues of GMP at Community Clinic level and assessing the quality of nutrition&#xD;
      services at primary health care facilities. The studies identified that lack of coordination,&#xD;
      inadequate training, supervision, and logistic supplies as challenges to GMP implementation.&#xD;
      Currently, GMP, (primarily sick child GMP) is being implemented through community clinics,&#xD;
      supported by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or other programs funded by donors.&#xD;
      Besides, GMP is also taking place in areas where there are no NGO or donor support&#xD;
      activities. However, the quality of nutrition data related to GMP is believed to be&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. Hence, it is important to assess the effectiveness of GMP on the growth of&#xD;
      under 2-year-old children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: GMP services could improve the growth of children under 2 years of age by 20&#xD;
      percent in the intervention group compared to the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:To examine the effectiveness of GMP in improving nutritional status of children&#xD;
      under 2 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Quasi-experimental study using mixed methods Study duration: 24 months Study&#xD;
      setting: The study will be conducted in six sub-districts of rural Bangladesh where GMP is&#xD;
      operational at the community clinic level. However, those areas will be excluded if there is&#xD;
      any ongoing community or household level intervention on nutrition counseling being&#xD;
      implemented by an NGO. For smooth implementation of GMP, refresher training on nutrition to&#xD;
      health service providers will be provided by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants: children under 2 years of age, mother's/caregiver's of children &lt;2 and&#xD;
      service providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: children under 2 years of age who are exposed to GMP services at&#xD;
      community clinics where an NGO funded program is supporting GMP implementation Control group:&#xD;
      children under 2 years of age, at community clinics where GMP is not operational&#xD;

      Introduction and objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bangladesh has partly achieved the millennium development goal targets for nutrition and is&#xD;
      committed to achieving the Sustainable development goals targets. Between 1997 and 2014,&#xD;
      childhood stunting reduced from 60% to 36% nationally, and wasting has declined from 21% to&#xD;
      14%. However, 6.4 million children remain stunted, leaving them unable to develop to their&#xD;
      full physical and mental potential. To tackle the high burden of under-nutrition, the&#xD;
      government of Bangladesh has identified growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) as a priority&#xD;
      activity in the National Nutrition Services operational plan. GMP is to be implemented from&#xD;
      all primary health care facilities of the government health system. Growth Monitoring and&#xD;
      Promotion (GMP) is a preventive activity comprised of growth monitoring linked with promotion&#xD;
      (usually counseling) that increases awareness about child growth and improves caring&#xD;
      practices. Ideally, in GMP, the weight of children usually under 2 years of age is measured&#xD;
      periodically (for example, on a monthly or bi-monthly basis). The measurement can start at&#xD;
      birth, accurately recorded on a growth chart, interpreted and explained to the caregivers.&#xD;
      Additionally, the health workers give information through counseling, facilitating&#xD;
      communication, and interacting with mothers in a way that aims to generate adequate maternal&#xD;
      action to promote child growth. Recent systematic reviews question the effectiveness and&#xD;
      relevance of GMP programs in general. Currently, GMP, which is primarily focused on sick&#xD;
      child GMP is being implemented through community clinics (CCs), supported by NGOs or other&#xD;
      programs funded by donors. Besides, GMP is also taking place in areas where there are no&#xD;
      non-governmental organization (NGO) or donor support activities. However, the quality of&#xD;
      nutrition data related to GMP is believed to be unsatisfactory. On this backdrop, it is&#xD;
      important to assess the GMP implementation and its effect on the growth of under 2-year-old&#xD;
      children. Hence, this study will offer a useful opportunity to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      strengthening the GMP activities in improving growth and infant and young child feeding&#xD;
      (IYCF) practices among children under 2 years of age in rural Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of study site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the discussion and list of sub-districts shared by the NGO program, the investigators&#xD;
      have selected 3 sub-districts where the program will be implemented from January 2018. The&#xD;
      investigators have selected these 3 sub-districts based on (a) time of implementation of the&#xD;
      program which matches with the project timeline; (b) available staff and logistics support by&#xD;
      the NGO program in these sub-districts; and (c) large number of Community Clinics in these&#xD;
      sub-districts to satisfy the required number of study participants and their caregivers.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators have also selected 3 sub-districts as control keeping an&#xD;
      adequate buffer zone to avoid intervention spill-over effect. The investigators will select&#xD;
      30 community clinics from these sub-districts through a community scoring system to have the&#xD;
      maximum impact of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of study participants: The community clinics (CCs) and its catchment area will be&#xD;
      considered as clusters. From the list of community clinics, required numbers of clusters will&#xD;
      be randomly selected through a proportionate sampling. From the randomly selected CCs, the&#xD;
      required number of study participants will be enrolled after conducting household listing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures: The children will be enrolled from the catchment area of&#xD;
      community clinics and be followed up for 12 months. During the follow-up period, the children&#xD;
      will be visited periodically to assess their exposure to GMP service and also their feeding&#xD;
      practice. Anthropometric measurements will be taken at baseline and then tri-monthly till the&#xD;
      end of the 12 months follow-up period. Mother's knowledge and attitude about IYCF issues will&#xD;
      be assessed at baseline and at an endpoint survey. Service provider's skills and perception&#xD;
      about GMP will be assessed at baseline and at end-line. Quality of GMP implementation will be&#xD;
      at baseline and periodically during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools: Household surveys, key informant interviews (KII), and observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The survey data will be analyzed using STATA software (version 13). The summary&#xD;
      statistics would be expressed as means with standard deviations, medians or percentages, with&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate. To assess differences in mean among the&#xD;
      factories, ANOVA and for categorical outcomes, chi-square statistical comparisons of&#xD;
      proportions with 95% confidence intervals, will be calculated. A difference-of-difference&#xD;
      (DID) analysis of quantitative outcome data will be done. To identify significant predictors&#xD;
      associated with the main outcome indicators, bi-variate and multiple regression analyses will&#xD;
      be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thematic analysis will be followed for qualitative information collected through&#xD;
      participant's caregiver interview, key informant interview, and observation. Following&#xD;
      preparation of the transcript, responses will be coded according to themes (a priori),&#xD;
      sub-themes and emergent issues, if any. Triangulation of data derived from different methods&#xD;
      will be carried out to validate qualitative information.&#xD;
