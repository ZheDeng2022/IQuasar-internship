  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the Phase I portion of the study is to determine the safety profile&#xD;
      and preliminary evidence of efficacy associated with infusion of autologous gene-corrected&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pediatric non-randomized open-label Phase I clinical trial. This will include&#xD;
      a safety evaluation and preliminary assessment of the efficacy of hematopoietic gene therapy&#xD;
      consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying&#xD;
      the ITGB2 gene in subjects with severe Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (LAD-I). Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo mobilization and collection of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with&#xD;
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor or bone marrow harvest in select&#xD;
      circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSCs will then be transduced with the therapeutic vector (Chim.hCD18-LV), with the intent of&#xD;
      enabling stable integration of the provirus in the genome of stem and progenitor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the number of CD34+ cells that are cryopreserved is at least 4×10E6 total CD34+ cells/kg,&#xD;
      subjects will receive myeloablative conditioning with intravenous busulfan. The gene-modified&#xD;
      CD34+ cells will be then transplanted back into the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once engrafted, it is anticipated that the gene-modified stem and progenitor cells will&#xD;
      enable hematopoiesis, generating blood cells in which the integrated therapeutic gene (ITGB2)&#xD;
      will be transcribed and translated to produce the therapeutic CD18 protein with a&#xD;
      preferential high expression in mature myeloid cells. Leukocytes expressing a functional CD18&#xD;
      will have the capability to arrest on endothelial surfaces and extravasate to infectious&#xD;
      sites, enabling a competent antimicrobial response and reversing the clinical disorder.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A confirmed diagnosis of severe LAD-I as demonstrated by flow cytometry indicating&#xD;
             CD18 expression on &lt;2% neutrophils (polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMNs]). (Patients&#xD;
             in which CD18+ PMNs are &gt;2% will be considered eligible with &lt;2% CD11a or CD11b&#xD;
             expressing PMNs and if there is a documented ITGB2 mutation and clinical history&#xD;
             consistent with LAD-I (or known family history).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one (1) prior significant bacterial or fungal infection (US National Cancer&#xD;
             Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], v5.0, Grade&#xD;
             ≥2). This criteria is not required for patients with documented family history who&#xD;
             meet the above inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A competent custodial parent with legal capacity to execute an Ethics Committee&#xD;
             (EC)-approved consent form must be available to participate in the consent process.&#xD;
             (Informed assent will be sought from capable patients, in accordance with the&#xD;
             directive of the EC and with local requirements.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to comply with trial procedures including investigational therapy and&#xD;
             follow-up evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of a medically-eligible human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling&#xD;
             donor transplant. Patients may not be included in this trial as an alternative to a&#xD;
             clinically-indicated and feasible HLA-matched sibling donor HSC transplant. If an&#xD;
             HLA-identical sibling is identified, but mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow HSC&#xD;
             collection is not feasible (for example: donor is in utero, is a newborn from whom&#xD;
             cord blood was not collected, or is unable to undergo donation procedure because of&#xD;
             medical impairments), then inclusion may be permitted per the Principal Investigator&#xD;
             discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic dysfunction as defined by either:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary dysfunction as defined by either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Need for supplemental oxygen during the prior 2 weeks (in absence of acute&#xD;
                  infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oxygen saturation (by pulse oximetry) &lt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active metastatic or locoregionally advanced malignancy (including&#xD;
             hematologic malignancy) for which survival is anticipated to be less than 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious infections with persistent bloodstream pathogens at time of trial entry.&#xD;
             (Patients with active infections [e.g., unresolved ulcerative lesions, skin or oral&#xD;
             infections] are permitted as long as appropriate antibiotic therapy has been [or is&#xD;
             being] administered).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or other contraindication for both leukopheresis and bone marrow harvest&#xD;
             procedure, as determined by the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or other contraindication for the administration of conditioning therapy,&#xD;
             as determined by the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant medical conditions, including documented human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) infection, poorly-controlled diabetes, poorly-controlled hypertension,&#xD;

             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator&#xD;
             renders the patient unfit for trial participation or at higher than acceptable risk&#xD;
             for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are evaluated for the trial and determined ineligible may be subsequently&#xD;
        evaluated and declared eligible if the criteria by which they were considered ineligible is&#xD;
        reversible (for example: bloodstream infection, transient increase in liver enzymes) and&#xD;
        there is documented and plausible evidence of its resolution in the opinion of the&#xD;
        Principal Investigator.&#xD;
