  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility trial of a 6-month extreme carbohydrate restricted diet (20 grams total&#xD;
      carbs/day) via counseling with dietitian plus aromatase inhibitor therapy. Visits will occur&#xD;
      at screening, mid-study, and pre-surgery. Anthropomorphic measurements, and patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PROs) will be taken at all three visits. Patients will speak with a dietitian at&#xD;
      their monthly standard of care visits, and will receive weekly calls for the first 4 weeks of&#xD;
      the intervention. All subjects will receive surgery after approximately 6 months of&#xD;
      intervention. Total duration of the study is expected to be 2 years, though each patient's&#xD;
      participation will be approximately 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of patients able to consistently adhere to the low carbohydrate diet in combination with AIs during neo-adjuvant treatment. The patient will be considered adherent for each food diary if &lt;20% of calories were obtained from carbohydrates. This will be approximately 80 grams of carbohydrates but will vary depending on total caloric intake. A patient will be considered adherent to the diet overall if they meet the adherence cutoff at least 75% of the time (i.e. in at least 75% of food diaries for a single patient &lt;20% of calories were obtained from carbohydrates).</description>
