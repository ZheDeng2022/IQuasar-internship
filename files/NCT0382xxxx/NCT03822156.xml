  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective cohort study. The purpose of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      clinical features of the patients with the cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and&#xD;
      endobronchial TB from the patients who have been registered in this hospital for treatment&#xD;
      and follow-up, as part of the &quot;PPM Project (Private-Public Mix project) for Korean National&#xD;
      Tuberculosis Control&quot; introduced in Korea since 2007.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is known to remain its Infectivity for a longer period&#xD;
      of time than the non-cavitary pulmonary TB, which is usually almost inactivated its&#xD;
      infectivity within two weeks after the administration of the anti - TB drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are few studies on this, so it is not known how long the infectivity persists,&#xD;
      whether there is a correlation with the number of cavities or the size of the cavities&#xD;
      between persistence of infectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, endobronchial TB is known also to be highly infectious, unlike simple pulmonary&#xD;
      TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known how long infectivity can persist after the administration of anti-TB&#xD;
      medication, and whether there is any difference in persistence of infectivity regarding the&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of endobronchial TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will analyze the retrospective data analysis of UUH-PPM Cohort,&#xD;
      a cohort of PPM project patients in the Ulsan University Hospital (UUH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPM project is a &quot;Private-Public Mix project&quot; for the eradication of tuberculosis from&#xD;
      Korea, which the Korean government and private medical institutions have been conducting&#xD;
      since 2007.&#xD;
