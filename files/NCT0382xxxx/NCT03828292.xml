  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916) is a first in class, antibody dependent cellular&#xD;
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced, humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody-drug conjugate&#xD;
      (ADC) which binds specifically to B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on tumor cells&#xD;
      of all participants with multiple myeloma. This is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation&#xD;
      study to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity&#xD;
      and clinical activity of GSK2857916 when given as monotherapy (Part 1) or given as&#xD;
      combination therapy (Part 2). Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design.&#xD;

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 20 years or older (at the time consent is obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma as defined&#xD;
             according to IMWG 2014, criteria in a participant who fulfills all of the following:&#xD;
             has undergone stem cell transplant, or is considered transplant ineligible, Part 1:&#xD;
             has received at least 2 prior lines of anti-myeloma drugs containing at least 1&#xD;
             proteasome inhibitor and at least 1 immunomodulator, Part 2: has received at least 1&#xD;
             prior line of anti-myeloma drugs; has demonstrated progression on, or within 60 days&#xD;
             of completion of the last therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has measurable disease with at least one of the following: serum M-protein &gt;=0.5 grams&#xD;
             per deciliter (g/dL) (&gt;=5 grams per liter [g/L]); Urine M-protein &gt;=200 mg/24 hours;&#xD;
             Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: Involved FLC level &gt;=10 mg/dL (&gt;=100 mg/L) and an&#xD;
             abnormal serum FLC ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of autologous stem cell transplant are eligible for study&#xD;
             participation provided the following eligibility criteria are met: Transplant was &gt;100&#xD;
             days prior to study enrolment; No active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants: Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local&#xD;
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical&#xD;
             studies. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or&#xD;
             breast feeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a woman&#xD;
             of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or For Part 1 and Part 2 Arm A: Is a WOCBP and using&#xD;
             a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent per&#xD;
             year), preferably with low user dependency, during the treatment period and for 4&#xD;
             months after the last dose of GSK2857916, and 7 months from the last dose of&#xD;
             bortezomib (only Part 2 Arm A), and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the&#xD;
             purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator should evaluate the&#xD;
             effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test (as&#xD;
             required by local regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment and agree to use effective contraception during the study and for 4 months&#xD;
             after the last dose of GSK2857916, and 7 months from the last dose of bortezomib (only&#xD;
             Part 2 Arm A); For Part 2 Arm B: Due to pomalidomide being a thalidomide analogue with&#xD;
             risk for embryo-fetal toxicity and prescribed under a restricted distribution program,&#xD;
             WOCBP participants will be eligible if they commit either to abstain continuously from&#xD;
             heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control,&#xD;
             beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with pomalidomide, during therapy,&#xD;
             during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of&#xD;
             pomalidomide treatment. Thereafter, WOCBP participants must use a contraceptive method&#xD;
             that is highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent per year) for a further 3&#xD;
             months, and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction&#xD;
             during this period. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating&#xD;
             pomalidomide therapy. The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days and the&#xD;
             second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing pomalidomide therapy. The&#xD;
             investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and&#xD;
             recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early&#xD;
             undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants: Contraceptive use by men should be consistent with local&#xD;
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical&#xD;
             studies. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following&#xD;
             from the time of first dose of study treatment until 6 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             GSK2857916, 4 months after the last dose of bortezomib (only Part 2 Arm A), and 4&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of pomalidomide (only Part 2 Arm B) to allow for clearance&#xD;
             of any altered sperm: Refrain from donating sperm plus either: Be abstinent from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long&#xD;
             term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent; or must agree to use&#xD;
             contraception/barrier as detailed: Agree to use a male condom even if they have&#xD;
             undergone a successful vasectomy and female partner to use an additional highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent per year as when&#xD;
             having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (including pregnant&#xD;
             females).&#xD;
