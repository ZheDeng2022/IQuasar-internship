      The haematological neoplasia relapse is the cause of higher mortality after allogeneic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT). When transplantation fails the most common therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      is to increase the antitumor activity of the donor's immune system through the infusion of&#xD;
      donor Lymphocytes (DLI). The use of DLI may limit the relapse, but may induce transplantation&#xD;
      disease against the host (GvHD), in 40-60% of patients. With advances in transplantation&#xD;
      procedures, the use of non-compatible (HLA-mismatched) haploidentical (aplo) donor cells has&#xD;
      become feasible and is increasing. However, strategies for immune control of relapse after&#xD;
      HSCT from haploidentical donor are hampered by the absence of prospective data that can guide&#xD;
      treatment and limit the induction of GvHD in the setting of the HLA difference between the&#xD;
      donor and the recipient. Cytokine-induced Killer Cells (CIK) are T lymphocytes from&#xD;
      haploidentical donor expressing CD56 (e.g., double positive cells at CD3 / CD56). CIK are a&#xD;
      product of advanced cell therapy (Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Product, ATMP) for somatic&#xD;
      cell therapy and have a reduced histocompatibility (MHC) complex: are cytotoxic, anti-tumor&#xD;
      cells, possess the characteristics of both T cells and Natural Killer (NK) and show in vivo a&#xD;
      very strong cytolytic activity against leukemia, but a low reactivity against the host.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study has as its primary objective to investigate the safety of CIK cells&#xD;
      deriving from the donor, especially in terms of the onset of GvHD, used as a treatment for&#xD;
      relapse after transplantation with haploidentical stem cells. The study will allow to&#xD;
      evaluate the possibility of using CIK cells, at the indicated dose combination (5x10 * 6&#xD;
      cells / kg, 5x10 * 6 and 10x10 * 6 cells / kg) as an effective and safe therapy in the&#xD;
      context of haploidentical transplantation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Disease relapse is a major cause of mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) for hematologic malignancies. When allogeneic transplant fails the&#xD;
      most common therapeutic strategy is to increase the anti-tumor activity of donor immune&#xD;
      system through infusion of donor lymphocytes (DLI). Use of DLI can effectively treat limited&#xD;
      relapses, but can induce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in the range of 40-60% of the&#xD;
      patients. With the advances in HSCT procedure, the use of HLA-mismatched (haplo) family&#xD;
      donors became feasible and extended the opportunity for HSCT to almost all patients lacking&#xD;
      an HLA-matched donor. Due to the promising results of the procedure and the easier access to&#xD;
      the donor, the number of haplo-HSCT transplant is steeply increasing. However, strategies&#xD;
      aiming at eliciting the immune control of the relapse after haplo-HSCT are hampered by&#xD;
      absence of prospective data that guide treatment and the fear of inducing GvHD in this&#xD;
      setting of profound HLA disparity between donor and recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite the use of DLI in haplo-HSCT is not a standard practice, DLI are occasionally&#xD;
           empirically used, mainly due to the lack of alternative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytokine Induced Killer (CIK) cells are T lymphocytes expressing the CD56 marker, i.e.&#xD;
           CIK are CD3/CD56 double positive cells. CIK cells are produced in vitro by incubating&#xD;
           blood leukocytes according to a specific expansion protocol which includes initial&#xD;
           stimulation with Interferon-gamma and anti-CD3 antibody, followed by expansion with&#xD;
           (Interleukin-2) IL-2. CIK cells are non MHC restricted, cytotoxic, anti-tumoral cells&#xD;
           which share characteristics of both T and NK cells and show in vivo a very strong&#xD;
           cytolytic activity against leukemia, graft versus leukemia, while being essentially&#xD;
           devoid of graft versus host reactivity. They show a natural non-MHC restricted (T Cell&#xD;
           Receptor)TCR independent cytotoxicity against malignant targets cells, involving&#xD;
           perforin and granzyme release and NKG2D, as well as CD56 and other small target&#xD;
           molecules. In the past 15 years the investigators have extensively studied the use of&#xD;
           cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells as alternative cellular therapy to treat disease&#xD;
           relapse after HSCT. The key feature of CIK cell therapy in the context of haplo- HSCT is&#xD;
           the lower risk of inducing GvHD compared to DLI, that could permit to avoid the&#xD;
           devastating effect of acute and chronic GvHD in terms of decreased survival, quality of&#xD;
           life, disability and need of additional care. Indeed, beyond the dramatic impact in the&#xD;
           quality and quantity of life of patients, costs for the health system of the management&#xD;
           of acute and chronic GvHD are exceedingly high. At this regard, CIK cells have been&#xD;
           regarded as the cellular therapy that is associated with a more favourable therapeutic&#xD;
           index compared to DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In an early Phase I study the investigators observed remissions in 3 of 11 patients who&#xD;
           were treated with infusion of CIK cells at a time when malignant cells were detectable.&#xD;
           In each of these 3 cases, the patient had been previously treated unsuccessfully with&#xD;
           conventional DLI. Successful remission induction by infusion of CIK cells after&#xD;
           unsuccessful DLI suggests that the (Graft Versus Leukemia) GVL activity of CIK cells was&#xD;
           attributable to NK-T cells. In a subsequent phase I clinical trial was assessed the&#xD;
           feasibility of using CIK cells from HLA-matched sibling donors. Using a dose escalation&#xD;
           design, the investigators showed that CIK cells could be given at doses as high as&#xD;
           1x10^8 per kg recipient body weight without causing acute infusion-related toxicity. The&#xD;
           investigators recently reported the final results of a phase II multicenter pilot study,&#xD;
           showing that CIK cell treatment for the relapse after HSCT is effective with a low&#xD;
           toxicity in terms of GvHD compared to DLI. Importantly for the present proposal, in this&#xD;
           study, 5 patients were treated in the context of haplo- HSCT. These did not show any&#xD;
           different response or safety concern compared to other patients, suggesting the&#xD;
           feasibility of this approach in a haploidentical context. Similarly, another study of&#xD;
           CIK cellular therapy in HSCT including also patients with haploidentical donors&#xD;
           confirmed the feasibility and safety of this approach. Considering that infused T cells&#xD;
           are associated with risk of GvHD induction, especially in the haploidentical&#xD;
           transplantation setting, novel cellular therapies manipulated to minimize GvHD while&#xD;
           enhancing the graft-versus leukemia efficacy need to be tested in early phase clinical&#xD;
           trials. Thus, the aim of the present proposal is to use CIK cells as a platform for a&#xD;
           safe and effective cellular therapy in the context of haploidentical transplantation. As&#xD;
           no dose limiting toxicity has been reached in phase I/II studies and no clear&#xD;
           relationship among dose and both toxicity and response emerged so far, in the present&#xD;
           study the investigators planned to use the final standard dose of our previous phase II&#xD;
           study of 5x106 cells/kg, 5x10^6 and 10x10^6 cells/kg with no schedule modification .&#xD;
           Three infusion of CIK cells will be administered every 3 weeks.&#xD;
