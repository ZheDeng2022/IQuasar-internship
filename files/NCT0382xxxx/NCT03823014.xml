  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether an external erectile prosthesis (The Elator™) is&#xD;
      a feasible alternative to internal erectile prostheses for transgender men who have undergone&#xD;
      a phalloplasty with glansplasty and wish to use their neophallus for sexual penetration. The&#xD;
      Elator™ was initially developed for men experiencing erectile dysfunction after prostate&#xD;
      cancer. The device consists of two silicone rings connected by a pair of plastic coated rigid&#xD;
      metal rods. One ring goes at the base of the penis. The other ring is connected to the rods.&#xD;
      This ring is placed behind the glans, and then the rods are connected to the base ring to&#xD;
      stretch and provide rigidity to the phallus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 1.4 million transgender adults in the United States. Approximately&#xD;
      half are transgender men, individuals who have a male gender identity but were assigned&#xD;
      female at birth. A national survey of transgender adults found more than half of transgender&#xD;
      men have had, or may want, gender affirmation surgery in the form of phalloplasty - the&#xD;
      surgical creation of a penis and scrotum. The neophallus created in this manner can be used&#xD;
      for standing urination but not for penetrative sex, due to the lack of erectile structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research suggests that one factor limiting interest in phalloplasty is the lack of reliable,&#xD;
      durable, and desirable erectile devices. Internal prostheses are the primary method used to&#xD;
      attain penile rigidity after phalloplasty. However, these devices carry a significant risk of&#xD;
      mechanical failure and other adverse events. The high failure and complication rates&#xD;
      associated with internal erectile prostheses demonstrate a need for alternative options for&#xD;
      transgender men after phalloplasty. One such option consists of an external erectile&#xD;
      prosthesis or support. The Elator™ consists of two silicone rings connected by a pair of&#xD;
      plastic coated rigid metal rods. Use of such an external device may be preferable for men who&#xD;
      do not wish to undergo additional surgery after phalloplasty, and/or those who have had&#xD;
      problems with internal prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Word of mouth suggests that a number of transgender men have experimented with these devices&#xD;
      after phalloplasty, but to date no study has tested the safety and function of external&#xD;
      erectile prostheses in this population. Currently, the FDA exempts most external penile&#xD;
      rigidity devices from pre-market notification and review. As such, safety and efficacy&#xD;
      testing is not required prior to public marketing. However, before medical professionals can&#xD;
      feel comfortable recommending these devices to their patients, such testing is clearly&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot study will test whether an external erectile prosthesis (The Elator™) is a&#xD;
      feasible alternative to internal erectile prostheses for transgender men after phalloplasty.&#xD;
      This study will recruit twenty men who have had a phalloplasty greater than one year prior to&#xD;
      the study date, have protective sensation to the tip of their phallus, have a current sexual&#xD;
      partner with whom they would like to explore sexual penetration using the neophallus, and who&#xD;
      do not currently have an internal erectile prosthesis.&#xD;
