  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic disease deriving from an abnormal proliferation of&#xD;
      monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. The survival of MM patients varies from less than&#xD;
      6 months to more than 10 years depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis and prognostic&#xD;
      factors. Three current standard treatments are approved for elderly or younger patients with&#xD;
      significant comorbidities not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT):&#xD;
      bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP), melphalan-prednisone- thalidomide (MPT) and&#xD;
      lenalidomide with low-dose dexamethasone (Rd).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consistent fraction of elderly patients with cancer and co-morbidities are at increased&#xD;
      risk of developing frailty (the emergent geriatric syndrome), as well as physical and&#xD;
      cognitive decline, with negative effect on nutrition and lifestyle, and eventually on&#xD;
      responsiveness to and efficacy of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A frailty scale was recently described that categorized patients with MM as fit, intermediate&#xD;
      or frail based on age, comorbidities, and physical and cognitive functioning. The frailty&#xD;
      score was a predictor of death, progression of the disease, toxicity and drug&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will compare available first line standard treatments, the&#xD;
      triplet VMP versus the doublet Rd, in an unselected population of patients ≥ 65 years&#xD;
      affected by MM in every day clinical practice. In the last decade, many novel and expensive&#xD;
      drugs have been approved for this disease, yet the general older population is not adequately&#xD;
      represented in validating trials. Nevertheless, the results and treatments derived from those&#xD;
      trials have often been applied to the older population, with a high risk to produce a&#xD;
      negative impact on patient functional capacity and ability to carry out daily tasks,&#xD;
      cognitive function, depression status, nutritional condition, social situation/capability to&#xD;
      stay at home and finally affecting their quality of life (QoL) and OS. The main aim of the&#xD;
      project is to evaluate the best initial treatment for elderly MM patients and to compare&#xD;
      benefits, risks, QoL and costs of currently available, standard treatments according to the&#xD;
      frailty profile.&#xD;
