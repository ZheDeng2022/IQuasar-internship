  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, randomized, concurrently controlled, noninferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of instrumented Bio2 Vitrium Cervical Interbody&#xD;
      Device in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with structural allograft bone and&#xD;
      local autologous bone graft in treating patients with a symptomatic degenerative cervical&#xD;
      disc disease at one level from C3/C4 to C7/T1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate if Bio2 Vitrium® Cervical Interbody Device (VCIBD) is non-inferior to&#xD;
      allograft cage in single-level ACDF with the use of local autologous bone. VCIBD is a&#xD;
      restorable cervical interbody cage for the treatment of fusion, following discectomy, of the&#xD;
      cervical spine from C3/C4 disc space to the C7/T1 disc space. The material used to&#xD;
      manufacture the implant is 13-93 bioactive glass, which is a silicate-based material as&#xD;
      described in ASTM F1538-03(R2017). The implant has high porosity and strength and does not&#xD;
      contain any biological material or constitute a combination product. The device has a central&#xD;
      lumen for packing with autograft. VCIBD is intended to be used with a supplemental fixation&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device, when placed between the vertebrae, provides mechanical stability and prevents&#xD;
      subsidence prior to bone ingrowth. It restores and maintains the intervertebral space during&#xD;
      the fusion process. The porosity and material characteristics provide an osteoconductive&#xD;
      matrix that supports bone ingrowth. Additional stabilization is provided by supplemental&#xD;
      fixation using anterior cervical plate. The implant incorporates a central lumen, which&#xD;
      allows for the cage to be packed with autogenous bone graft.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 Health Survey is a 36-item instrument for measuring health status and outcomes. It yields an eight-scale profile score from the following eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and general mental health (psychological distress and psychological well being). In addition, two composites scores are constructed using factorial modeling, one from physical health composite score (PCS) and one for mental health composite score (MCS).</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcomes. It contains questions in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and provides a simple descriptive profile and single index for health status preference. In addition, there is a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is the participant's rating of their health on a scale of 0 &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; to 100 &quot;best imaginable health state&quot;.</description>
