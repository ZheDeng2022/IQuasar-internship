      Thirty-two (32) eligible healthy subjects between ages of 18-50 years old will be enrolled&#xD;
      and randomized to either Sequence 1 (fed to fasted state) versus Sequence 2 (fasted to fed&#xD;
      state) at a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Capable of giving informed consent and complying with trial procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 years, inclusive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Considered healthy by the Investigator based on a detailed medical history, full&#xD;
             physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Nonsmoker, defined as not having smoked or used any form of tobacco for at least 6&#xD;
             months before Screening based on subject report;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body mass index (BMI) of 19 to 30 kg/m2 inclusive and body weight &gt;/= 50 kg;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to adhere to trial procedures and to be confined at the clinical&#xD;
             research unit (CRU).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All female subjects (childbearing potential and non-childbearing potential) must have&#xD;
             a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening. In addition, female subjects must&#xD;
             meet 1 of the following 3 conditions: (a) postmenopausal for at least 12 months&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause, (ii) surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal occlusion) based on subject&#xD;
             report, or (iii) if of childbearing potential and heterosexually active, practicing or&#xD;
             agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception. Highly effective methods&#xD;
             of birth control include an intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing&#xD;
             system (IUS), and contraceptives (oral, skin patches, or implanted or injectable&#xD;
             products) using combined or progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
             inhibition of ovulation. A vasectomized male partner is an acceptable birth control&#xD;
             method if the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the female subject&#xD;
             and the vasectomized partner has received medical confirmation of surgical success.&#xD;
             Highly effective methods of birth control must be used for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             study drug dosing, through the end of study (EOS) visit or early termination, and for&#xD;
             a minimum of 1 month after the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of&#xD;
             pregnancy. Sexually active, fertile, male subjects must be willing to use acceptable&#xD;
             contraception methods (such as double-barrier methods of a combination of male condom&#xD;
             with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide) from the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug through the EOS visit or early termination, and for a minimum of 1 month after&#xD;
             the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinically significant past medical history of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             musculoskeletal, endocrine, hematologic, psychiatric (including life-long history of&#xD;
             depression and/or anxiety), renal, hepatic, bronchopulmonary, neurologic, immunologic,&#xD;
             ophthalmological, or lipid metabolism disorders; or drug hypersensitivity; or any&#xD;
             condition that in the judgement of the Investigator will affect the trial results or&#xD;
             the subject's safety;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of suicide attempt in the past 12 months and/or seen by the Investigator as&#xD;
             having a significant history of risk of suicide or homicide;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History or presence of malignancy other than adequately treated and cured basal cell&#xD;
             skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, or in-situ cervical cancer, within 5 years&#xD;
             prior to screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically relevant illness within 1 month prior to Screening or at Screening that may&#xD;
             interfere with the conduct of this trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medically uncontrolled high blood pressure with mean systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg&#xD;
             or mean diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg at Screening after 3 measurements (after at&#xD;
             least 5 minutes of rest in a seated position);&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) or a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc&#xD;
             interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;450 ms);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Positive blood screen for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody;&#xD;

             precursor venlafaxine;&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Participation in a previous clinical trial of either LY03005 or ODV or medicines&#xD;
             containing ODV or its precursor, venlafaxine, within 30 days prior to Screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Unwillingness or inability to comply with food and beverage restrictions during trial&#xD;
             participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Donation of blood of more than 1 unit (approximate 450 mL) or blood products or acute&#xD;
             loss of blood during the 90 days prior to Screening;&#xD;
