  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ballistocardiography (BCG) and the seismocardiography (SCG) are old techniques recording&#xD;
      the vibrations at the skin level generated by the acceleration and displacement of the blood&#xD;
      and cardiac mass at each cardiac contraction. The former records the acceleration near the&#xD;
      subject's center of mass, the latter at the local chest wall. So far, the unclear&#xD;
      physiological origin of those acceleration signals has led to important ambiguities in their&#xD;
      scientific and clinical interpretation. Therefore, several ongoing studies would aim to&#xD;
      highlight the physiological genesis of those acceleration-induced signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the main objective of this study is to correlate the BCG and SCG signals recorded at&#xD;
      the body surface with several haemodynamic parameters recorded invasively during a cardiac&#xD;
      catheterisation, pulmonary pressure, wedge pressure, cardiac output to cite a few.&#xD;

      Patients suffering from severe heart failure regardless of the etiology will undergo a&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization as required by their medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCG and BCG signals will be recorded simultaneously to the catheterization by the mean of&#xD;
      an unintrusive and friendly device consisting of two houses, the first one placed on sternum&#xD;
      and the second one in the lumbar column. The device will record a continuous tracing&#xD;
      synchronized with the intracavitary pressure profiles recorded during the invasive procedure.&#xD;

The signal will be transferred to a tablet by Bluetooth and tracings will be analysed automatically with Matlab. The SCG+BCG signals are synchronized to the intracardiac pressure tracings in order to allow a comparative interpretation between the two tracings.</description>

        Patients suffering from heart failure and undergoing a planned cardiac catheterization as&#xD;
        required by their medical condition will be asked to participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria include heart failure regardless of its etiology. Patients with a&#xD;
        left ventricle assistance device will not be enrolled because the high-frequency&#xD;
        accelerations generated by the mechanical device and transmitted to the skin level will&#xD;
        likely hamper the ballisto- and seismocardiographic signal.&#xD;
