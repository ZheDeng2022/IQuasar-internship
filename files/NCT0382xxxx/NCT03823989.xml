  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, open-label, single-arm, prospective study, in which up to 18&#xD;
      adult patients requiring radiotherapy for metastatic disease or for an inoperable primary&#xD;
      tumor with no definitive curative treatment option, will undergo a combination treatment of&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) delivered PROMITIL and standard of care radiotherapy. The treatment&#xD;
      regimen will involve administration of two PROMITIL doses, delivered at a 21-day interval,&#xD;
      and a course of EBR (type of RT according to investigator's preference), initiated 1-3 days&#xD;
      after the first PROMITIL dose and completed within a 2-week period. EBR will consist of no&#xD;
      more than 10 fractions delivered within 2 weeks as conventionally fractionated RT, or SBRT.&#xD;
      Treatment safety will be assessed on a weekly basis throughout the two 21-day treatment&#xD;
      courses (42 days) and throughout the follow-up period (up to Day 127). AEs will only be&#xD;
      logged until 6 weeks after the last PROMITIL dose (up until Day 64). Disease status will be&#xD;
      reevaluated between days 43-50 of the study, and every 6 weeks thereafter (Days 85 and 127±7&#xD;
      days). In addition, following completion of the treatment schedule, all patients will be&#xD;
      followed up by phone every 12 weeks, until either death, disease progression (PD), withdrawn&#xD;
      consent or trial cut-off date, i.e., for up to 2 years after patient accrual to study,&#xD;
      (whichever occurs first). The following anticancer agents will NOT be allowed during the&#xD;
      screening period, 6-week treatment period and until first disease reevaluation: cytotoxic&#xD;
      agents, non-cytotoxic myelosuppressive agents (CDK 4/6 inibitiors, PARP inhibitors, m-TORS&#xD;
      inhibitors and tyrosine kinase-inhibitors). Treatment with hormonal agents, monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (anti-EGFr, anti-Her2, anti-VEGF and VEGFr, anti-PD1, anti-PDL1) and&#xD;
      bisphosphonates can be continued during the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As combination with radiotherapy is expected to provide an additive or synergistic effect,&#xD;
      the current dose-escalation study will begin with a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, to be followed by an&#xD;
      increase (1.5 mg/kg) in Cohort 2 and a further increase 1.8 mg/kg in Cohort 3 in the absence&#xD;
      of DLTs after two treatment cycles, with an interluding 10-fraction course of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROMITIL will be intravenously delivered on Day 1 of each of the two 21-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: The first 6 patients recruited to the study will receive 1.25 mg/kg PROMITIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are recorded by day 43 of the study, the&#xD;
      second cohort of 6 patients will begin treatment at a dose level of 1.5 mg/kg PROMITIL.&#xD;
      However, if 1 DLT is recorded, the second cohort of 6 patients will receive the same dose of&#xD;
      1.25 mg/kg PROMITIL. If 2 DLTs are recorded in Cohort 1, the second cohort of 6 patients will&#xD;
      receive 1.0 mg/kg PROMITIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are recorded by day 43 of the study of the&#xD;
      first 3 patients of Cohort 2, a third cohort will enroll 6 patients to receive treatment at a&#xD;
      dose level of 1.8 mg/kg PROMITIL. If none or 1 DLT is recorded, the dose of 1.8 mg/kg will be&#xD;
      cleared as recommended dose for phase 2. If 2 DLT are recorded, the study will be terminated&#xD;
      as soon as the 2nd DLT is recorded, and the prior dose level of 1.5 mg/kg will be cleared as&#xD;
      recommended dose for phase 2&#xD;
