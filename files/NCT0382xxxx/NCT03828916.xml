  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate both the safety and efficacy of using the&#xD;
      NuShield® allograft in addition to standard of care surgical procedures in subjects requiring&#xD;
      surgical repair of the peroneal tendon. The effects of this treatment will be assessed using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visual Analog Scale Foot and Ankle (VAS FA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FAAM Sport&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PROMIS Global Health SF&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tegner Activity Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Foot and Ankle Outcomes Instrument (Q1, Q2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swelling assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound imaging for tendon thickness, gliding and adhesion formation&#xD;
