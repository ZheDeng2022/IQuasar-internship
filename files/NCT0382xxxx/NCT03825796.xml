    <textblock>
      This trial evaluates how well CPX-351 and enasidenib work in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia characterized by IHD2 mutation. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CPX-351,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Enasidenib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving CPX-351&#xD;
      and enasidenib may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia, compared to&#xD;
      giving only one of these therapies alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the remission rate (defined as complete remission [CR]/ CR with incomplete&#xD;
      hematologic recovery [CRi]) of the combination of liposome-encapsulated&#xD;
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) plus enasidenib mesylate (enasidenib) in adults with&#xD;
      relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by a 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) producing&#xD;
      IDH2 mutations that include IDH2^R172 and IDH2^R140.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate persistent severe hematologic toxicity at induction day 60 in patients with a&#xD;
      morphologic leukemia-free state (bone marrow blasts &lt; 5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate delayed CR/CRi with enasidenib maintenance in participants with stable&#xD;
      disease after induction with CPX-351.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the rate of CR plus complete remission with partial hematologic recovery&#xD;
      (CRp) of the combination of CPX-351 plus enasidenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate time to return of normal hematopoiesis after induction therapy. V. To&#xD;
      evaluate 30- and 60-day survival. VI. To evaluate CPX-351 plus enasidenib as a bridge to&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the co-existing mutations that are present with the IDH2 mutation and&#xD;
      describe those that are present in patients who achieve CR/CRi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the depth of molecular response to induction by minimal residual disease&#xD;
      (MRD) using next generation sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the subclinical cardiotoxicity of CPX-351 as measured by troponin I,&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, and enasidenib mesylate orally (PO) on days 10-60 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients whose bone marrow is not&#xD;
      hypoplastic receive re-induction including liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine IV&#xD;
      on days 1 and 3, and enasidenib mesylate PO on days 8-60 in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Participants who achieve CR/CRi may proceed directly to allogeneic HSCT or&#xD;
      receive up to 4 cycles of consolidation. Patients &lt; 60 years receive cytarabine twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) on days 1, 3, and 5, and patients &gt;= 60 years receive cytarabine IV once daily on days&#xD;
      1-5. Patients also receive enasidenib mesylate PO on days 6-55. Treatment repeats every 28-55&#xD;
      days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who maintain CR/CRi after completion of consolidation therapy undergo allogeneic&#xD;
      HSCT at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Participants who have stable disease (not meeting criteria for progressive&#xD;
      disease, but also not achieving CR/CRi) at day 60 receive enasidenib mesylate PO daily in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Routine follow-up visits will be&#xD;
      conducted at least once every 3 months for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
