      Non-invasive imaging of tumor PD-L1 expression with 89Zr-labeled durvalumab PET/CT predicts&#xD;
      response to durvalumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The programmed death 1 (PD1)/ programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway plays an important&#xD;
      role in regulating the T-cell anti tumor response. Blocking this interaction with the anti&#xD;
      PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab has proven to be effective resulting in durable disease&#xD;
      control rates. Currently, PD-L1 expression as determined by immune histochemistry (IH) is the&#xD;
      best available biomarker for treatment response, but standardized scoring criteria are&#xD;
      lacking and the risk for sampling errors exists. Molecular imaging using 89Zr-labeled&#xD;
      antibodies may overcome these limitations, enabling the visualization of PD-L1 expression in&#xD;
      primary and metastatic tumor lesions and providing information on the in vivo accessibility&#xD;
      of the PD-L1 target following intravenous administration. Besides, a baseline FDG-PET scan&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;

                  1) from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such precautions&#xD;

                  receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90&#xD;
                  days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Not engaging in&#xD;
                  sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the&#xD;
                  rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception. Male patients should refrain from sperm donation throughout this&#xD;
                  period.&#xD;
