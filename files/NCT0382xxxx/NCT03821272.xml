  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of giving seven injections&#xD;
      of PepCan or placebo over approximately a 24-month period in subjects with head and neck&#xD;
      cancers who achieved remission. PepCan may prove to be beneficial in treating many stages of&#xD;
      HPV-related malignancies starting from infection to cancer. Safety, efficacy in terms of&#xD;
      reduced cancer recurrence, immunological responses and profiles, and gut microbiome changes&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an HPV therapeutic vaccine&#xD;
      called PepCan (HPV-16 E6 peptides) in adults over a two (2) year period. Each subject will be&#xD;
      receiving a total of 7 injections of PepCan (50 µg per peptide dose) or placebo (saline) at a&#xD;
      3:1 ratio in a randomized double-blinded design. Subjects will receive one injection every 3&#xD;
      weeks until they receive 4 injections. Then, subjects will receive one injection every 3&#xD;
      months until they receive a total of 7 injections. Subjects will have 2 more visits&#xD;
      approximately 6 months apart after the last injection. Immunological assessment by&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay will be made at 4 time points (Visits 1, 5, 8, and&#xD;
      9), and by fluorescent activated cell sorter analysis will be made at times points at Visits&#xD;
      1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Oral wash samples and stool samples will be collected at the&#xD;
      Screening Visit, Visit 5, Visit 7 and Visit 8 for microbiome diversity analysis.&#xD;
