    <description>Percentage change from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 16. The EASI score assesses the extent of disease at four body sites and measures four clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenification, each on a scale of zero to three. The EASI score confers a maximum of 72 and evaluates two dimensions of Atopic Dermatitis (AD): disease extent and clinical signs. The suggested severity strata for the EASI are as follows: 0 = clear; 0.1-1.0 = almost clear; 1.1-7.0 = mild; 7.1-21.0 = moderate; 21.1-50.0 = severe; 50.1-72.0 = very severe.&#xD;
Restricted maximum likelihood(REML)-based Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) including fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit, and Asian/Non-Asian (yes/no) as well as the treatment-by-visit interaction, and continuous, fixed covariates of baseline endpoint and baseline-by-visit interaction.

    <description>SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD). Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate body surface area affected by AD. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed from none=0to severe=3. Severity scores summed to B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale from 0 to 10, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.&#xD;

    <description>Number of patients achieving at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline to clear (0) or almost clear (1) in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) at Week 4 and 16. IGA score allows investigators to assess the overall disease severity at one given time point. It is a 5-point scale with: 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The overall IGA score includes the assessment of erythema, induration/papulation, lichenification, and oozing/crusting. For the first three sections the following scale will be used: &quot;None&quot;, &quot;Barely Perceptible&quot; (&quot;Minimal&quot; for lichenification), &quot;Slight but Definite&quot;, &quot;Clearly Perceptible&quot; or &quot;Marked&quot;. For oozing/crusting the available answers are &quot;None&quot; or &quot;Present.&quot;</description>
