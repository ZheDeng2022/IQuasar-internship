    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess whether it was possible to improve patients'&#xD;
      self-assessed quality of recovery and reduce the level of post-operative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      in female patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy by simple perioperative measures in&#xD;
      the form of a preoperative 200 ml nutritional drink and chewing gum during early recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomised to an active group receiving the intervention, and controls provided&#xD;
      with standard care only. Patients were followed by questionnaire interviews preoperatively&#xD;
      and at 2, 24 and 48 hours after surgery.&#xD;

      Abstract One major goal in modern perioperative anaesthesia care is to facilitate a rapid,&#xD;
      yet safe recovery process, with focus on improving time to regained consciousness and&#xD;
      subsequent resuming of activities of daily living. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and&#xD;
      gynaecological laparoscopy are a &quot;high volume&quot; procedure commonly performed in young females&#xD;
      expecting rapid resumption of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to assess whether it was possible to improve patients'&#xD;
      self-assessed quality of recovery and reduce the level of post-operative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      in female patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy by simple perioperative measures in&#xD;
      the form of a preoperative 200 ml nutritional drink and chewing gum during early recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients were randomised to an active group receiving the intervention, and controls&#xD;
      provided with standard care only. Patients were followed by questionnaire interviews&#xD;
      preoperatively and at 2, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The Quality of Recovery scale (QoR)&#xD;
      15 items and 5 additional questions around gastro-intestinal symptoms were self-assessed by&#xD;
      patients at each occasion.&#xD;
