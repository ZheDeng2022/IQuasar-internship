&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in at least 6 centers in China and at least 60 subjects who&#xD;
      provide consent for participation will be enrolled. Subjects will be considered enrolled&#xD;
      after providing consent. Subjects will be implanted with any one of the device/lead&#xD;
      combination groups outlined in Figure 1, depending on their clinical need as determined by&#xD;
      the Investigators. At least 15 subjects will be enrolled in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will have at least 15 enrolled subjects with the Ellipse VR single-chamber ICD&#xD;
           with a Durata lead in the RV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will have at least 15 enrolled subjects with the Ellipse DR dual-chamber ICD&#xD;
           with a Durata lead in the RV and a Tendril STS lead in the RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 will have at least 15 enrolled subjects with the Ellipse DR dual-chamber ICD&#xD;
           with a Optisure lead in the RV and a Isoflex lead in the RA.&#xD;

        -  Group 4 will have at least 15 enrolled subjects with a Quadra Assura MP CRT-D and an&#xD;
           Optisure or Durata lead in the RV, an Isoflex or Tendril STS lead in the RA, and a&#xD;
           Quartet lead in the LV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment group and group 4 lead pairing will be at the discretion of the Investigator,&#xD;
      dependent on patient needs in conjunction with study needs to fulfill study goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least forty-five (45) days after system implantation or after a system revision, subjects&#xD;
      will have a baseline visit followed by an MRI visit; subjects will undergo a study-related&#xD;
      MRI scan at 1.5T. Subjects will have a 1-month follow-up after the study MRI scan. The&#xD;
      minimum duration of each subject's participation is approximately 2.5 months from enrollment.&#xD;
      The expected duration of enrollment is approximately 14 months. The total duration of&#xD;
      clinical study is expected to be 16.5 months.&#xD;

        -  Have a life expectancy of less than 12 months due to any condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness evaluation method&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two effectiveness endpoints to be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of the effectiveness endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion of leads with a capture threshold increase of ≤ 0.5V at 0.5ms for RA and&#xD;
                RV leads and ≤ 1.0V at 0.5ms for LV leads from pre-MRI scan to 1-month post-MRI&#xD;
                scan testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion leads with a sensing amplitude decrease of ≤ 50% from pre-MRI scan&#xD;
                testing to 1-month post-MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Selection of method and time for evaluation, recording and analysis of the effectiveness&#xD;
           endpoints Since the objective is to evaluate the effect of MRI exposure for the ICD/&#xD;
           CRT-D device groups included in this study, the effectiveness parameters were selected&#xD;
           to compare abnormal changes in device performance from pre- to 1-month post- MRI scan.&#xD;
           The pre-MRI measurements are collected within the same day prior to the MRI scan. The&#xD;
           1-month post-MRI scan measurements are collected at 30 days post-MRI scan (within +14&#xD;
           days) to ensure any effect of the MRI exposure is captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness parameters are recorded directly from the device. The device measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained using the Merlin programmer to interrogate the device during study visits.&#xD;
      The analysis of the effectiveness parameters will be conducted on all subjects with complete&#xD;
      data from pre- to 1-month post-MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation method There is one safety primary endpoint to be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Description of the safety endpoint Freedom from MRI-scan related complications from the&#xD;
           time of the MRI scan to 1-month post-MRI scan testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Selection of method and time for evaluation, recording and analysis of the safety&#xD;
           endpoints Since the objective is to evaluate the effect of MRI exposure for the ICD/&#xD;
           CRT-D device groups included in this study, the safety parameters were selected to&#xD;
           include only MRI-scan related complications from the time of device programming for an&#xD;
           MRI scan to 1-month post-MRI scan. An independent physician CEC will adjudicate all&#xD;
           adverse device effects during this period to determine the relatedness to the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety surveillance within this study and the safety reporting, both performed by the&#xD;
      investigator, starts as soon as the subject completes the pre-MRI visit testing and the MRI&#xD;
      Settings have been programmed according to the protocol. The safety surveillance and the&#xD;
      safety reporting will continue until the last study visit has been performed, the subject is&#xD;
      deceased, the subject/investigator concludes his participation into the clinical study or the&#xD;
      subject withdrawal from the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor and/or designee will monitor the clinical study over its duration according to the&#xD;
      CIP-specific monitoring plan which will include the planned extent of source data&#xD;
      verification.&#xD;

          -  Be a Chinese national&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Will be implanted with one of the following device/lead combinations evaluated in this&#xD;
             study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 1: Ellipse VR single-chamber ICD with a Durata lead in the right ventricle&#xD;
                  (RV)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 2: Fortify Assura single-chamber ICD, with an Optisure lead&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 3: Ellipse DR dual-chamber ICD with a Durata lead in the RV and a Tendril&#xD;
                  STS lead in the right atrium (RA)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 4: Fortify Assura ICD and an Optisure lead in the RV and an Isoflex lead in&#xD;
                  the RA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing to undergo an elective MRI scan without sedation ≥ 45 days after implant&#xD;
             NOTE: Antianxiety agents (e.g. minor tranquilizers, etc.) may be used as long as the&#xD;
             patient can communicate with site personnel during the MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to provide informed consent for study participation (legal guardian or legally&#xD;
             authorized representative is NOT acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to comply with the prescribed follow-up tests and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are not contraindicated for an MRI scan (per the MRI Screening Form)&#xD;

        Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria must be excluded from the&#xD;
        clinical investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a competitor's MRI compatible endocardial lead implanted or capped&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have another existing active implanted medical device, e.g., neurostimulator, infusion&#xD;
             pump, etc. that has MR labeling that will not allow the MRI scans per this protocol to&#xD;
             be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have other non-MRI compatible device or material implanted. The following examples may&#xD;
             be included as long as labelling of these devices allow MRI scans conducted per this&#xD;
             protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  MRI compatible knee replacements, hip replacements, stents, etc.&#xD;
