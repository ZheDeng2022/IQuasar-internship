    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well rifaximin works in treating patients with monoclonal gammopathy.&#xD;
      Antibiotics, such as rifaximin, may help to kill bacteria in the intestines and reduce the&#xD;
      abnormal protein or cells in patients with monoclonal gammopathy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of a 2-week course of rifaximin on clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) in&#xD;
      patients with monoclonal gammopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability of a 2-week course of rifaximin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate changes in stool microbiota by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene&#xD;
      (16S) sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate changes in gammopathy as assessed by changes in clonal Ig and/or plasma&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive rifaximin orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) on days 1-14 in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 8 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance based on&#xD;
             International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be enrolled into one of 3 cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort A: IgA gammopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort B: IgG gammopathy / or light chain gammopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort C: IgM gammopathy / asymptomatic macroglobulinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received antibiotics within last 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents for gammopathy. Patients&#xD;
             with clinical myeloma requiring anti-myeloma therapy are also excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions or intolerance attributed to rifaximin or compounds of&#xD;

             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;

             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of rifaximin administration&#xD;
