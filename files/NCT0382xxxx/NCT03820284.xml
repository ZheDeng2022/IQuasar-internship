      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori has been linked to a variety of gastric and extra gastric diseases.&#xD;
      Chronic infection with H. pylori causes histologically evident gastritis in all colonized&#xD;
      individuals and is the predominant risk factor for gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma. However, increasingly robust experimental and epidemiological&#xD;
      evidence suggests that H. pylori may at the same time be beneficial to its carriers, as it&#xD;
      efficiently prevents allergic disorders and chronic inflammatory conditions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic, nonspecific intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation with an unexplained pathology and an alternating relapsing and remitting&#xD;
      clinical progression. IBD is divided into two subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's&#xD;
      disease (CD). Most studies in the IBD field attribute its etiology to the complex&#xD;
      interactions among immune dysfunction, genetic susceptibility of the host, and environmental&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the twenty-first century, improving hygienic conditions and socioeconomic status have&#xD;
      reduced the H. pylori infection rate and this trend has concurrently been accompanied by an&#xD;
      increased IBD incidence in most countries Numerous studies have reported a lower H. pylori&#xD;
      infection rate in patients with CD and/or UC than in non-IBD control individuals. although a&#xD;
      small number of studies showed no significant association .Recently, emerging epidemiologic&#xD;
      studies and animal experiments revealed an inverse correlation between H. pylori infection&#xD;
      and IBD onset, suggesting that H. pylori colonization exerts a special protective effect on&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      observation Cross sectional study will be conducted at assuit university hospitals on all&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory disease to detect the prevalence of helicobacter pylori among them&#xD;
      .Then the examined patients will be divided in to two group receiving the same medication&#xD;
      group A : inflammatory bowel disease patient with H.PYLORI group B: inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease Patient without H.PYLORI longitudinal study will be conducted to both group to study&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes in both group .&#xD;

      PATIENT AND METHOD :&#xD;
&#xD;
      observation Cross sectional study will be conducted at assuit university hospitals on all&#xD;
      patients with inflammatory disease to detect the prevalence of helicobacter pylori among them&#xD;
      .Then the examined patients will be divided in to two group receiving the same medication&#xD;
      group A : inflammatory bowel disease patient with H.PYLORI group B: inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease Patient without H.PYLORI longitudinal study will be conducted to both group to study&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes in both group .&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Thorough medical history and full clinical examination will be taken from all patient&#xD;
           including&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Personal history focus on special habit especially smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
           -documented previous history for H.pylori eradication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Onset and duration of inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  current medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  presence of any extra intestinal manifestation of Inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  presence of any complications from Inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigation :&#xD;
&#xD;
           -All patients with inflammatory bowel disease will be tested for presence or absence of&#xD;
           H.PYLORI by histological examination of endoscopically biopsied gastric mucosa&#xD;
&#xD;
           -his to logical examination of colonic mucosal every 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
           -complete blood count&#xD;
&#xD;
           -serum albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
           -c reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).&#xD;
&#xD;
           -fecal calprotectin if possible&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assess the severity of among both group (A,B) every 3 month for 2years. ulcerative&#xD;
                by Mayo Score/Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index and Crohn's disease by&#xD;
                Montreal classifications for Crohn's Disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mayo Score/Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Stool frequency 0 = Normal 1 = 1-2&#xD;
           stools/day more than normal 2 = 3-4 stools/day more than normal 3 = 4 stools/day more&#xD;
           than normal Rectal bleeding 0 = None 1 = Visible blood with stool less than half the&#xD;
           time 2 = Visible blood with stool half of the time or more 3 = Passing blood alone&#xD;
           Mucosal appearance at endoscopy 0 = Normal or inactive disease 1 = Mild disease&#xD;
           (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability) 2 = Moderate disease (marked&#xD;
           erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions) 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous&#xD;
           bleeding, ulceration) Physician rating of disease activity 0 = Normal 1 = Mild 2 =&#xD;
           Moderate 3 = Severe&#xD;
