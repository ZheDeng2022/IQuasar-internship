    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Domiciliary care- Activities&#xD;
      of Daily Living program on activities of daily living (ADL), motor, cognition, perception,&#xD;
      sensory, quality of life, and depression for patients with stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Administering ADL and recovery of ADL functions are the primary efficacy indicators in&#xD;
      long-term care and the main treatment goals in rehabilitation for patients with stroke.&#xD;
      Residential rehabilitation is a direct way to observe patients' living environment and&#xD;
      provides feasible ADL treatment plans for patients with stroke living at home or in the&#xD;
      community. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Domiciliary care-&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living program on activities of daily living, motor, cognition,&#xD;
      perception, sensory, quality of life, and depression. The eligible participants were&#xD;
      recruited and assigned into two groups: ADL home program and control group who received&#xD;
      traditional rehabilitation in hospital. The primary outcome measures were the Canadian&#xD;
      Occupational Performance Measure, the Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales, the Frenchay&#xD;
      Activities Index, and ADL domain of the Stroke Impact Scale. The secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Test of Visual&#xD;
      Perceptual Skills-Third Edition, and the Center of Epidemiological Study-Depression.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure assesses occupational performance. The total score ranges from 1-10. A higher score indicates better occupational performance. Changes of occupational performance will be assessed at the 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index-based Supplementary Scales assesses basic activities of daily living. The total score range from 0-58. A higher score indicates better basic activities of daily living. Changes of basic activities of daily living will be assessed at the 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Frenchay Activities Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Frenchay Activities Index assesses instrumental activities of daily living. The total score range from 0-45. A higher score indicates better instrumental activities of daily living. Changes of instrumental activities of daily living will be assessed at the 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the ADL domain of the Stroke Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ADL domain of the Stroke Impact Scale assess difficulty in performing activities of daily living. The domain score range from 10-50. A higher score indicates less difficulty in performing activities of daily living. Changes of difficulty in performing activities of daily living will be assessed at the 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment assesses ability of motor control. The total score range from 0-226. A higher score indicates better ability of motor control. Changes of ability of motor control will be assessed at the 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Mini Mental State Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination assesses general cognitive ability. The total score range from 0-30. A higher score indicates better general cognitive ability. Changes of general cognitive ability will be assessed at the 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Test of Visual Perceptual Skills-Third Edition</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Test of Visual Perceptual Skills-Third Edition assesses visual perception. The total score range from 0-112. A higher score indicates better visual perception. Changes of visual perception will be assessed at the 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Center of Epidemiological Study-Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Center of Epidemiological Study-Depression assesses depression conditions. The total score range from 0-60. A higher score indicates more serious depression conditions. Changes of depression conditions will be assessed at the 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.</description>
