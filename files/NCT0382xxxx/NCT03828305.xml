  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) is a health emergency with high mortality.&#xD;
      Mortality could depends on the start time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuvers&#xD;
      (and the quality of its performance) and the use of the automated external defibrillator&#xD;
      (AED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods / design The aim of the study is to determine the effectiveness of a network of&#xD;
      volunteers automatically activated by smartwatch and smartphone, on the reduction of the&#xD;
      start time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers. It is developed in four phases: 1)&#xD;
      validation of an application (App) for smartwatch developed to automatically generate a&#xD;
      health alert in case of out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest (OHCA); 2) training course&#xD;
      in basic CPR maneuvers and use of the AED aimed at the civilian population; 3) creation of a&#xD;
      network of volunteers trained in CPR and using the AED that covers the city; 4) simulation&#xD;
      study in which members of the network of volunteers will be activated automatically through&#xD;
      their smartphone to attend simulated OHCA. 134 activations of the alert will be made. On 67&#xD;
      occasions the alert will be directed to the emergency health services and to the network of&#xD;
      volunteers (intervention group). On 67 occasions the alert will be directed to the emergency&#xD;
      health services (control group). The arrival time of the first rescuer, category of the first&#xD;
      rescuer (emergency services or network of volunteers), start time of the maneuvers and&#xD;
      competence in the performance of the maneuvers will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion Training in CPR maneuvers is recommended for the civilian population and&#xD;
      especially for relatives and close persons of people with heart disease to reduce the start&#xD;
      time of CPR and improve survival rates due to CRA. This study aims to observe that the start&#xD;
      time of CPR maneuvers and use of the AED will be lower in the intervention group than in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

      Methods/design Study aim This clinical trial aims to determine the effectiveness of a network&#xD;
      of volunteers trained in CPR maneuvers and using the AED connected through an application&#xD;
      (App) for smartwatch, which allows automatic activation in case of out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory arrest (OHCA), on the start time of the CPR maneuvers and use of the AED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in 4 phases. 1) validate an App for smartwatch that allows the&#xD;
      automatic activation of a network of volunteers trained in CPR maneuvers and use of the AED&#xD;
      (Network-CPR) and the emergency services, in case the user of the smartwatch suffers a OHCA;&#xD;
      2) training in basic CPR and use of the AED in the general population; 3) creating a network&#xD;
      of volunteers from the subjects trained (Network-CPR); 4) determine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      automatic activation of the Network-CPR through an app for smartwatch on the start time of&#xD;
      the CPR maneuvers and use of the AED; and to evaluate the competences in the performance of&#xD;
      the maneuvers by the members of the Network-CPR through simulations in the city streets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the mobile app An App was developed in the Android operating system for&#xD;
      smartwatch, an App for mobile smartphones with Android operating systems, and a platform to&#xD;
      install in the central computer of the Primary Care Emergency Center (PCEC). In case of&#xD;
      detecting an absence of the heart rate (&gt;3 seconds without heartbeat) and falling down to the&#xD;
      ground of the smartwatch carrier, the application will send an alert in the first place to&#xD;
      the smartwatch, if it is a false positive the smartwatch carrier will deactivate it. If it is&#xD;
      a real alert and after 6 seconds the smartwatch carrier does not deactivate it, a warning&#xD;
      alert will be generated and sent automatically to an App installed on the smartphones of the&#xD;
      members of the Network-CPR (limited to members that are within a radius of 300 meters where&#xD;
      the warning alert was generated), and at the same time will also reach a platform installed&#xD;
      in the central computer of the PCEC. The members of the Network-CPR will receive on their&#xD;
      smartphone the signal with the geolocation of the CRA, the map with the fastest route to&#xD;
      reach the location of the CRA and the point where the nearest AED is located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. Validation of the App. This validation will be done through the determination of&#xD;
      automatic activations in various locations in the city, it will be determined if the alert&#xD;
      reach the members of the Network-CPR and the PCEC and if it is geolocated in a precise way .&#xD;
      In addition, during 3 months, four volunteers with high risk of CRA will carry the smartwatch&#xD;
      and it will be determined if false activations (false positives) occur during this period of&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 and 3. Training and creation of the Network-CPR that will cover the city. This&#xD;
      network will be created with certain population groups that are routinely in contact with&#xD;
      susceptible persons of OHCA (police, firemen, teaching staff, health personnel, merchants,&#xD;
      pharmacists, university students, gym monitors, etc.), in addition, relatives of people with&#xD;
      heart disease will be included. In the case of elderly people who are alone, they will&#xD;
      include their neighbors or caregivers. In the city, there are 2,105 people with heart disease&#xD;
      susceptible to OHCA. The research team and the health personnel of the participating primary&#xD;
      care centers (PCC) will offer training courses on basic CPR maneuvers and use of the AED,&#xD;
      following the protocol of the Center Català de Ressucitació (CCR) [14]. The training is aimed&#xD;
      at training 430 people (20% of the relatives of people with heart disease) and will be made&#xD;
      by trainers accredited by the CCR. There will be a total of 30 sessions with groups of&#xD;
      approximately 15 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the training courses, the research team will explain the project and offer&#xD;
      voluntary participation in the Network-CPR. Recruitment of 100 participants (25% of the&#xD;
      trained participants) is expected. This participation implies having a qualification of&#xD;
      suitable, based on the evaluation of the competences during the course; being over 18 years;&#xD;
      have a smartphone with Android operating system; the signing of the informed consent&#xD;
      document; and the installation of the App receiving the alerts on the smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4. Simulation study. A total of 134 simulations will be carried out with simulated CRA&#xD;
      warnings alerts in the city. On 67 times, the alerts will reach the Network-CPR and the&#xD;
      emergency services (intervention group) and 67 times only the emergency services(control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The warnings alerts will be generated in 134 locations randomly, based on the locations where&#xD;
      a CRA was notified to the emergency services during the year 2017 (51 locations). The&#xD;
      intervention group will be activated through generated alerts that will arrive through the&#xD;
      App for smartphones of the members of the Network-CPR that are in a radius of 300 meters; and&#xD;
      through the platform installed in the PCEC central computer to the emergency services. The&#xD;
      control group will be activated by telephone calls to the PCEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simulations will be carried out during two periods (morning and afternoon). During the&#xD;
      time of the simulations a medical doctor and an emergency nurse (PCEC team) will be in the&#xD;
      PCEC, to be activated, go to the locations and perform the simulations. The PCEC team will&#xD;
      not know in which simulations they are activated or in which the Network-CPR is activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the locations you will find two trained and standardized health personnel (victim team:&#xD;
      medical doctor or an emergency nurse and a trainer accredited by the CCR), duly identified,&#xD;
      with a CPR mannequin and a practice AED.&#xD;
