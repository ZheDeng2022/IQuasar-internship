      Akari clinical trials and who wish to continue to receive rVA576 (Coversin) after their&#xD;
      active participation in the parent trial has completed and patients treated under&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The early termination of this study is a business decision, Akari have made the decision to&#xD;
    close their global Phase III PNH program. The decision was not related to any efficacy, safety&#xD;
    or clinical concerns regarding Coversin/rVA576.&#xD;

             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. In the opinion of the treating responsible clinician patient is receiving clinical&#xD;
