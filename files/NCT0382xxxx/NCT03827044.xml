    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if dMMR and/or POLE exonuclease domain mutant stage&#xD;
      III colon cancer patients gain clinical benefit (i.e. improvement in disease free and overall&#xD;
      survival) from PD-L1 inhibitors after standard fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. This removes the&#xD;
      suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumour CD8+ T cells, resulting in the restoration of&#xD;
      cytotoxic T cell response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of giving Avelumab after standard adjuvant chemotherapy to this well-defined,&#xD;
      molecularly-selected, group is based on the fact that dMMR and POLE exonuclease domain mutant&#xD;
      CRCs have a highly and ultra-mutated genetic profile, respectively, thus leading to a high&#xD;
      number of neo-antigens with associated over expression of immune checkpoint related proteins.&#xD;
      This profile is expected to be highly responsive to checkpoint inhibition as suggested by&#xD;
      data of PD-1 inhibitors in dMMR/MSI-H metastatic CRCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study meets the primary endpoint, using Avelumab in the adjuvant setting following&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy would become the standard of care for patients with dMMR and/or POLE&#xD;
      exonuclease domain mutant colon cancers. Furthermore, given the availability of molecular&#xD;
      markers for patient selection, funders of healthcare would be more likely to fund this&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also provides a unique opportunity to conduct translational research analyses on&#xD;
      pre- and post-treatment tumour tissue samples and blood samples from dMMR or POLE mutant CRC&#xD;
      patients treated with the checkpoint inhibitor Avelumab.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, phase III trial comparing standard&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine based adjuvant chemotherapy followed by Avelumab (experimental arm) with&#xD;
      standard fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm) in patients who&#xD;
      have undergone radical surgical resection for stage III dMMR or POLE exonuclease domain&#xD;
      mutant colon cancer. Patients will be stratified in a 1:1 ratio for dMMR status, POLE&#xD;
      mutation and type of adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., 24 weeks of single agent capecitabine&#xD;
      chemotherapy versus 12 weeks of CAPOX chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the statistical design, 402 patients (201 per arm) are to be randomised. It is&#xD;
      expected that approximately 4000 participants will need to be screened in order to recruit&#xD;
      402 patients to the study, assuming an incidence of dMMR of 10-15% and an incidence of POLE&#xD;
      mutations of 7% in under 50s (unpublished data from Tomlinson group). Considering the time&#xD;
      required to obtain local approval and to initiate all participating centres, the study is&#xD;
      expected to take up to 36 months to complete accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no proscriptive criteria for surgical resection of the primary tumour in this&#xD;
      trial. It is however expected that resection of the tumour will be undertaken in the elective&#xD;
      setting by a colorectal specialist surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour MMR status will be routinely tested locally as per NICE guidelines (either in the&#xD;
      pre-operative biopsy or resection specimen). Subjects whose tumours are dMMR can sign the&#xD;
      main study consent and undergo the study screening procedures. If they are found to fulfil&#xD;
      all eligibility criteria, then they will be randomised. Subjects who are below 50 and whose&#xD;
      tumours are pMMR, will be asked to sign a prescreening consent for the centralised analysis&#xD;
      of POLE exonuclease domain mutations. This will be done at Oxford Molecular Diagnostics&#xD;
      Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford. Those who have tumours harbouring these&#xD;
      mutations can sign the main study consent and undergo the study screening procedures. If they&#xD;
      are found to fulfil all eligibility criteria, then they will be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients who are randomised will receive standard fluoropyrimidine-based&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy for 12 or 24 weeks depending on the decision of the local investigator.&#xD;
      The choice of adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., 24 weeks of single agent fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
      chemotherapy or 12 weeks of doublet, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy) must be declared by the&#xD;
      investigator at study entry before randomisation. Type of adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., 24&#xD;
      weeks of single agent capecitabine or 12 weeks of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin). will be&#xD;
      used as stratification factor alongside MMR status and POLE mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of adjuvant chemotherapy, patients who are randomised to the investigational arm,&#xD;
      will receive additional 24 weeks of treatment with Avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of treatment, all subjects will be followed up for up to 7 years from the&#xD;
      start of adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative biomarker analyses will be conducted as part of the translational study in tumour&#xD;
      tissue samples from the resection specimens, tumour tissue samples from the relapsed tumour&#xD;
      (if applicable, feasible and upon patient consent) and serial blood samples collected at&#xD;
      study entry, during adjuvant treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
