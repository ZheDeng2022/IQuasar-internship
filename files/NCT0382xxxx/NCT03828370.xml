      The smart phone application (B-SMART) to be developed in this research project for family&#xD;
      members of DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) offenders and offenders themselves will extend the&#xD;
      impact of the Ignition Interlock Device (IID) and help DWI offenders and their families avoid&#xD;
      drunk driving once the IID is removed from their automobiles. As such, the public health&#xD;
      consequences of DWI, in terms of health, morbidity and mortality, and its economic and&#xD;
      societal consequences, will be positively influenced by a highly accessible and diffusible&#xD;
      intervention. The proposed Phase II project will complete the development and programming of&#xD;
      the B-SMART smartphone web app and test its impact in a randomized efficacy trial with&#xD;
      first-time DWI offenders and their concerned family members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Driving while intoxicated (DWI) remains a substantial and preventable source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in the United States. A variety of sanctions and interventions have been attempted&#xD;
      to reduce DWI in the U.S., including enhanced DWI enforcement efforts, stricter drunk driving&#xD;
      laws, responsible alcohol beverage service training, and alcohol treatment. The Ignition&#xD;
      Interlock Device (IID), which requires a driver to blow into a breathalyzer unit installed in&#xD;
      an automobile to establish sobriety, reduces drunk driving while installed. The use of IIDs&#xD;
      has become widespread: most states in the U.S. now require convicted drunk drivers to install&#xD;
      an IID in their cars upon some form of conviction. However, research has conclusively shown&#xD;
      that once the IIDs are removed from DWI offenders' cars, DWI recidivism levels return to&#xD;
      those comparable to offenders who did not have an IID. Interventions are needed to increase&#xD;
      the likelihood that the effectiveness of IIDs persists beyond the installation period. The&#xD;
      Brief Family-Involved Treatment (B-FIT) is a promising intervention to improve DWI recidivism&#xD;
      by affecting the social environment of DWI offenders. Proposed here is Phase II research, a&#xD;
      continuation of the original Phase I project, that will complete the translation of B-FIT&#xD;
      into the B-SMART mobile web app for smartphones. The content of the intervention will be&#xD;
      based on empirically-validated couples therapy for those with alcohol use disorders developed&#xD;
      by Co-Investigator McCrady, translated to a smartphone platform. Phase II of this project&#xD;
      will involve the systematic completion of B-SMART, employing: 1) an Expert Advisory Board,&#xD;
      and 2) iterative development, multimedia and usability focus groups, and interviews comprised&#xD;
      of CFM and DWI offenders. B-SMART will be fully produced for DWI offenders and their&#xD;
      concerned family members (CFM) and then tested in a randomized controlled efficacy trial with&#xD;
      first-time DWI offenders (n=150) and their CFMs (n=150) recruited from the Santa Fe County&#xD;
      DWI Program. Unique to this intervention are the involvement of family members in supporting&#xD;
      the DWI offender to not drink and drive and the use of smartphone technology to make that&#xD;
      support immediate, accessible, and diffusible. B-SMART will involve the CFMs by providing&#xD;
      coping skills, communication skills, and strategies to help avoid DWI. The randomized&#xD;
      efficacy trial of B-SMART will examine B-SMART's impact on a variety of alcohol-related&#xD;
      dependent variables, including IID lockout events, alcohol use, and family functioning.&#xD;
      Should B-SMART be demonstrated to impact DWI offenders and their family members by reducing&#xD;
      IID Lockout Events (which predict future DWI recidivism) and alcohol use, and improving&#xD;
      family functioning, DWI offenders, their families, and their communities will have an&#xD;
      important, effective, accessible tool to further reduce the social, health and economic&#xD;
      consequences of DWI.&#xD;

    <description>The B-SMART mobile web app will contain four modules: 1) Supporting Abstinence, 2) Shared Positive Activities, 3) Common Challenges for Family Members with IID, and 4) Effective Communication. Within each module there will be a series of learning activities, including presentation text, interactive engagement, and videos. All app content will be available in both English and Spanish, based on user language preference.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the usual and customary care (UC) group will receive a website with a pamphlet on the IID installed in their vehicle and the manufacturer information provided about the IID in PDF format, in both English and Spanish. This constitutes a UC group, as such pamphlets are widely available to DWI offenders who have IIDs installed in their vehicles. Thus, providing this pamphlet represents a standard information provision for first-time DWI offenders and their CFMs.</description>
