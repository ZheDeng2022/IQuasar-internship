    <textblock>
      This study investigates a possible fibrinolytic effect of sequential compression devices&#xD;
      (SCDs). These devices have been used for decades to reduce risk of deep venous thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT). However, a randomized study in plastic surgery outpatients has not been done. This&#xD;
      study is undertaken to remedy that deficiency in our knowledge base.&#xD;

      Protocol: The Effect of Intraoperative Sequential Compression Devices on Fibrinolysis in&#xD;
      Plastic Surgery Outpatients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study Synopsis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a serious and potentially life-threatening surgical&#xD;
           complication. Sequential compression devices (SCDs), also called intermittent pneumatic&#xD;
           compression, are widely used by surgeons in an effort to reduce risk. In addition to a&#xD;
           possible mechanical effect, some investigators believe that these devices reduce the&#xD;
           coagulability of blood by altering the fibrinolytic balance. This investigation is meant&#xD;
           to evaluate any possible effect of these devices on fibrinolytic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The SCDs are not being investigated for a new indication. This study is meant to&#xD;
           determine whether these commonly used devices have any effect on blood coagulability.&#xD;
           This study is not intended to determine whether SCDs affect DVT rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator (ES) has conducted a literature search on this topic. There is no&#xD;
           published prospective randomized study available investigating a possible fibrinolytic&#xD;
           effect of SCDs in surgical patients. Therefore any clinical benefit remains speculative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of this device is well-recognized. The rationale for using SCDs in this study is&#xD;
           to investigate their potential effect on blood coagulability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subject Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed study is a prospective randomized study involving 50 consecutive plastic&#xD;
           surgery outpatients who consent to participate. Twenty-five patients will have&#xD;
           sequential compression devices applied and 25 patients will not be treated with these&#xD;
           devices and will serve as controls. All subjects are adults aged 18 or over undergoing&#xD;
           elective cosmetic surgery, including both men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients, men and women, are included with no exclusion criteria (that go beyond&#xD;
           exclusion criteria for elective outpatient surgery). Pregnant women are not surgical&#xD;
           candidates and are excluded (women in the reproductive age group are routinely checked&#xD;
           with a pregnancy test). There are no contraindications to SCDs among patients undergoing&#xD;
           elective outpatient plastic surgery. Patients with coagulopathies that would represent a&#xD;
           contraindication for surgery, or significant diseases (heart disease, uncontrolled&#xD;
           diabetes) are excluded. Oral contraceptive use is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of including patients who are not treated with SCDs is to have a control&#xD;
           group, which is mandatory in a randomized study. The sample size of 50 was obtained from&#xD;
           an a priori power analysis and sample size calculation to allow statistical significance&#xD;
           at an alpha value of 0.05. The use of SCDs is not a standard of care requirement. Their&#xD;
           efficacy remains controversial, with no high-level (i.e. Level 1) support.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients receive measures to reduce the risk of DVT. No muscle relaxation is used&#xD;
           during surgery to preserve the calf muscle pump. Patients ambulate immediately after&#xD;
           surgery. In addition, patients are monitored with ultrasound surveillance to ensure the&#xD;
           early detection and treatment of any DVTs that may develop postoperatively. Patients do&#xD;
           not normally receive anti-platelet therapy because of the increased risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with contraindications to the use of SCDs will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
           These conditions include suspected active or untreated DVT, pulmonary edema, congestive&#xD;
           heart failure, thrombophlebitis or an active infection, vein ligation, gangrene,&#xD;
           dermatitis, open wounds, a recent skin graft, massive edema or extreme deformity of the&#xD;
           leg, neuropathy, legs that are insensitive to pain, or when increased venous or&#xD;
           lymphatic return is undesirable. None of these conditions is present in healthy patients&#xD;
           undergoing elective cosmetic surgery, which form the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           The duration of the study is 2 months, sufficient to obtain data for 50 consecutive&#xD;
           patients. All patients are plastic surgery outpatients undergoing elective cosmetic&#xD;
           procedures. The consent discussion will take place between the principal investigator&#xD;
           and the patient. All surgery will be performed by the study author at a state-licensed&#xD;
           ambulatory surgery center, the Surgery Center of Leawood, KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients already have IV access at the time of surgery. A blood sample (2 cc) will be&#xD;
           drawn immediately before surgery and at 1-hour intervals during surgery and in the&#xD;
           recovery room. The blood samples will be analyzed at an outside laboratory for tissue&#xD;
           plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels at&#xD;
           these time points. The number of blood draws will be determined by the length of the&#xD;
           operation and time in the recovery room. The last blood sample is taken at the hourly&#xD;
           interval that immediately precedes the patient's discharge from the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will undergo ultrasound surveillance. This diagnostic test is painless,&#xD;
           noninvasive, and highly accurate for detecting DVTs. Scans are performed before surgery,&#xD;
           on the day after surgery, and 1 week after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Risk/Safety Information&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is no risk or discomfort to the patient and the amount of blood drawn is&#xD;
           minuscule. There added risks associated with SCD sleeves are very rare, such as skin&#xD;
           irritation, nerve compression, and patient falls, although the latter problem is&#xD;
           impossible because the devices are removed prior to the patient waking up from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Monitoring/Reporting of Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any adverse event will be monitored by the principal investigator and reported to&#xD;
           patients, although none is expected. The principal investigator will collect, assess,&#xD;
           and follow-up on any adverse events. Any adverse events will be reported, including to&#xD;
           the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Study Oversight&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are no foreseeable circumstances that would abort the study. The study and data&#xD;
           will be available for auditing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Data will be analyzed by a biostatistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. IRB Review/Ethics Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study meets the standard of equipoise in that there is no known benefit of SCDs in&#xD;
           preventing DVTs in plastic surgery outpatients. SCDs harmlessly compress the calves and&#xD;
           are known to be extremely safe. Each subject will receive full and adequate verbal and&#xD;
           written information. Consenting patients will read and sign the Informed Consent&#xD;
           document prior to taking part in the study and prior to surgery. Any change in the&#xD;
           protocol will be submitted for review. This study is undertaken in accordance with&#xD;
           ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are&#xD;
           consistent with Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements. This&#xD;
           study will be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
           Administration (FDA) applicable laws and IRB requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pooled data will be evaluated without any identifying information by a Ph.D.&#xD;
           biostatistician. There is no opportunity for violation of patient privacy. Blood samples&#xD;
           will only include a number (Patient 1, patient 2, etc.) and the date and time of the&#xD;
           blood draw with no patient identifying information sent to the lab (Quest Laboratories).&#xD;
           Patient information is kept within a secure location within the office of the principal&#xD;
           investigator in accordance with HIPAA requirements. No patient identification will&#xD;
           accompany any publications of the study. The data are open to inspection by any&#xD;
           regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Intended Use of the Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be evaluated to determine whether or not the null hypothesis is confirmed (i.e.&#xD;
      whether SCDs affect blood coagulability). It is expected that the study findings will be&#xD;
      published in the medical literature.&#xD;
