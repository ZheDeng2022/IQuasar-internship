  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that hyperglycemia in type 1 and type 2 diabetes is&#xD;
      associated with alterations in brain structure and cognitive impairment. People with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis related diabetes (CRFD) are exposed to hyperglycemia as seen in other forms of&#xD;
      diabetes, and cystic fibrosis is also associated with chronic systemic inflammation. Both&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and chronic inflammation have been postulated to affect brain structure and&#xD;
      function. Cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR). protein is widely&#xD;
      expressed in the neurons of the brain including in the hippocampus The hippocampus plays an&#xD;
      essential role in learning and memory processing and is thought to be particularly vulnerable&#xD;
      to effects of metabolic stressors. The expression of CFTR in neurons has several potential&#xD;
      implications for central nervous system function, including cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this project is to examine the effects of cystic fibrosis (CF) and&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) on brain structure and function.&#xD;
