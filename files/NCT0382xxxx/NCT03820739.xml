      The VAC52150EBL3005 (EBOVAC-Salone Extension) is a cohort study to evaluate the long-term&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Ebola vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN®-Filo in&#xD;
      adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad26.ZEBOV consists of the Janssen Vaccines &amp; Prevention B.V. adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)&#xD;
      vector expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola virus (EBOV) Mayinga variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVA-BN®-Filo consists of the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) - Bavarian Nordic (BN) vector&#xD;
      expressing the GPs of EBOV, Sudan virus and Marburg virus and the nucleoprotein of Tai Forest&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These candidate Ebola vaccines are being evaluated in phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies, in&#xD;
      different heterologous prime-boost regimens, in which one study vaccine is used to prime a&#xD;
      filovirus-specific immune response and the other study vaccine is used to boost the humoral&#xD;
      immune responses. The VAC52150EBL3001 study (EBOVAC-Salone, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:&#xD;
      NCT02509494) taking place in Kambia District, Northern Sierra Leone, is a phase 3 trial with&#xD;
      an open-label Stage 1 followed by a randomised double-blind controlled Stage 2. In Stage 1,&#xD;
      43 adults (aged 18 years or older) received Ad26.ZEBOV as prime followed by MVA-BN®-Filo&#xD;
      boost vaccination at day 57. In Stage 2, approximately 400 adults and 576 children (aged 1 to&#xD;
      17 years - divided into three age groups; 12 to 17 years, 4 to 11 years, and 1 to 3 years),&#xD;
      have been randomised to receive a vaccine regimen of Ad26.ZEBOV as prime and MVA-BN®-Filo as&#xD;
      boost at day 57, or control vaccination for both prime and boost vaccination. The control&#xD;
      used is a World Health Organisation (WHO)-prequalified Meningococcal Group A, C, W135 and Y&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine. EBOVAC-Salone Extension has been designed to extend the total follow-up&#xD;
      period of participants exposed to the candidate Ebola vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN®-Filo in&#xD;
      the EBOVAC-Salone study, and to follow-up infants conceived by a female participant during&#xD;
      the 3-month period following vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV or during the 28 day period&#xD;
      following vaccination with MVA-BN®-Filo in EBOVAC-Salone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the long-term safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Ebola&#xD;
      vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN®-Filo administered to adults and children in EBOVAC-Salone and&#xD;
      the long-term safety of infants conceived by a female participant during the 3-month period&#xD;
      following vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV and the 28 day period following vaccination with&#xD;
      MVA-BN®-Filo in EBOVAC-Salone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the long-term safety of Ad26.ZEBOV at a dose of 5x1010 viral particles and&#xD;
           MVA-BN®-Filo at a dose of 1x108 TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose) in African&#xD;
           adults (for 5 years) and children (for 4 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess binding antibody responses against EBOV GP, up to 5 years post-prime in adults&#xD;
           and 4 years post-prime in children using Filovirus Animal Non-Clinical Group (FANG)&#xD;
           enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety, up to their fifth birthday, in infants conceived by a female&#xD;
           participant during the 3-month period following vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV or during&#xD;
           the 28 day period following vaccination with MVA-BN®-Filo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess neutralising antibody responses directed against EBOV GP as measured by a&#xD;
           pseudovirion neutralisation assay (psVNA) at years 2, 3 and 4 post-prime in children and&#xD;
           years 3, 4 and 5 post-prime in adults, depending on sample and assay availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of previous infection with malaria, determined using validated&#xD;
           ELISA and bead based assays, on the persistence of the humoral immune response to&#xD;
           vaccination up to 5 years post-prime in adults and 4 years post-prime in children. The&#xD;
           bead based assays will allow the inclusion of antigens associated with short term&#xD;
           humoral immune responses and thus assessment of intra study exposure to malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cohort study evaluating the long-term safety and immunogenicity of the candidate&#xD;
      Ebola vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN®-Filo in participants who were exposed to these vaccines&#xD;
      in the EBOVAC-Salone trial. Cohort 1 will consist of participants who received an Ebola&#xD;
      vaccine during the EBOVAC-Salone study. Adults (defined as participants 18 years of age or&#xD;
      older at the time of the EBOVAC-Salone prime vaccination) will be followed up annually for 5&#xD;
      years from receipt of prime vaccination and children (defined as participants aged 1 to 17&#xD;
      years at the time of the EBOVAC-Salone prime vaccination) will be followed up annually for 4&#xD;
      years from the receipt of prime vaccination. Cohort 2 (offspring) will consist of infants&#xD;
      conceived by a female participant in EBOVAC-Salone during the 3 months following vaccination&#xD;
      with Ad26.ZEBOV or during the 28 days following vaccination with MVA-BN®-Filo. Offspring will&#xD;
      be followed annually for occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) until their fifth&#xD;
      birthday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No investigational vaccine will be administered during EBOVAC-Salone Extension. The study&#xD;
      will consist of an enrolment visit, a number of study visits and an end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study-related activities will be performed until a subject, or parent/guardian has given&#xD;
      informed consent for their, or their child's, participation in the study. For cohort 1,&#xD;
      enrolment into EBOVAC-Salone Extension will occur at the subject's final study visit in&#xD;
      EBOVAC-Salone once the informed consent form (ICF) has been signed. If a subject has already&#xD;
      completed their final study visit in EBOVAC-Salone, enrolment and baseline information will&#xD;
      be collected at the time the participant signs the EBOVAC-Salone Extension ICF. Information&#xD;
      from the participant's final EBOVAC-Salone study visit up to the moment of enrolment into&#xD;
      this study will be captured retrospectively. For cohort 2, enrolment will occur once the&#xD;
      subject's parent/guardian has signed the EBOVAC-Salone Extension ICF. Baseline information&#xD;
      and information from birth up to the moment of enrolment into this study will be collected at&#xD;
      the time the ICF is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will take place as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Once yearly, on the anniversary of their prime vaccination (± 1 month), cohort 1&#xD;
      participants will attend the study clinic for collection of information on any SAEs since&#xD;
      their previous visit. In a subsample of participants, blood sampling for serology assays will&#xD;
      also be collected at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Once yearly, on their birthday (± 1 month), cohort 2 participants (offspring) will&#xD;
      be seen at the study clinic) for collection of information on any SAEs they experienced since&#xD;
      their previous study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between clinic visits, reminder phone calls and/or home visits will be used for retention&#xD;
      purposes, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: subjects who received Ebola vaccine prime vaccination in EBOVAC-Salone are eligible&#xD;
      for enrolment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: any infant conceived by a female EBOVAC-Salone participant during the 3-month&#xD;
      period following vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV or during the 28 day period following&#xD;
      vaccination with MVA-BN®-Filo in EBOVAC- Salone are also eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      No investigational vaccine will be administered during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAEs occurring from the final EBOVAC-Salone study visit (or from birth for eligible&#xD;
      offspring) will be collected annually as indicated in the Time and Events Schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOGENICITY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling to assess vaccine-induced immune responses will be conducted only in cohort 1&#xD;
      in a subsample consisting of approximately 102 adults and 165 children (55 from each of the&#xD;
      three paediatric age groups that were enrolled in EBOVAC-Salone: 12-17 year olds, 4-11 year&#xD;
      olds, and 1-3 year olds). Some of the blood collected will also be used to determine previous&#xD;
      exposure to malaria using validated ELISA and bead based assay. The immune response to&#xD;
      malaria will be considered when evaluating the persistence of antibody response induced by&#xD;
      the Ebola vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both cohort 1 and cohort 2, a physical examination including vital signs will be conducted&#xD;
      at the first study visit and at yearly visits. In cohort 2, growth measurements will also be&#xD;
      collected. In cohort 1, a haematology assessment will be conducted in the subsample providing&#xD;
      immunogenicity blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be done when all participants have completed their final study&#xD;
      visit or discontinued. This analysis will include all available data up to this point. No&#xD;
      interim analyses are planned. There are no formal hypotheses tests planned for the safety&#xD;
      data. The primary endpoint for long term safety of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN®-Filo is the&#xD;
      occurrence of SAEs in the total vaccine cohort during the follow up period of up to 5 years&#xD;
      (in adults) or 4 years (in children), and separately in infants in cohort 2. The primary&#xD;
      analysis for immunogenicity will involve assessing humoral immune responses to Ad26.ZEBOV or&#xD;
      MVA-BN®-Filo using a longitudinal design in children and adults vaccinated with Ad26.ZEBOV or&#xD;
      MVA-BN®-Filo (cohort 1).&#xD;
