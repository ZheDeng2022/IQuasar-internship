  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Posterior post-operative spine wounds involving surgery at multiple levels are&#xD;
      known to have higher rates of wound complications relative to other areas of the body.&#xD;
      Instrumentation, repeat surgery and prior radiation all contribute to more hostile&#xD;
      environments for wound healing. The purpose of this study is to determine whether incisional&#xD;
      vacuum dressings can help improve the healing/complication rates associated with these&#xD;
      wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients will be recruited over a two year span as part of the initial pilot study&#xD;
      to determine the capabilities/practicality of recruitment locally. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      in and out of hospital for 3 months or until the wound has healed clinically. The primary&#xD;
      outcome, surgical site infection (SSI), will be evaluated using prior Centre for Disease&#xD;
      Control (CDC) definitions. STATA will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results: Although the incisional vacuum system (PrevenaTM) has been used&#xD;
      previously for spine wounds, there are no randomized control trials compared with standard&#xD;
      dressings. Since the infection rate in these wounds has been founds previously to be quite&#xD;
      high (10-25%) a reduction could have profound significant benefits on patient morbidity and&#xD;
      overall costs to the healthcare system. The pilot study will help inform the direction of a&#xD;
      larger, potentially multi-centered trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: If a large treatment effect is demonstrated with the PrevenaTM System then this&#xD;
      could potentially change the standard of care for complex spine wounds.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with surgical site infection (SSI) of the spine have higher morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      and higher costs of care. Hospital length of stay has been shown to be significantly longer,&#xD;
      and readmission rate significantly higher, for infected patients than that for uninfected&#xD;
      patients. Repeated surgery, typically irrigation and debridement (I&amp;D), due to deep SSI is&#xD;
      required in the majority of these patients. The risk of post-operative spinal wound infection&#xD;
      is reported to be 1-20% depending on patient factors, surgical factors and spine pathology&#xD;
      factors. The risk of SSI can be as high as 10-25% in major risk groups, such as posterior&#xD;
      surgical approach in revision lumbar surgery, thoracolumbar trauma with neurological deficit,&#xD;
      and in surgery for metastatic disease. Wound complications such as seroma or dehiscence can&#xD;
      be as high as 40% in spine oncology patients, especially if they have received radiation&#xD;
      and/or chemotherapy. Definitive management is based on etiology, clinical course, and patient&#xD;
      risk factors. A patient who develops a post-operative wound infection often requires&#xD;
      prolonged hospitalization, revision surgical procedures, and long-term intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics, which significantly increase health care resource utilization, and thus the&#xD;
      overall cost. Awareness of risk factors and development of preventive measures can lead to&#xD;
      improved outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many supplemental treatment strategies for post-operative spine infection and wound&#xD;
      complications in addition to I&amp;D. Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) of infected spine wounds has&#xD;
      proven to be an acceptable adjunct to aid in the closure or staging of complex spinal wounds.&#xD;
      The VAC system has proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of complex spinal wounds,&#xD;
      spinal SSI and wounds that are at high risk for failed primary closure. Indications for VAC&#xD;
      treatment as a means of preventing wound complications are evolving. Preemptive use of VAC&#xD;
      treatment on closed primary wounds has been employed in high risk (morbidly obese) patients&#xD;
      with acetabular fractures, and successful outcomes have been achieved. Use of VAC treatment&#xD;
      on closed wounds as a preventive measure in properly selected patients appears safe and has&#xD;
      effectively decreased wound complication rates. This mode of prophylactic treatment is called&#xD;
      &quot;incisional VAC therapy&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KCI (the manufacturer of a Vacuum Assisted Closure System) has gained FDA and Health Canada&#xD;
      approval for a specific device called &quot;Prevena™&quot;, which is designed for incisional vacuum&#xD;
      therapy. The Prevena™ System is indicated for use over clean, closed incisions that continue&#xD;
      to drain following sutured or stapled closure. It acts by removing exudate, helping hold the&#xD;
      edges of the incision together and protecting the surgical site from external contamination&#xD;
      in a clean, protected postoperative wound environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no studies have been done to establish the efficacy of the Prevena™ System for use&#xD;
      on patients requiring spine surgery to reduce wound complications such as SSI, wound&#xD;
      dehiscence, or seroma formation. A recent systematic review of published studies examining&#xD;
      the use of dressings and drains in posterior spinal surgery found no evidence to support the&#xD;
      use of any particular system. A number of recent studies have also examined the incidence of&#xD;
      surgical site infection in different high-risk populations (10-25%) and a predictive model&#xD;
      for the development of a complex post surgical wound infection. The factors identified lead&#xD;
      to considerable disability, cost and additional utilization of health care resources. If a&#xD;
      prophylactic wound treatment can decrease wound complications in high risk patients, this may&#xD;
      lead to a decreased need for post-operative services, reduced complication rate, less&#xD;
      antibiotic usage and fewer returns to the operating room. If patients can avoid&#xD;
      complications, they can resume normal activities faster and ultimately should have higher&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an era where health expenditure is literally exploding and becoming non-sustainable in&#xD;
      many countries, cost effectiveness analysis is required to responsibly manage scarce health&#xD;
      care resources. Specifically in the context of SSI, is the added cost of the Prevena™ System&#xD;
      justified by the potential decrease in wound complication rate?&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the Prevena™ System will decrease the rate of acute post-operative Surgical Site&#xD;
      Infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be randomized to receive either standard sterile wound dressing or&#xD;
      the Prevena™ System at the time of closure of the surgical wound. Consenting and&#xD;
      randomization will be performed by a member of the research team. Post-stratification&#xD;
      randomization will be performed based on the three clinical presentation groups (revision&#xD;
      surgery, metastatic tumor and trauma with deficit). This ensures that the investigators get&#xD;
      appropriate randomization within each of the three clinical groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data elements (with their time of collection) will be collected from the&#xD;
      patient's hospital chart of during follow-up clinical assessment&#xD;

&#xD;
      Data for each patient will be collected using the patient's hospital chart and visual&#xD;
      inspection of the wound by a clinician. One questionnaire, the EQ5D, will be completed by&#xD;
      study participants, with the help of a research assistant at Baseline (after obtaining&#xD;
      consent), on Post-operative Day 7, Day 14 and Week 6. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete this questionnaire if they have any unscheduled/unplanned encounters related to the&#xD;
      occurrence of either a primary (SSI) or secondary (dehiscence/seroma) outcome during the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective patients (revision and some metastatic cases) will be introduced to the study at the&#xD;
      time of surgical consent by a member of the research team. Emergent patients (all trauma and&#xD;
      most metastatic cases) will be introduced to the study pre-operatively in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department or in the Orthopaedic Clinic by a member of the research team. Study participants&#xD;
      will be randomized prior to surgery to receive either the Prevena™ System or standard wound&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consenting participants will be randomized, based on the three primary diagnostic groups&#xD;
      (revision surgery, metastatic disease or fracture with deficit). Study participants who&#xD;
      receive the 'standard wound care' will have the dressing changed 3 days after their surgery&#xD;
      and will have study encounters on Post-operative Day 7, Day 14 and Week 6 for wound&#xD;
      inspection, dressing change (Day 7) and suture/staple removal (Day 14). Study participants&#xD;
      who receive the Prevena™ System will have the same schedule of study encounters for wound&#xD;
      inspection (Post-operative Day 7, Day 14 and Week 6). The Prevena™ System will be removed on&#xD;
      Day 7 and a dry, sterile dressing will be applied. On Day 14 sutures/staples will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have not yet been discharged at the time of the scheduled study encounter will&#xD;
      be seen in hospital. Patients who have been discharged prior to any scheduled study&#xD;
      encounters will be seen in a follow-up spine clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will all be assigned a unique study ID and the treatment allocation will be&#xD;
      hidden for the purposes of analysis. It will be impossible to blind physicians or&#xD;
      participants to the treatment group given the obvious difference in appearance of the&#xD;
      Prevena™ System versus standard wound dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power calculation has been performed to determine the number of participants required. This&#xD;
      analysis has presumed an incidence of SSI of 15% (based on an averaging calculation of&#xD;
      published data for these high risk groups), and used a 2-tailed analysis, assuming a power of&#xD;
      0.8 and a Type I error of 5%. For a 50% decrease in primary outcome rates, Surgical Site&#xD;
      Infection, (15% to 7.5%), 275 participants per group will be required. The pilot data&#xD;
      generated from the proposed study will allow for refinement of this target recruitment.&#xD;
