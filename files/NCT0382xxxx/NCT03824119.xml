  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have suggested that NSAID use causes an increase in blood pressure. Further,&#xD;
      blood pressure elevation has been noted in women with pregnancy related hypertensive disease&#xD;
      during the postpartum period. NSAIDs remain part of standard postpartum care in women with&#xD;
      hypertensive disease. The objective of this study is to determine whether postpartum standard&#xD;
      care withholding NSAID use is associated with a clinically significant reduction in&#xD;
      postpartum hypertension in women with pregnancy induced hypertension. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that women with pregnancy induced hypertensive disease will be half as likely to&#xD;
      have blood pressure elevation of 150/100 mmHg in the first 24 hours postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label randomized trial of women with antepartum hypertension. Women&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive standard postpartum care or standard postpartum care without&#xD;
      NSAIDs. Blood pressure measurements and patient outcomes will be recorded. The study period&#xD;
      will begin at the time of delivery and will end at the time of hospital discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the withholding of NSAID use is&#xD;
      associated with a clinically significant decrease in postpartum hypertension in women with&#xD;
      antepartum hypertension. The investigators are interested in whether the use of NSAIDs&#xD;
      elevates blood pressure to greater than or equal to 150/100 mmHg (by either systolic or&#xD;
      diastolic parameters) more frequently in hypertensive women. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that among participants with hypertensive disease associated with pregnancy, those who have&#xD;
      NSAIDs withheld from standard postpartum care (experimental arm) will be half as likely to&#xD;
      have an increase of blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg in the first 24 hours postpartum compared&#xD;
      to participants receiving standard care that includes NSAIDs (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a randomized, open label study investigating the effect of NSAID use on blood&#xD;
      pressure during the immediate postpartum period in women with chronic hypertension (cHTN) or&#xD;
      pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH). The experimental group in this study will be women&#xD;
      randomized to withholding NSAIDs during the study period, as women with hypertension&#xD;
      routinely receive NSAIDs postpartum. Women with a diagnosis of pregnancy induced hypertension&#xD;
      [gestational hypertension (gHTN), preeclampsia, superimposed preeclampsia, ] or cHTN will be&#xD;
      enrolled antepartum and will be separated into two groups by the route of delivery: vaginal&#xD;
      vs. cesarean delivery. Participants in the control arm will be assigned to receive standard&#xD;
      care, which includes NSAIDs (ketorolac, ibuprofen) and participants in the experimental arm&#xD;
      will be assigned to receive standard care with NSAIDs withheld in the postpartum period for&#xD;
      the duration of hospitalization. The intervention period will last approximately 2-4 days and&#xD;
      will conclude at the time of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurements will be obtained and recorded routinely in the postpartum period&#xD;
      until hospital discharge. More frequent measurements may be performed in the event of severe&#xD;
      blood pressure elevations at the discretion of the provider and treating clinical team.&#xD;
      Complete Blood Count (CBC) on postpartum Day 1 will be performed as part of standard care.&#xD;
      Additional laboratory evaluations will be performed at the discretion of the provider. In&#xD;
      addition to blood pressure measurement, pain scale scores will be recorded daily using a&#xD;
      Numeric Pain Scale Score. Initiation of anti-hypertensive medication, severe hypertension (BP&#xD;
      160/110 mmHg), treatment with magnesium sulfate and adverse maternal outcomes&#xD;
      (cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, eclamptic seizure,&#xD;
      death) will be documented and abstracted from the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power calculation to estimate the appropriate number of subjects needed to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 30% in the primary outcome, with an alpha level of 0.05 and 80% power&#xD;
      demonstrates that approximately 100 subjects per group (50 in the experimental group and 50&#xD;
      in the control group) will be needed for each delivery route tested (vaginal and cesarean).&#xD;
