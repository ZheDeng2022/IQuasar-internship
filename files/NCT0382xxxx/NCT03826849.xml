  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of a mobile phone application (app) developed by the VA National Center for&#xD;
      PTSD (VA NCPTSD) for use by Veterans with insomnia. The primary objective is to assess&#xD;
      whether Veterans find the Insomnia Coach app to be satisfactory and feasible to use.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine if use of the app improves subjective sleep quality and&#xD;
      sleep parameters (e.g., sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time), as well&#xD;
      as other important outcomes (e.g., daily functioning).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are high rates of insomnia among Veterans, particularly those who have been exposed to&#xD;
      potentially traumatic situations (i.e., combat exposure) and few receive cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), a first-line treatment for insomnia. Insomnia Coach is a mobile&#xD;
      app for individuals with insomnia symptoms. This app provides:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  education about sleep, the development of insomnia, and evidence based behavioral and&#xD;
           cognitive strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-assessment tools measuring insomnia severity and sleep need&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-monitoring with a daily sleep diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-management tools for relaxation and changing thinking about sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  individualized recommendations for a preferable sleep window (i.e., bed and rise times)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  daily reminders for behavioral changes In this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT),&#xD;
           50 Veterans with significant insomnia symptoms will be recruited using flyers and social&#xD;
           media (i.e., Facebook ads) and randomized in equal numbers to receive one of two&#xD;
           conditions: 1) the Insomnia Coach mobile app (which is based on cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
           therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) and, 2) a waitlist control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective use of the Insomnia Coach mobile app will be tracked to assess feasibility (i.e.,&#xD;
      will participants use the app as intended). Participants will complete measures (using&#xD;
      Qualtrics) of sleep, insomnia severity, depression and anxiety, and functional well-being at&#xD;
      baseline, 6 weeks (posttreatment), and 12 weeks (follow-up). At post-treatment, participants&#xD;
      in the Insomnia Coach app condition will also be asked to report their level of satisfaction&#xD;
      with the app and to complete a brief qualitative evaluation of their experience using the&#xD;
      app. Waitlist control condition participants will be informed about the Insomnia Coach app&#xD;
      and provided with information on how to download it after completion of the follow-up&#xD;
      assessment (i.e., at 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to learn whether individuals, particularly Veterans, with&#xD;
      insomnia, find Insomnia Coach to be satisfactory and feasible to use. It also aims to assess&#xD;
      if use of the app potentially improves subjective sleep quality and sleep parameters (e.g.,&#xD;
      sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time), as well as other important&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., daily functioning). If this research demonstrates that Insomnia Coach is a&#xD;
      promising tool for individuals experiencing sleep difficulties, it has the potential to&#xD;
      address a need using a very cost-effective, widely accessible, scalable solution that would&#xD;
      warrant more rigorous evaluation (e.g., a full-scale RCT).&#xD;

    <measure>Mobile Apps Rating Scale (MARS; Stoyanov et al., 2015)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item multidimensional, objective measure of app usability. It includes four subscales that measure an app's engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. All items are rated on a 5-point scale from &quot;1. Inadequate&quot; to &quot;5. Excellent&quot;. The scores are tallied up and a mean score out of 5 is given to each of the categories scored.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS; Brooke, 1986)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item questionnaire of usability of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications. Items are on a 5-point scale numbered 1 to 5. Half of the items are worded negatively and half are worded positively. SUS yields a single number representing a composite measure of the overall usability of the system. To calculate the SUS score, the score contributions from each item are summed. Each item's score contribution will range from 0 to 4. For items 1,3,5,7,and 9 the score contribution is the scale position minus 1. For items 2,4,6,8 and 10, the contribution is 5 minus the scale position. Then the sum of the scores is multiplied by 2.5 to obtain the overall value of SU. SUS scores have a range of 0 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 19-item self-report measure assessing qualities and problems associated with sleep in the past month. It generates seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. A global sleep quality score is obtained by summing the seven component scores. Higher scores reflect poorer sleep quality. The global score ranges from 0 to 21, with a cut-off score of 5 as distinguishing &quot;good&quot; sleepers from &quot;poor&quot; sleepers.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS-Sleep-Related Impairment (PROMIS-SRI; Buysse et al., 2010)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 16-item self-report form assesses sleep-related impairment over the past seven days. Each question has five response options ranging in value from 1 to 5. To find the total raw score the values of the response to each question are summed. The raw scores are converted to a standardized T-score using conversion tables published on the PROMIS website (nihpromis.org), with higher scores indicating greater sleep/wake disturbances.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 Item (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This 7-item measure assesses anxiety symptom severity. Items are scored from zero to three. The whole scale score can range from 0 to 21 and cut-off scores for mild, moderate and severe anxiety symptoms are 5, 10 and 15 respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-item self-report instrument used to assess depression severity. Since the scale is self-administered in our studies and further probing about positive responses is not feasible, the question about suicide from the PHQ-9 was removed. Items are scored 0 to 3, with the total score being the sum of the 8 items. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity, with a score of 10 or greater considered major depression, and scores of 20 or more is severe major depression.</description>
