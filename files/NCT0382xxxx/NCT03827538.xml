      Data obtained from clinical and bimolecular studies have showed that chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) patients might present higher rates of diaphragm function impairment&#xD;
      when compared to age and sex matched healthy controls. The potential mechanisms of injury&#xD;
      have been found in regional stresses and strains due to disadvantageous muscle geometry,&#xD;
      increased workload during exertion, mechanical stress and metabolic factors (i.e., increased&#xD;
      protease activity, free radicals, oxidation). In particular emphysema, with the breakdown of&#xD;
      elastic alveolar tissue, leads to increased lung compliance and gas trapping. Lung&#xD;
      hyperinflation with amplified dynamic elastance and intrinsic positive end expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PEEPi) limit the diaphragmatic excursion capacity. Moreover both end expiratory&#xD;
      lung volume (EELV) and residual volume (RV) increase, shifting tidal breathing (Vt) towards&#xD;
      the right side of the pressure-volume curve and imposing higher intra-thoracic pressures to&#xD;
      maintain an adequate Vt. Furthermore it has been showed that in COPD patients experiencing&#xD;
      frequent exacerbations the maximum pressure produced by diaphragm contraction seems&#xD;
      significantly lower as compared to non-COPD subjects, independently on the nature of the&#xD;
      tests used for assessment (both volitional - Pdi at Total Lung Capacity (TLC) or Pdi sniff-&#xD;
      or non volitional - phrenic nerve stimulation). Thus the reduction of diaphragm maximal&#xD;
      performances might be explained by muscle shortening and mechanical impairment following the&#xD;
      onset of progressive lung hyperinflation. Lung hyperinflation worsens with exercise leading&#xD;
      to breathlessness and is associated with reduced physical activity and reduced survival.&#xD;
      Inhaled bronchodilator medications have only modest impacts on symptoms and do not alter the&#xD;
      natural history of the disease. In selected patients with a heterogeneous pattern of&#xD;
      emphysema, surgical resection can be targeted at the worst affected areas of lung tissue,&#xD;
      which contribute disproportionately to gas trapping and hyperinflation, and so improve&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics. Lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients (LVRS) improves&#xD;
      symptoms and prolongs survival but can be associated with significant morbidity and a risk of&#xD;
      death, with a cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of at least $40 000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more recent approach has been to use endobronchial valves to occlude the airways supplying&#xD;
      the worst affected part of the lung. This is intended to cause atelectasis in the target&#xD;
      lobe, with a similar impact on the function of the rest of the lung as seen in LVRS. Several&#xD;
      trials have demonstrated that endobronchial valve treatment in patients with emphysema can&#xD;
      lead to improvements in symptoms, lung function and exercise capacity reductions in dynamic&#xD;
      hyperinflation and improvements in oxygen kinetics and chest wall synchrony. While studies on&#xD;
      surgical lung volume reduction have demonstrated improvement in diaphragmatic muscle function&#xD;
      no studies have investigated the effects of endobronchial valves positioning on diaphragm&#xD;
      performance in patients with lung hyperinflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods have been used to evaluate diaphragmatic contractile activity. Among these,&#xD;
      the standard reference is represented by the measurement of trans-diaphragmatic (Pdi)&#xD;
      pressure expressed by the difference between pleural (or esophageal [Pes]) and abdominal (or&#xD;
      gastric [Pgas]) pressures through nasogastric probes equipped with pressure sensors. However,&#xD;
      such methods are still far from routine clinical practice, thus highlighting the need for&#xD;
      simple and accurate methods to assess diaphragmatic performance. In last years the ultrasound&#xD;
      (US) evaluation of the diaphragmatic function has been developing in the field of intensive&#xD;
      care as a tool to estimate patient's work of breathing during ventilation. In a recently&#xD;
      published study on 75 patients with AECOPD requiring mechanical ventilation, we showed a&#xD;
      complete correlation between US assessment and Pdi measurements at maximal inspiration in&#xD;
      evaluating diaphragm function. In particular we demonstrated that changes of the diaphragm&#xD;
      thickness (ΔTdi) &lt; 20% during tidal volume has the same accuracy of transdiaphragmatic&#xD;
      pressure in identifying diaphragm impairment. Furthermore we investigated the US evaluation&#xD;
      of the diaphragm in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through the ΔTmax index&#xD;
      (the ratio between diaphragm thickness at the end of Vt and after maximal inspiration up to&#xD;
      total lung capacity). We found that ΔTmax strongly correlates with respiratory functions&#xD;
      tests with high accuracy in identifying subjects with FVC &lt;50% of predicted value. Moreover&#xD;
      in a recently published study, Bernardi and coworkers presented a non invasive technique to&#xD;
      measure PEEPi in COPD patients, through the US assessment of the time latency (msec) between&#xD;
      the onset of diaphragm contraction on US and the onset of inspiratory flow (28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study aims at evaluating diaphragmatic function before and after&#xD;
      endobronchial valves positioning in a COPD patients with lung hyperinflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study population and setting This prospective explorative observational&#xD;
      cohort study will be carried out in the Thoracic Endoscopic Unit (TEU) of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Modena Italy over a 24-month period once approval from the local Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of Modena will be obtained. Written informed consent to participate to the study will be&#xD;
      obtained by all enrolled patients patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible if admitted to the TEU for intervention of endobronchial valves&#xD;
      positioning due to documented lung hyperinflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will include previously documented diaphragmatic dysfunction, the presence&#xD;
      of neuromuscular diseases or other forms of myopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated according to the best current clinical practice by the TEU&#xD;
      staff, which will be blinded to the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General measures At enrollment respiratory clinical variables (age, sex, diagnosis and stage,&#xD;
      body mass index, smoke habits, comorbidities, previous treatment with systemic steroids) and&#xD;
      respiratory function test values will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures A respiratory physician with high expertise in chest US will perform a US&#xD;
      assessment of the diaphragm before and after endobronchial valves placement. Motility of the&#xD;
      diaphragm is assessed with a B-mode US device (GE Vivid 7, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) connected to&#xD;
      a 7-12 MHz linear probe. Measurements are performed in supine position with an average&#xD;
      inclination of 45°. The position of the probe is set to obtain the best view of the zone of&#xD;
      apposition of the diaphragm, located between the mid-axillary and the posterior axillary&#xD;
      line. The diaphragm is identified as a three-layer structure consisting of one relatively&#xD;
      non-echogenic muscle layer coated in two echogenic lines determined by peritoneal serosa and&#xD;
      diaphragmatic pleura. Diaphragm thickness is measured bilaterally at end-inspiration and&#xD;
      end-expiration. The US images will be stored in electronic or paper format by an examiner&#xD;
      unaware of the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular the following measurements will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ΔTd: change in diaphragm thickness (Tdi) during inspiration starting from FRC to Vt =&#xD;
           [(end-inspiratory Tdi - end-expiratory Tdi) / end-expiratory Tdi] X 100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ΔTmax: ratio between Tdi at the end of Vt and Tdi after maximal inspiration up to TLC =&#xD;
           end-inspiratory Vt Tdi / end-inspiratory TLC Tdi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEEPiecho: P0.1Mx(TLAT,US/100). TLAT = time latency (msec) between the onset of&#xD;
           diaphragm contraction on ultrasound and the onset of inspiratory flow; P0.1M = mouth&#xD;
           occlusion pressure at 100ms, an estimate of the effort a patient must make to generate&#xD;
           the inspiratory flow. It is measured using a unidirectional valve, occluded during&#xD;
           expiration so that the P0.1M is measured from functional residual capacity (FRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  US measurement of maximal diaphragmatic inspiratory excursion measured in right&#xD;
           subcostal window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assessment of maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP),&#xD;
      and sniff inspiratory nasal pressure (SNIP), will be performed before and after endobronchial&#xD;
      valves placement by a respiratory function technician unaware of the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each outcome measurements will be performed 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days and&#xD;
      90 days after endobronchial valves placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The statistical package GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc. La&#xD;
      Jolla, CA, USA) will be used for analysis. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables&#xD;
      will be presented as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) or associated to interquartile&#xD;
      range. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test (Mann-Whitney) and t student test will be used for&#xD;
      comparison of continuous variables.&#xD;
