  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical intervention is a modular skills-based intervention for flexible&#xD;
      delivery of care, measurement-based care practices, and integration of exposure strategies&#xD;
      critical for anxiety symptom reduction. Notably, the treatment targets anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      rather than diagnoses to improve use in PCMHI and CBOC settings. The pilot study will develop&#xD;
      and conduct preliminary testing of bCBT for anxiety using Veterans Affairs (VA) Video Connect&#xD;
      to Home (VVC-H) to deliver care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are identified in over 30% of primary care patients and are associated with&#xD;
      substantial functional impairment, poor health-related quality of life, and suicide; however,&#xD;
      rates of treatment are low. In contrast to advances in improving treatment of depression and&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder in VA, far less attention has been given to anxiety disorders.&#xD;
      In the absence of VA clinical practice guidelines for anxiety disorders, evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment practices are unstandardized in VA primary care and Community Based Outpatient&#xD;
      Clinics (CBOCs). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for the&#xD;
      anxiety disorders but was developed for use in specialty mental health settings and often&#xD;
      targets individual anxiety disorders (e.g.generalized anxiety, panic, and social phobia) with&#xD;
      diagnosis-specific treatment packages. These interventions are not practical for primary care&#xD;
      and CBOC settings where treatment must be brief and focused on reduction of anxiety symptoms&#xD;
      rather than targeted anxiety diagnoses. Further complicating the delivery of CBT for anxiety&#xD;
      disorders is that repeated exposure to feared cues is considered a critical component of CBT&#xD;
      for anxiety but is rarely used in these settings. Providers within VA currently have no&#xD;
      standardized options for delivering brief evidence-based psychotherapy for Veterans with&#xD;
      anxiety. Although Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) and CBOCs increase access to&#xD;
      mental health services, VA recognizes the need to deliver mental health services using video&#xD;
      to home technology to increase access, decrease barriers (i.e., geographic distance,&#xD;
      transportation, travel time, stigma, child care) and provide more Veteran-centric care. VA is&#xD;
      pioneering implementation of VA Video Connect to Home (VVC-H) technology in specialty mental&#xD;
      health clinics, but VVC-H continues to be rarely used and little is known about the&#xD;
      implementation potential of VVC-H to improve psychotherapy access and outcomes in primary&#xD;
      care and CBOC settings. In summary, VA needs a flexible evidence-based approach for anxiety&#xD;
      that fits within primary care and CBOC settings and offers innovative delivery strategies to&#xD;
      increase access to care. Although treatment in PCMHI and CBOC settings must be time-limited,&#xD;
      it must also be highly effective. The investigators have developed robust brief CBT (bCBT)&#xD;
      interventions and provider support programs for depression and is now seeking to address&#xD;
      anxiety using a similar approach. The proposed clinical intervention will use&#xD;
      state-of-the-art practices including delivery of services via VVC-H. This open trial seeks to&#xD;
      recruit 12 Veterans who have significant anxiety symptoms according to the GAD-7 (standard&#xD;
      assessment tool for VA clinical settings). Veterans will be recruited from the Michael E.&#xD;
      DeBakey VAMC primary care clinic and affiliated Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety (bCBT). Sessions with clinicians will be provided via VA Video Connect to Home (VVC-H). Participants will have the option to select from a list of skills to tailor to his/her preferences. Participants will be able to receive up to 9 total sessions and generally last 30 to 40 minutes. For the purpose of this study, treatment duration will be limited to 3 months to ensure standardization of study outcome measures.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive psychoeducation on anxiety and bCBT treatment approach, work on setting goals, begin self-monitoring, and select skill sessions that fit his/her most pressing needs. Available skills: Relaxation-Diaphragmatic breathing is a simple relaxation technique that increases oxygen flow and reduces the unpleasant physiological sensations associated with anxiety; Exposure - designed to educate Veterans about the role of avoidance in maintaining anxiety problems, as well as information about how to reduce avoidance through exposure exercises; Cognitive - Veterans may opt to address anxiety and worry through modifying negative thinking patterns. Two available options - Increasing Helpful Thoughts and Managing Unhelpful Thoughts.</description>
