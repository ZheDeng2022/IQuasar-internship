    <textblock>
      Surgical gastrojejunostomy is the conventional treatment for palliating patients suffering&#xD;
      from of inoperable malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). Although, the procedure is&#xD;
      associated with a high success and low re-intervention rates, there is a risk of morbidities&#xD;
      (10% - 16%) and mortalities (7%). The placement of a pyloro-duodenal self-expandable metallic&#xD;
      stent (SEMS) is an alternative to surgery for the palliating these patients. As compared to&#xD;
      surgery, the procedure is associated with shorter hospital stay, reduced morbidities and&#xD;
      cost. However, the clinical efficacy of SEMS is limited by several problems. In uncovered&#xD;
      SEMS, the long-term patency is reduced by tumor ingrowth leading to subsequent re-stenosis.&#xD;
      In covered SEMS, stent migration occurs at a frequency of 14-25% and it is a major obstacle&#xD;
      to stent patency. As a result, randomized trials comparing uncovered stents and partially or&#xD;
      fully covered stents in patients with malignant GOO have reported comparable stent patency&#xD;
      between the two types of stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the creation of a gastrojejunostomy under EUS (EUS-GJ) guidance using&#xD;
      lumen-apposing stents has been described. The procedure was associated with a technical&#xD;
      success rate of around 90% and clinical success of 85% to 100%. The procedure holds the&#xD;
      potential to create a gastrojejunostomy without surgery. Furthermore, there is a low risk of&#xD;
      tumor ingrowth and stent migration, thus improving the stent patency and reducing the need of&#xD;
      re-intervention. We have previously published a novel method of creating EUS-GJ with the use&#xD;
      of a double balloon occluder (EPASS). The device provides a stable condition for performance&#xD;
      of EUS-GJ and improves the safety of the procedure. However, there is limited data on how&#xD;
      EPASS compares to endoscopic stenting. The aim of the current study is thus to compare EPASS&#xD;
      and DS under a randomized setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, SEMSs have provided an attractive alternative to surgery for palliation of&#xD;
      malignant gastric outlet obstruction. Several studies have assessed the clinical and&#xD;
      technical success rates of pyloro-duodenal SEMS for malignant gastroduodenal obstruction.&#xD;
      Technical success rates of 90% to 100% and clinical success of 80% to 95% was achieved.The&#xD;
      procedure was associated with quicker recovery and reduced morbidities as compared to&#xD;
      surgical gastrojeunostomies. However, the long-term patency of uncovered SEMS is limited by&#xD;
      the risk of tumor ingrowth that would lead to subsequent re-stenosis of the stents requiring&#xD;
      re-intervention. Thus to palliate malignant gastric outlet obstruction, surgical&#xD;
      gastrojejunostomy is preferred in patients that are at good risk for surgery with prolonged&#xD;
      life expectancy whilst insertion of pyloro-duodenal SEMS is preferred in patients that are&#xD;
      associated with high-risk for surgery and short life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In lieu of the above reasons, it would be the ideal situation if a gastrojejunostomy could be&#xD;
      created endoscopically without surgery. The procedure could potentially avoid the risk of&#xD;
      morbidities and mortalities associated with surgery whilst enjoying the superior patency&#xD;
      associated with a gastrojejunostomy. However, a number of hurdles need to be overcome for&#xD;
      safe creation of an anastomosis endoscopically. Firstly, the collapsed bowel (duodenum or&#xD;
      jejunum) needs to be easily identified from the stomach. Secondly, a reliable method of&#xD;
      creating an anastomosis needs to be available. Lastly, a device for maintaining the&#xD;
      anastomosis between two non-adherent organs is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of EUS as a platform to create a gastrojejunostomy endoscopically may theoretically&#xD;
      tackle all of the above hurdles. The device could be used in the stomach to visualize the&#xD;
      adjacent duodenum or jejunum for anastomosis. A 19-gauge needle could be used to puncture the&#xD;
      adjacent bowel for passage of a guide-wire to connect the two non-adherent organs.&#xD;
      Thereafter, a SEMS could be placed between the two organs for creation and maintenance of the&#xD;
      anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial results of EUS-guided gastrojejunostomies from two studies have become available.&#xD;
      Khashab et al reported EUS-GJ in 10 patients. Technical success was achieved in 9 patients&#xD;
      (90%). Clinical success with resumption of solid oral intake was achieved in all 9 patients&#xD;
      (100%), who underwent successful EUS-GE. 8 patients were able to tolerate almost a normal&#xD;
      diet and/or full diet, and 1 patient tolerated a soft diet. There were no procedure-related&#xD;
      adverse events. Mean procedure time was 96 minutes (range 45-152 minutes), and mean length of&#xD;
      hospital stay was 2.2 days. In another multicenter study, 26 patients received EUS-GJ.&#xD;
      Technical success was achieved in 24 patients (92 %). Clinical success was achieved in 22&#xD;
      patients (85 %). Of the 4 patients in whom clinical success was not achieved, 2 had&#xD;
      persistent nausea and vomiting despite a patent EUS-GJ and required enteral feeding for&#xD;
      nutrition, 1 died before the initiation of an oral diet, and 1 underwent surgery for&#xD;
      suspected perforation. Adverse events, including peritonitis, bleeding, and surgery, occurred&#xD;
      in 3 patients (11.5 %). In both of these studies, the AXIOS stent was used for creation of&#xD;
      the anastomosis (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a common technical problem exists in both of these series. The target duodenum or&#xD;
      jejunum needed for creation of a GJ is collapsed and it is difficult to identify the target&#xD;
      organ by EUS from the stomach. Furthermore, the insertion of the stent for creation of the&#xD;
      anastomosis may be difficult with a collapsed bowel and this may result in catastrophic&#xD;
      outcomes. Our group has overcome this problem with a novel device - the double balloon&#xD;
      occluder. The device comprises of two balloons that could occlude a segment of bowel. Saline&#xD;
      could then be injected in to the occluded segment resulting in distension of the bowel and&#xD;
      making it possible to be targeted by EUS from the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has published the results of using the double balloon occluder in conjunction with&#xD;
      the AXIOS stent for creation of a GJ in 20 patients (Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided&#xD;
      double-balloon-occluded gastrojejunostomy bypass - EPASS). The technical success rate was 90%&#xD;
      (18/20). The median intubation time from the double-balloon tube intubation to stent&#xD;
      placement was 25.5 min (range 10-39 min). Post-treatment gastric outlet obstruction scoring&#xD;
      system (GOOSS) score improved in all 18 cases in which EPASS was successfully performed. The&#xD;
      mean post-GOOSS score was significantly higher than the pre-GOOSS score (0.6±0.75 vs&#xD;
      2.94±0.23, p&lt;0.001). None of the patients with successful placement of the stent suffered&#xD;
      from adverse events or recurrent obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of EUS-GJ were recently compared with that of conventional procedures for&#xD;
      management of malignant GOO. In a retrospective study, EUS-GJ was compared with DS. 30&#xD;
      patients received EUS-GJ and 60 patients DS. The technical success rates were similar between&#xD;
      the two groups (96.7% vs. 86.7%, P=0.07). Clinical success was also similar between the two&#xD;
      groups (70.0% vs. 86.7%, P=0.08). The re-intervention rate was significantly higher in the ES&#xD;
      group (43.3% vs. 3.4%, P&lt;0.001), whilst adverse events were comparable (13.3% vs 18.3%, P =&#xD;
      0.549). On multivariate analysis, DS was independently associated with need for&#xD;
      re-intervention (OR 25.7, p=0.004). In another study, EUS-GJ (25 patients) was compared with&#xD;
      laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy (29 patients) 20. Technical success was comparable (88% vs&#xD;
      100%, P = 0.11). Clinical success was similar (84% vs 90%, P = 0.11). Average post-procedure&#xD;
      length of stay was 9.4 days in the EUS-GJ group and 8.9 days in the Lap-GJ group (P = 0.75).&#xD;
      Adverse events were significantly more the lap-GJ group (41% vs 12%, P = 0.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, based on the above results, EUS-GJ may be associated with improved outcomes as compared&#xD;
      with conventional procedures for management of malignant GOO. Hence, the aim of the current&#xD;
      study is to compare the efficacies of EPASS versus uncovered pyloro-duodenal stents (DS) in&#xD;
      unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction in a randomized setting.&#xD;
