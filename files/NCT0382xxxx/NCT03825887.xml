      The investigators will compare between using of PCA Morphine (Group A) and using of PCA&#xD;
      Nalbuphine (Group B) in the following items over the first 7 days of initiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain intensity VAS every 12 hours and during the performing of mouth care for each&#xD;
           patient over the first 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total opioid consumptions for each patient every 24 hours and the total consumption of&#xD;
           the entire 7 days since initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of active and total pushes of PCA buttons every 24 hours and the sum up of the&#xD;
           active and total pushes of PCA buttons for each patient over the 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient satisfaction at the end of the 7 days. Patient satisfaction score PSS was&#xD;
           assessed using a linear scale where 0=very satisfied; 10=very dissatisfied (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serious adverse events. (Nausea and vomiting, pruritus, respiratory depression, urinary&#xD;
           retention, sedation, bradycardia, hypotension).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>patients with AML , ALL and bone marrow transplantation with oral mucositis grade3 or 4 were randomized into two group: patient using of PCA Morphine (Group A) patient using of PCA Nalbuphine (Group B). Patients of both groups will be started on the same dose of 10 mcg / kg / hour as a background and 10 mcg bolus dose with lock-out 20 minutes having the maximum allowed dose up to 40 mcg / hour.</intervention_model_description>
