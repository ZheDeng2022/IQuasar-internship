  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) and radiculopathic pain are a major socio-economic problem affecting all&#xD;
      age groups. 70% of people consult a doctor at least once in their life due to LBP. Radicular&#xD;
      pain is thought to be caused by inflammation of the spinal nerve roots near the&#xD;
      intervertebral disc injury. In this context, fluoroscopic guided transforaminal epidural&#xD;
      steroid injection (TFESI) has been increasingly preferred in patients who can not benefit&#xD;
      from conservative approach in the treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathic pain due to lumbar&#xD;
      disc herniation in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of comorbid psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      somatization disorder and given the detailed and visual information to patients who will be&#xD;
      undergone TFESI could affect the result of the treatment in a good way. The pain&#xD;
      questionnaire used for objectively evaluating injection outcomes is personality dependent and&#xD;
      there are many factors that can affect it.&#xD;

      Although information leaflets given to patients prior to surgical or non-surgical&#xD;
      interventions have not yet been used as a standard in each clinic, the effects on patients&#xD;
      have been frequently researched in recently. A detailed description of the treatment, the&#xD;
      devices to be used and the disclosure of the steps of the procedure may have an effect on the&#xD;
      result of the treatment. The aim of the study; (1) the presence of comorbid psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions in patients with lumbar disc hernia and radiculopathy, (2) to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of the written and visual informative form given before the injection of the lumbosacral&#xD;
      TFESI.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The study was designed as prospective, single blinded, randomized controlled study. Patients were randomized into two groups. The enrollment of the participants was carried out by an independent researcher.

    <description>The oswestry disability index is a survey designed to investigate how lumbar and leg pain affects their daily lives. It consists of 10 questions investigating the general life activity of the patient. The patient receives at least 0 points and at most 5 points from each question. The higher scores indicate that increased disability.</description>
