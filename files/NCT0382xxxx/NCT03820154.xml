  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testing of a new ready-to-use Tape in comparison to the currently used skin prick test for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of allergies. Assessment of clinical equivalence of the SPT Tape for&#xD;
      representative common inhalant allergens to conventional SPT in terms of wheal reaction&#xD;
      positivity and overall safety. Tests are performed in patients who have a medical history of&#xD;
      relevant allergic rhinitis to any of the tested allergens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, single site bridging study. Subjects with a history of in-halation allergies&#xD;
      will be tested in parallel with the SPT Tape and with the conventional SPT procedure using&#xD;
      one forearm each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each patient, a panel of 8 allergens with the SPT Tape and with the conventional SPT is&#xD;
      applied on the two forearms one time only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following Soluprick® allergens and control solutions will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive control, negative control, Phleum pratense, birch, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus,&#xD;
      D. farinae, dog dander, cat dander, mugwort, Alternaria sp. The allergens used for the SPT&#xD;
      and the SPT Tape are identical Soluprick allergen solutions; allergens will be applied in the&#xD;
      same location and order on both arms.&#xD;

    <description>The Skin Prick Test Tape is an innovative sterile &quot;all-in&quot; drug carrying 8 allergens and 2 control solutions including prick needles in one Tape for easy use and standardization. Single use. Reading of wheal reactions after 15 minutes, facilitated by stripes with the allergen names.</description>

    <description>The conventional SPT is the world-wide standard in allergy Type 1 diagnosis for inhalant and food allergens. Drops of allergens are applied to the forearm and, with the help of a lancet, brought into the skin. Reading of wheal reactions after 15 minutes.</description>
