  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the role of low-dose immediate-release oral morphine&#xD;
      as a novel adjunct pharmacotherapy to enable symptomatic adults with advanced chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease (ILD) to exercise at higher&#xD;
      intensities for longer durations and maximize the psycho-physiological benefits of a&#xD;
      supervised exercise training program. We hypothesize that, compared to placebo, exercise&#xD;
      training with oral morphine will result in relatively greater improvements in exercise&#xD;
      endurance time and intensity ratings of perceived breathlessness during constant-load&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary cycle exercise testing (CPET) at 75% of peak power output (PPO).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supervised exercise training programs (such as pulmonary rehabilitation) are an integral&#xD;
      component of the clinical management of COPD or ILD; a proven intervention for improving&#xD;
      symptom burden, quality of life, emotional function, exercise capacity, and risk of&#xD;
      hospitalization and death. While both low and high intensity exercise training benefits&#xD;
      adults with COPD or ILD, evidence supports that higher intensity exercise training produces&#xD;
      relatively greater physiological and symptomatic improvements. High intensity exercise of&#xD;
      adequate duration is, however, difficult and unpleasant for people with COPD or ILD due to&#xD;
      heightened exertional symptoms, particularly breathlessness.These symptoms persist despite&#xD;
      the patient's underlying disease being optimally managed according to evidence-based clinical&#xD;
      practice guideline standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose immediate-release oral morphine has recently shown promise as a novel adjunct&#xD;
      therapy to reduce exertional breathlessness and increase exercise endurance time in people&#xD;
      with advanced chronic lung disease (COPD). The purpose of this randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, two-arm pilot study is to further explore the role of low-dose&#xD;
      immediate-release oral morphine as an adjunct pharmacotherapy to enable symptomatic adults&#xD;
      with advanced COPD or ILD to exercise at higher intensities for longer durations and maximize&#xD;
      the psycho-physiological benefits of a 5-week supervised exercise training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with a clinical diagnosis of COPD or ILD and chronic breathlessness syndrome will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to exercise training with oral morphine (ExT+MOR) (n=20; 10 COPD&#xD;
      and 10 ILD) or exercise training with placebo (diluted simple syrup) (ExT+PLA) (n=20; 10 COPD&#xD;
      and 10 ILD). All eligible participants will complete four assessment visits (Visits 1, 2, 3&#xD;
      and 4) and 15 exercise training (T1-15) sessions. Assessment Visits 1 and 3 will include&#xD;
      post-bronchodilator (400 mg Salbutamol) pulmonary function testing and a symptom-limited&#xD;
      incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to determine peak power output (PPO). Visits&#xD;
      2 and 4 will include a symptom-limited constant-load CPET at 75% of the PPO determined at&#xD;
      Visit 1 and a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to assess body composition.&#xD;
      Supervised exercise training will be performed three times per week for five weeks on an&#xD;
      electronically braked cycle ergometer, supervised by a trained exercise specialist. Exercise&#xD;
      sessions will be individualized based on participants' pre-defined PPO (initial intensity of&#xD;
      60% PPO), and progressed to ensure the participant is exercising at an intensity&#xD;
      corresponding to a breathlessness intensity rating of between 3-5 Borg 0-10 category ratio&#xD;
      scale (CR10) units and can complete at least 20-min of continuous cycling. Exercise duration&#xD;
      will be increased in 5-min intervals up to 40-min. Thereafter, exercise intensity will be&#xD;
      increased by 5-15% of baseline PPO.&#xD;
