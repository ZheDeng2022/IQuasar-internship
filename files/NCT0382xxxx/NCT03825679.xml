  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral infarction is a major health problem. The two most common causes are atherosclerosis&#xD;
      (30 to 35%) and cardio-embolic origin (35 to 40%). However, in 25% of cases the cause is&#xD;
      undetermined, known as cryptogenic stroke or stroke of undetermined origin. Paroxysmal Atrial&#xD;
      Fibrillation appears to cause a significant proportion of these cryptogenic cerebral&#xD;
      infarctions. One of the major challenges in the management of cerebral infarctions is the&#xD;
      prevention of recurrence. If the cause is atheromatous, treatment is based on platelet&#xD;
      antiaggregants and the correction of cardiovascular risk factors. If the cause is atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, the treatment of choice is anticoagulation therapy. Cryptogenic strokes are&#xD;
      managed with antiplatelet therapy. In past studies, the thrombi responsible for cerebral&#xD;
      infarctions have been analyzed anatomopathologically to see if the composition of the thrombi&#xD;
      could help identify the cause of the cerebral infarction. These studies have proved to be&#xD;
      contradictory. The composition of the bacterial flora of cerebral infarct thrombi has not yet&#xD;
      been studied, apart from some limited data on septic emboli. In myocardial infarction, the&#xD;
      cause of which is almost exclusively atheromatous, bacteria of the periodontal flora have&#xD;
      been detected in thrombi of ST-segment elevation infarctions. The causes of cerebral&#xD;
      infarction are multiple. The hypotheses explored in this study are that there are differences&#xD;
      in the composition of the bacterial flora of the thrombus depending on whether the cause is&#xD;
      atheromatous or cardio-embolic and that the study of the composition of the thrombus could be&#xD;
      used to identify the cardio-embolic cause in patients with cryptogenic cerebral infarction.&#xD;
