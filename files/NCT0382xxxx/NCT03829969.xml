  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled phase III study. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of JS001 combined with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and cisplatin(TP regimen )with placebo combined with TP regimen in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma(ESCC )who have not received&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 500 patients with advanced or metastatic ESCC who have not received chemotherapy&#xD;
      previously will be enrolled in this study and 1:1 randomized into JS001 combined with TP&#xD;
      group and placebo combined with TP group (i.e., 250 patients each in group A and B) The&#xD;
      sample size was calculated based on the dual-endpoint of primary effectiveness endpoint&#xD;
      (progression-free survival, PFS, as evaluated by BIRC per RECIST v1.1 criteria) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS). The hierarchical testing will be used for PFS and OS analysis at the overall&#xD;
      significance level of two-sided 0.05, that is, all α levels (two-sided 0.05) will be firstly&#xD;
      used for the hypothesis test of PFS; if the null hypothesis of PFS is rejected, the&#xD;
      hypothesis test of OS will be performed at the two-sided significance level of 0.05. For PFS,&#xD;
      it will be expected to observe 283 PFS events in 500 patients enrolled about 24 months after&#xD;
      randomization of the first subject, thereby there is 85% statistical power to detect an&#xD;
      improved PFS for JS001 in combination with TP versus placebo in combination with TP in&#xD;
      subject with advanced or metastatic ESCC who had not previously received chemotherapy at the&#xD;
      two-sided significance level of 0.05 (corresponding hazard ratio (HR) =0.7); for OS, it will&#xD;
      be expected to observe 366 OS events in 500 patients enrolled about 39 months after&#xD;
      randomization of the first subject, thereby there is 85% statistical power to detect an&#xD;
      improved OS for JS001 in combination with TP versus placebo in combination with TP in subject&#xD;
      with advanced or metastatic ESCC who had not previously received chemotherapy at the&#xD;
      two-sided significance level of 0.05 (corresponding hazard ratio (HR) =0.73). It is planned&#xD;
      to performed an interim analysis of OS at the time of PFS analysis (about 24 months after&#xD;
      randomization of the first subject).&#xD;
