  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm multicenter, phase II study. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of bemcentinib (BGB324) a highly selective inhibitor of the AXL receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase for the treatment of AML and MDS patients failing or being refractory to&#xD;
      first line hypomethylating agent (HMA) treatment. Furthermore, safety, disease progression,&#xD;
      treatment failure will be assessed. A total of 43 patients will be included in the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel treatment options in patients with MDS or AML are urgently needed; treatment has not&#xD;
      changed significantly over the past decades and survival is still dismal, especially in&#xD;
      elderly patients not capable for an allogeneic stem cell transplantation and failing first&#xD;
      line treatment with hypomethylating agents. Axl, a member of the Tyro3, Axl, Mer (TAM)&#xD;
      receptor family, mediates proliferation and survival of leukemic cells and is upregulated&#xD;
      upon cytostatic treatment. In addition, leukemic cells induce expression of the Axl ligand&#xD;
      growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) in bone marrow stroma cells, which further amplifies&#xD;
      their growth and therapy resistance. selective inhibition of Axl signaling by the small&#xD;
      molecule Axl inhibitor bemcentinib blocked leukemic proliferation in vitro and in mouse&#xD;
      models. It was shown that a blockade of the Gas6/Axl signaling axis by R428 (bemcentinib)&#xD;
      significantly impaired MDS growth in an ex-vivo stroma-dependent co-culture setting using&#xD;
      patient-derived primary material. These effects were especially observed in the CD34+ MDS&#xD;
      stem cell compartment. A persistence of this stem cell compartment is expected to underlie&#xD;
      drug resistance and/or drive disease progression in MDS. Thus, Axl represents a potential&#xD;
      novel target in higher risk MDS and AML.&#xD;
