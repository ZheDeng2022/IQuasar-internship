    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 1b/2 study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Onvansertib,&#xD;
      administered orally, daily, for 5 consecutive days on Day 1-5 of each 14-day course in each&#xD;
      28-day cycle, in combination with FOLFIRI + Avastin, as second-line treatment in adult&#xD;
      patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer with a Kras mutation. Participants must have&#xD;
      histologically confirmed metastatic and unresectable disease, and previously failed treatment&#xD;
      or be intolerant to fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab.&#xD;
