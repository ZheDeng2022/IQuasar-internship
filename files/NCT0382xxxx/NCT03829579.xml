    <description>Participants will self-administer esketamine nasal spray, under the supervision of the healthcare professional at the site of care. A starting dose of 56 milligram (mg) will be administered intranasally into each nostril on Day 1 with subsequent doses of 56 mg or 84 mg administered during Weeks 1-4 (2 treatment sessions per week). For participants who respond, treatment is continued as follows: 56 mg or 84 mg of esketamine nasal spray during Weeks 5-8 (once weekly), and Week 9 onwards (every 2 weeks or once weekly), with period re-evaluation to determine the need for continued treatment. Doses will be adjusted based on efficacy and tolerability to the previous dosing.</description>
