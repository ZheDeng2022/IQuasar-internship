      This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted&#xD;
      according to United States standards of Good Clinical Practice in accordance with applicable&#xD;
      Federal regulations and institutional research policies and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) has been shown to decrease post-operative pain and narcotic use&#xD;
      when administered perioperatively as a local injection during arthroplasty procedures.&#xD;
      Studies have also demonstrated that LB used in conjunction with dexamethasone may increase&#xD;
      the duration of effectiveness of LB. This study seeks to evaluate if there is a difference in&#xD;
      post-operative pain and narcotic use when LB is administered in an interscalene block during&#xD;
      outpatient rotator cuff repair surgery. Furthermore, this study aims to determine if the&#xD;
      addition of dexamethasone with LB results in a prolonged decrease in post-operative pain and&#xD;
      a reduction in narcotic use.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient surgery has become the gold standard for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.&#xD;
      Innovations in pain management with regional anesthesia and multimodal techniques have&#xD;
      greatly contributed to this transition over the past several decades. Despite overall&#xD;
      improvements, uncontrolled postoperative pain leads to prolonged ambulatory stays, increased&#xD;
      patient dissatisfaction, unexpected admissions to the hospital or visits to the Emergency&#xD;
      Room after surgery, and a greater incidence of complications. Furthermore, in the wake of the&#xD;
      &quot;opioid epidemic&quot;, concerns with narcotic consumption and addiction have become heightened&#xD;
      with regulations and laws recently enacted making prescribing and managing postoperative pain&#xD;
      ever more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interscalene nerve blockade for shoulder procedures has become an increasingly common&#xD;
      technique to provide perioperative pain control with good efficacy, low complication rates&#xD;
      and reduced narcotic consumption. While the utilization of ultrasound to help administer the&#xD;
      block has aided in the accuracy providing a more consistent analgesic effect, its overall&#xD;
      short duration (12-24 hours) remains one of the major limitations of this technique.&#xD;
      Modalities to prolong its effect have included use of indwelling catheters and the addition&#xD;
      of perineural dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) (Exparel) was approved for single shot interscalene&#xD;
      administration by the FDA. This medication has been purported to provide up to 72 hours of&#xD;
      extended release of bupivacaine via its multivesicular and honeycomb-like structure that&#xD;
      predictably breaks down resulting in a slow and sustained release of the medication.9&#xD;
      Although numerous studies have been conducted and several meta-analyses performed looking at&#xD;
      the overall efficacy of local injections of LB for operative procedures in an inpatient&#xD;
      setting, no study to date has independently assessed its efficacy in the new perineural&#xD;
      indication for outpatient shoulder surgery. Furthermore, no study to date has compared the&#xD;
      use of LB to the use of LB with dexamethasone in a perineural indication to see if the&#xD;
      duration of efficacy is further prolonged with the addition of dexamethasone. All existing&#xD;
      literature is in regard to use of liposomal bupivacaine injected locally within the surgical&#xD;
      site. This will be the first study to examine the perineural use of LB for outpatient&#xD;
      shoulder surgery, and to determine if there is a prolonged decrease in pain and a decrease in&#xD;
      narcotic consumption with the use of LB with dexamethasone when delivered as an interscalene&#xD;
      block in an ambulatory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, this study seeks to evaluate if there is&#xD;
      a difference in post-operative pain and narcotic use when LB is administered in an&#xD;
      interscalene block during outpatient rotator cuff repair surgery. Furthermore, this study&#xD;
      aims to determine if the addition of dexamethasone with LB results in a prolonged decrease in&#xD;
      post-operative pain and an overall reduction in narcotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims &amp; Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: To determine if the use of LB in an interscalene block decreases patient-reported&#xD;
      post-operative visual analogue pain scale (VAS) in patients undergoing outpatient rotator&#xD;
      cuff surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be a decrease in the visual analogue pain scale for up to 72 hours&#xD;
      post-operatively among participants who receive LB or LB plus dexamethasone, as compared to&#xD;
      the control group (bupivacaine plus dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, post-operative&#xD;
      patient-reported VAS pain (on a scale of 1-10) will be collected 3 times per day (every 8&#xD;
      hours) for 5 post-operative days (PODs), corresponding to a total of 120 hours after surgery.&#xD;
      For each 24-hour period (corresponding to each POD), the pain scores will be averaged and&#xD;
      compared between the three treatment groups (control, LB, and LB plus dexamethasone) for each&#xD;
      of the 5 PODs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: To determine if the use of LB plus dexamethasone in an interscalene block decreases&#xD;
      patient-reported post-operative VAS pain for a longer duration than the LB or the control&#xD;
      group (bupivacaine plus dexamethasone) in patients undergoing outpatient rotator cuff surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be a decrease in visual analogue pain scale for greater than 72 hours&#xD;
      post-operatively among participants who receive LB plus dexamethasone, as compared to the LB&#xD;
      and the control group (bupivacaine plus dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, post-operative&#xD;
      patient-reported visual analogue pain scale (on a scale of 1-10) will be collected 3 times&#xD;
      per day (every 8 hours) for 5 post-operative days (PODs), corresponding to a total of 120&#xD;
      hours after surgery. For each 24-hour period (corresponding to each POD), the pain scores&#xD;
      will be averaged and compared between the three treatment groups (control, LB, and LB plus&#xD;
      dexamethasone) for each of the 5 PODs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims &amp; Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2a: To determine if there is a difference in time at which post-operative narcotics are&#xD;
      first used among three groups receiving different interscalene blocks (LB plus dexamethasone,&#xD;
      LB, and control) in patients undergoing outpatient rotator cuff surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Narcotic use will begin at a later time among those receiving LB plus&#xD;
      dexamethasone, as compared to the LB and the control group (bupivacaine plus dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, narcotic use will be&#xD;
      collected at 8-hour increments for a total of 5 post-operative days (PODs), corresponding to&#xD;
      a period of 120 hours post-surgery. The 8-hour time period during which a participant first&#xD;
      begins using a narcotic will be recorded and compared between three treatment groups&#xD;
      (control, LB, and LB plus dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2b: To determine if there is a difference in patient-reported post-operative narcotic use&#xD;
      (measured in morphine equivalents) among three groups receiving different interscalene blocks&#xD;
      (LB plus dexamethasone, LB, and control) in patients undergoing outpatient rotator cuff&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be a decrease in cumulative narcotic use (measured in morphine&#xD;
      equivalents) among participants who receive LB plus dexamethasone, as compared to the LB and&#xD;
      the control group (bupivacaine plus dexamethasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, post-operative&#xD;
      patient-reported narcotic use (measured by the number of tablets ingested and converted to&#xD;
      morphine equivalents) will be collected 3 times per day at 8-hour increments for a total of 5&#xD;
      post-operative days (PODs), corresponding to a total of 120 hours after surgery. For each&#xD;
      24-hour period (corresponding to each POD), narcotic use will be tabulated and compared&#xD;
      between three treatment groups (control, LB, and LB plus dexamethasone). Furthermore,&#xD;
      cumulative narcotic use during the 5-day (120 hour) study period will be calculated and&#xD;
      compared between three treatment groups (control, LB, and LB plus dexamethasone).&#xD;

        <description>Patient-reported post-operative opioid use (converted to morphine equivalents), collected post operatively, in 8-hour increments, for a total of 96 hours post-surgery Patients will be prompted via text message to provide the amount of narcotics (number of pills converted to morphine equivalents) taken over the course of the previous 8 hours. If a response text message is not received, a phone call will be made to obtain the information. Patients who do not have a smart phone will receive a phone call or keep a personal log of narcotic use.</description>
