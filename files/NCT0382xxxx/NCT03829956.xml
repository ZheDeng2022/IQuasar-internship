      Intraoral Neuromuscular Training for Treatment of Snoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies show that improving pharyngeal muscle tone can ameliorate obstructive sleep apnoea&#xD;
      (OSA) and snoring. The study uses an intra-oral stimulation device (SnooZeal) aimed at a&#xD;
      population of snorers. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of intra-oral&#xD;
      neuromuscular stimulation training during wakefulness on snoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study, recruiting up to 200 patients from the sleep clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, subjects will use the intra-oral stimulation device once a day for 20 minutes&#xD;
      each time for a period of 6 weeks. During these 6 weeks, subjects will complete a daily diary&#xD;
      of the device use and any side effects or adverse events. Partners also complete a daily&#xD;
      snoring score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed-up for a further 2 weeks after treatment. They will complete&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and subjective sleep quality questionnaires for a&#xD;
      further 2 weeks. Partners will also complete the post treatment snoring scores. Sleep study&#xD;
      will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective evaluation will be based on pre- and post-treatment sleep studies, visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) snoring scores, PSQI and subjective sleep quality questionnaire. All&#xD;
      side effects and adverse events will be reported and acted upon according to the risk&#xD;
      management structure.&#xD;

      Aim/ Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to assess the efficacy of transoral neuromuscular stimulation&#xD;
      training during wakefulness on snoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study, recruiting patients from the sleep clinics at the&#xD;
      Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery in Queen's Hospital, Barking,&#xD;
      Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Screening Participants will be identified from Queen's Hospital, Barking, Havering and&#xD;
      Redbridge NHS Trust. There will be a screening phone call to ensure suitability based on an&#xD;
      inclusion criterion and offer first line information about the trial. If suitable,&#xD;
      participants will be given a written information sheet and invited to undertake a 2 day home&#xD;
      sleep study (using WatchPAT). If the average apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from these 2 days is&#xD;
      below 15/h, the participants will be invited for a clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Recruitment visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical airway examination by Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) consultant&#xD;

           participant's bed partner will be required to complete daily visual analogue scoring of&#xD;
           the participant's snoring, with 1 being &quot;no snoring&quot; and 10 being &quot;intolerable snoring&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral examination (detailed examination by dentist to document pre-therapy oral state&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant and bed partner to complete sleep quality questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
           Quality Index, Epsworth sleepiness score (ESS) and subjective sleep quality&#xD;
           questionnaire) on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Therapy phase (day 1-42)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Face-to-face meeting, instruction on use of the intraoral device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant to use the Snoozeal device for 20 minutes once daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bed partner daily subjective assessment of snoring (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant daily assessment of side effects/adverse events and time of use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant and bed partner to complete Sleep quality Questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
           Quality Index, Epsworth sleepiness score and subjective sleep quality questionnaire) at&#xD;
           day 42&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly follow up phone call from research team to confirm compliance. Compliance will&#xD;
           also be cross checked using the total time of use recorded by the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. End of Therapy Review (day 43 - 49)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of device integrity by visual inspection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral examination (detailed examination by dentist to document post therapy oral state)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat Sleep Study - 2 night sleep study with WatchPAT&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Follow Up phase (day 43-56)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant advised to stop using device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bed partner daily subjective assessment of snoring (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject and bed partner to complete Sleep quality Questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
           Quality Index, Epworth sleepiness score and subjective sleep quality questionnaire) at&#xD;
           day 56&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Post Therapy Review (day 57)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Face-to-face meeting and feedback&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of participant data sheets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant subjective overall assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre and post sleep studies will be performed using WatchPAT. Parameters recorded:&#xD;
      saturation, AHI, snoring sound parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AHI will be identified and analyzed by WatchPAT data and software. The WatchPat is an&#xD;
      approved FDA sleep study device. Snoring will be quantified subjectively by both the bed&#xD;
      partner using a visual analog score, and objectively during the home sleep study as frequency&#xD;
      of snores (number of snores / hours of sleep) and % total sleep time spent snoring. Sleep&#xD;
      quality will be quantified subjectively by PSQI score. Sleepiness will be quantified&#xD;
      subjectively by ESS score.&#xD;

    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) of snoring is a subjective assessment of the participant's severity of scoring by their partner on a scale of 1 - 10 (1 being no snoring, 10 being intolerable snoring). This assessment will be done on a daily basis for the 2 weeks prior to intervention, 6 weeks of intervention and 2 weeks post intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between pre-therapy (day -1) and post therapy (day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-report questionnaire that is completed by the participants at day -1 (pre-therapy), day 42 (end of therapy) and day 56 (post therapy). The questions are multiple choice questions with the answers based on participants' usual sleep habits during the last four weeks. The outcome is assessed based on the evaluation of the change in responses before and after therapy. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between pre-therapy (day -1) and post therapy (day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The score can range from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating a higher level of daytime sleepiness.</description>
