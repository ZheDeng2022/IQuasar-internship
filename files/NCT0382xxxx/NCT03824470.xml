    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to research the effect of intubation without muscle relaxant&#xD;
      on post-operative recovery conditions in patients with OSAS (obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      syndrome). Our secondary aim is to research the hemodynamic parameters in intraoperative&#xD;
      period and complications such as sore throat and laryngospasm voice limitation in the&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;

      Study Protocol, Methods and Procedures to be Applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out as double blinded randomized controlled after the approval of&#xD;
      the ethics committee of our hospital. By carrying out the Stop Bang questionnaire which is a&#xD;
      practical and highly sensitive test, 60 patients ranging from 18 to 65 years with a stop bang&#xD;
      score of 3 and ASA I-II and mallampati I and II scores will be included to the study. The&#xD;
      patients included in the study will be divided into two groups of 30 people randomly with a&#xD;
      closed envelope method. Patients who were intubated in the intensive care unit during&#xD;
      postoperative period, those using CPAP device at home or those who received OSAS therapy, who&#xD;
      had undergone head and neck surgery or who had head surgery, central nervous system damage&#xD;
      and cardiovascular or pulmonary stability, neuromuscular disease patients, those with known&#xD;
      allergies to the anesthetic agents used, those whose written and verbal consent cannot be&#xD;
      obtained, smokers, pregnants and patients with ASA III and IV will not be included in our&#xD;
      study. All patients will be seen a day in advance and after performing stop bang test, those&#xD;
      with test score of 3 and above will be included in the study and their physical examinations&#xD;
      and laboratory findings will be evaluated. The demographic data of the patients will be&#xD;
      recorded. The physician performing the anesthesia and the evaluating physician will be&#xD;
      different people. The evaluating physician will not know which anesthetic agent is used to&#xD;
      the patients. The group to be performed Esmeron will be named Group E and the group to be&#xD;
      given Remifentanil will be named Group R. All patients included in the study will be taken to&#xD;
      the operation room and the hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, mean blood pressure values,&#xD;
      SpO2) will be recorded by naninvasive monitoring. The data obtained will be considered as&#xD;
      basal. All patients will be given 2 mg / kg demisolam for the purpose of sedation. General&#xD;
      anesthesia will be done by connecting the Tof device to the patients. Anesthesia induction&#xD;
      will be done to anesthesia induction Group R with 1 mg / kg lidocaine, 4 mcg / kg&#xD;
      remifentanil and 2 mg / kg propofol intravenously. In group E, after the administration of 1&#xD;
      mg / kg lidocaine, 2 mg / kg propofol, 1 mcg / kg remifentanil and 0.6 mg / kg rocuronium,&#xD;
      patients in both groups will be intubated and general anesthesia will be performed when the&#xD;
      Tof value is 0. During intubation; intubation difficulty will be evaluated and recorded by&#xD;
      intubation scoring system. Anesthesia maintenance in both groups will be provided with 8%&#xD;
      desflurane, 40% O2, 60% dry air and iv. 0.025 mcg / kg / min remifentanil fusion. During the&#xD;
      study, the recorded basal hemodynamic parameters of the patients will be recorded in the&#xD;
      first 20 minutes of the operation with a 5-minute interval and 10-minute interval after the&#xD;
      20th minute. In case of a change of 20% in any one according to basal, it will be intervened&#xD;
      immediately. In order to provide the depth of anesthesia before the operation, patients will&#xD;
      be monitored with TOF device and the depth of anesthesia will be provided. Shortly after the&#xD;
      end of the surgery, the gases will be cut off and the Tof value of 70% and above will be&#xD;
      recorded. When Tof is 70%, Group R will be given 10 cc physiological saline intravenously. In&#xD;
      order to antagonize the muscle relaxant effect in Group E, 2 / mg / kg sguamadex will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously by diluting with 10 cc physiological saline. Patients will be&#xD;
      extubated when the tof value of both groups is 90%. The durations from 70% to 90% of the Tof&#xD;
      value, spontaneous eye opening duration after the patient is extubated, duration of&#xD;
      extubation, response duration to commands, duration until modified aldrete score is 10,&#xD;
      surgeon satisfaction (good, bad, moderate) and duration of surgery will be recorded. The&#xD;
      operation will be terminated by recording whether there is a need for ventilation with sore&#xD;
      throat, laryngospasm volume restriction, desaturation and mask.&#xD;
