  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomised study of OligoG DPI compared to placebo DPI, both on top of&#xD;
      standard-of-care, to assess safety, efficacy and tolerability. Adult patients with Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis will be included in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The alginate oligosaccharide OligoG CF-5/20 dry powder for inhalation (OligoG DPI) represents&#xD;
      a novel therapeutic approach for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). OligoG has been shown to&#xD;
      release stagnant mucus, modulate sputum rheology and disrupt the biofilm formation often&#xD;
      typically observed in CF. These properties will in turn facilitate mucus clearance and&#xD;
      promote effectiveness of antibiotic therapy against the chronic pulmonary infections&#xD;
      characteristic of CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CF (age 18 years or older) will be eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design will be a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study for proof of concept&#xD;
      that OligoG DPI can improve lung function in adult CF patients. Study medication will be&#xD;
      given twice daily for twelve weeks on top of standard of care (SOC). Thirty-three patients&#xD;
      will be included, out of which twenty-two shall receive OligoG, and eleven shall receive&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all patients have completed the 12 week double blind treatment period, all patients&#xD;
      will be offered open-label OligoG twice daily, in addition to standard of care, for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be absolute change i percent predicted FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory parameters will include sputum microbiology.&#xD;

             and height, according to the GLI equation (Eur Respir J. Dec 2012; 40(6): 1324-1343).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection with at least one positive&#xD;
             microbiological PA testing during the last 12 months before the Screening Visit.&#xD;

             cycled antibiotic treatment, the treatment should start with an active cycle at the&#xD;
             day of randomisation (+/- 2 day) (together with the IMP intake). If taking tobramycin&#xD;
             cycled with another antibiotic, IMP should start on the active cycle of tobramycin.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  organisms within the 12 months before the date of informed consent, with the&#xD;
                  first and last of these separated by at least 3 months, and the most recent one&#xD;
                  within the 6 months before the date of informed consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients currently receiving any other investigational treatment, or who have&#xD;
             participated in a clinical study within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the screening&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current malignant disease (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma and cervical&#xD;
             neoplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychological condition, other than CF, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator exposes the patient to an unacceptably high risk.&#xD;
