      A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of SH-1028 with&#xD;
      Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      SH-1028 in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.The trail is divided into two parts:part A is&#xD;
      dose extension phase,and Part B is expand sample size phase to confirm the efficacy of&#xD;
      SH-1028.Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation&#xD;
      status following confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of SH-1028 by assessment of&#xD;
      Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.&#xD;
