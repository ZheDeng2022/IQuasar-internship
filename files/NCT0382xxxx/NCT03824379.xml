      Higher prevalence of hypomagnesaemia in diabetic patients with nephropathy was compared to&#xD;
      those without nephropathy. Serum magnesium levels were significantly inversely correlated&#xD;
      with serum creatinine and U-A/C ratio, and positively correlated with glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate (GFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, Magnesium supplementation using magnesium salts could be a good approach to improve&#xD;
      the cardiovascular complications, insulin resistance index, lipid profile and kidney function&#xD;
      in diabetic nephropathy patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy is a serious kidney-related complication of type 1 diabetes and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. It is also called diabetic kidney disease. Up to 40 percent of people with diabetes&#xD;
      eventually develop kidney disease. Over time, elevated blood sugar associated with&#xD;
      uncontrolled diabetes causes high blood pressure which in turn damages the kidneys by&#xD;
      increasing kidney filtration pressure. Complications of diabetic nephropathy include heart&#xD;
      and blood vessel disease (cardiovascular disease), fluid retention and hyperkalemia.&#xD;
      Magnesium (Mg) is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and the second most important&#xD;
      intracellular cation. It plays an essential role in biological systems as co-factor for more&#xD;
      than 300 essential enzymatic reactions such as signal transduction, energy metabolism,&#xD;
      vascular processes and bone metabolism. Normal serum Mg concentrations ranges from 0.7 to 1.1&#xD;
      mmol/L (1.4-2.0 mEq/L or 1.7-2.4 mg/dL). Outcome studies in the general population have&#xD;
      indicated potential associations between low serum Mg levels and atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, and left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as both CVD mortality and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality. Low SMg levels (1.4-1.9 mg/dL; 0.58-0.78 mM) were independently&#xD;
      associated with all-cause death in patients with prevalent CKD. Higher prevalence of&#xD;
      hypomagnesaemia in diabetic patients with nephropathy compared to those without nephropathy.&#xD;
      Serum magnesium levels were significantly inversely correlated with serum creatinine and&#xD;
      U-A/C ratio, and positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Magnesium&#xD;
      deficiency promotes hydroxyapatite formation and calcification of vascular smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells . It is closely related to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. A lower Mg level&#xD;
      is directly associated with a faster deterioration of renal function in T2DM patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, hypomagnesemia is associated with the long-term micro- and macrovascular&#xD;
      complications of T2DM. A dysregulation of mineral metabolism, reflected by altered levels of&#xD;
      magnesium and FGF-23, correlates with an increased urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR)&#xD;
      in type 2 diabetic patients with CKD stages 2-4. Also, a link between hypomagnesemia and&#xD;
      atherogenic dyslipidemia alterations exists; a significantly raised total cholesterol and LDL&#xD;
      and non-HDL in patients with CKD are observed, suggesting a link to increased cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk in CKD patients. Increasing magnesium levels could attenuate the cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      derived from hyperphosphatemia, hence the CKD progression. Current literature suggests that&#xD;
      Mg may have a protective effect on the CV system. Mg supplementation improves the insulin&#xD;
      resistance index and beta-cell function, and decreases hemoglobin A1c levels in type 2 DM&#xD;
      patients. In animal models of vascular calcification VC, dietary supplementation with&#xD;
      magnesium results in marked reduction in VC and mortality, improved mineral metabolism,&#xD;
      including lowering of PTH, as well as improvement in renal function. Hence, Magnesium&#xD;
      supplementation using magnesium salts could be a good approach to improve the cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications, insulin resistance index, lipid profile and kidney function in diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy patients.&#xD;
