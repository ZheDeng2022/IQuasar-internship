    <textblock>
      This three-arm clinical trial aims to improve levels of physical activity among Arabic-&#xD;
      speaking residents of East Jerusalem with prediabetes. Levels of daily physical activity&#xD;
      (assessed through activity trackers), dietary habits and self-assessed health will be&#xD;
      compared between patients that receive only the activity tracker and written information&#xD;
      (group A), receive the activity tracker, written information and a personalized physical&#xD;
      activity prescription (group B), and those that receive in addition also intensive follow-up&#xD;
      with motivational interview by physician assistants and a dietitian (group C)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm clinical trial studying the effect of providing activity trackers with&#xD;
      intensive motivational interview by trained physician assistants, and dietitian counselling,&#xD;
      on the levels of daily physical activity among Arabic- speaking residents of East Jerusalem&#xD;
      with prediabetes from Clalit Health Services. In addition, this study will also assess&#xD;
      healthy dietary changes, and self assessed health and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare three groups (total 375, each group 125):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - will receive activity trackers and written educational handouts in addition to&#xD;
      their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B - will receive all of group A intervention components and also a personalized&#xD;
      physical activity prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C - will receive all of group B components and also intensive motivational interview&#xD;
      support by trained physician assistants (3 sessions), and dietitian support (two sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be followed-up for six months, with data collection occurring at&#xD;
      baseline, three months and six months. Data collection will include average weekly steps,&#xD;
      blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, routine blood tests (including fasting glucose,&#xD;
      HbA1C, and lipid profile), physical activity survey, Mediterranean dietary habits survey,&#xD;
      Food Frequency Questionnaire, and quality of life survey.&#xD;
