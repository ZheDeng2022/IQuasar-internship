      In the current application, the investigators propose to elaborate upon, reconstruct and&#xD;
      advance to pivotal trial readiness a recently validated mobile application (HeartMapp),&#xD;
      designed for the ecological momentary assessment and treatment of individuals with Heart&#xD;
      Failure (HF). Presently, HeartMapp includes physiological modules (PM) that support&#xD;
      self-monitoring and exercises that promote heart health, and cognitive modules (CM) that&#xD;
      track and enhance cognitive functions. During the first three-months, the investigators will&#xD;
      finalize the cognitive training modules within HeartMapp and release through the quality&#xD;
      management system. At the completion of software development, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      test the relevant usage and progression variables of the algorithm that will be used to&#xD;
      direct engagement with the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a single arm, open label, pilot clinical trial to examine&#xD;
      feasibility and initial efficacy of the HeartMapp+CT (HeartMapp and computerized&#xD;
      plasticity-based adaptive cognitive training). The term &quot;CT&quot; refers to computerized training.&#xD;
      The study will enroll 32 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of HF and over sample by&#xD;
      25% to reduce attrition for a total of 24 participants enrolled at the end. Participants will&#xD;
      complete follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-months after enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a progressive disease that affects 6.5 million Americans and is&#xD;
      projected to reach 10 million by 2020. Presently, treatments for HF are largely comprised of&#xD;
      drug therapies targeting pathophysiology and self-administered therapies that require&#xD;
      patients to learn, accurately recall and routinely execute complex self-care practices. HF&#xD;
      patients are expected to monitor their weight, diet and manage their medications, and are&#xD;
      also required to recognize, monitor and report HF related symptoms. However, adopting&#xD;
      self-care behaviors are often challenging for patients due to concomitant cognitive&#xD;
      impairments, as shown in 30% to 80% of HF patients; a condition which is often complicated by&#xD;
      insufficient social support. Multiple studies have shown a direct relationship between&#xD;
      cognitive deficits and difficulty with self-care. Thus, there is currently an urgent unmet&#xD;
      need for novel patient-centered interventions that are easy to use by older adults with HF&#xD;
      that suffer cognitive difficulties and lack social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current application, investigators propose to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance&#xD;
      to pivotal trial readiness a recently validated mobile application (HeartMapp), designed for&#xD;
      the ecological momentary assessment and treatment of individuals with HF. Presently,&#xD;
      HeartMapp includes physiological modules (PM) that support self-monitoring and exercises that&#xD;
      promote heart health, and cognitive modules (CM) that train participants to enhance cognitive&#xD;
      functions. The Posit Science Corporation team of developer and neuroscientists will closely&#xD;
      collaborate with investigators at University of South Florida (Drs. Athilingam and Labrador),&#xD;
      inventors of the initial version of HeartMapp, to include a clinician-facing dashboard and&#xD;
      reporting utility comprised of both PM and CM performance and progress tracking metrics. This&#xD;
      Point-of-Care (POC) device will also aid clinical studies of cardiovascular, lung, and blood&#xD;
      diseases and disorders by providing continuous monitoring data collected remotely to serve as&#xD;
      an open channel between patients and clinicians. A recent usability study of the HeartMapp PM&#xD;
      conducted by co-investigator Dr. Athilingam in 25 HF patients was successful; patients found&#xD;
      the app easy to use, helpful and engaging. A concurrent pilot clinical trial that examined&#xD;
      only CM in 17 HF patients demonstrated that CM improved memory, cognitive speed of&#xD;
      processing, and showed trends for improved everyday function and HF self-care. Across all&#xD;
      functional outcomes measured, the CM group showed better function post-training relative to&#xD;
      controls. Similarly, in our prior research, and in the successful development of related&#xD;
      products at Posit Science that demonstrated a core ability to develop multimodal (i.e.,&#xD;
      assessment and treatment) applications with compelling user experiences that drive strong&#xD;
      performance improvements across multiple performance domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a single arm, open label, pilot clinical trial to examine&#xD;
      feasibility and initial efficacy of the HeartMapp+CT (HeartMapp and computerized&#xD;
      plasticity-based adaptive cognitive training). The study will enroll 32 adults aged 40 and&#xD;
      older with a diagnosis of HF and over sample by 25% to reduce attrition for a total of 24&#xD;
      participants. Participants will complete follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-months after&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome is to test the feasibility and initial efficacy of using HeartMapp&#xD;
           with computerized plasticity-based adaptive cognitive training (HeartMapp+CT), which&#xD;
           will be quantified by measuring app usage and engagement with the apps. Engagement with&#xD;
           cognitive training will be calculated as percentage of participants who complete 30&#xD;
           sessions of assigned cognitive training included in HeartMapp. App usability and&#xD;
           engagement will be assessed by App access by participants; Accessing App components at&#xD;
           least 80% of the days (72 days out of 90-days) will be used to determine app engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary outcomes are improvement in cognitive function and HF self-care. If an&#xD;
           effect sizes on Cohen's d of d=0.25 or greater relative to controls for these outcomes,&#xD;
           HeartMapp will be considered potentially efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory outcomes include improvement in quality of life, global health, medication&#xD;
           adherence, heart rate variability and hospital admission. The investigators will&#xD;
           calculate effect sizes using Cohen's d on these outcomes to inform future studies.&#xD;
