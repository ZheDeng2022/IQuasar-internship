  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve blocks are routinely performed perioperatively to provide anesthesia and analgesia for&#xD;
      various surgical procedures on the upper limb. These blocks are performed with the aid of an&#xD;
      ultrasound machine to improve the success rate. Below the clavicle approach to these nerves&#xD;
      is used for surgeries below the elbow, forearm and hand efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guidance for such blocks allows direct visualisation of the needle and the spread&#xD;
      of the freezing medication (local anesthetic) in real-time therefore reducing complications&#xD;
      and improving success rates of blocks. It may be possible that a smaller volume of local&#xD;
      anesthetic in this setting may allow effective anesthesia while lowering the adverse effects.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find out the lowest volume of the local anesthetic that will be&#xD;
      effective in blocking the nerves adequately.&#xD;

      This is a dose finding study. Volume assignment of ropivacaine will be carried out using a&#xD;
      Biased Coin Design up and down method. In this method, the volume of local anesthetic&#xD;
      (ropivacaine) administered to each patient will depends on the response of the previous&#xD;
      patient. In the event of block failure, the next subject will receive an additional 2 mL of&#xD;
      volume compared with the previous patient. In the event of block success, the next patient&#xD;
      will receive either the same volume as the last patient or a 2 mL reduction in volume (per&#xD;
      the biased coin design with a probability of the same volume being 0.9 and lower volume being&#xD;
      0.1). The first patient in the study will receive 30 mL and depending on the block success,&#xD;
      the volume of the next block will be increased or decreased. The biased coin design is well&#xD;
      described and established in other minimum volume studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have the block in the block room with standard monitoring (non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse-oximetry, electrocardiogram) and mild sedation with midazolam and&#xD;
      fentanyl. All blocks will be performed by staff anesthesiologists with a subspecialty in&#xD;
      regional anesthesia and who work routinely in the block room or by a resident or fellow who&#xD;
      is directly supervised by one of these staff anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two follow up telephone call to all patients enrolled in this study 24 hours&#xD;
      post block insertion and one at 7 days to discuss length of block duration, any postoperative&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting, any ongoing numbness or tingling, and overall satisfaction with the block.&#xD;
      The participants will be informed of this phone call as part of the consent process and their&#xD;
      telephone number will be confirmed.&#xD;
