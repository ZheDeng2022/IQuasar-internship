  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candida can cause infections. The most common kind of Candida at clinics is C albicans. But&#xD;
      other kinds have increased at clinics too. Researchers want to review the records of people&#xD;
      who were in previous NIH studies who had Candida. They want to find out what risk factors are&#xD;
      associaated with this infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the factors that are associated with Candida fungemia to develop. The factors are&#xD;
      clinical features, diagnoses, and previous antifungal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who were in prior NIH studies and had Candida&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will review the records of 62 NIH participants. The records are from 2004 to&#xD;
      2017. They will look at data such as blood test results, diagnosis, and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will only reach out to participants if they get approval from a review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will probably not reveal data that would be important to participants health.&#xD;
      But if it does, researchers will try to contact those participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored in secure computers. They will be stored with a code that only the study&#xD;
      team can link to a participant.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol is a chart review of patients who had Candida species grown from blood cultures&#xD;
      drawn at the National Institutes of Health. The study will involve only review of patient&#xD;
      records and will not require new specimens or participant contact. The patients whose records&#xD;
      will be reviewed in this protocol are/were enrolled on a number of different protocols&#xD;
      related to their underlying disease(s). Principal investigators of each protocol have been&#xD;
      contacted to request permission to conduct this study, and to verify that none of the&#xD;
      original protocols or informed consent documents precludes such a review of clinical data.&#xD;
