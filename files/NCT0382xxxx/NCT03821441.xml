      Trail To Evaluate the Immunity Duration of healthy children who already took part in &quot; The&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity by different sequential schedules of bOPV and bOPV in dragee candy&#xD;
      with sIPV, a randomized, double blind, single center and parallel phase Ⅲ clinic trial was&#xD;
      performed in Infants of two-month old in Guangxi Province, China&quot; and continue to search for&#xD;

      According to the requirement of the Strategy of Polio Eradication &amp; Endgame Strategic Plan&#xD;
      2013-2018, bivalent oral attenuated live poliomyelitis vaccine against type 1 and 3 (bOPV)&#xD;
      and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine made by Sabin strain (sIPV) need to be used to&#xD;
      eradiation both the wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived poliovirus. To evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity by different sequential immunization schedules of bOPV and bOPV in dragee&#xD;
      candy with sIPV,a randomized, double blind, single center and parallel phase Ⅲ clinic trial&#xD;
      was performed in Guangxi Province in China. A total of 1200 infants at 2 months old were&#xD;
      selected, and randomlydivided into 12 different groups (100 individuals were included in each&#xD;
      group) administrated the vaccines at 0, 28, 56 days schedule.The detail of each group as&#xD;
      following:1)1-dose cIPV + 2-dose bOPV (Candy); 2)1-dose sIPV + 2-dose bOPV (Candy); 3)2-dose&#xD;
      cIPV + 1-dose bOPV (Candy); 4)2-dose sIPV + 1-dose bOPV (Candy); 5)2-dose cIPV + 1-dose tOPV&#xD;
      (Candy); 6)2-dose sIPV + 1-dose tOPV (Candy); 7)1-dose cIPV + 2-dose bOPV (Liquid); 8)1-dose&#xD;
      sIPV + 2-dose bOPV (Liquid); 9)2-dose cIPV + 1-dose bOPV (Liquid); 10)2-dose sIPV + 1-dose&#xD;
      bOPV (Liquid); 11)2-dose cIPV + 1-dose tOPV (Liquid); 12)2-dose sIPV + 1-dose tOPV&#xD;
      (Liquid).Blood Sample was collected before vaccination and one month after the third dose of&#xD;
      vaccination. Neutralization antibody against type I, Type I and Type III poliomyelitis virus&#xD;
      were detected to evaluate the seroprotection rates and antibody geometric mean&#xD;
      concentrations. The fecal samples were collected to test viral shedding.The safety by&#xD;
      different sequential schedule of the vaccines was also evaluated.This part of study have&#xD;
      already been done in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further evaluate the immunity duration of different sequential immunization schedules for&#xD;
      bOPV and IPV ,more importantly,trying to research the effectiveness of bOPV booster&#xD;
      immunization,the previous study will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detail of the research as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject, who have already receipted 3-dose polio vaccine for primary immunization in&#xD;
      phase III clinical trail in Guangxi and with the result of the paired-serum, are recruited&#xD;
      again.In order to research the immunity durability of primary immunizations of primary&#xD;
      immunization(3 doses of immunization),blood samples are collected from the subject aged 24&#xD;
      months,36 months and 48 months separately.Neutralization antibody titers for against type I,&#xD;
      Type I and Type III poliomyelitis virus are detected,moreover,the positive rate and antibody&#xD;
      geometric mean titers are analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of bOPV（liquid/candy) will be given orally to subjects at the age of 48 months&#xD;
      which can in support of the effectiveness research of booster immunization with bOPV. To&#xD;
      protect the rights and interests of subjects,the investigator can use other poliovirus&#xD;
      vaccine such as IPV instead when bOPV（liquid/candy）is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticoagulant blood will be collected separatly at 48 months and the 28 days after&#xD;
      booster immunization from subjects,which will be used to detect cellular immune response.&#xD;
