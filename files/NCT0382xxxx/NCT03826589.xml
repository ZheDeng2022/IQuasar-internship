    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, Simon's 2-stage, proof-of-concept trial. The aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of avelumab with axitinib in patients with persistent or recurrent&#xD;
      cervical cancer following platinum-based chemotherapy. The study hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      combination of avelumab and axitinib can significantly improve the objective response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) with acceptable toxicity compared to traditional chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the fourth commonest female cancer in the world. When there is distant&#xD;
      metastasis or recurrence, platinum-based chemotherapy is the usual treatment option. Once&#xD;
      this first-line chemotherapy fails, the prognosis is dismal. Various second-line agents&#xD;
      including second-line chemotherapy agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors have&#xD;
      unsatisfactory response rate.&#xD;
