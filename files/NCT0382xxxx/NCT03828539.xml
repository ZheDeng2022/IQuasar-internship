  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study used a single-cohort, 2-treatment arm, parallel-group randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      double-dummy design in adult patients with episodic migraine and chronic migraine, who had to&#xD;
      be either naïve or not suitable for or could have failed up to three prophylactic treatments&#xD;
      out of: propranolol/metoprolol, amitriptyline, flunarizine. Patients were stratified into&#xD;
      groups according to their number of migraine days during the baseline period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients completing the Baseline period and fulfilling baseline eligibility criteria were&#xD;
      invited to participate to the Double-blind, double-dummy Treatment Epoch (DBTE, 24 weeks) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms. DBTE started with a titration&#xD;
      phase for topiramate of a maximum of 6 weeks to determine the maximal tolerated dose and&#xD;
      aimed to reach the recommended treatment dose of 100 mg according to the German SmPC. After&#xD;
      the titration phase, maintenance phase started (18 weeks). Topiramate dose had to be&#xD;
      maintained until the end of the DBTE. Erenumab dose at beginning of the DBTE was determined&#xD;
      patient individually by the investigator based on the guidance provided in the SmPC and was&#xD;
      either 70 mg or 140 mg. Dose escalation from 70 mg to 140 mg in case of insufficient response&#xD;
      was considered at anytime during the DBTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reduction of topiramate and erenumab was not allowed during DBTE (Week 0 to Week 24).&#xD;
      After Week 24 or if the patient discontinued study drug, a one week double-blind taper off&#xD;
      phase followed to ensure proper down titration for topiramate. At the end of the DBTE (24&#xD;
      weeks) the final assessment occurred to address the objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Follow-Up Visit 4 weeks after last study visit (or 8 weeks after last IMP injection for&#xD;
      discontinued patients) was required as part of routine safety monitoring. The primary&#xD;
      analysis was triggered when all patients had completed their respective last visit of the&#xD;
      DBTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The End of study occurred when the last patient completed last visit (LPLV).&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective was to demonstrate the tolerability of 70 mg and 140 mg erenumab compared to topiramate in the highest tolerated dose assessed by the rate of patients discontinuing treatment due to AE during the double-blind epoch of the study.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Last three months (month 4, 5, and 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of erenumab compared to topiramate on the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction from baseline in MMDs. The Baseline period was defined as the period between Week -4 and the day prior to first dose. This was analyzed by logistic regression over the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of treatment. All the subjects' data collected regarding 50% response in MMD was used in the analysis regardless of whether subjects discontinue study treatment or not. Subjects with missing response information on this endpoint were imputed as non-response (non-responder imputation).</description>

    <measure>EXPLORATORY ENDPOINT: Proportion of Patients Achieving at Least a 5 Points Reduction in the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HIT-6 is a widely used patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the negative effects of headaches on normal activity. Six items assess the frequency of pain severity, headaches limiting daily activity (household, work, school, and social), wanting to lie down when headache is experienced, feeling too tired to work or do daily activities because of headache, feeling &quot;fed up&quot; or irritated because of headache, and headaches limiting ability to concentrate or work on daily activities. Each of the 6 questions is responded to using 1 of 5 response categories: &quot;never,&quot; &quot;rarely,&quot; &quot;sometimes,&quot; &quot;very often,&quot; or &quot;always.&quot; For each HIT-6 item, 6, 8, 10, 11, or 13 points, respectively, are assigned to the response provided. These points are summed to produce a total HIT-6 score that ranges from 36 to 78. HIT-6 scores are categorized into 4 grades: little or no impact (49 or less), some impact (50 - 55), substantial impact (56 - 59), and severe impact (60 - 78) due to headache.</description>

    <measure>EXPLORATORY ENDPOINT: Proportion of Patients Achieving at Least a 5 Points Increase in the Medical Outcome Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36) From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a widely used and extensively studied instrument to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among healthy subjects and patients with acute and chronic conditions. It consists of eight subscales that can be scored individually: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) also can be computed. The SF-36 has proven useful in monitoring general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of different disease, differentiating the health benefits produced by different treatments, and in screening individual patients. The purpose of the SF-36 in this study was to assess the HRQoL of patients. Given the nature of this disease and the 4-weekly assessment, the SF-36 version 2, with a 4-week recall period, was used in this study.</description>

        <description>The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of erenumab compared to topiramate on the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction from baseline in MMDs. The Baseline period was defined as the period between Week -4 and the day prior to first dose. This was analyzed by logistic regression over the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of treatment. All the subjects' data collected regarding 50% response in MMD was used in the analysis regardless of whether subjects discontinue study treatment or not. Subjects with missing response information on this endpoint were imputed as non-response (non-responder imputation).</description>

Six items assess the frequency of pain severity, headaches limiting daily activity (household, work, school, and social), wanting to lie down when headache is experienced, feeling too tired to work or do daily activities because of headache, feeling &quot;fed up&quot; or irritated because of headache, and headaches limiting ability to concentrate or work on daily activities. Each of the 6 questions is responded to using 1 of 5 response categories: &quot;never,&quot; &quot;rarely,&quot; &quot;sometimes,&quot; &quot;very often,&quot; or &quot;always.&quot; For each HIT-6 item, 6, 8, 10, 11, or 13 points, respectively, are assigned to the response provided. These points are summed to produce a total HIT-6 score that ranges from 36 to 78. HIT-6 scores are categorized into 4 grades: little or no impact (49 or less), some impact (50 - 55), substantial impact (56 - 59), and severe impact (60 - 78) due to headache.</description>

        <title>EXPLORATORY ENDPOINT: Proportion of Patients Achieving at Least a 5 Points Increase in the Medical Outcome Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36) From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a widely used and extensively studied instrument to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among healthy subjects and patients with acute and chronic conditions. It consists of eight subscales that can be scored individually: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) also can be computed. The SF-36 has proven useful in monitoring general and specific populations, comparing the relative burden of different disease, differentiating the health benefits produced by different treatments, and in screening individual patients. The purpose of the SF-36 in this study was to assess the HRQoL of patients. Given the nature of this disease and the 4-weekly assessment, the SF-36 version 2, with a 4-week recall period, was used in this study.</description>
