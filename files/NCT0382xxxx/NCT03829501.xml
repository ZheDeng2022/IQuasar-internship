      A Phase 1/2, open label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability&#xD;
      of KY1044 as single agent and in combination with anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab) in adult patients&#xD;
      with selected advanced malignancies, who are ineligible for or there are no available&#xD;
      therapies known to confer a clinical benefit for their disease, or they have exhausted all&#xD;
      such available options in each indication and therefore will be patients for whom a clinical&#xD;
      trial is appropriate.&#xD;
