    <textblock>
      Experimental fear in rodents is correlated with slow oscillations in electrical recordings of&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex activities. The present study aims to test whether slow prefrontal&#xD;
      oscillations is a biomarker of pathological anxiety in human subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fear and anxiety are adaptive responses that may become excessive or inappropriate in&#xD;
      pathological conditions, as defined as anxiety disorders in DSM-5. These disorders, including&#xD;
      phobic disorders such as social anxiety disorder, are frequent and impairing in the general&#xD;
      population, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 28% and significant consequences on&#xD;
      quality of life. Direct and indirect medical costs related to these conditions amount to 74.4&#xD;
      billion €/year in Europe. Despite their prevalence, debilitating nature and chronicity, the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is poorly understood and neurobiological treatments,&#xD;
      including pharmacotherapy, are lacking efficacy. A better understanding of the neuronal&#xD;
      mechanisms implicated in anxiety is necessary for the conception of new approaches to treat&#xD;
      pathological anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety is commonly modeled in animals using fear conditioning, which consists in associating&#xD;
      a neutral stimulus (eg: a sound) with a mild electrical foot-shock. As a result of the&#xD;
      association between sound and shock, sound presentation in isolation induces a set of&#xD;
      conditioned behavioral responses, such as an immobilization (&quot;freezing&quot;). Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that the expression of fear responses, measured on the basis of freezing, is&#xD;
      associated with the emergence of slow oscillations (2-6Hz) in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)&#xD;
      of mice. Moreover, emergence of these oscillations in mPFC is predictive of the occurrence of&#xD;
      freezing, and the artificial induction of 4 Hz oscillations in mPFC with optogenetics induces&#xD;
      freezing. Finally, inhibiting neurons in mPFC during the ascending phase of this slow mPFC&#xD;
      oscillation at the time of conditioned sound presentation is sufficient to significantly&#xD;
      reduce fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, these results obtained in mice seem to find their prolongation in humans.&#xD;
      Recent studies using fear conditioning in human subjects have also reported the emergence of&#xD;
      prefrontal slow oscillations between 2-6 Hz during expression of conditioned fear responses.&#xD;
      These results suggests that common mechanisms underlie the expression of fear in humans and&#xD;
      rodents. However, whether similar neuronal circuits and mechanisms are implicated in human&#xD;
      anxiety disorders remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at assessing the presence of slow mPFC oscillations during expression of&#xD;
      anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. Beyond understanding of the neuronal&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying anxiety expression, this study could provide a biomarker of anxiety&#xD;
      with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.&#xD;

    <description>The presence of significant prefrontal oscillations in the EEG recording 2-6Hz band during in vivo social exposure (oral presentation to examiners) will be assessed in 10 subjects with social anxiety disorder. EEG will be recorded immediately before, during and after oral presentations to examiners.&#xD;
Psychometric evaluation will be performed prior to experimental sessions. Rating of anxiety levels will be performed by subjects using a Visual Analogue Scale of anxiety during each of the 3 experimental periods (wainting, presentation, recovery).&#xD;
Results of EEG recordings in the first 10 subjects will lead to continuation (presence of significant slow prefrontal oscillations during anxiety) or interruption (absence of signification oscillation) of the study.</description>
