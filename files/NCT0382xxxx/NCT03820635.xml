      The study will be conducted at Assiut University Hospital. Eligible subjects will be screened&#xD;
      for vascular calcification by Doppler ultrasound examination. A correation between the level&#xD;
      of serum Osteopontin (OPN) level and the extent of vascular calcification will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteopontin (OPN) is one of integrin-binding N-linked glycoproteins, which is produced by&#xD;
      activated mononuclear cells and is linked to increasing evidence about the role of OPN in&#xD;
      vascular calcification[1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical studies have shown that vascular calcification is a pathological process&#xD;
      leading to mechanical rigidity and stiffness of vascular wall, endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      development and accelerating atherosclerosis even in the absence of established&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) disease . Ectopic calcification is explained by several mutually&#xD;
      counteracting molecular mechanisms, i.e. oxidative stress, microvascular inflammation, immune&#xD;
      cell-to-cell cooperation, accumulation of lipids and extracellular proteins, vascular&#xD;
      reparative systems, and metabolic disorders All these processes are under tight regulation of&#xD;
      vitamin D, parathyroid hormone-related peptides (fibroblast growth factor, transcription&#xD;
      factor Sox2, beta-catenin, etc) and matricellular proteins such as OPN. [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPN was found to have relation with vascular calcification, atherosclerosis, and CV disease&#xD;
      associated with severe vascular remodelling including hypertension, chronic kidney disease,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus . In this context, OPN is a promising biomarker of vascular remodelling&#xD;
      closely related to inflammation intensity, glucose level and pro-thrombotic state with&#xD;
      promising predictive value for CV events [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a matricellular protein that was first identified in 1995 by Heingard et al. as&#xD;
      sialoprotein derived from bovine bone matrix . During the last decade a number of studies&#xD;
      analysed the role of OPN in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. This proposed&#xD;
      association needs confirmation and detailed description by further research [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, OPN has been reported to be highly expressed in the tubular epithelium of the renal&#xD;
      cortex and in glomeruli in rat and mouse models of diabetic nephropathy [5]. This was&#xD;
      associated with extensive macrophage accumulation in the kidney interstitium indicating that&#xD;
      OPN upregulation and macrophage recruitment may play a role in the tubulo-interstitial injury&#xD;
      in diabetic nephropathy [6]. Consistently, OPN/mice are protected from diabetes-induced&#xD;
      albuminuria and renal damage, possibly by modulating podocyte signaling and motility [7]. In&#xD;
      humans, plasma OPN levels are independently associated with presence and severity of diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy [8] Compelling evidence in the literature provides interesting clues about a link&#xD;
      between the rennin-angiotensin system (RAS) and OPN in diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;
      Diabetes-induced OPN expression and macrophage accumulation in the kidney interstitium of&#xD;
      diabetic rats are significantly ameliorated after treatment with the long acting ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor [9]. Showing that treatment with ramipril for nine month improves creatinine&#xD;
      clearance rate and decreases urinary protein excretion, systolic blood pressure, development&#xD;
      of glomerulosclerosis, tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in a&#xD;
      diabetics. Of note, all these effects of ACE inhibition were associated with markedly&#xD;
      suppressed OPN expression, suggesting that blockade of the RAS by ramipril may confer&#xD;
      renoprotection by decreasing OPN secretion in diabetic nephropathy [10]. Liver X receptors&#xD;
      (LXRs) have been identified as important lipid-dependent regulators of glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      immune functions in leukocytes [11]. Synthetic LXR ligands can inhibit cytokine-induced OPN&#xD;
      expression in macrophages [12]. Tachibana and colleges recently observed decreased urinary&#xD;
      albumin excretion and substantially attenuated macrophage infiltration, mesangial matrix&#xD;
      accumulation and interstitial fibrosis in streptozotocin-induced diabetics following&#xD;
      administration of the LXR agonist T0901317. Notably, this was paralleled by diminished OPN&#xD;
      expression in the kidney cortex indicating that inhibition of renal OPN by LXR activation may&#xD;
      provide a potential therapeutical approach for diabetic nephropathy [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein expressed by several different cell types,&#xD;
      although the bone is known to be a major source [14].The exact excretion pathway of OPN from&#xD;
      the body is not known. OPN is involved in a number of physiological and pathological&#xD;
      conditions, including (1), urinary stones (2), wound healing (3), chronic inflammatory and&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases (4), obesity-related chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.&#xD;
      However, OPN was originally found in bone and shown to regulate the formation and&#xD;
      calcification of bone tissue. [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, OPN has also been linked to vascular remodelling and calcification, especially in&#xD;
      diabetic arteries, and has been shown to associate with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy&#xD;
      in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in&#xD;
      diabetic subjects with history of long standing diabetes. [16]&#xD;
