    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. It is still a&#xD;
      challenging task to detect colorectal cancer at an early stage. Studies have found that DNA&#xD;
      methylation has a relationship with the occurrence and development of tumors. Singlera&#xD;
      Genomics Inc. has invented the proprietary methyl-Titan sequencing technology and developed a&#xD;
      detection method for colorectal cancer and advanced adenoma (Adenoma/Colorectal cancer Early&#xD;
      detection, ACE) using the cancer-specific methylation markers. ACE is a blood-based&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic technique. It has high compliance rate compared with colonoscopy, and&#xD;
      sampling is more convenient than stool testing. It also has much higher sensitivity compared&#xD;
      to existing blood testing methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study plans to use ACE method to analyze ctDNA in the blood for the&#xD;
      cancer-specific DNA methylation markers to aid in the differential diagnosis of patients with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer or adenoma. This technique will greatly reduce the discomfort in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of suspected patients and improve the diagnosis of high-risk population of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are: 1) to establish a detection system based on plasma ctDNA&#xD;
      methylation sequencing technology for the auxiliary diagnosis of colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      adenoma, 2) to assess the diagnostic value of plasma ctDNA methylation signature for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and adenoma, and 3) to assess the association of plasma ctDNA methylation&#xD;
      signals with colonoscopy results and pathological results of surgical specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1300 patients (700 cases positive and 600 cases negative) aging between 45 and 80&#xD;
      years old will be enrolled. Colonoscopy will be performed to determine whether patients are&#xD;
      positive or negative. Positive patients who need surgical resection will be further&#xD;
      classified according to their surgical histopathological results. For negative patients, the&#xD;
      type of lesion will be clarified. The plasma samples of all subjects will be analyzed for&#xD;
      cancer-specific ctDNA methylation profiles. Based on the results of plasma ctDNA methylation&#xD;
      test, the risks of colorectal cancer of the enrolled subjects are scored. Combined with the&#xD;
      grouping information, the clinical application value of the cancer-specific methylation&#xD;
      profile for early cancer diagnosis will be assessed.&#xD;

      1. Research Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Diagnosis of colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer is a common malignant tumor of the&#xD;
           digestive tract. According to statistics from 2015, both morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
           colorectal cancer in China are among the top five of all cancers. Studies have shown&#xD;
           that the five-year survival rate of patients can achieve 90% if patients are diagnosed&#xD;
           before the spread of tumor cells. However only 40% of patients are currently diagnosed&#xD;
           at early stage. Therefore, treatment in the early stage of the disease is a necessary&#xD;
           means to cope with colorectal cancer. The main method used clinically for diagnosis is&#xD;
           colonoscopy. This method is accurate, but limited by many factors, such as diarrhea,&#xD;
           intestinal perforation, and need to be prepared in many ways before the examination. The&#xD;
           patients need to eat fluid diet, clean the intestines, etc. Other diagnostic methods&#xD;
           such as imaging, histopathological examination have a low detection rate, or cause&#xD;
           damage to the organ. Therefore, it is a still challenging task to detect colorectal&#xD;
           cancer at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Detection of ctDNA methylation in colorectal cancer patients and clinical studies&#xD;
           Epigenetics refers to a heritable phenotypic change without a change in the primary&#xD;
           sequence of the DNA. DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic modification pathways,&#xD;
           which can cause changes in chromatin structure and DNA stability, and regulate gene&#xD;
           transcription and expression. Studies have found that DNA methylation has an close&#xD;
           relationship with the occurrence and development of tumors. DNA methylation changes&#xD;
           occur at numerous sites of DNA in tumor cells as compared to normal cells. Further&#xD;
           studies show that DNA methylation occur early in the process of cancer, making it&#xD;
           possible to use DNA methylation for early screening of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on the research paper published by professor Kun Zhang in Nature Genetics,&#xD;
           Singlera Genomics Inc. invented the proprietary methyl-Titan sequencing technology and&#xD;
           developed a detection method for colorectal cancer and advanced adenoma&#xD;
           (Adenoma/Colorectal cancer Early detection, ACE). ACE is a blood-based non-invasive&#xD;
           diagnostic technique. It has high compliance rate compared with colonoscopy, and&#xD;
           sampling is more convenient than stool testing. It also has much higher sensitivity&#xD;
           compared to existing blood testing methods. Based on these advantages, the ACE&#xD;
           technology is suitable for early colorectal cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the development stage Singlera Genomics Inc. used a high-throughput and&#xD;
           high-coverage screening method for 4 million CpG methylation sites in the genome, and&#xD;
           analyzed different stages of colorectal cancer, adenoma, polyp tissue samples and paired&#xD;
           normal tissues to screen colorectal cancer-related methylation sites. Plasma samples&#xD;
           from cancer patients and healthy people were also analyzed to select ctDNA methylation&#xD;
           markers for colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The current study plans to use ACE method to analyze ctDNA in the blood for the&#xD;
           cancer-specific DNA methylation markers to aid in the differential diagnosis of patients&#xD;
           with colorectal cancer and adenoma. This technique will greatly reduce the discomfort in&#xD;
           the diagnosis of suspected patients and improve the diagnosis of high-risk population of&#xD;
           colorectal cancer. The higher detection rate is beneficial to the early detection and&#xD;
           early treatment of colorectal cancer, which will effectively save medical costs and&#xD;
           improve the survival rate of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research goals&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Primary goals To establish a detection system based on plasma ctDNA methylation&#xD;
           sequencing technology for the auxiliary diagnosis of colorectal cancer and adenoma; To&#xD;
           assess the diagnostic value of plasma ctDNA methylation signature for colorectal cancer&#xD;
           and adenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Secondary goals To assess the association of plasma ctDNA methylation signals with&#xD;
           colonoscopy results and pathological results of surgical specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Research design and planning This study was a prospective, open, controlled,&#xD;
           multicenter study. The enrolled samples contain a positive group (including colorectal&#xD;
           cancer stage I-IV, advanced adenoma) and a negative group (non-advanced adenoma,&#xD;
           patients with negative pathological examination, healthy people with negative&#xD;
           colonoscopy results, benign hyperplasia and inflammatory colorectal disease without&#xD;
           dysplasia). The sample sizes are: 700 cases positive and 600 cases negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Number of cases and grouping scheme This trial plans to enroll 1300 subjects, which&#xD;
           will be assigned into two groups. The positive group includes 300 cases of colorectal&#xD;
           cancer (stage I-IV) and 400 cases of advanced adenoma (high grade dysplasia, villous&#xD;
           adenoma, tubular adenoma, serrated lesions, etc.). The negative group (600 cases in&#xD;
           total) includes: non-advanced adenomas (size≤10mm, no less than 100 cases), inflammatory&#xD;
           colorectal disease, benign hyperplasia, tumor-free patients upon histopathological&#xD;
           review, and normal healthy people.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3 Research procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.1 Patient screening The researcher will ask each subject for basic information,&#xD;
           history of illness, family history, medication history, and whether or not they have&#xD;
           participated related clinical trials to determine if they meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
           Based on their records the subjects who meet the inclusion criteria are first divided in&#xD;
           a simple positive group and a negative group. An informed consent form will be signed&#xD;
           for each enrolled patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All subjects who complete the initial grouping will have their peripheral venous blood&#xD;
           collected before undergoing colonoscopy and clinical management. 20 ml of the blood&#xD;
           sample is centrifuged according to the ctDNA detection plasma separation requirements.&#xD;
           The supernatant plasma is collected and immediately refrigerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.2 Clinical exam Colonoscopy is performed on all subjects (except those having&#xD;
           surgical pathology results). For patients with intestinal lesions, colonoscopy is&#xD;
           performed to determine whether they are positive or negative. Positive patients who need&#xD;
           surgical resection will be further classified according to their surgical&#xD;
           histopathological results. For negative patients, the type of lesion should be&#xD;
           clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.3 ACE testing All the plasma samples of the subjects assigned to specific groups are&#xD;
           transported to Shanghai Singlera Genomics Inc. (No. 20, Lane 500, Furonghua Road, Pudong&#xD;
           New Area, Shanghai). cfDNA is extracted from patient plasma, and cancer-specific DNA&#xD;
           methylation profile is analyzed. According to the results of plasma ctDNA methylation&#xD;
           test, the risk of colorectal cancer of the enrolled subjects is scored, and combined&#xD;
           with grouping information to assess the clinical application value of the&#xD;
           cancer-specific methylation profile in ctDNA for early cancer and adenoma diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.4 End point determination The positive subjects are determined based on the results of&#xD;
           surgical histopathological examination; the negative subjects are determined based on&#xD;
           colonoscopy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ctDNA methylation profile is analyzed for positive and negative subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Sample size estimation The results of this study are colorectal cancer-specific&#xD;
      methylation signals from peripheral blood ctDNA. The methylation signals will all be&#xD;
      superimposed with a certain weight, and the final score is in a single number form. Our&#xD;
      preliminary results showed that the mean value of the control group (μ1) was 0.36, and the&#xD;
      mean value of the test group (μ2) was 0.73. The mean difference between groups was δ = μ2 -&#xD;
      μ1= 0.37, the standard deviation σ of the overall sample standard deviation s is 0.42. Set&#xD;
      the check level α to 0.005 on both sides. The verification performance β is 0.005, and the t&#xD;
      value table is queried to obtain t(α) = 2.807, t(β) = 2.576.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following formula is used to calculate the sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 2*((tα + tβ)*S/δ)2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculated result is n = 74.68, which is rounded to 75. Considering that the enrolled&#xD;
      samples may have 25% unusable cases, the minimum test group sample size was set to 100 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive group 1, colorectal cancer stage I-IV, no need to allocate groups in each&#xD;
      sub-category. Considering balancing the number of samples between other groups, the sample&#xD;
      size is set to 300 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive group 2, advanced adenoma, according to the &quot;Guidelines for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of colorectal cancer&quot;, the advanced adenomas are divided into four categories.&#xD;
      There is no need for equal distribution in different categories, with an average of 100 cases&#xD;
      per category, for a total of 400 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The negative group is divided into three categories. Non-advanced adenomas need to be&#xD;
      differentiated from positive adenomas in positive group 2, and need a minimum sample size of&#xD;
      100 cases. Other categories do not require a specific sample size. Considering balancing with&#xD;
      other groups the sample size is set to a total of 600 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Statistics and data analysis Sequencing data for each sample was evaluated for sequencing&#xD;
      quality using a variety of parameters, including whether the sequencing data reaches a preset&#xD;
      level; whether the Q30 value is acceptable; whether the CpG site is balanced, whether the&#xD;
      coverage is up to standard, whether the amplicon sequencing depth is as expected, and whether&#xD;
      the sequencing uniformity is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cancer-specific DNA methylation signals in the sequencing results are summarized and&#xD;
      analyzed according to the model established in our previous studies. Each signal value is&#xD;
      superimposed with a certain weight to obtain a methylation score for each sample. Combined&#xD;
      with the grouping information of each sample, PCA, clustering and other classification&#xD;
      analysis are performed for each sample. The methylation signals are then converted to a&#xD;
      colorectal cancer/adenoma risk score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the differences of risk scores between negative group and positive group, the&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicted values are calculated, and the clinical&#xD;
      application efficacy of the cancer-specific methylation signal in plasma ctDNA is evaluated.&#xD;
