      A private trial for evaluating the overall response rate contributed by AMPC in AML in&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed AML&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After inclusion and exclusion criteria has been determined and approved, written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the candidate. All medical history relevant to the diagnosis of&#xD;
      AML will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening period could extend from 0 to 7 days depending on the completion of screening&#xD;
      laboratory results as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day -5 (up to day -1), the patient will undergo a screening test for the following test&#xD;
      items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BUN, creatinine, electrolyte, liver function test (LFT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full blood count (FBC), including blood smear&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B/C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human T lymphocytic virus type I and II (HTLV-I/II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV1/2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Syphilis serology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mycoplasma serology For Hepatitis B/C,HTLV-I/II, HIV1/2, Syphilis serology, and&#xD;
           Mycoplasma serology, these tests obtained up to 3 months prior to day -5 can be allowed&#xD;
           for using as screening result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow study including aspiration with wright's stain, biopsy, flow cytometry, and&#xD;
           chromosome study (Any molecular testing for AML is optional.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy can be omitted if the prior study performed within 14 days before day-5&#xD;
      and the available materials (core biopsy and slides) and result can be obtained for&#xD;
      pathological review. In this case, only bone marrow aspiration for Wright's stain, flow&#xD;
      cytometry, and chromosome study will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy will be repeated if the previous result has been performed more than 14&#xD;
      days prior to day -5 and/or FBC at day -5 reveals peripheral blast count higher than 10% of&#xD;
      total white blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For chromosome study (cytogenetics), the previous result before the recent line of&#xD;
      chemotherapy prior to enrollment can be used for the screening data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0, peripheral blood will then be collected, ranging from 250mL to 400mL depending on&#xD;
      candidate fitness. The blood is collected into a sterile blood bag and sealed. Subsequent&#xD;
      processes will be conducted in the blood bag within a closed-system to minimize contamination&#xD;
      risks. FBC will be collected in order to determine the disease status. After that, the&#xD;
      investigator will consider to prescribe blood transfusion for the candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0 to day 3, the collected blood will be sent to the laboratory for stem cell culture,&#xD;
      and a sample of the collected blood will be sent to a third-party laboratory for&#xD;
      contamination testing of the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bacterial endotoxin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total viable aerobic count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total viable count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microbial growth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mycoplasma real-time PCR test&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 4, the biotest results will be released and the safety profiles of the AMPC product&#xD;
      must be completed and passed before the cultured stem cells may be released for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 5, candidates will receive an infusion of the cultured stem cells. Prior to the&#xD;
      infusion, FBC and blood chemistry (BUN, Cr, electrolyte, LFT) will be collected and the&#xD;
      treating doctor will first conduct an allergy skin test to determine suitability for&#xD;
      reinfusion. The cultured stem cells are then reinfused intravenously into the candidate in a&#xD;
      process that could take up to 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      The candidate participation will take place on day 0 to day 1 or 2 (if blood transfusion is&#xD;
      required) and day 5 (period adjusted for blood transfusion if required) for peripheral blood&#xD;
      collection and stem cell reinfusion respectively; with 12 month follow up after treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 days post-treatment follow-up: full blood count test and blood smear, BUN, Cr,&#xD;
           electrolyte, LFT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 days post-treatment follow-up: full blood count test and blood smear, BUN, Cr,&#xD;
           electrolyte, LFT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 month (+/-7 days) post-treatment follow-up: full blood count test and blood smear,&#xD;
           BUN, Cr, electrolyte, LFT, bone marrow study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 month (+/-7 days) post-treatment follow-up: full blood count test and blood smear,&#xD;
           BUN, Cr, electrolyte, LFT, bone marrow study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 month (+/-7 days) post-treatment follow-up: full blood count test with bone marrow&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 month (+/-7 days) post-treatment follow-up: full blood count test with bone marrow&#xD;
