  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational, prospective and multicenter study in approximately 25 sites nationwide. The&#xD;
      investigators participating in this study will be rheumatologists specializing in this&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients diagnosed with PsA (according to the CASPAR diagnosis&#xD;
      criteria), naïve to biological treatments, who have - following the routine practice in their&#xD;
      centers - initiated treatment with apremilast 6 months (±1 months) before their inclusion in&#xD;
      the study, irrespective of treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be consecutive and the reason for not including a potential candidate&#xD;
      patient will be registered. The decision to prescribe apremilast treatment should be clearly&#xD;
      dissociated from the inclusion of the patient in the study, which will not occur earlier than&#xD;
      6 months (± 4 weeks after treatment start). Therefore, the choice of the therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      will be made independently by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before entering the study, all patients shall sign an informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study, including permission to retrieve data from their medical records and to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid recruitment biases and obtain a homogeneous cohort regarding treatment duration, all&#xD;
      consecutive patients who attend to a routine follow-up visit and have been prescribed&#xD;
      apremilast 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) before the baseline visit, will be offered to enter the&#xD;
      study. All consecutive patients who can be contacted 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) following&#xD;
      initiation of treatment with apremilast will be approached for entry to minimize bias in&#xD;
      patient selection&#xD;
