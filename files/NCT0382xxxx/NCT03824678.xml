  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to assess the PK of a single 1-mg oral dose of CC-220&#xD;
      in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, and in matched healthy&#xD;
      control subjects with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degree of hepatic impairment will be determined during the Screening period by the subject's&#xD;
      score according to Child-Pugh Classification Criteria&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 5 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with mild hepatic impairment (with a&#xD;
           Child Pugh score of ≥ 5 to ≤ 6) will be enrolled in Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (with&#xD;
           a Child Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with severe hepatic impairment (with a&#xD;
           Child Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Approximately 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic function&#xD;
           will be enrolled in Group 4. Subjects in Group 4 will be matched to subjects in Group 2&#xD;
           with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5: Approximately 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic function&#xD;
           will be enrolled in Group 5. Subjects in Group 5 will be matched to subjects in Group 3&#xD;
           with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function may start the study in parallel.&#xD;

             (condoms not made out of natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are recommended])&#xD;
             during sexual contact with a pregnant female or FCBP while participating in the study,&#xD;
             and for at least 90 days after the dose of IP, even if he has undergone a successful&#xD;
             vasectomy.&#xD;

             acceptable to the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject is afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38°C or 100.4°F), with sitting systolic&#xD;
             blood pressure ≥ 90 and ≤ 160 mm Hg, sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ 50 and ≤ 100&#xD;
             mm Hg, and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 100 beats per minute at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Each subject with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment must also meet all of&#xD;
             the criteria listed below for entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment or cirrhosis due to chronic&#xD;
             hepatic disease and/or prior alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has mild (Group 1), moderate (Group 2), or severe (Group 3) hepatic impairment&#xD;
             as defined by Child-Pugh score.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 1 subjects (mild hepatic impairment) are required to have documentary&#xD;
                  confirmation of the diagnosis of liver impairment made by biopsy, laparoscopy, or&#xD;
                  ultrasound with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 5 to ≤ 6 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 2 subjects (moderate hepatic impairment) are required to have documentary&#xD;
                  confirmation of the diagnosis of liver impairment made by biopsy, laparoscopy, or&#xD;
                  ultrasound with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Group 3 subjects (severe hepatic impairment): if biopsy, laparoscopy, or&#xD;
                  ultrasound is not performed prior to Screening, subjects can be included only if&#xD;
                  they have chronic liver disease and objective evidence of portal hypertension&#xD;
                  (ascites diagnosed by imaging or varices), with a Child-Pugh score ≥ 10 and ≤ 13&#xD;
                  at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects should be enrolled into the group corresponding to the Child-Pugh&#xD;
             classification score that most accurately reflects the most severe hepatic disease&#xD;
             classification within the past 6 months (based on past medical history or PE&#xD;
             observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If a Child-Pugh score was previously calculated and documented in the last 6&#xD;
             months, and it is more severe than the one calculated at Screening, then that previous&#xD;
             value may be used for study entry purposes. If the Screening Child-Pugh score is more&#xD;
             severe, then it will be used. If no score was calculated in the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening, then the score obtained at Screening will be used. Adequate documentation&#xD;
             should be provided to substantiate the Child-Pugh score assigned to each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject must be medically stable for at least 1 month before Screening with clinically&#xD;
             acceptable medical history, PEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and 12-lead&#xD;
             ECGs consistent with the underlying hepatic impairment condition, as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject is stable on a concomitant medication regimen (defined as not starting a new&#xD;
             medication[s] or a change in the dosage or frequency of the concomitant medication[s]&#xD;
             within 7 days or 5 half-lives [whichever is longer] before dosing with CC-220).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject may be treated with diuretics for ascites; however, subjects with severe&#xD;
             ascites at time of enrollment may only be included at the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator with agreement of Celgene.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject may have a history of encephalopathy; however, they must be on stable&#xD;
             treatment for at least 1 month prior to Screening and must not have had an acute&#xD;
             severe encephalopathic episode in the 1 month prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at Screening (QT interval&#xD;
             corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula [QTcF] ≤ 480 msec).&#xD;

             Each matched healthy subject must also meet all the criteria listed below for entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject is free of any CS disease that would interfere with the study evaluations and&#xD;
             has not had any unstable CS illness within 3 months prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject has liver-related laboratory test results within the respective reference&#xD;
             ranges or with clinically insignificant excursions therefrom as agreed by the&#xD;
             Investigator and Celgene's Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject must match a subject in Group 2 or 3, as needed, primarily with respect to&#xD;
             sex, age (± 10 years) and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]). Group 4 subjects will be&#xD;
             matched with subjects from Group 2, and Group 5 subjects will be matched with Group 3&#xD;
             subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subject is in good health as determined by past medical history, PEs, vital signs,&#xD;
             ECG, and clinical laboratory results. Clinical laboratory results (ie, hematology,&#xD;
             chemistry, and urinalysis) and 12-lead ECGs must be within normal limits or clinically&#xD;
             acceptable as judged by the Investigator. In addition:&#xD;
