    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose, clinical trial&#xD;
      examining the safety and biological effects of allogeneic fresh human umbilical cord&#xD;
      tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell product BX-U001, given by intravenous (IV) infusion, to&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with moderate to severe disease activity, who are not well&#xD;
      controlled by their current treatments. Two doses of BX-U001 will be tested in 16 patients.&#xD;
      The subjects will receive a one-time IV infusion of BX-U001 and monitored for 52 weeks.&#xD;

      This is a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose, clinical trial&#xD;
      examining the safety and biological effects of allogeneic fresh human umbilical cord&#xD;
      tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell product BX-U001, given by IV infusion, to RA patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe disease activity, who are not well controlled by their current&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cohorts of patients will be recruited sequentially, and each cohort includes 8 patients.&#xD;
      In each cohort, eligible patients will be randomized to the two treatment arms at the ratio&#xD;
      of 3:1 (BX-U001: Placebo). The patients in the first cohort will receive a single infusion of&#xD;
      BX-U001 at dose of 0.75×10^6 cells/kg body weight or placebo. In the second cohort, the&#xD;
      patients will receive a single infusion of BX-U001 at dose of 1.5×10^6 cells/kg body weight&#xD;
      or placebo. After the one-time infusion on Day 1, patients will be monitored for 52 weeks.&#xD;
      During the study, besides BX-U001 or placebo infusion, patients will remain treated with&#xD;
      their previous conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than biologics) in the same dosage/way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Week 12, the patients will undergo efficacy evaluations to determine their&#xD;
      response to treatment using the response rate of American College of Rheumatology 20%&#xD;
      improvement criteria (ACR20). For patients who lack response to treatment as defined by not&#xD;
      achieving 20% improvement on tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) at Week&#xD;
      12, they will receive standard of care treatment including csDMARDs, biologic DMARDs&#xD;
      (bDMARDs) and adjunctive agents such as corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and analgesics at Week 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study duration is planned to be 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>The DAS28-CRP is a composite measure of inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis and incorporates a tender and swollen joint count, CRP and Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity expressed in a Gaussian distribution of variables ranging from 0 to 10. A DAS28-CRP score of &lt;3.2 suggests a low level of disease activity, while a score of &gt;5.1 suggests a high level of disease activity.</description>

SDAI total score= 0 to 86. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt;3.3 to 11 = low disease activity, &gt;11 to 26 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;26 = high disease activity.</description>
