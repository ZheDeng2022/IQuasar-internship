             discretion of the principal investigator or designated licensed clinical investigator&#xD;
             and reasoning must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Screening laboratory values must be within normal range or not clinically significant&#xD;
             as determined by the PI and approved by the Medical Monitor: sodium, potassium, BUN,&#xD;
             ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, random glucose, WBC with&#xD;
             differential, hemoglobin, and platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Negative HIV 1/2 antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus&#xD;

          6. Urine test result for recreational drugs/drugs of abuse that in the opinion of the PI&#xD;
             would not be a concern for subject's safety, or ability to reliably attend visits, and&#xD;

             history of chickenpox, previous vaccination against VZV with Varivax® (or other&#xD;
             low-titer live-attenuated varicella vaccine), or positive serology test for VZV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must be able to understand informed consent in English and capable of completing a&#xD;
             study diary card in English.&#xD;

             controlled hypertension), or use of medication that, in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;

             who are likely to be unreliable in attending study visits or other reason that the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator determines that the subject will not be a good candidate to&#xD;
