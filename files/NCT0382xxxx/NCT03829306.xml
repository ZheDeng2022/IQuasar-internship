      This exploratory project is a prospective and multicenter study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to Kadcyla in a cohort of 50&#xD;
      progressive/recurrent HER2+ BC patients planned to be treated with Kadcyla within the&#xD;
      approved indication in Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect high quality molecular data derived from the analysis of serial&#xD;
      biological samples (primary tumor and/or metastatic tissue, plasma, serum and whole blood&#xD;
      samples), together with annotated clinical follow up, to reach a better understanding of the&#xD;
      biological events that drive breast cancer progression and response/resistance to Kadcyla in&#xD;
      ABC patients.&#xD;
