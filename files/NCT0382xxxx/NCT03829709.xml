      The main objective of the research will be to analyze, through surface electromyography, the&#xD;
      impact of inspiratory muscle training before a supervised home training protocol in patients&#xD;
      with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). For this, a clinical, longitudinal,&#xD;
      prospective, quantitative and single center trial will be carried out, aiming at home&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training lasting 5 weeks, 3 times a week, 30 minutes daily through the IMT&#xD;
      Threshold, with 14 volunteers enrolled in the Laboratory of Studies in Functional&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (LAERF) of the Federal University of Pará (UFPA). They will be classified as&#xD;
      the manifestation of Tropical Spastic Paraparesis / Myelopathy (PET / MAH) for GP (PET / MAH&#xD;
      probable) and GD (PET / MAH definitive) groups, obeying inclusion criteria. For&#xD;
      characterization of expiratory flow rates and flows, as well as respiratory muscle strength,&#xD;
      they will be submitted to spirometry and manovacuometry, pre, per, and post treatment,&#xD;
      respectively. For the analysis of the electromyographic activity, the diaphragm, parasternal&#xD;
      and sternocleidomastoid muscles will be counted in the follow-up during the analysis of&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength, as well as once a week during the conduction of the inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle training protocol. The collected data will be stored in a Microsoft Office Excel® 2010&#xD;
      worksheet and then submitted to statistical analysis using the Bioestat 5.0® program,&#xD;
      adopting a standard error of 5%. The theoretical support of the research will have a&#xD;
      bibliographical survey of scientific articles collected during the design of the project, and&#xD;
      the accomplishment of the research. It is expected to map, through the surface&#xD;
      electromyographic study, the impact of respiratory muscle training at a distance on the&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength of patients with HTLV-I virus with probable or definitive PET /&#xD;
      MAH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human T-lymphotropic viruses, HTLV (Human Lymphotrophic Virus T), are retroviruses, which&#xD;
      stand out as type 1 (HTLV-1) and type 2 (HTLV-2), the former being the etiologic agent of&#xD;
      serious organ diseases such as leukemia adult T-cell lymphoma (ATLL), a neurological&#xD;
      disorder, Tropical Spastic Paraparesis / HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (PET / HAM) and other&#xD;
      non-malignant ophthalmologic, dermatological, rheumatic and osteomyelitis non-malignant&#xD;
      disorders. For HTLV-2 it has not yet separated with some disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest prevalence of virus is found in countries of the Caribbean, South America,&#xD;
      Melanesia Islands, West Africa and Japan. Brazil is an endemic country for infection and&#xD;
      prevalence varies from state to state, being highest in Bahia, Pernambuco and Pará. The form&#xD;
      of sexual transmission, hematologic for blood transfusions or accompanied by contaminated&#xD;
      needles, mother-to-child verticalization, the passage of the lymphocyte infected by breast&#xD;
      milk and also in the perinatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of the disease comes from the infection of several types of cells, such as T&#xD;
      and B lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts. However, its tropism is by TCD4 + cells. The&#xD;
      form of contamination is cell-cell, thus being transferred from infected material to&#xD;
      uninfected cells, modifying the immune system, as well as cell cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main characteristic of HTLV infection is that in most cases the virus persists&#xD;
      asymptomatic and undetectable by the immune system per year or until death in about 98% of&#xD;
      the patients, while the hosts are able to transmit the virus. There are still no basic&#xD;
      surveys on how severe forms of symptoms of graves occur in those infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, when the individual becomes symptomatic, he is affected by chronic infection&#xD;
      that may be associated with disabling diseases that compromise quality of life, such as the&#xD;
      neurological disease PET-MAH. The onset is insidious with frequent changes in gait and&#xD;
      urinary symptoms, mainly affecting the lower limbs such as spasticity, hyperreflexia,&#xD;
      sensory-motor dysfunctions such as neuropathic or nociceptive pain, paresis, paralysis and&#xD;
      paresthesia, urinary bladder disorders, muscle weakness and low back pain. The early&#xD;
      diagnosis of motor complications in the face of the onset of neurological disease also&#xD;
      contributes to the prevention of the installation of motor sensory sequelae if the&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic treatment is established early. According to this reference, one of the&#xD;
      aspects of preventive care refers to the functional autonomy correlated with physical&#xD;
      conditioning in order to increase the strength and / or endurance of the skeletal muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, the possibility of morphological and functional changes in the respiratory&#xD;
      system is also highlighted. With preventive therapeutic possibilities, the respiratory muscle&#xD;
      training (TMR) appears to this indicator with reference to the maximum inspiratory and&#xD;
      expiratory pressures (PiMáx and PeMáx). This procedure directly reflects on the patient's&#xD;
      functionality, having as guideline the conduction of training protocols. The protocol should&#xD;
      be conducted at least three days weekly frequently twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One tool to evaluate muscular behavior during TMR is surface electromyography (EMGs), which&#xD;
      consists of a non-invasive detection of the muscular electrical activity by which it is&#xD;
      presented graphically. It is constituted by the transcription of the sum of the electrical&#xD;
      activity of all the active muscle fibers, through the positioning of electrodes on the skin.&#xD;
      Thus, in order to verify the muscular activity of the respiratory dynamics related to&#xD;
      inspiration, the main groups are the diaphragm, parasternal intercostal, sternocleidomastoid,&#xD;
      abdominal rectus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the training requires time, availability and greater displacement of the patient&#xD;
      to the outpatient treatment units, thus causing difficulties in adherence to the proposed&#xD;
      therapy. To that end, it has been proposed ways that facilitate such conduction, such as home&#xD;
      treatments, which, in most cases, the patient is supervised by the physiotherapist at least&#xD;
      once a week presently followed by distance monitoring.&#xD;

    <description>The evaluation of respiratory muscle strength will be performed by measuring the maximal inspiratory pressure (PiMáx) and expiratory (PeMAx) measurements with manovacuometer (+ - 300cmH2O). In order to perform the measurement of PiMáx and PeMáx, referring to inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength respectively. The values can range from 0 to 300 cmH2O, being 0 no strength and 300 maximum respiratory muscle strength.</description>

    <description>The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) will be performed in the morning shift for 30 minutes, 3 times a week for 5 weeks. The first training session each week will be held at the LAERF under the direct supervision of the investigator and the other two home-based training sessions under the supervisor's distance supervision. They will receive the Threshold® IMT linear loading device, and guidelines for handling, posture and asepsis. The initial training load for each participant will be adjusted to 25% of PiMáx. Participants will be trained and instructed to do the exercise program on their own at home. Once a week, during the return to the laboratory the researcher will determine the new values for load (1st week 25%, 2nd week 35%, 3rd week 40%, 4th week 45%, 5th week 50%).</description>
