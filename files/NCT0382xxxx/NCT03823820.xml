    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to find out if using a simple bed side test can tell us&#xD;
      information about changes that occur in women's body water content. We would like to check if&#xD;
      certain medical conditions could affect body water contents.&#xD;

      Maternal cardiovascular physiology evolves during the course of pregnancy to accommodate the&#xD;
      growing foetus. In order that the uterine artery can deliver 10% of the entire maternal&#xD;
      cardiac output, there are considerable structural and physiological changes that take place.&#xD;
      There is a 30% increase in global arterial compliance, predominantly due to vasodilation at&#xD;
      the level of the renal arteries, which leads to a reduced total peripheral resistance. Stroke&#xD;
      volume increases due to the plasma expansion and increasing total blood volume. All water&#xD;
      compartments show an absolute and relative increase with advancing gestation and eventually&#xD;
      water represents the largest component of weight gain in pregnancy. These changes have been&#xD;
      measured and known to clinicians for decades. Yet, it is only in the recent past, that the&#xD;
      possible clinical relevance of assessing total body water and extracellular body water has&#xD;
      been enhanced by the cross over of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with obesity&#xD;
      epidemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) measures whole body (or regional) impedance by means&#xD;
      of an electric current transmitted at different frequencies. New techniques allow measurement&#xD;
      of total body water with separation into extracellular and intracellular water. Current&#xD;
      evidence suggests that BIA may provide useful information not only in different&#xD;
      well-established patient groups (renal dialysis, malnutrition), but also in critically ill&#xD;
      patients with burns, trauma and sepsis undergoing fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a limited number of studies assessing the use of BIA during pregnancy. In a&#xD;
      longitudinal study of 126 pregnant women, Piuri and colleagues assessed changes of&#xD;
      bio-impedance analysis among low-risk pregnant woman recruited in the first trimester and&#xD;
      followed their progress. They found that women who developed hypertensive disorders of&#xD;
      pregnancy (HDP) showed significantly different bioimpedance from control cases. Total Body&#xD;
      Water (TBW)indices were highly significantly different from the first trimester. In&#xD;
      pregnancies delivered of small for gestational age (SGA) newborns, these indices were the&#xD;
      opposite of the values observed in patients with HDP-average for gestational age (AGA).TBW in&#xD;
      these patients was significantly reduced compared with normal pregnancies. The authors&#xD;
      concluded that the bioelectrical impedance is a fast, simple, noninvasive way to assess the&#xD;
      TBW content in pregnancy and bio-impedance might help to identify, early in gestation,&#xD;
      patients at risk of developing different clinical phenotypes of hypertensive disease of&#xD;
      pregnancy and SGA fetuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective observational study of 3000 pregnant women, Kent and colleagues examined the&#xD;
      use of multi frequency segmental bioelectric impedance analysis in the first trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy for assessment of maternal body composition as predictors of increased birth&#xD;
      weight. They observed that on direct measurements of body composition, birth weight&#xD;
      correlated positively with maternal fat-free mass and not adiposity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors may influence the progression of normal labour. It has been postulated that&#xD;
      the routine administration of intravenous fluids to keep women adequately hydrated during&#xD;
      labour may reduce the period of contraction and relaxation of the uterine muscle, and may&#xD;
      ultimately reduce the duration of the labour. It has also been suggested that intravenous&#xD;
      fluids may reduce caesarean section rates (CS) for prolonged labour. Conversely, excessive&#xD;
      volumes of intravenous fluids may pose risks to both the mother and her new-born with&#xD;
      different fluids being associated with different risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Cochrane systematic review, Dawood and colleagues reported that administration of&#xD;
      intravenous fluids compared with oral intake alone demonstrated a reduction in the duration&#xD;
      of labour. The findings of other trials suggested that if a policy of no oral intake is&#xD;
      applied, then the duration of labour in nulliparous women may be shortened by the&#xD;
      administration of intravenous fluids at a rate of 250 ml/hour rather than 125ml/hour.&#xD;
      However, there was no objective assessment of hydration status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the benefits of routine administration of intravenous fluids to labouring women has&#xD;
      not been adequately elucidated although it is a widely-adopted policy, and there is no&#xD;
      consensus on the type or volume of fluid that are required, or indeed, whether intravenous&#xD;
      fluids are at all necessary. Women may be able to adequately hydrate themselves if they were&#xD;
      allowed oral fluids during labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced recovery was initially introduced for patients having minimally-invasive&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery. Following its introduction in colorectal surgery, it is now advocated&#xD;
      for many other specialities including Obstetrics. Enhanced recovery has transformed the&#xD;
      delivery of perioperative practice. The core ethos of enhanced recovery is to speed up a&#xD;
      patient's recovery after surgery and improve patient outcomes, with associated benefits for&#xD;
      staff and healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are given clear instructions about fluid and food intake before the operation.&#xD;
      Currently there is limited data about hydration state at the time of admission for operation.&#xD;
      Women having their operation on the morning of admission are advised to follow the following&#xD;
      instructions: a) they should not eat food after 0200h. b) They can drink water until 0600h.&#xD;
      c) At 0600h women should consume 400ml (2x 200ml bottles supplied at outpatient&#xD;
      'pre-clerking' clinic) of high energy carbohydrate drink before they attend hospital. Women&#xD;
      should then remain nil by mouth, unless advised differently by the hospital team. Ranitidine&#xD;
      and all routine medications (unless directed otherwise on the intrapartum care plan) should&#xD;
      be taken at 0600h. Women having operations in the afternoon are advised a) to have light&#xD;
      breakfast such as cereal, toast and fruit. b) Women should not eat food after 0600h but may&#xD;
      drink water until 1000h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy carry risks for the mother and the baby and it is one&#xD;
      of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality death in the worldwide. A UK study&#xD;
      reported that one-third of severe maternal morbidity was a consequence of hypertensive&#xD;
      conditions and a study conducted in the USA found that over half of admissions for acute&#xD;
      kidney failure, one-quarter of admissions for coagulopathy and nearly one-third of admissions&#xD;
      for ventilation or cerebrovascular disorders occurred in women with hypertensive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a semi-longitudinal cohort study from Italy, Wilfried and colleagues examined changes in&#xD;
      body fluid composition using Bioimpedance analyser of women with early onset preeclampsia (75&#xD;
      subjects) and late onset preeclampsia (117 subjects) and compared results to healthy&#xD;
      controls. They observed significant difference in extracellular water among women with&#xD;
      preeclampsia across trimesters. However, changes in body fluid and degree of severity of&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia were not examined before. Other conditions that could affect body composition&#xD;
      of water during pregnancy includes hyperemesis gravidarum, poor renal or cardiac function,&#xD;
      major postpartum haemorrhage, and sepsis.&#xD;
