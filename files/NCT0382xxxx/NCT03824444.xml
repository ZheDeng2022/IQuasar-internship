      An FDA Early Feasibility Study (EFS) allows for early clinical evaluation of devices to&#xD;
      provide proof of principle and initial clinical safety data. The Primary Aim of this proposal&#xD;

      patients with transhumeral (above elbow) amputations, establishing its initial safety.&#xD;
      Success of the Primary Aim (Safety) will be determined over a one year follow-up period by&#xD;
      observing the rate of patients successfully using their device without removal. The Secondary&#xD;
      Aim of this proposal is to quantify the functional effectiveness of the OI device, giving&#xD;
      specific attention to protocol differences required for male and female patients. Success for&#xD;
      the Secondary Aim (Functional Effectiveness) will be to determine functional improvement with&#xD;
      the device compared to the pre-operative performance. This will be the first longitudinal&#xD;

      An FDA Early Feasibility Study (EFS) allows &quot;for early clinical evaluation of devices to&#xD;
      provide proof of principle and initial clinical safety data.&quot; Over the past four years, the&#xD;
      team has performed the first EFS clinical trial of a percutaneous osseointegrated (OI)&#xD;
      docking system for patients with transfemoral amputations. As of December 1, 2017, 10&#xD;
      transfemoral VA patients received the device and are ambulating successfully for up to&#xD;
      36-months with positive safety and functional results. Currently, the EFS safety and&#xD;
      functionality data are being used to target a pivotal study of the transfemoral device to&#xD;
      obtain Premarket Approval (PMA) that will result in the broad clinical introduction of the&#xD;
      transfemoral OI device within the US. However, transhumeral patients are currently&#xD;
      underserved by prosthetic technologies. Nearly 60% of transhumeral patients limit their use&#xD;
      of suspension-based prostheses and upwards of 30% of upper-limb suspension-type prosthetic&#xD;
      devices are completely abandoned by both the VA and the military patient populations-with&#xD;
      abandonment of the prosthesis most common among women. The overarching goal of this proposal&#xD;
      is to maximize the functional recovery of US Veteran, military, and civilian patients with&#xD;
      transhumeral limb loss. The investigators believe that this can be done by bringing FDA&#xD;
      approved percutaneous OI devices to this patient population. Over the past 3 years, the&#xD;
      investigators developed a unique percutaneous OI device, known here as PODS, specifically for&#xD;
      transhumeral patients using an evidence based approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Aim of this proposal is to perform an FDA guided EFS of the PODS device for&#xD;
      transhumeral patients, establishing its initial clinical safety. Transhumeral patients will&#xD;
      be recruited to the Salt Lake City (SLC) VA for in-depth consultation and functional&#xD;
      evaluation. Recruited candidates will undergo a full clinical evaluation of the residual&#xD;
      limb. Functional assessments, focusing on activities of daily living (ADL), and evaluation of&#xD;
      joint and terminal device biomechanics will be collected with their socket-prosthetic device&#xD;
      (time = 0). These data will be used for final patient selection (N=10) for inclusion in the&#xD;
      FDA EFS clinical trial. The EFS patients will be brought back to the SLC VA, admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital, and have the Stage 1 surgery to receive the PODS endoprosthetic device, and then&#xD;
      discharged to home. Approximately 4 weeks later, patients will return to the SLC VA and have&#xD;
      the Stage 2 procedure performed to place the percutaneous post and attach their prosthetic&#xD;
      device. Post-operatively, wound healing will be monitored at the percutaneous site. Patients&#xD;
      will be discharged from the hospital to continue outpatient rehabilitation. Periodically&#xD;
      (time = 3, 6, and 12 months) following the Stage 2 procedure, patients will be brought back&#xD;
      to the SLC VA for assessment of their residual bone, soft tissues and device. The functional&#xD;
      assessments will be repeated with their PODS device at each follow-up visit. Success of the&#xD;
      Primary Aim (Safety) will be determined for the 1-year follow-up period with patients&#xD;
      successfully using their PODS devices with no device removal due to deep bone infections,&#xD;
      aseptic loosening, or atraumatic fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Aim of this proposal is to quantify the functional effectiveness of the PODS&#xD;
      device, giving specific attention to protocol differences required for male and female&#xD;
      patients. Success for the Secondary Aim (Functional Effectiveness) will be to quantify the&#xD;
      degree to which patients achieve functional improvement with the PODS device compared to the&#xD;
      pre-operative performance. These data will be the first longitudinal analyses to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of percutaneous OI prostheses on objective functionality measures of these&#xD;
      transhumeral amputation individuals.&#xD;
