  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods study follows a prospective cohort of participants receiving Mifeprex®&#xD;
      (mifepristone) by a clinician in advance of a potential unintended pregnancy. Women&#xD;
      participating in this study will be assessed by a clinician and provided Mifeprex® and&#xD;
      misoprostol in a clinical setting. To assess acceptability of this service delivery model&#xD;
      among participants, and feasibility of implementing a larger randomized controlled trial, the&#xD;
      study will survey participants, evaluate any clinical outcomes recorded during clinical&#xD;
      visits, and interview participants about their experiences participating in the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the project is to improve access to early abortion by reducing&#xD;
      barriers that patients face obtaining services. Currently, patients are prescribed and&#xD;
      receive Mifeprex® and misoprostol directly from a clinician, who evaluates patients for&#xD;
      medical eligibility and contraindications. The Mifeprex® may be taken in the facility or at&#xD;
      home, and the misoprostol is taken 24-48 hours later at home. The FDA recommends a follow-up&#xD;
      visit, which can be over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test the model of advance provision of medication&#xD;
      abortion (MAB). In this model, patients at risk of unintended pregnancy and with a desire to&#xD;
      avoid pregnancy will be assessed by a clinician and provided counseling on pregnancy&#xD;
      recognition and testing, as well as how to administer MAB at home. For this pilot study, only&#xD;
      patients who have previously had a MAB will be included, since this population has reported&#xD;
      the highest interest in the model, and they are also already familiar with how to use the&#xD;
      medications. The clinician will provide Mifeprex® and misoprostol to the patient at the time&#xD;
      of counseling in case the patient becomes pregnant and wants to terminate the pregnancy using&#xD;
      the medications up to 10 weeks gestation. Patients will contact a study clinician for an&#xD;
      over-the-phone assessment of eligibility for MAB, including assessment of gestational age,&#xD;
      before self-administration of Mifeprex® and misoprostol, and then attend a follow-up visit&#xD;
      with the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will sign the Danco Patient Agreement Form prior to receiving the medication.&#xD;
      Clinicians dispensing the medications will have signed the Prescriber Agreement Form, and the&#xD;
      medications will be dispensed in a clinic or hospital. Study investigators will monitor&#xD;
      participant activity through surveys throughout the study. Participants will be given clear&#xD;
      instructions on study participation and returning unused medications in an appropriate time&#xD;
      frame. Clinicians will also re-evaluate participants by telephone before they take the&#xD;
      medications and evaluate them in person at a subsequent follow-up visit.&#xD;
