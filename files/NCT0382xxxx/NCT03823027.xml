  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of STAR01 is to evaluate the performance and safety of the medical&#xD;
      device (class IIb) SiPore15™ after a 12-week long treatment in the target population of obese&#xD;
      and overweight subjects with prediabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The expected&#xD;
      performance and safety of the device is based on the safety and efficacy results seen in an&#xD;
      earlier First-in-Man (FIM) study. The safety and tolerability of SiPore15™ is based on the&#xD;
      well-established and extensive use of food grade silicon dioxide and favorable data from the&#xD;
      FIM study. Data on side-effects will be collected for verification of device safety. The&#xD;
      study duration is 24 weeks in total, 12 weeks from baseline on investigational medicinal&#xD;
      device (IMD) treatment, with additional 12 weeks off treatment. The study population is&#xD;
      planned for forty (40) subjects to be enrolled, male and females, age &gt;18 years and&#xD;
      fulfilling all inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The single-arm study is designed to collect data on changes over time, i.e. comparing the pre-treatment/baseline value with the value achieved after full treatment (12 weeks). Thus, each individual act as his/her own control. The study design has been discussed with notified bodies, and deemed appropriate as there is no state-of-the-art pharmacotherapy for treatment of prediabetes to compare with.</intervention_model_description>
