  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a significant, expensive health problem. Kidney&#xD;
      transplantation improves survival, quality of life, and is much cheaper than dialysis&#xD;
      treatment for ESKD. However sometimes kidney transplants from a deceased donor function&#xD;
      poorly after surgery, and a period of continued dialysis is needed, a condition known as&#xD;
      delayed graft function (DGF). In addition to complicating recovery, DGF can adversely affect&#xD;
      long-term kidney function and the health of the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous fluids given during and after transplantation (usually 0.9% sodium chloride or&#xD;
      saline) are critical to preserve kidney transplant function, but there is evidence that 0.9%&#xD;
      saline may not be the safest fluid to use due to its high chloride content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BEST Fluids is a randomised controlled trial that aims to find out whether using a balanced&#xD;
      low-chloride solution - Plasma-Lyte 148® - as an alternative to normal saline in deceased&#xD;
      donor kidney transplantation, will improve kidney transplant function, reduce the impact of&#xD;
      DGF, and improve long-term outcomes for patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End-stage kidney disease is a significant public health problem worldwide, and its treatment&#xD;
      imposes a high healthcare burden and cost. Kidney transplantation is considered the best&#xD;
      treatment for ESKD, offering improved survival and quality of life at significantly lower&#xD;
      cost that dialysis. However, many kidney transplants fail prematurely due in part due to&#xD;
      injury sustained at the time of transplantation. Delayed graft function (DGF), i.e. the&#xD;
      requirement for dialysis early after transplantation, affects approximately 30% of deceased&#xD;
      donor kidney transplants, and increases the risk of graft failure and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous fluids are a critical, albeit inexpensive, aspect of care that impacts early&#xD;
      transplant function with normal (0.9%) saline the current standard care at most centres.&#xD;
      However, normal saline may in fact be harmful in the setting of kidney transplantation due to&#xD;
      its high chloride content relative to plasma, causing metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury&#xD;
      and thus potentially increasing the risk of DGF. Utilising a balanced low-chloride&#xD;
      crystalloid solution such as Plasma-Lyte 148® (Plasmalyte) as an alternative to 0.9% saline&#xD;
      may therefore improve outcomes after kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BEST-Fluids study is an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, registry-based, multi-centre,&#xD;
      double -blind randomised, controlled trial. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect in deceased donor kidney transplant recipients of intravenous therapy with&#xD;
      Plasmalyte versus 0.9% saline, commencing pre-operatively and continuing until intravenous&#xD;
      fluids are no longer required or 48 hours post-transplant (whichever is earliest), on DGF,&#xD;
      defined as the requirement for dialysis in the first seven days post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted for a deceased donor kidney transplant at participating centres will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study prior to transplant surgery. Following informed consent,&#xD;
      participants will be randomised to receive either blinded Plasmalyte or blinded 0.9% saline&#xD;
      for all intravenous fluid therapy purposes until 48 hours post-transplant. The volume and&#xD;
      rate of fluid therapy will be determined by treating clinicians; all other treatments will be&#xD;
      as per local standard of care. Participants will be enrolled, randomised and followed up&#xD;
      using ANZDATA, the Australia &amp; New Zealand Dialysis &amp; Transplant Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was prospectively registered with Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry&#xD;
      (ANZCTR) on 08/03/2017 (ACTRN12617000358347).&#xD;
