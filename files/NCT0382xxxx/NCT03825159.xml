      The new device with digital technology provides a new avenue to enable clinicians to&#xD;
      communicate wirelessly with the imbedded core system such that they can adjust the electrical&#xD;
      stimulation parameters and retrieve the temperature data for further compliance analysis. The&#xD;
      smart phone and cloud technology can be effectively applied for both security and&#xD;
      convenience. The electrical stimulation technology integrated with the total contact spinal&#xD;
      orthosis combines the external correction forces on the spinal skeleton from the passive&#xD;
      orthosis with the muscle forces at the lateral trunk from the stimulation process. The&#xD;
      electrical stimulation is purposely to tone the muscle in order to replace the external&#xD;
      mechanical forces gradually. Ultimately, when being weaned off the orthosis, patients may&#xD;
      maintain the correction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal orthosis is an option to treat Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) and is the most&#xD;
      commonly used among conservative treatment. According to Scoliosis Research Society (SRS),&#xD;
      orthotic treatment is indicated for AIS patients with curves greater than 25˚ but smaller&#xD;
      than 45˚. However, the in-brace correction is hardly maintained and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      orthotic treatment is limited, which has been an impetus to develop a more effective method&#xD;
      for AIS patients to fulfill the unmet need. In order the orthosis is effective, biomechanical&#xD;
      intervention and the patient compliance are two key factors. The purpose of this two-year&#xD;
      project is to develop a new spinal orthosis in which an integrated system of electric surface&#xD;
      stimulation and heat sensing is imbedded such that the AIS will be effectively treated with&#xD;
      the mechanical orthosis plus a nocturnal use of electrical stimulation. In addition to the&#xD;
      already stellar device, a totally new concept of spine erectability is proposed to provide&#xD;
      evidence that can manifest the unique value of orthotic treatment as opposed to surgery. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that the new spinal orthosis would not only reduce the Cobb angle and apical&#xD;
      rotation but also would strengthen the spine erectability in AIS patients. The new device&#xD;
      with digital technology provides a new avenue to enable clinicians to communicate wirelessly&#xD;
      with the imbedded core system such that they can adjust the electrical stimulation parameters&#xD;
      and retrieve the temperature data for further compliance analysis. The smart phone and cloud&#xD;
      technology can be effectively applied for both security and convenience. The electrical&#xD;
      stimulation technology integrated with the total contact spinal orthosis combines the&#xD;
      external correction forces on the spinal skeleton from the passive orthosis with the muscle&#xD;
      forces at the lateral trunk from the stimulation process. The electrical stimulation is&#xD;
      purposely to tone the muscle in order to replace the external mechanical forces gradually.&#xD;
      Ultimately, when being weaned off the orthosis, patients may maintain the correction. With&#xD;
      the spinal orthosis, the applied current in stimulation process would be reduced and the skin&#xD;
      irritation would too. First year, there will be three tasks. An instrument will be developed&#xD;
      for clinicians to assess the applicability of electrical surface stimulation to each AIS&#xD;
      patient. System integration of the spinal orthosis with electrical surface stimulation and&#xD;
      heat sensing will be accomplished. Clinical study of the effectiveness of passive spinal&#xD;
      orthoses on 30 AIS subjects as a control group, where the Cobb angle, apical rotation and&#xD;
      spine erectability will be measured before treatment and after. Second year, another 30 AIS&#xD;
      patients will be recruited; the applicability of electrical surface stimulation will be&#xD;
      assessed; and the new spinal orthosis will be applied to the experiment group. The Cobb&#xD;
      angle, apical rotation and spine erectability will be measured before treatment and after for&#xD;
      each subject. Independent t test will be carried out for the two groups to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;

    <description>When measuring Cobb angle, the investigators should identify the upper and lower end vertebra. Then, the investigators draw perpendicular lines extending along the vertebral borders. The angle where two perpendicular lines meet is called Cobb angle</description>

    <measure>Change of Spine erectability</measure>
    <time_frame>base line, 6th month and 12th month</time_frame>
    <description>Spine erectability is to define the physiological ability of the spine to maintain it erect against gravity and will be assessed without wearing orthoses.&#xD;
The force F acting at the apex is the weights of the head and two upper limbs plus 7/17 trunk weight, which can be calculated with the readily available anthropometric data. The bending moment M at T8 equals the applied force F multiplies the lever arm d, which is the distance between the force and the weight line.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of Apical rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>base line, 6th month and 12th month</time_frame>
    <description>Apical rotation is the degree of apical vertebral rotation .The Raimondi method uses the projection of the vertebral pedicles and the width of the vertebra as a reference for the measuring. The largest axis of the pedicle is demarcated and measured on the side of the curve convexity, and the distance of the longitudinal line from the pedicle to the border of the vertebra on the convex side is measured. Those two values are transported to the ruler, and the value of the rotation is obtained.</description>
