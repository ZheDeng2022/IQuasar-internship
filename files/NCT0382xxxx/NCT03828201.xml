    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least&#xD;
      isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most important anti-TB drugs. It occurs in 3.6% of newly&#xD;
      diagnosed TB patients in the world and 17% of patients who have been previously treated. In&#xD;
      2017, approximately 600,000 people were estimated to have acquired MDR-TB. However, only 25%&#xD;
      of persons with MDR-TB were diagnosed and started on treatment, reflecting inadequate&#xD;
      diagnostic capacity and lack of TB treatment capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, four-arm, phase 2 study, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the efficacy and safety of an all-oral regimen of bedaquiline,&#xD;
      delamanid, levofloxacin, linezolid, and clofazimine given for 16, 24, 32 or 40 weeks&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is tuberculosis that is resistant to at least&#xD;
      isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most important drugs in treating TB. In 2017, approximately&#xD;
      558,000 new people were estimated to have developed MDR-TB, and 8.5% of the cases had&#xD;
      extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).(1) Current WHO-endorsed MDR-TB treatment&#xD;
      regimens take 9-20 months to complete and are associated with substantial toxicity, including&#xD;
      deafness from injectable agents, hepatitis from pyrazinamide and severe neuropathy from&#xD;
      linezolid. Given the long duration and toxicities of MDR-TB regimens, it is perhaps not&#xD;
      surprising that WHO reports that only 25% of patients with MDR-TB are enrolled into&#xD;
      WHO-endorsed treatment regimens. Thus, there is an urgent need for shorter, less toxic&#xD;
      treatments for MDR-TB. This proposal will determine the efficacy, safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      optimal duration of a novel, all oral MDR-TB treatment regimen while addressing three major&#xD;
      challenges with innovations that have the potential to transform future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed DRAMATIC (Duration Randomized Anti-MDR-TB And Tailored Intervention Clinical)&#xD;
      Trial is a multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, four-arm, phase 2 trial that will&#xD;
      examine an injectable- and pyrazinamide-sparing regimen of bedaquiline, delamanid,&#xD;
      levofloxacin, linezolid, and clofazimine. The DRAMATIC regimen limits the administration of&#xD;
      linezolid to the initial 8 weeks of treatment, the window before linezolid-related neuropathy&#xD;
      occurs. Animal and human studies provide evidence for the potential efficacy of this 5-drug&#xD;
      regimen, but the optimal duration of treatment remains uncertain.(2-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the relationship between the duration of the experimental regimen and the&#xD;
           proportion of participants with sustained cure at 76 weeks after randomization without&#xD;
           treatment failure or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the relationship between baseline prognostic risk strata and sustained cure at&#xD;
           76 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the association between novel biologic markers and sustained cure at 76 weeks&#xD;
           after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify the shortest duration of the study regimen that has acceptable safety and&#xD;
           efficacy for a Phase 3 clinical trial of the DRAMATIC regimen for treatment of MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Describe the frequency, magnitude, time course of and risk factors for QTc prolongation&#xD;
           associated with the study regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of implementing the new duration-randomized&#xD;
           design in a multi-centre randomized trial of drug-resistant TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Determine if time to sputum culture conversion predicts optimal duration of treatment&#xD;
           when stratified by extent of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Describe the relationship between the duration of the experimental regimen and the&#xD;
           proportion of participants with sustained cure at 104 weeks after randomization without&#xD;
           treatment failure or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Assess vital status at 132 weeks post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of a shorter, better-tolerated treatment regimen will greatly enhance the ability&#xD;
      of TB control programs to treat the growing number of patients. The DRAMATIC Trial will&#xD;
      employ an innovative and efficient new design to establish a robust, nontoxic MDR-TB&#xD;
      treatment regimen and identify the minimal duration for which it needs to be administered.&#xD;
      These results will speed the process of moving forward to a confirmatory phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      trial and increase the likelihood that such a trial is successful.&#xD;

    <description>Frequency: daily Route of administration: oral&#xD;
Clofazimine has shown activity against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to treat drug resistant tuberculosis as a &quot;Group B&quot; drug. It is thought that clofazimine acts by inhibiting the formation of matrixes within the DNA and thus delaying the growth of the bacterium. Clofazimine first received FDA approval in 1986, although its use in the treatment of MDR-TB has not been approved by any stringent regulatory authorities and it is therefore used &quot;off-label&quot; for this function.</description>
