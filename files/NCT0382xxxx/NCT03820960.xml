  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disease (annual incidence: 3-4/105&#xD;
      inhabitants) leading to an increased risk of spontaneous bleeding. ITP is said &quot;primary&quot; when&#xD;
      not associated to other systemic disease (lymphoma, systemic autoimmune disease, chronic&#xD;
      infectious disease…). First-line treatment is based on corticosteroids. Intravenous&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (IVIg) is added in case of serious bleeding. In about 70% of adult cases, ITP&#xD;
      becomes persistent or chronic (lasting &gt;3 months and &gt;12 months, respectively). Second-line&#xD;
      treatments are then indicated. Among them, thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs),&#xD;
      romiplostim and eltrombopag are increasingly used. Splenectomy is used as ultimate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paradoxically, the risk of thrombosis is higher in ITP patients in comparison with the&#xD;
      general population, due to the release of young hyperactive platelets from bone marrow. The&#xD;
      incidence of thrombosis in ITP patients has been estimated between 0.5 and 3/100&#xD;
      patients-years. However, risk factors for thrombosis in ITP are not known, except splenectomy&#xD;
      that is used in very few patients now. The role of other ITP treatments in thrombosis&#xD;
      occurrence has been evoked, particularly for corticosteroids and IVIg. TPO-RAs have been&#xD;
      associated with a risk of thrombosis in clinical trials and pharmacovigilance studies, even&#xD;
      in case of low or normal platelet count. However, this risk has not been measured in the&#xD;
      real-life practice, adjusted for other risk factors for thrombosis.&#xD;

        Observational population-based study in France in the French Adult Immune THrombocytopenia&#xD;
        (FAITH) cohort from July 2009 until June 2015. The FAITH study identifies since July 2009&#xD;
        all incident primary ITP adults in France within the national health insurance database&#xD;
        (Système National d'Informations Inter-Régimes de l'Assurance Maladie, SNIIRAM, &gt;66 million&#xD;
