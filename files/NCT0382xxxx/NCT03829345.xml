  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SOlar is a multi-centre phase II clinical trial of single agent olaparib in advanced&#xD;
      oesophagogastric cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric and oesophageal cancers are a significant health burden and are a leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer related death. Despite improvements in survival over the last 4 decades overall the&#xD;
      outcomes remain poor. In patients with advanced disease the outlook is particularly bleak&#xD;
      with survival rates of less than one year with first line chemotherapy. New treatments are&#xD;
      urgently needed to improve the poor survival rates in these cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor which blocks poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, an enzyme&#xD;
      which is involved in repair of damaged DNA. By inhibiting PARP1 olaparib prevents repair of&#xD;
      damaged DNA. Cells with unrepaired DNA cannot survive and die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety/tolerability of olaparib in patients&#xD;
      with advanced oesophagogastric cancer. It will be conducted in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first stage will evaluate the efficacy of olaparib in 27 patients. If 4 or fewer&#xD;
           patients have control of their disease at 8 weeks then the trial for the olaparib arm&#xD;
           will stop and no further patients will be recruited to the study. If 5-13 patients have&#xD;
           control of their disease at 8 weeks then the study will progress to stage 2. If 14 or&#xD;
           more patients have disease control at 8 weeks then a larger study may be opened in an&#xD;
           unselected population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second stage will evaluate disease control in a further 27 patients. This is to&#xD;
           allow identification of potential biomarkers of response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal, gastro-oesophageal junction or gastric&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma that has progressed during or within 6 months of first or subsequent&#xD;
             line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with HER2-positive oesophageal, gastro-oesophageal, or gastric adenocarcinoma&#xD;

             used for both the purpose of confirming the histological diagnosis and subsequent&#xD;
             biomarker analysis. All patients must be willing to have a fresh tumour biopsy to&#xD;
             obtain tumour tissue for biomarker analysis at baseline and on progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Disease amenable to safe biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured as per&#xD;

             normal (ULN) or a calculated creatinine clearance &gt;51 mL/min for patients with&#xD;
             creatinine levels above institutional normal. For GFR estimation, the Cockcroft and&#xD;
