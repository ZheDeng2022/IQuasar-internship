      Rationale: Anastomotic leakage (0% - 30%) is a severe complication after esophagectomy with&#xD;
      mortality rates approximately ranging from 2% - 12%. In addition, it is associated with a&#xD;
      prolonged ICU treatment and hospital stay. Anastomotic leakage severity is currently graded&#xD;
      according to how it is treated (grade I: conservative treatment, grade II endoscopic or&#xD;
      radiologic intervention and grade III surgical intervention). However, this scoring system&#xD;
      cannot be used to guide decision making when anastomotic leakage is diagnosed in a clinical&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that may influence the severity of the anastomotic leakage are (amongst others)&#xD;
      location of the anastomosis, estimated surface of the defect, estimated circumference of the&#xD;
      defect, extent of contamination, degree of sepsis and time from diagnosis until therapy.&#xD;
      However, little is known about to what extent these and other factors contribute to&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage severity. In addition, there is a paucity of data on what leakage&#xD;
      characteristics dictate the success of a specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate what factors contribute to anastomotic leakage severity and to compose an&#xD;
           evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate what anastomotic leakage characteristics are associated with success of&#xD;
           different anastomotic leakage treatments and to compare the effectiveness of different&#xD;
           initial anastomotic leakage treatments for leakages classified according to severity and&#xD;
           leakage characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: International multicenter retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients with anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy and gastric&#xD;
      conduit reconstruction for esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort size: 1000-2000 patients with anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameter: 90 day mortality. Secondary outcome parameters: in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, 30-day mortality, 180-day mortality, comprehensive complications index, total&#xD;
      number of reinterventions, hospital and ICU length of stay, hospital related costs.&#xD;

      2. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of esophageal cancer is increasing, with an estimated annual incidence of&#xD;
      480.000 cases worldwide [Jemal 2011]. Esophagectomy remains the cornerstone of curative&#xD;
      treatment, often in combination with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. However,&#xD;
      esophagectomy is associated with considerable morbidity and anastomotic leakage is a severe&#xD;
      postoperative complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage is defined as a &quot;full thickness gastrointestinal defect involving&#xD;
      esophagus, anastomosis, staple line, or conduit irrespective of presentation or method of&#xD;
      identification&quot; according to the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG)&#xD;
      definition [Low 2015]. Anastomotic leakage has been described to occur in 0-30%. If&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage occurs, it is associated with mortality rates ranging from 2% - 12%&#xD;
      [Biere 2011, Saluja 2012]. In addition, it is often associated with a prolonged ICU&#xD;
      treatment, hospital length of stay and multiple reinterventions [Lubbers 2019, submitted].&#xD;
      The impact of anastomotic leakage on quality of life is high and it is associated with a&#xD;
      substantial burden in terms of hospital resources and costs [Biere 2011, Alanezi 2004,&#xD;
      Luketich 2012, Blackmon 2007].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of anastomotic leakage ranges from conservative management (nil per mouth,&#xD;
      antibiotics and nasogastric tube drainage) to radiologic drainage, endoscopic treatment with&#xD;
      stents, drains or endoVAC (Vacuum Assisted Closure) systems, and surgical exploration. A&#xD;
      recent systematic review performed by our group assessed the current literature for studies&#xD;
      that specifically reported on specific therapies and outcome of anastomotic leakage&#xD;
      [Verstegen 2018, submitted]. Nineteen studies with 273 patients were included and studies&#xD;
      were of low to moderate quality. No meta-analysis was performed because of substantial&#xD;
      clinical heterogeneity of the included studies. The main conclusion of the review was that&#xD;
      due to small cohorts and clinical heterogeneity no evidence based treatment strategy could be&#xD;
      composed from the current literature. A retrospective multicenter study of 79 patients&#xD;
      revealed that the used treatment modality of an anastomotic leakage is not only patient&#xD;
      dependent, but also hospital dependent [Lubbers 2019, submitted]. Until now the management of&#xD;
      an anastomotic leakage is more or less based on expert opinion rather than on an&#xD;
      evidence-based anastomotic leakage treatment algorithm. From these studies, it became evident&#xD;
      that the absence of an anastomotic leakage severity score complicates performing robust&#xD;
      research on this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage severity is currently graded according to how it is treated (grade I:&#xD;
      conservative treatment, grade II endoscopic or radiologic intervention and grade III surgical&#xD;
      intervention) [Low 2015]. Although this scoring system is useful for reporting the&#xD;
      consequences of anastomotic leakage, by definition it cannot be used to guide decision making&#xD;
      when anastomotic leakage is diagnosed in a clinical setting. Examples of factors that may&#xD;
      influence the severity of the anastomotic leakage are location of the anastomosis&#xD;
      (intrathoracic or cervical), circumference of the defect, surface of the defect, extent of&#xD;
      contamination (i.e. local, mediastinal, intrathoracic), degree of sepsis and time from&#xD;
      diagnosis until therapy. However, little is known about to what extent these and other&#xD;
      factors contribute to anastomotic leakage severity. In addition, there is a paucity of data&#xD;
      on what leakage characteristics dictate the success of a specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.1 Main study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate what factors contribute to anastomotic leakage severity and to compose an&#xD;
           evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate what anastomotic leakage characteristics are associated with success of&#xD;
           different anastomotic leakage treatments and to compare the effectiveness of different&#xD;
           initial anastomotic leakage treatments for leakages classified according to severity and&#xD;
           leakage characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Other study objectives This is an explorative study and relevant interactions between&#xD;
      factors will be investigated. The following other study objectives are predefined. Outcome&#xD;
      will be evaluated in terms of mortality, comprehensive complications index (CCI), number of&#xD;
      reinterventions, length of stay and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate what factors are associated with postoperative mortality in patients with&#xD;
           anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy and to compose a model that predicts mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study practice variation in the treatment of anastomotic leakage and to evaluate&#xD;
           heterogeneity in its outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether the number of postoperative days the leak is diagnosed is&#xD;
           associated with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate whether diagnostic tests that are performed within 48 hours of&#xD;
           anastomotic leakage diagnosis (e.g. CT scan, endoscopy) are associated with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To investigate whether time from diagnosis to first invasive treatment (in a subgroup of&#xD;
           patients that is treated invasively) is associated with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To investigate whether outcome is different in patients with anastomotic leakage after&#xD;
           Ivor Lewis versus McKeown versus Orringer esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To investigate whether outcome is different in patients undergoing open versus minimally&#xD;
           invasive esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To investigate whether outcome is different in patients in whom an omental wrap of&#xD;
           pleural flap was used to cover the anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To compare outcome in patients receiving selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD)&#xD;
           versus patients who did not receive SDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To compare outcome in patients who have the leakage drained by postoperative drains at&#xD;
           the time of diagnosis (e.g. mediastinal drain, cervical drain, chest tube) versus&#xD;
           patients who did not have the leakage drained at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. To investigate whether there is a difference in success rate and outcome for endoVACs&#xD;
           that are placed within the esophagus/gastric tube versus endoVACs that are placed&#xD;
           through the anastomotic defect.&#xD;

      large group of Dutch hospitals that are currently performing esophagectomies (Dutch Upper-GI&#xD;
      Cancer Audit - DUCA group) have consented to participate in this study. The TENTACLE study&#xD;
      has also been endorsed by the Oesophago-Gastric Anastomosis Audit (OGAA) study group. In&#xD;
      addition, collaboration is sought with the European Society for Diseases of the Esophagus&#xD;
      (ESDE) trainee chapter and the Minimally Invasive Oesophagectomy (MIO) think tank initiative&#xD;
      (see Chapter 5.5 - Feasibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Population All adult patients with an anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy and gastric&#xD;
      conduit reconstruction for esophageal cancer are suitable for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of the&#xD;
      following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Aged 18 years or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esophagectomy and gastric conduit reconstruction for resectable esophageal&#xD;
           (cT1-4aN0-3M0) cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative anastomotic leakage according to the ECCG definition [Low 2015].&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esophagectomy for benign disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency resection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergoing extended total gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Sample size calculation This is an explorative study and data will be used to investigate&#xD;
      to what extent specific characteristics of anastomotic leakages are associated with severity&#xD;
      of the leakage and how they relate to the successfulness of different treatments. Therefore,&#xD;
      no formal sample size calculation was performed. In order to be able to draw robust&#xD;
      conclusions from this study, to develop an evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score&#xD;
      and to gain a solid basis for future anastomotic leakage related research, we aim to include&#xD;
      at least 1000 patients with anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Feasibility In order to include the proposed number of patients and to collect data from&#xD;
      international patient cohort, we aim to acquire data from 4 esophageal surgeon networks.&#xD;
      Although there is some overlap between these groups, we believe that inviting the 4 networks&#xD;
      to participate will optimize the chance of obtaining robust results from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Dutch Upper-GI Cancer Audit (DUCA) group A large group of Dutch hospitals performing&#xD;
           esophagectomies have agreed to participate in this study. During the study period of 8&#xD;
           years, approximately 750 resections were performed per year and the incidence of&#xD;
           anastomotic leakage was around 18%. Therefore, data from 1080 patients with anastomotic&#xD;
           leakage (750*8*0.18) can be included from the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The European Society for Diseases of the Esophagus (ESDE) trainee chapter The ESDE&#xD;
           trainee chapter is a research collaborative that is managed by trainee members of the&#xD;
           society. Centers in this network of around 20 hospitals will be invited to participate&#xD;
           in this study. We estimate that around 10 hospitals will participate, with a mean case&#xD;
           load of 40 esophagectomies per year and a mean anastomotic leakage incidence of 15%. We&#xD;
           therefore estimate that 480 patients could be included from this collaboration&#xD;
           (10*40*8*0.15).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Oesophago-Gastric Anastomosis Audit (OGAA) group The OGAA was established in 2017&#xD;
           and aimed to identify patient and differences in operative technique that influence&#xD;
           outcome. This worldwide network of esophageal surgeons performed a 6 month snapshot&#xD;
           study and will include an estimated 1750 cases by December 31st 2018. We will invite the&#xD;
           centers in the OGAA to participate in this study and to contribute the cases that have&#xD;
           already been registered in the OGAA and to contribute additional data from their&#xD;
           2011-2018 cohorts. We estimate that there will be approximately 263 patients with&#xD;
           anastomotic leakage in the OGAA (1750*0.15) . Possibly, more cases will be contributed&#xD;
           from the participating centers if they contribute additional data from their 2011-2018&#xD;
           cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Minimally Invasive Oesophagectomy (MIO) think tank initiative The European MIO think&#xD;
           tank group includes members from around 15 European high volume centers. We estimate&#xD;
           that in the past 8 years, each center performed 40 esophagectomies per year and with a&#xD;
           leakage incidence of around 10% this group could contribute around 480 cases&#xD;
           (15*50*8*0.10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Primary outcome parameter • 90-day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Secondary outcome parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality and 180-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive complications index (CCI) [Slankamenac 2013].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total number of reinterventions (endoscopic, radiologic, surgical).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay and readmission rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 List of study parameters This is a retrospective study and we expect that not all&#xD;
      relevant data can be obtained from the patient files. For example, estimation of leak&#xD;
      circumference or leak surface will not be possible without an endoscopy and we expect that&#xD;
      not all patients underwent an endoscopy. However, it is expected that the large number of&#xD;
      patients will provide enough data to analyze whether factors with a lot of missing data are&#xD;
      of influence. Therefore, these factors that are likely to have a lot of missing data are&#xD;
      taken up in this list, even though missing data may introduce bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Characteristics: annual volume, diagnosis &amp; treatment strategy by&#xD;

&#xD;
      7. ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Analysis strategy - general considerations The ultimate goal of main study objective 1 is&#xD;
      to obtain an evidence based anastomotic leakage severity score that reflects the influence of&#xD;
      leakage associated parameters on 90-day mortality. This will allow researchers to describe&#xD;
      leakage severity in groups of patients and it can be used to correct for differences between&#xD;
      groups regarding anastomotic leakage severity. This will therefore aid in performing future&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only factors that concern leakage characteristics (listed in chapter 7.3 - List of study&#xD;
      parameters / Leakage characteristics) and factors that concern the consequences of the leak&#xD;
      for a patient (listed in chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters / Patient parameters at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis) are used to compose this score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other important parameters that are likely to be predictive of 90-day mortality (e.g. age,&#xD;
      comorbidity index, preoperative performance status, etc.) are not included in the severity&#xD;
      score since these can be reported (and corrected for) separately. Operation characteristics&#xD;
      (e.g. resection type, anastomotic site, etc.) may also be predictive of 90-day mortality if&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage occurs. Operation characteristics are not included in the severity score&#xD;
      since it is likely that these factors are also important for anastomotic leakage strategy,&#xD;
      regardless of leakage severity (e.g. cervical anastomotic leakage may require different&#xD;
      treatment than intrathoracic anastomotic leakage) and we aim to investigate this in our other&#xD;
      study objectives (see chapter 3.2 - Other study objectives). In addition, it is one of our&#xD;
      other study objectives to compose a model that predicts 90-day mortality in case of&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage (see chapter 3.2 - Other study objectives) and for this model all&#xD;
      predictive factors that are registered in this study will be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Main study objective 1 The first main study objective is to investigate what factors&#xD;
      contribute to anastomotic leakage severity and to compose an evidence based anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage severity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, univariate analysis is performed on relevant parameters that are described in chapter&#xD;
      7.3 - List of study parameters / Leakage characteristics and in chapter 7.3 - List of study&#xD;
      parameters / Patient parameters at the time of diagnosis. Relevant parameters are entered&#xD;
      into separate binary logistic regression models with 90-day mortality as outcome parameter in&#xD;
      order to explore associations in the data. Second, factors that are considered to be&#xD;
      clinically relevant based on literature and/or expert opinion are selected for multivariate&#xD;
      analysis. Backwards stepwise selection is used to exclude values of p&gt;0.05 from the model.&#xD;
      Results are presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A 2-tailed&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. Third, this multivariate model will be&#xD;
      internally validated by bootstrapping, using 5000 bootstrap resamples. Finally, a nomogram is&#xD;
      constructed based on the final bootstrapped multivariable regression analysis and this&#xD;
      nomogram can be used to calculate the anastomotic leakage severity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate the relative influence of casemix parameters (e.g. age, comorbidity,&#xD;
      etcetera) on the leakage severity score, similar analysis will be performed in which casemix&#xD;
      parameters (listed in (listed in chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters / Patient and tumor&#xD;
      characteristics and in chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters / operation characteristics)&#xD;
      are also included. If casemix is found to be very strongly associated with outcome relative&#xD;
      to the severity score (to the extent that the severity score is of limited additional value&#xD;
      in the regression model), latent class analysis is used [Rabe-Hesketh 2008]. The parameters&#xD;
      used for the anastomotic leakage severity score (chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters /&#xD;
      Leakage characteristics and in chapter 7.3 - List of study parameters / Patient parameters at&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis) are used to create casemix corrected classes of anastomotic leakage&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained by the described analyses will also be performed in subgroups of&#xD;
      patients undergoing McKeown, Ivor Lewis and Orringer esophagectomy. By performing this&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis, we will investigate whether the obtained model is useful for all types&#xD;
      of esophagectomy or whether different factors are predictive of 90-day mortality for the&#xD;
      different types of esophagectomy. If substantial differences are found between the primary&#xD;
      analysis and this sensitivity analysis, the possibility of composing different anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage severity scoring systems will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will investigate and report whether the anastomotic leakage severity score is&#xD;
      also predictive of the other outcome parameters. Together with data from the secondary study&#xD;
      objective (see chapter 3.2 - Other study objectives) in which associations between 90-day&#xD;
      mortality and other outcome parameters are investigated, this will result in defining if&#xD;
      other parameters can be used as a proxy for 90-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Main study objective 2 The second main study objective is to investigate what anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage characteristics are associated with success of different initial treatments and to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of different initial anastomotic leakage treatments for leakages&#xD;
      classified according to severity and leakage characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first analysis relevant primary treatment parameters (listed in chapter 6.3 - List of&#xD;
      study parameters / Primary treatment) are the exposures. The association between anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage characteristics and operation characteristics (see chapter 6.3 - List of study&#xD;
      parameters / Leakage characteristics and chapter 6.3 - List of study parameters / Operation&#xD;
      characteristics) and outcome parameters (see chapter 6.1 - Primary outcome parameter and&#xD;
      chapter 6.2 - Secondary outcome parameters) will be evaluated for the exposures in regression&#xD;
      analysis. Correction for patient characteristics, tumor characteristics and anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage severity score is performed, if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of this first analysis, subgroups of patients are created based on&#xD;
      individual operation or leakage characteristics or based on combinations of characteristics.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the primary treatment strategies is assessed in a regression models for&#xD;
      the different outcome parameters and correction for patient characteristics, tumor&#xD;
      characteristics and anastomotic leakage severity score is performed, if appropriate.&#xD;
      Comparison of the primary outcome parameter and secondary outcome parameters will be&#xD;
      expressed in terms of a relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. A&#xD;
      two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Other study objectives Analysis of other study objectives will follow the same principles&#xD;
      as described in chapter 7.2 - Main study objective 1 and chapter 7.3 main study objective 2.&#xD;
      Detailed and predefined analysis plans will be written during the preparation phase of the&#xD;
      TENTACLE study (see Chapter 4.3 - Study timeline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. ETHICS STATEMENT AND REGULATORY APPROVAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. The study protocol and relevant documents have been approved by the medical ethical&#xD;
      committee of the Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. All&#xD;
      participating centers are provided with the study protocol and relevant documents in January&#xD;
      2019, so that participating centers can ask their local ethical committees for approval if&#xD;
      needed according to local ethical protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. DATA HANDLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.1 Database system The Castor database system (www.castoredc.com) will be used. This online&#xD;
      medical research database system is certified to meet international security standards and is&#xD;
      compliant with all relevant regulations, amongst which are ICH-GCP, GDPR, HIPAA, FDA 21 CFR&#xD;
      part 11, ISO 27001 and ISO 9001. More information and individual security certificates can be&#xD;
      found on https://www.castoredc.com/security-statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Case report form (CRF) A detailed CRF is created from the Castor (www.castoredc.com)&#xD;
      database and provided to the invited centers (see also appendix 1). The CRF includes info&#xD;
      points with definitions and guidelines that aid in adequate scoring of the listed parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Data collection and data entering All patient data will be entered anonymously by or&#xD;
      under supervision of the treating physician(s). Up to 4 users per participating center will&#xD;
      receive a Castor login username and password and these users can enter data into the&#xD;
      database. In addition to entering data per patient individually, local study teams can upload&#xD;
      their already existing database into the Castor database system and add only the additional&#xD;
      data that is required for this study. The TENTACLE study team will provide a short&#xD;
      step-by-step manual and can provide additional help with this, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Data privacy statement All anonymous study data will be available to the TENTACLE study&#xD;
      team. The data of a center will be available to that specific center only through the Castor&#xD;
      database system website. The data will not contain identifiable patient parameters (e.g. no&#xD;
      date of birth, no date of surgery, etc.). In compliance with the General Data Protection&#xD;
      Regulation (GDPR - EU 2016/679). Each patient will be coded with a unique patient number so&#xD;
      that patients in the study are untraceable from the study database. Surgeons that participate&#xD;
      in the TENTACLE study are asked to keep a password coded file that can identify individual&#xD;
      patients locked away in their practice. This file can be accessed by the local investigators&#xD;
      if needed, for example in case a relevant new research question requires entering of&#xD;
      additional data into the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. PUBLICATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.1 Main publications&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to publish two main manuscripts that cover the investigation of our main study&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigation of what factors are associated with anastomotic leakage severity and&#xD;
           composition of the anastomotic leakage severity score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate of what anastomotic leakage characteristics are associated with success of&#xD;
           different anastomotic leakage treatments and comparison of the effectiveness of&#xD;
           different initial anastomotic leakage treatments for leakages classified according to&#xD;
           severity and leakage characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Other publications Other possible publications will cover the secondary study objectives&#xD;
      . These manuscripts will be defined at a later stage in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3 Publication policy The TENTACLE study embraces corporate authorship and all&#xD;
      collaborators that contribute to this study will form the TENTACLE collaborative group. This&#xD;
      group will co-author all publications in which TENTACLE study data is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol writing committee is fully involved in conducting this study and will be&#xD;
      included as authors in both main publication(s) in which the TENTACLE study data is used. If&#xD;
      the journal to which a manuscript is submitted does not allow the number of authors of the&#xD;
      two main manuscripts, authors join the collaborative group instead, based on scientific input&#xD;
      during the study, manuscript writing and revising.&#xD;
