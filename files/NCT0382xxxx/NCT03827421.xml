  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Doppler is a noninvasive tool. Using velocity measurements and pulsatility index&#xD;
      it allows the evaluation of cerebral haemodynamics. In patients presenting brain injury&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion may be impaired. Indirect cerebral blood flow can be monitored and risk of&#xD;
      neurological worsening can be detected using transcranial Doppler. Education and performance&#xD;
      of emergency physicians must be evaluated on brain-injured patients because this tool is&#xD;
      operator dependent. The main objective of this study is to estimate the average number of&#xD;
      exams required to learn transcranial Doppler within junior emergency physicians with the&#xD;
      achievement of their learning curve. We will perform a prospective, monocentric,&#xD;
      observational study within the neurosurgical resuscitation department of Grenoble Alpes&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transcranial dopplers will be carry out on 75 brain-damaged patients by 13 emergency&#xD;
      residents physicians after a theoretical and practical training. They will be evaluated by 8&#xD;
      experts. The primary endpoint will be the mean number of transcranial dopplers required to&#xD;
      have an excellent concordance between resident and expert. The concordance between the&#xD;
      Doppler findings of the resident and the expert would exceed 0.8 before 30 examinations. The&#xD;
      learning curve assessed on the duration necessary to acquire good quality data should&#xD;
      decrease rapidly with the repetition of the examinations. Validating the transcranial Doppler&#xD;
      learning curve for junior emergency physician would allow them to perform this exam safely&#xD;
      and efficiently. Transcranial Doppler may be easy and fast to learn but the persistence of&#xD;
      its competency over time should be evaluated.&#xD;
