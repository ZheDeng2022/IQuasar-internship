  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy, safety of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SBRT) in combination with immunotherapy in participants with metastatic non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) who are eligible for an immunotherapy agent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 T-cell checkpoint pathway is an effective and well tolerated&#xD;
      approach to stimulating the immune response which is a critical option in the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC. However, progression free survival (PFS) is increased by only 2-4 months&#xD;
      and median overall survival (OS) by 3-9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is compelling evidence that PFS is increased up to 3 fold and OS by 2 fold in patients&#xD;
      receiving a course of radiation therapy while on immunotherapy. Radiotherapy is known to&#xD;
      induce immunogenic tumor cell death and upregulation of dendritic cells and antigen&#xD;
      presentation leading to activation of cytotoxic T-Cells. Dramatic T-cell activation has been&#xD;
      demonstrated where tumor regression occurs outside the radiation treatment field in a&#xD;
      phenomenon termed the abscopal effect and is associated with high dose radiation delivered&#xD;
      via SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, SBRT activation of T-cells could be complementary to immunotherapy and enhance&#xD;
      T-cell mediated killing via PD-L1 blockade which could lead to lasting and durable tumor&#xD;
      response with improved progression free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
