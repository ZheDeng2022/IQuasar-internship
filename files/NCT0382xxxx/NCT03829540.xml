      This study is designed as a single arm open label Phase I, 3x3, multicenter study of&#xD;
      CD4-directed chimeric antigen receptor engineered T-cells (CD4CAR) in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Specifically, the study will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of CD4CAR T-cells. Funding Source - FDA OOPD&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed as a dose-escalation protocol. Due to the relatively low&#xD;
      incidence and prevalence of cluster of differentiation 4-positive (CD4+) hematological&#xD;
      malignancies and the associated aggressive nature of these diseases and the sequel of&#xD;
      treatment failure, the investigators expect to recruit 20 subjects at Stony Brook with an&#xD;
      expected dropout rate of 25% primarily due to rapid progression or death and screen and or&#xD;
      manufacturing failure. Taking this into account, the investigators expect to treat 15&#xD;
      patients. The study will utilize autologous CD4CAR T-cells that are engineered to express a&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting CD4 that is linked to the cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 28 (CD28), 4-1BB, cluster of differentiation 3-zeta (CD3ζ) signaling chains&#xD;
      (third generation CAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At entry, disease status will be staged and investigators will determine if the subject has&#xD;
      the minimal T cell number adequate for apheresis (screening step) and for manufacturing&#xD;
      CD4CAR cells. qualifying subjects will be leukapheresed to obtain large numbers of peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for the manufacturing. Next, participants will receive&#xD;
      conditioning chemotherapy. If tumor burden is sufficiently reduced (screening step),&#xD;
      participants will receive CD4CAR cells by infusion on Day 0 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cell harvest, 12-15-liter apheresis procedure will be performed at the apheresis center&#xD;
      with the intention to harvest at least 50x10^9-nucleated cells to manufacture CD4CAR T-cells.&#xD;
      A portion of the pheresed cells will also be cryopreserved for FDA look-back requirements and&#xD;
      for further research. The T-cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with CD4CAR&#xD;
      lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro, and then frozen for administration. Each dose will be&#xD;
      stored in either one or two bags. The route of administration is by IV infusion and the&#xD;
      duration of infusion will be approximately 20 minutes. Each bag will contain an aliquot&#xD;
      (30-50 mL) of liquid suitable for freezing, and containing the following infusible grade&#xD;
      reagents (% v/v): 62.5cc Plasmalyte-A 5% dextrose; 7.5cc Pure dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 20cc&#xD;
      of 25% Human Serum Albumin, and 10cc Dextran 40. The cell product is expected to be ready for&#xD;
      release approximately 3-4 weeks after apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease progresses during the manufacturing period participants may be excluded from&#xD;
      the study. Minimal chemotherapy to keep the disease under control in the meanwhile is allowed&#xD;
      if deemed necessary by investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of CD4CAR transduced T cells will consist of the cell number for the dose level&#xD;
      to be infused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-infusion monitoring: on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28 following infusion of CD4CAR&#xD;
      T-cells, evaluation of leukemic cell killing and CD4CAR Trafficking will be done. Cytokines&#xD;
      levels will be evaluated on Day 2, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21, 28 and every 8 hours during active&#xD;
      cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Active monitoring of fungal and viral infections during&#xD;
      treatment while utilizing standard prophylaxis recommended for HIV-positive patients with&#xD;
      T-cell aplasia and those undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant. Investigators plan to&#xD;
      collect data about clinicoradiologic measurements of residual tumor burden starting on day 6&#xD;
      and weekly afterward until remission and then monthly for 6 months. This will be followed by&#xD;
      quarterly clinical evaluations for the next two (2) years with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and comprehensive blood testing. After these short- and intermediate-term&#xD;
      evaluations are performed, these patients will enter a rollover study to assess for&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS), relapse, and the development of other health problems or&#xD;
      malignancies for annual where follow-up will by phone and a questionnaire for an additional&#xD;
      thirteen (13) years. The treating physician will decide to proceed with allogeneic or&#xD;
      autologous transplant when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of CD4CAR description: the main objective of this study is to establish a recommended&#xD;
      dose and/or schedule of CD4CAR. The guiding principle for dose escalation in phase I is to&#xD;
      avoid unnecessary exposure of patients to sub-therapeutic doses (i.e., to treat as many&#xD;
      patients as possible within the therapeutic dose range) while preserving safety and&#xD;
      maintaining rapid accrual. Investigators will use the rule-based traditional Phase I &quot;3+3&quot;&#xD;
      design for the evaluation of safety. Based on lab experience in mice the starting dose (dose&#xD;
      level 1) for the first cohort of three patients in phase I portion of the study will be&#xD;
      8x10^5 cells. The dose escalation or de-escalation will follow a modified Fibonacci sequence&#xD;
      as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than one patient out of the first cohort of three patients in dose level 1 experience&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the trial will be placed on hold. If zero or one out of three&#xD;
      patients in the first cohort of dose level 1 experience DLT, three more patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at dose level 1; the dose escalation continues until at least two patients among a&#xD;
      cohort of six patients experience DLT (i.e., ≥33% of patients with a DLT at this dose level)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If one of the first three patients in dose level 1 experiences a DLT, three more&#xD;
           patients will be treated at dose level 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If none of the three patients or only one of the 6 patients in the dose level 1&#xD;
           experiences a DLT, the dose escalation continues to the dose level 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If one of the first three patients in dose level 2 experience a DLT, three more patients&#xD;
           will be treated at dose level 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If none of the three patients or only one of the 6 patients in the dose level2&#xD;
           experiences a DLT, the dose escalation continues to the dose level 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If one of the first three patients in dose level 3 experiences a DLT, three more&#xD;
           patients will be treated at dose level 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If none of the three patients or only one of the 6 patients in the dose level 3&#xD;
           experiences a DLT, dose level 3 will be declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
           will be used as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the phase II portion of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the dose escalation continues until at least two patients among a cohort of six&#xD;
      patients experience DLT (i.e., ≥33% of patients with a DLT at that dose level). The&#xD;
      recommended dose for phase II trials is defined as one dose level below this toxic dose&#xD;
      level. Since some grade 3 and possibly 4 toxicities are highly likely to be reversible, grade&#xD;
      3 infectious, hematological and vascular toxicities will not be considered DLTs mandating&#xD;
      dose reduction. Also allergic or infusion-related reactions ≤ grade 3 will not be counted as&#xD;
      DLTs. There will be no intra-patient dose escalation or reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow for full spectrum toxicity duration evaluation and reporting, no patients within the&#xD;
      same or a different cohort will be initiated on lymphodepleting chemotherapy sooner than 28&#xD;
      days from the initiation date of the preceding patient.&#xD;
