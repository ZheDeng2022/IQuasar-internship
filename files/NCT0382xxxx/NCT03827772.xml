  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic liver disease has become one of the foremost causes of chronic liver disease across&#xD;
      the world, and a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality. Alcoholic steatohepatitis is&#xD;
      an entity in this broad spectrum, with severe alcoholic hepatitis transitioning to acute on&#xD;
      chronic liver failure carrying a one month mortality of as high as 20 to 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current management guidelines for severe alcoholic hepatitis show benefit with prolonged&#xD;
      alcohol abstinence, nutritional support, the use of corticosteroids, pentoxifylline or&#xD;
      N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and early liver transplantation. However, major studies and&#xD;
      meta-analyses have demonstrated that these interventions, with the exception of early liver&#xD;
      transplantation, do not improve mortality rates to the level of statistical significance.&#xD;
      Owing to the high short term mortality associated with severe alcoholic hepatitis, the&#xD;
      inadequacy of a treatment that could significantly impact this short term mortality, and the&#xD;
      limited applicability of early liver transplantation, a study on newer modalities of&#xD;
      treatment is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role that human gut microbiota plays in health and disease is receiving considerable&#xD;
      attention. Targeting intestinal dysbiosis, a phenomenon found to be intricately linked with&#xD;
      the causation of alcoholic hepatitis, could provide insights into novel therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbiota transplantation is a novel approach that has gained widespread acceptance in&#xD;
      in the management of recurrent severe Clostridium difficile infection. It's role is also&#xD;
      being studied in other diseases where an association with gut dysbiosis has been found, such&#xD;
      as in inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The role of FMT has also been&#xD;
      studied in liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In this process, a diseased recipient is transferred&#xD;
      fecal material containing the microflora of a healthy individual. It limits the colonization&#xD;
      of pathogens, inducing colonization resistance, affects microbiota composition in the gut, as&#xD;
      well as metabolism in the microbial pathogens. FMT helps alleviate gut dysbiosis and restores&#xD;
      gut microbial diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to evaluate the role of FMT on short term survival and improvement in scores of&#xD;
      prognostic significance (CTP, MELD, MELDNa, mDF) in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.&#xD;
