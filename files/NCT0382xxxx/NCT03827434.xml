  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is rising and more than 30 million of Americans or&#xD;
      9.4% of the US population has DM. Several large scale randomized clinical trials have found&#xD;
      that improved glycemic control reduces the development of complications in patients with DM.&#xD;
      However intensive glucose management carries an increased risk of hypoglycemia, a condition&#xD;
      that may lead to neurological damage and is associated with increased incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing uncontrolled hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia represents therefore an important&#xD;
      objective, as may decrease the direct and indirect impact that diabetes has in our health&#xD;
      care system. Achieving optimal glycemic control requires frequent blood glucose monitoring by&#xD;
      the patients and recurrent clinic visits,which is often difficult to achieve, as access to&#xD;
      typical DM clinic is at least sub optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      m-Health and telemedicine health solutions represent alternative ways to manage patients in&#xD;
      the outpatient setting and have been applied in different medical areas, among them in&#xD;
      diabetes. However, almost all the telemedicine studies that have been previously performed&#xD;
      and recruited DM patients used telemedicine solutions which were based on point of care (POC)&#xD;
      finger-stick glucose testing, which are checked infrequently , usually 4-6 times/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices offer additional ways to monitor blood glucose&#xD;
      values and can provide numerous glucose measurements (as frequent as every 5 min). By using&#xD;
      software applications, such as the Clarity (Dexcom), which highlights glucose patterns,&#xD;
      trends and statistics in standardized reports, providers can make safe recommendations of&#xD;
      adjusting DM medications, especially insulin titration. In this randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      investigators propose to use CGM devices and Clarity software as a telemedicine platform in&#xD;
      order to improve glycemic control and improve health outcomes.&#xD;
