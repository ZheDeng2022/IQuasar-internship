      This study evaluates a high intake of milk compared with a high intake of soured milk&#xD;
      (Swedish filmjölk) on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in a randomized crossover&#xD;
      intervention study.&#xD;

      A diet rich in antioxidants reduces oxidative stress and inflammation and could potentially&#xD;
      improve health and lower the rate of hip fracture. Milk and dairy are also promoted as part&#xD;
      of a healthy diet since they contain 18 of 22 essential nutrients including calcium,&#xD;
      phosphorous, and vitamin D and have been suggested to be associated with lower risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, especially stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Meta-analyses of milk&#xD;
      and dairy on fracture and mortality risk in cohort studies are, however, inconclusive and&#xD;
      show significant heterogeneity between studies. Small intakes may have beneficial effects in&#xD;
      comparison to null intake whereas higher intakes may have other effects and non-linear&#xD;
      relationships are rarely examined. Frequently, different milk products are considered as one&#xD;
      entity in cohort studies. The investigators recently showed that different milk products&#xD;
      might have differential effects on disease. A high long-term milk intake was associated with&#xD;
      an increased risk of mortality (total, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality) and hip&#xD;
      fracture, especially among women, whereas a high long-term intake of fermented milk (soured&#xD;
      milk and yogurt or cheese) was associated with a lower risk of mortality and fracture among&#xD;
      women. Similar results have been presented for total mortality (Northern Sweden) and humeral&#xD;
      fractures (South-Eastern Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intake of milk and fermented milk is of tradition high in Sweden. The prevalence of lactase&#xD;
      persistence is high (around 95%). The range in milk intake from non- and low-consumers to&#xD;
      high consumers makes Sweden an appropriate setting for epidemiological and interventional&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common potential mechanism for intake of fruits, vegetables, and different dairy products&#xD;
      on risk of disease is their influence on inflammation and oxidative stress. Chronic low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation and age-related increase of oxidative stress are suggested pathogenic mechanisms&#xD;
      of premature ageing and many diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, accelerated&#xD;
      bone loss (leading to osteoporosis), and age-related reduction of muscle strength and mass&#xD;
      (sarcopenia) with potential impacts on risk of falling and fracture. The lower risk of&#xD;
      fractures with a high intake of fermented milk products observed may be due to potential&#xD;
      probiotic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects and effects on gut microbiota. A high&#xD;
      intake of milk was not only associated with risk of mortality and fractures but also with&#xD;
      increased concentrations of inflammation and oxidative stress markers. An inverse association&#xD;
      was seen for intake of soured milk and yogurt [Michaëlsson, 2014]. Fermented milk products&#xD;
      with probiotics have been shown to reduce the levels of inflammation markers, other studies&#xD;
      have been small to show conclusive effects and results may also be dependent on the probiotic&#xD;
      strain. A head-to-head comparison of the effect of regular milk and soured milk (or yogurt)&#xD;
      on markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in a randomized intervention study is&#xD;
      warranted. The randomized crossover intervention study will be performed among both men and&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine the potentially different short-term effects of milk and&#xD;
      sour milk on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in a randomized cross-over trial.&#xD;
      The research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In a randomized cross-over trial, what is the effect of a daily intake of at least 500&#xD;
           ml of Swedish milk compared with an intake of at least 500 ml Swedish soured milk&#xD;
           (filmjölk) during 3 weeks on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the effects of these milk products on a large number of proteins related with&#xD;
           inflammation and ageing diseases, assessed with large-scale proteomic analysis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the effects of these milk products on metabolites involved in inflammation and&#xD;
           ageing diseases using large-scale metabolomics analysis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What are the effects of these milk products on the gut microflora (microbiome)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in proteomics, metabolomics and the gut microbiome are other pre-specified outcome&#xD;
      measures but since they are exploratory in nature, we do not specify them under outcomes&#xD;
      since it is not possible to exactly specify these outcome measures. Exploratory analyses will&#xD;
      include whether effects are different between men and women, dependent on body composition&#xD;
      (assessed with whole body dual X-ray absorptiometry, DXA) or long-term dietary intake&#xD;
      (assessed by fatty acid composition in subcutaneous fat). Participants will be allowed to&#xD;
      consume more than 500 ml of milk/filmjölk during the intervention periods and, if possible, a&#xD;
      potential dose-response effect will be evaluated.&#xD;
