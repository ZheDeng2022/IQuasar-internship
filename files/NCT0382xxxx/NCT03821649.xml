  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution programs (OEND) involve training and&#xD;
      equipping people who are likely to be bystanders to opioid overdose to recognize and respond&#xD;
      to opioid-related emergencies by activating emergency services, delivering basic life support&#xD;
      and administering naloxone. The goal of the Surviving Opioid Overdose with Naloxone Education&#xD;
      and Resuscitation (SOONER) trial is to identify if point-of-care OEND increases rates of&#xD;
      satisfactory bystander resuscitative performance to simulated opioid overdose in comparison&#xD;
      with the existing standard of care. Recruitment and retention of participants at risk of&#xD;
      overdose, and the acceptability of the simulated overdose outcome may challenge the&#xD;
      feasibility of the SOONER trial. The primary objective is to identify if an integrated&#xD;
      participant recruitment and retention strategy can recruit approximately 28 eligible&#xD;
      participants within 4 weeks and maintain less than 50% attrition in the context of a&#xD;
      randomized trial on point-of-care OEND and simulated overdose resuscitation performance in&#xD;
      family practice, emergency department, and addictions settings in Toronto, Ontario. After the&#xD;
      initial 28 participants, we are continuing to recruit up to 50 more participants in a&#xD;
      bridging phase that leads into the full trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deaths from opioid overdose represent an important and expanding global public health&#xD;
      epidemic. Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution programs (OEND) involve&#xD;
      training and equipping people who are likely to witness overdose to recognize these&#xD;
      emergencies and administer essential first aid interventions including naloxone, a widely&#xD;
      known and effective competitive opioid antagonist. Policymakers and practitioners have called&#xD;
      for expanded access to OEND programs in clinical settings such as emergency departments,&#xD;
      family practice, and addiction medicine clinics, or &quot;point-of-care OEND&quot;. Point-of-care OEND&#xD;
      would improve access to this potentially life-saving intervention. Simple and effective&#xD;
      point-of-care OEND tools are a prerequisite for the successful translation of this&#xD;
      intervention into general ambulatory settings, including family practice, addiction medicine&#xD;
      and psychiatry clinics, and emergency departments. The investigators plan to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized trial to evaluate the educational effectiveness of a novel point-of-care OEND kit&#xD;
      in a simulated opioid overdose, in comparison with existing community- and hospital-based&#xD;
      OEND programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conducting trials among people who use drugs or who are likely to witness overdose involves&#xD;
      several well-documented scientific, logistical, and bioethical challenges. These challenges&#xD;
      contribute to the persistent under-evaluation of interventions to enhance the health of this&#xD;
      marginalized population, and threats to study validity when retention rates are low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, retention and attrition rates could alter the study timelines, logistics and&#xD;
      costs for the proposed trial. A feasibility study is needed to evaluate and refine an&#xD;
      integrated participant recruitment and retention strategy, develop expected retention rates,&#xD;
      establish the local acceptability of study procedures in recruitment sites, and reconsider&#xD;
      study design and analysis if required. A feasibility study will also permit the evaluation of&#xD;
      basic randomization and data collection procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to identify if an integrated participant&#xD;
      recruitment and retention strategy can recruit approximately 28 eligible participants within&#xD;
      4 weeks and maintain less than 50% attrition in the context of a randomized trial on&#xD;
      point-of-care OEND and simulated overdose resuscitation performance in family practice,&#xD;
      emergency department, and addiction medicine settings at St. Michael's Hospital, and in&#xD;
      family practice at the Inner City Family Health Team.&#xD;
