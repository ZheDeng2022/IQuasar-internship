  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study at the Baylor College of Medicine, Division of Vascular Surgery and&#xD;
      Endovascular Therapy, is being proposed to test the efficacy of a novel electrical&#xD;
      stimulation platform named the Tennant Biomodulator designed by AVAZZIA to accelerate wound&#xD;
      healing, relieve pain and improve mobility in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation may offer a unique treatment option to heal complicated and&#xD;
      recalcitrant wounds, improve flap and graft survival, and even reduce the likelihood of&#xD;
      ulceration. Electrical stimulation has been suggested to reduce infection, improve cellular&#xD;
      immunity, increase perfusion, relieve pain, improve plantar sensation, and accelerate wound&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation could have positive effect on not only increasing skin perfusion in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes but also could improve mobility and balance via enhancing plantar&#xD;
      sensation as demonstrated in our recent study. Thus, plantar stimulation not only may be&#xD;
      beneficial to accelerate wound healing in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients but also may&#xD;
      assist to improve mobility and reduce the likelihood of recurrence of ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is proposed to examine the effectiveness of an innovative portable electrical&#xD;
      stimulation platform (Tennant Biomodulator by AVAZZIA) to accelerate wound healing in DFU&#xD;
      patients. It is hypothesized that 1) electrical stimulation will have an immediate effect on&#xD;
      increasing skin perfusion (immediate benefit) and 2) daily use of the Tennant Biomodulator&#xD;
      for 4 consecutive weeks is effective to speed up wound healing, increase skin perfusion,&#xD;
      reduce pain, and improve balance and mobility in DFU patients (long term benefit)&#xD;
