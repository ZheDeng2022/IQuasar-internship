  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pragmatic randomized controlled trial (expected N = 80) of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      to contrast two psychotherapeutic implementation strategies (State-of-the-Art welcome phase&#xD;
      vs. prolonged focus on sudden changes). Blinded allocation of implementation strategy for&#xD;
      patients; open label for therapists (no blinding possible), randomized allocation for&#xD;
      patients, therapist allocation via ABAB-design (crossed-therapist design). Post treatment&#xD;
      self-reported outcome will be measured based on a latent outcome factor (i. e. &quot;outcome&#xD;
      composite&quot;).&#xD;

      State of research. The proposed trial has a common theme, i.e., the understanding of the&#xD;
      enduring efficacy of psychological treatments in individuals who suffer from general anxiety&#xD;
      disorder (GAD). There is meta-analytic evidence that bona fide psychotherapy is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for GAD, but also for individuals that suffers from anxiety and depression.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, in spite of the empirical evidence of the overall efficacy, there is a lack of&#xD;
      randomized controlled studies that systematically investigate the therapists' variability (i.&#xD;
      e. therapist effects) within the very same treatment protocol. The development of study&#xD;
      designs to investigate potential health professional effects along treatment effects is a&#xD;
      general claim for human interventions. This protocol includes one of the very first&#xD;
      process-outcome trials in GAD that systematically examine theory-based patients' and&#xD;
      therapists' characteristics simultaneously using longitudinal multilevel methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with investigating therapist and patient characteristics, two methods for timing the&#xD;
      check-in phase at the beginning of each session will be compared by keeping constant the&#xD;
      standardized treatment manual for patients with GAD: (a) prolonged focus on subtle changes&#xD;
      check-in condition lasting from 7 to 20 minutes and (b) a state of the art (SOA) check-in&#xD;
      phase lasting from 5 to 10 minutes. To address the nested data structure, therapists will be&#xD;
      allocated by a single-subject ABAB-design. A total of 80 patients (40 participants in each of&#xD;
      the two conditions) with a primary GAD diagnosis will be treated by 20 advanced&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy trainees at the psychotherapy outpatient clinic in the&#xD;
      department of psychology at the university of Zürich.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance. (a) Study population. GAD is a neglected disorder in the Swiss mental health&#xD;
      system. GAD is associated with personal suffering, a reduced quality of life, and high&#xD;
      economic costs. (b) Design development. Systematic integration of potential therapist effects&#xD;
      is a neglected aspect in many areas of evidence-based human interventions (inside but also&#xD;
      outside of psychological interventions). (c) Treatment development. Evidence-based treatments&#xD;
      are usually far from being fully efficacious. There is a debate about innovative research&#xD;
      agendas and how to foster the efficacy of such treatments. (d) Experimental process-outcome&#xD;
      research. There is a need for future research to investigate theory-based therapist effects&#xD;
      and in-session timing within rigorous experimental process-outcome research designs to better&#xD;
      understand the factors involved in therapeutic change (e.g.&#xD;
      http://www.nature.com/news/therapy-deficit-1.11477).&#xD;

    <description>The implementation of an evidence-based treatment is largely principle-based - allowing considerable therapeutic flexibility in determining and timing of different treatment aspects. In this condition progress, subtle changes and sudden gains may be an explicit topic and there is no restraint to avoid such topics. However, the therapists are not obligated to take a systematized focus on potential subtle changes and they may use the timing of the sessions to involve the patients into the other tasks of therapy.</description>

    <description>In the present study, the MAW-packet will be applied within a usual 16-session individual therapy format and up to 3 further booster sessions.&#xD;
The session format of 50-60 minute usually consists of (a) a check-in phase of 5 to 15 minutes that includes a patients welcoming, reviewing self-help and agenda setting, (b) a working phase around 35-45 minutes that focuses on the previously agreed session goals, (c) a feedback phase of 5 to 10 minutes that summarizes the session and previews the upcoming self-help assignment.</description>
