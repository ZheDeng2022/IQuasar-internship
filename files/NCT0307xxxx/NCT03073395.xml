    <textblock>
      An phase I study to evaluate the uptake of [68Ga]P16-093 in known or suspected metastatic&#xD;
      prostate or renal cancer to establish the feasibility of using [68Ga]P16-093 to image PSMA&#xD;
      expressing cancer. Measurement of the whole body biodistribution of [68Ga]P16-093 in prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients post primary curative-intent treatment with stable PSA to generate human&#xD;
      radiation dosimetry data.&#xD;

        DYNAMIC GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants will be male ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of histologically confirmed cancer that meets criteria for either a) or b)&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Prostate cancer with known or suspected recurrent or metastatic disease based on&#xD;
                  clinical imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT, FACBC PET/CT)&#xD;
                  within 12 months of screening. If subject is post curative-intent local treatment&#xD;
                  (e.g. radical prostatectomy, local radiotherapy, brachytherapy) they must have&#xD;
                  had no intervening change in cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Renal Cell cancer with known or suspected metastatic disease based on clinical&#xD;
                  imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be&#xD;
             willing to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. If clinical imaging (e.g. bone scan, CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET/CT) has been done within&#xD;
             3 months of screening as part of standard clinical surveillance it must be negative or&#xD;
