  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy&#xD;
      of extended-release naltrexone plus bupropion as a combination pharmacotherapy for&#xD;
      methamphetamine use disorder. Participants will be randomly assigned to the active medication&#xD;
      combination (AMC) group or matching placebo group and will receive medications over the&#xD;
      course of 12 weeks. Follow-ups will occur in weeks 13 and 16.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 400 adults with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder randomized into&#xD;
      this multi-site study. Eligibility will be determined during a maximum 21 day screening&#xD;
      period. After screening is completed and eligibility is confirmed, including successful&#xD;
      administration of a naloxone challenge, participants will begin the 12 week medication phase&#xD;
      of the trial. Participants will be randomized to either the 1) AMC arm and receive injections&#xD;
      of extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX; as VivitrolÂ®) plus once-daily oral extended-release&#xD;
      bupropion tablets (BUP-XL) or the 2) matching placebo (PLB) arm and receive injections of&#xD;
      placebo (iPLB) plus once-daily oral placebo (oPLB) tablets. During the course of the study,&#xD;
      participants may be switched to another arm, as determined by the a priori adaptive aspect of&#xD;
      the study design. Participants appearing to respond well to their original treatment&#xD;
      assignment will not be switched. Overall, approximately 50% of the participants will receive&#xD;
      the AMC. Injections will be administered every three weeks, in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10.&#xD;
      Take-home oral study medication (BUP-XL or oPLB) will be dispensed weekly for dosing on&#xD;
      non-clinic days. Participants will be asked to attend the clinic twice weekly for observed&#xD;
      oral medication dosing, assessments, collection of urine samples, and once-weekly medical&#xD;
      management. On non-clinic days, participants will participate in smartphone app-based&#xD;
      medication adherence activities. Participants will be asked to complete assessments as&#xD;
      indicated on the schedule of assessments. Following the 12 week medication phase,&#xD;
      participants will complete a follow-up phase, including a medication taper and&#xD;
      post-medication phase follow-up visits during weeks 13 and 16.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants were randomized to either the AMC arm or the Placebo arm in Week 1; thus all are represented in the two Stage 1 categories (total 403).&#xD;
All participants also are represented in Stage 2. Some participants were re-randomized at Week 7 and some were not; thus the four Stage 2 categories also total 403.</pre_assignment_details>

PHQ-9 scores reflect depression severity, ranges from 0-27 (0 no depressive symptoms, 1-4 minimal depression, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, 20-27 severe depression)</description>
