    <textblock>
      Islet Transplantation is a procedure used in people with difficult to control Type 1&#xD;
      Diabetes. Insulin producing cells (islets) are isolated from a deceased donor pancreas. After&#xD;
      the cells are carefully isolated from the donor pancreas, the islets are transplanted into&#xD;
      the recipient's liver. These transplanted islets may produce insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges with islet transplant is the death of some of the transplanted islets&#xD;
      due to inflammation, oxidative stress and exposure to diabetogenic immunosuppressive agents&#xD;
      associated with islet functional impairment and graft loss, especially linked to the use of&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors, including tacrolimus (Tac).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiaging glycopeptide (PKX-001) is a small, stable, synthetic replica of antifreeze proteins&#xD;
      (AFPs), which naturally occur in Arctic and Antarctic fish and have been shown protecting&#xD;
      cells against harmful conditions. PKX-001 is a new drug that has been shown in lab studies to&#xD;
      help islet cells survive isolation and keep them healthy and functioning. Most importantly,&#xD;
      animal studies have shown that islets treated with PKX-001 were protected from the&#xD;
      immunosuppressant (Tac) toxicity and retained their function in animals receiving islet&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve up to 10 participants from the islet transplant waiting list at the&#xD;
      Clinical Islet Transplant Program. All participants will receive islets treated with the&#xD;
      medication PKX-001. PKX-001 will be used only in the islet preservation process, and will not&#xD;
      be given to participants as medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety of transplantation of PKX-001 treated&#xD;
      islets and to evaluate the cytoprotective capacity of PKX-001 in islet transplantation,&#xD;
      especially its capacity to protect against Tac induced graft dysfunction.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical islet transplantation is today an accepted modality to treat selected diabetic&#xD;
      patients with frequent hypoglycemic events and severe glycemic liability. Although islet&#xD;
      transplantation outcomes have improved significantly in highly specialized centers with a&#xD;
      5-year insulin independence rate exceeding 50%, a proportion of patients require&#xD;
      reintroduction of insulin later on. Tac may be partly responsible for the limited islet&#xD;
      durability and the need for multiple donors for each recipient in spite of its ability to&#xD;
      prevent rejection and autoimmune recurrence. In vitro studies of islets exposed to&#xD;
      immunosuppressants have shown that Tac levels above 10-100 mg/L cause vacuolization and&#xD;
      destruction of islets in culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have generated considerable interest for their ability to protect&#xD;
      cells under a variety of conditions. However, their large size restricts their use in&#xD;
      medicine as they are unable to pass through capillaries into interstitial tissue and are&#xD;
      unable to reach target cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these disadvantages of AFPs in mind, Dr. Geraldine-Castelot-Deliencourt (Rouen, France)&#xD;
      invented Antiaging glycopeptide, which is later manufactured by ProtoKinetix Inc. (St. Marys,&#xD;
      West Virginia, US). ProtoKinetix' anti-aging glycopeptide, PKX-001, is a small, stable,&#xD;
      synthetic replica of the larger, less stable AFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PKX-001 has gone through a series of tests in various outsourced laboratories in Europe and&#xD;
      North America. These tests have proven its ability to protect a multitude of cell lines (Hela&#xD;
      cells, adult fibroblast, neonatal fibroblasts, human neuronal stem cells, mouse neuronal stem&#xD;
      cells, mouse islet cells, blood platelets, cluster of differentiation 34+ (CD34+) cells, and&#xD;
      keratinocytes) against ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet C (UVC), Hydrogen Peroxide,&#xD;
      Inflammatory (ILβ), Time, Temperature (-196°C, -80°C, -3°C, 3°C, 4°C, 15°C and 22°C) and Low&#xD;
      Serum induced cell death at pHs from 5.3 -10.5. In addition to protecting cell survival&#xD;
      PKX-001 also preserves cell functionality. This has been tested via stem cell markers, CD34+&#xD;
      functionality tests, and in vivo studies where PKX-001 treated transplanted islet cells were&#xD;
      found to reduce blood glucose concentrations in diabetic mice by 40% by day 40 in comparison&#xD;
      to islet cells which were transplanted into mice without first being exposed to PKX-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the beneficial roles of PKX-001 on cellular survival and functionality&#xD;
      preservation, our team have evaluated the cytoprotective capacity of PKX-001 in islet&#xD;
      transplant, especially its capacity of protection against the diabetogenic effect of Tac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro assessment of human islets in culture with PKX-001 supplementation has also showed&#xD;
      enhanced quality and yield of post-preservation human islets and protection against acute&#xD;
      exposure to Tac at clinical relevant doses compared with those without PKX-001&#xD;
      supplementation. Further analysis indicated that islets treated with PKX-001 had decreased&#xD;
      oxidative stress, improved insulin release by increasing islet exocytosis, decreased islet&#xD;
      loss during preservation due to apoptosis, even in the presence of Tac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo studies have complemented all in vitro findings above, which demonstrated that&#xD;
      PKX-001 supplementation suppressed early inflammation and improved islet engraftment with&#xD;
      long-term efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a phase I, non-randomized, open-label, single arm, prospective trial&#xD;
      using retrospective controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten adult Islet transplant candidates (18 years and older), deemed appropriate for standard&#xD;
      islet transplant at the University of Alberta Hospital will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective data from 10 islet transplant patients consented for chart review (Protocol #:&#xD;
      000001120 entitled: &quot;On-going review of islet transplant patients at the University of&#xD;
      Alberta&quot; and Protocol #: 000001122 entitled: &quot;Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry&quot;) will&#xD;
      be also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of Care controls will be identified from the Islet Transplant program database&#xD;
      (period: 2014 - 2016) and anonymized by a simple numbering system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplantation of PKX-001 treated islets is safe and improves graft outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate safety of transplantation of PKX-001 treated islets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess efficacy of transplantation of PKX-001 treated islets To assess efficacy of&#xD;
      addition of PKX-001 during islet preservation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to transplantation, the patient is screened, qualified, listed for transplant, and&#xD;
      signs the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time a suitable islet preparation becomes available, the patient will receive&#xD;
      allogeneic islet cells transplanted into patients intraportally by percutaneous transhepatic&#xD;
      access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Islet transplant will be performed under the current immunosuppression regimen including:&#xD;
      induction (Alemtuzumab/Basiliximab) and long-term immunosuppression (Prograf/Cellcept). The&#xD;
      engraftment regimen includes anti-inflammatory medications (Etanercept/Anakinra) and&#xD;
      intravenous insulin and heparin. The only additional intervention used in this pilot trial is&#xD;
      the addition of the investigational agent, PKX-001 to islet processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a 3-month follow-up period following their initial or subsequent&#xD;
      islet transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no study-specific follow-up visits required for this study. Study subjects will be&#xD;
      followed as per standard of care. For the purpose of evaluating the primary and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints, the following measurements collected on study subjects at the time points&#xD;
      indicated as per standard of care, will be chart reviewed and recorded up to Day 30&#xD;
      post-transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessment by Transplant Fellow or Staff; Post-Transplant Blood work (as per&#xD;
      Standard of Care); Metabolic testing: Ensure (or Arginine); Glucose Records for&#xD;
      Self-Monitoring. Incidence of Primary Non-Function (see Glossary for definition); Incidence&#xD;
      of Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events can be reported on any day post transplant;&#xD;
      Abdominal Ultrasound with Doppler report (clinically significant findings). The study will&#xD;
      remain open to collect all 10 recipients' follow-up data to 3 month post-transplant. Primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcome reporting will occur 90 days following the transplant of the last&#xD;
      patient to the trial.&#xD;
