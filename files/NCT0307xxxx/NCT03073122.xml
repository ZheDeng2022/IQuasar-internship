  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the landmark Boston Circulatory Arrest Study, neurologic and developmental status was&#xD;
      measured following infant heart surgery and then prospectively at ages 1, 2.5, 4, 8, and 16&#xD;
      years, with findings of significant neurocognitive deficits and brain MRI abnormalities&#xD;
      regardless of operative management. To date, no study has evaluated the neuropsychological&#xD;
      and neuroimaging antecedents and correlates of well-being in adults with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease, a population now &gt;1 million and projected to grow at 5% per year. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to study the Boston cohort at ages 24-29 years to assess the associations of adult&#xD;
      well-being with childhood and adolescent executive function, other measures of mental health&#xD;
      and cognitive function, adolescent brain MRI findings, and clinical variables; findings will&#xD;
      guide the design of interventions in childhood to optimize outcomes in adults with congenital&#xD;
      heart disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously lethal, critical congenital heart disease (CHD) can now be treated effectively&#xD;
      with surgical, catheter, and medical interventions. The resulting dramatic improvement in&#xD;
      life expectancy has brought a major demographic shift, so that adult patients with CHD now&#xD;
      outnumber children with CHD, even for complex conditions. Adult survivors are at increased&#xD;
      risk of anxiety, depression, social difficulties, lower educational attainment, and&#xD;
      underemployment. These psychosocial morbidities may be associated with deficits in executive&#xD;
      functions (EFs) and other neurocognitive abilities that are prevalent in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with CHD. Deficits in EFs, represented by measures of inhibitory control, working&#xD;
      memory, cognitive flexibility, and decision-making, are highly dependent on the integrity of&#xD;
      cortical and subcortical neural networks that continue to develop into early adulthood and&#xD;
      can have a major adverse impact on self-regulation and management. The goal of this proposal&#xD;
      is to bridge the gap in knowledge between known executive function deficits in childhood CHD&#xD;
      and adult well-being. The investigators propose to accomplish our goal by studying subjects,&#xD;
      now age 24-29 years, who were enrolled as infants in the Boston Circulatory Arrest Study and&#xD;
      then studied with respect to neuropsychological and developmental function at ages 1, 2.5, 4,&#xD;
      8, and 16 years, as well as with brain MRI at 16 years. In Aim 1, the relationship of EFs to&#xD;
      major dimensions of adult well-being will be explored. It is hypothesized that lower&#xD;
      performance on EFs will be related to poorer overall well-being. The outcomes measured to&#xD;
      determine well-being will be quality of life, neuropsychological function (e.g. social&#xD;
      cognition, memory skills), mental health diagnosis and function (e.g. anxiety, depression),&#xD;
      social relatedness, academic achievement, and adult independence (e.g. employment status,&#xD;
      medical follow up). In Aim 2, the relationship of EFs to MRI-derived measures of brain&#xD;
      structure, function, and connectivity will be determined. It is hypothesized that lower&#xD;
      performance on EFs will be associated with lower global efficiency (integration) and higher&#xD;
      modularity (segregation). The brain MRI outcomes will be measured using global white matter&#xD;
      connectivity, regional cortical gray matter thickness, gray matter connectivity measured from&#xD;
      interregional correlation in cortical thickness, and functional connectivity as defined by&#xD;
      resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. In Aim 3, longitudinal models will be&#xD;
      used to analyze the association of adult well-being with earlier measures of EFs and other&#xD;
      neurocognitive and mental health variables, as well as with earlier clinical variables and&#xD;
      adolescent neuroimaging. The associations of adult well-being dimensions with childhood and&#xD;
      adolescent EFs, other measures of mental health and cognitive function, adolescent brain MRI&#xD;
      findings, and clinical variables will be explored. The ultimate goal is to identify early,&#xD;
      modifiable risk factors for adult performance to guide the design of targeted treatment&#xD;
      strategies that optimize educational achievement, employability, and quality of life in the&#xD;
      burgeoning population of adults with CHD.&#xD;

        Study Group: All children enrolled in the original boston circulatory arrest study who are&#xD;
        alive and living in the US will be invited to participate. We estimate that about 165&#xD;
        adults will be eligible to participate as we will again attempt to contact those patients&#xD;
        who did not participate in the 16 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls (for MRI): A group of 50 normally-developed age- and sex-matched young adults ages&#xD;
        24-30 years old who are able to provide informed consent to undergo the MRI portion of the&#xD;
        study and limited neuropsychiatric (NP) evaluation. These controls will be recruited from&#xD;
        the local metro-Boston area and we will frequency-match control patients to study patients&#xD;
        by gender, integer age and handedness.&#xD;
