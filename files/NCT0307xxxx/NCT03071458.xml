      The MUTHEC project aims to describe the mutational and transcriptomic landscape of HCC&#xD;
      treated by curative treatments (resection, radio frequency ablation, transplantation) as well&#xD;
      as advanced HCC together with the analysis of circulating tumor DNA.&#xD;

      Scientific context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. A&#xD;
      transcriptomic classification (G1-G6) described by our lab have underlined the heterogeneity&#xD;
      of HCC and identified relationship between transcriptomic group and clinical and genetic&#xD;
      features. Recently, a diagnostic and molecular algorithm has been developed to perform the&#xD;
      diagnosis of benign and malignant hepatocellular tumors and assess the prognosis of resected&#xD;
      HCC. Whole-exome sequencing has also identified new oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in&#xD;
      HCC. However, these studies have focused on HCC treated by liver resection and they have to&#xD;
      be validated in biopsy and surgical pieces in larges series of patients treated by resection,&#xD;
      liver transplantation and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). In addition, next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing allows to sequence circulating tumor DNA in plasma of patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer but it has never tested in patients with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the project The MUTHEC project involves 4 teams in France and aims to perform&#xD;
      translation of molecular and genetic classification of HCC in clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators want to draw a genetic landscape of HCC in different clinical&#xD;
      settings. The investigators will sequence 30 genes, previously identified by whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing, in a series of 120 HCC treated by RFA, 200 HCC treated by liver transplantation&#xD;
      and 40 advanced HCC. The investigators also aim to validate our diagnostic and prognostic&#xD;
      molecular algorithm (56 genes including the prognostic 5-gene score using quantitative&#xD;
      RT-PCR) in different clinical settings and test their uses in formalin-fixed,&#xD;
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. In addition, the investigators will test surrogate markers&#xD;
      of genetic alterations and oncogenic pathways using immunohistochemistry in these series of&#xD;
      tumors. All the HCC will be reviewed by expert pathologist in order to perform&#xD;
      genotype/phenotype classification. Lastly, the investigators want to conduct a pilot study to&#xD;
      sequence circulating tumor DNA. The investigators will use next generation sequencing to&#xD;
      detect in the plasma the somatic mutation observed in tumor biopsy. It will allow a&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnosis of tumor mutation in the plasma of patients before and after treatment&#xD;
      by RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The investigators aim to extend our knowledge of HCC genetic alterations in&#xD;
      the different types of curative treatment (resection, liver transplantation and RFA) and in&#xD;
      advanced HCC. In addition, the investigators want to translate this classification using&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry to facilitate it uses in routine. These results will be used in the&#xD;
      future to identify subgroups predict to response to targeted treatment. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will validate our diagnostic and prognostic molecular signature in different&#xD;
      clinical situation and in FFPE samples. Assessment of prognosis after curative treatment will&#xD;
      help to stratify adjuvant treatment in the future and guide therapeutic decision. Finally,&#xD;
      sequencing circulating tumor DNA would allow monitoring somatic mutations (&quot;liquid biopsy&quot;)&#xD;
      after curative treatment and under the selective pressure of targeted therapies.&#xD;
