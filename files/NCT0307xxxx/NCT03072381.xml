  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will be the first to assess pain- and function-dependent, elbow-specific&#xD;
      quality of life and in-vivo mechanical properties of common extensor tendons post-treatment&#xD;
      with PRP in a Level 1, RCT with subject and assessor blinding. The valuable data gained will&#xD;
      significantly add to the knowledge base of treatment effects of PRP for a chronic&#xD;
      tendinopathy. Positive findings of PRP compared to control (corticosteroid injection) would&#xD;
      suggest future larger scale studies to help establish an optimal protocol for the nonsurgical&#xD;
      management of CLE. Correlating US and shear wave acoustoelastography imaging assessments with&#xD;
      validated clinical outcomes will provide a powerful tool for future outcomes analyses using a&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging modality to monitor tissue healing both morphologically as well as&#xD;
      biomechanically, and may even be used to evaluate injury risk.&#xD;

      Randomization procedures Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 study arms. Subjects in Group&#xD;
      1 (PRP) will receive a single ultrasound-guided intratendinous (common extensor tendon&#xD;
      origin) injection of up to 3 mL autologous PEAK platelet-rich plasma at week 0 (baseline).&#xD;
      Subjects in Group 2 (corticosteroid control) will receive a single ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      intratendinous injection approximately (may be limited by tendon/soft tissue limitations of&#xD;
      the subject) of 2 mL 1% lidocaine + 1mL of him 40mg Kenalog (triamcinolone hexacetonide,&#xD;
      40mg/mL) at week 0. If a subject has bilateral elbow common extensor tendon pain, both elbows&#xD;
      will be treated in the same study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Subjects and assessors will be blinded to the subject group allocation. Control&#xD;
      subjects will also undergo phlebotomy to maintain blinding. Injection syringes will be&#xD;
      cloaked using opaque adhesive tape in order to ensure the injector is unaware of subject&#xD;
      treatment allocation. Subjects will be identified to study personnel using a unique study&#xD;
      number only and results of the imaging studies will be blinded, batched and evaluated in a&#xD;
      randomized manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound imaging analyses will be conducted at baseline, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks post&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platelet concentration will be analyzed in both samples (whole blood compared to PRP) in&#xD;
      order to record and verify the consistency of the concentration factor in PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shear wave ultrasound imaging will be compared using comparison of average shear wave speed&#xD;
      (SWS) between baseline and post treatment 52 week follow-up between the two randomized&#xD;
      groups. Shear wave speed is a quantitative measure obtained by measuring speed of ultrasound&#xD;
      in a selected region of interest (ROI). In prior studies, the study team has successfully&#xD;
      blinded the investigator when selecting the ROI, and conducted inter-rater repeatability&#xD;
      analysis showing that this was a valid, repeatable way of measuring SWS in a particular ROI.&#xD;
