  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GB) is the commonest form of brain cancer in adults. Despite current treatment&#xD;
      options including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, overall survival is poor.&#xD;
      Therefore, other treatment options are being explored and there is increasing interest in the&#xD;
      possibility of using the ketogenic diet (KD), alongside current treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KD is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet. This encourages the body to use fat (broken down&#xD;
      to ketones) as its primary energy source, instead of carbohydrate (broken down to glucose, a&#xD;
      type of sugar). KDs have been considered for use in patients with GB as this type of cancer&#xD;
      is thought to use glucose as its main energy supply, which is of short supply in this diet.&#xD;
      Animal studies have shown KDs may make GB more responsive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy&#xD;
      and could improve survival by slowing the cancer's growth. However, clinical studies are&#xD;
      needed in humans to assess any possible benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will see patients randomly assigned to one of two types of KDs; the modified&#xD;
      ketogenic diet (MKD) and the medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCT). Both diets&#xD;
      follow the same high fat, low carbohydrate principles, with the MCT diet requiring the&#xD;
      patient to take some of the fat as a supplement drink instead of as food. Patients will&#xD;
      follow the diet for 12 weeks initially. The trial will look to enroll newly diagnosed GB&#xD;
      patients, from The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust over a 12 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the trial is to investigate protocol feasibility and patient impact by comparing&#xD;
      two KDs in an NHS setting, with a view to informing future phase III clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, non-blinded, randomized, pilot study will be undertaken in patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma (GB). Patients will be randomized to the modified ketogenic diet (MKD) or the&#xD;
      medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCT) for a 12 week period (primary completion). If&#xD;
      patients wish to remain on diet, they will be offered dietetic support for a total of 12&#xD;
      months (secondary completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be open to all Walton Centre Foundation Trust patients with a newly diagnosed&#xD;
      GB, who have undergone surgical resection or biopsy within the last four months and who are&#xD;
      going on to receive/ are currently receiving/ have completed oncological treatments&#xD;
      (radiotherapy or chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy). Patients will be referred via&#xD;
      neuro-oncology multi-disciplinary meetings and neurosurgical clinics, post histology. The&#xD;
      diet will be offered alongside standard care, commencing within four months of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both diets are high in fat and low in carbohydrate, but contain different types and amounts&#xD;
      of fats. The MKD is 80% fat (predominately long chain fatty acids) and 5% carbohydrate,&#xD;
      whilst the MCT diet is 75% fat (30% of which is medium chain fatty acids) and 10%&#xD;
      carbohydrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A permuted block randomization method will be adopted, using 'sealedenvelope' randomization&#xD;
      system. This will be set up and administered by the statistician, who is not involved with&#xD;
      the recruiting of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive regular input from the trial dietitian. This includes clinical&#xD;
      consultations at baseline, dietary initiation, week 6, week 12 and every 3 months thereafter&#xD;
      and telephone consultations at weeks 1, 3 and 9. Patients will receive dietary and ketone&#xD;
      monitoring education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments and monitoring undertaken at each consultation include anthropometry,&#xD;
      biochemistry, compliance, tolerance, acceptability, quality of life and ketosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment and the patient may withdraw at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An information study is also embedded into KEATING, to aid understanding of the patients'&#xD;
      recruitment experience and viewpoints, by interviewing a sub-sample of patients and their&#xD;
      relatives/ carers. This will enable the design of bespoke strategies to optimise recruitment&#xD;
      to future trials related to ketogenic diets and gliomas&#xD;
