      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various preclinical, clinical, and animal studies suggest that curcumin has potential as an&#xD;
      antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and antiangiogenic, as a mediator of chemoresistance,&#xD;
      chemopreventive, and as a therapeutic agent. However, the main problem associated with the&#xD;
      use of curcumin in humans is its low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, poor&#xD;
      solubility in body fluids and low bioavailability. To overcome the pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      bioavailability limitations of oral administration, water soluble curcumin, Curcumin®&#xD;
      (CUC-01) injection, a clear, yellow viscous solution intended for dilution with a suitable&#xD;
      parenteral fluid prior to intravenous infusion was elaborated. Curcumin® (CUC-01) injection&#xD;
      is patented pharmacy product and sold per individual prescription in Germany and other&#xD;
      countries for Cancer Centers. However, clinical efficacy and safety of these formulation have&#xD;
      to be confirmed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of multidrug resistance (MDR) against a variety of conventional and novel&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents is a significant challenge in effective cancer therapy. Paclitaxel,&#xD;
      one of the most prescribed conventional chemotherapeutic agents, acts as microtubule&#xD;
      stabilizer and blocks cancer cells in the G2/M phase, thus preventing them from mitosis. It&#xD;
      is also an apoptosis inducer in cancer cells. However, one of the main drawbacks of its use&#xD;
      is that it is also a substrate of P-gp and treatment with PCL induces the overexpression of&#xD;
      the efflux pump in the cancer cells. NF-κB is a transcription factor that controls the&#xD;
      expression of genes involved in a number of physiological responses including&#xD;
      differentiation, inflammation, apoptosis and upregulation of the P-gp. The PI3K/Akt pathway&#xD;
      is also another over-activated pathway in a wide range of tumor types and therefore its&#xD;
      over-activation leads to increased cancer-cell survival, proliferation, and growth and it&#xD;
      also promotes NF-κB activity, all affects the success of the chemotherapy with Paclitaxel.&#xD;
      Curcumin is known to downregulate both the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways independent of each&#xD;
      other, and thus it can act as a mediator of chemoresistance by sensitizing cancer cells to a&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that co-administration of Paclitaxel and curcumin will help to overcome&#xD;
      multidrug resistance in cancer. Synergistic interaction of curcumin and paclitaxel was&#xD;
      demonstrated in paclitaxel (Taxol)-resistant breast cancer cells, human breast cancer&#xD;
      xenograft model, in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and many other cancer cell&#xD;
      lines. In vivo, this combination treatment produced a three-fold tumor inhibition with each&#xD;
      of these cell lines. Furthermore, the combination of paclitaxel and curcumin exerted&#xD;
      increased anti-tumor efficacy on mouse models These results clearly indicate combination of&#xD;
      Curcumin with paclitaxel could have significant clinical advantages for the treatment of&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin exerted in vitro anti-breast cancer activities through regulation of matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1),&#xD;
      NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) factors, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B&#xD;
      (Akt) signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, and based on this evaluation, we intend examining the effect of Curcumin ®,&#xD;
      (CUC-01) in advanced and metastatic breast cancer in this randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
