    <textblock>
      MI in elderly women seems to share the same pathophysiology than in men, especially plaque&#xD;
      rupture associated with conventional risk factors. Therefore the questions is not solved on&#xD;
      the pathophysiology and specific risk factors in young women whose prognosis is more severe.&#xD;
      A complete descriptive analysis appears mandatory to understand the peculiarities, including&#xD;
      not only morphological but also biological explorations as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date no systematic descriptive analysis has been performed including clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, cardiac and extra-cardiac morphological exploration and hormonal and&#xD;
      immunological assays, particularly in young premenopausal women presenting MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide for the first time a complete analysis, including hormonal assays,&#xD;
      never made in an &quot;acute&quot; population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this clinical study is to systematically pool clinical, morphological&#xD;
      and biological data of young women (&lt; 50 years) presenting an Acute MI and to assess their&#xD;
      short-term (in-hospital) and mid-term (12 months) prognosis. The definition of MI is the one&#xD;
      adopted in the Third definition published in 2012. As such an event occurs in a young&#xD;
      patient, diagnostic and treatment may vary among centres. The incidence of such cases in each&#xD;
      centre being low and practice inhomogeneous, no conclusion could be advanced concerning the&#xD;
      study of associated, indeed predisposing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work aims to comprehensively and systematically collect all the clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      data and the results of the all morphological explorations carried out during the care of&#xD;
      these young women admitted for acute MI in high-volume centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional invasive act, without any direct benefit for the care of patients will be&#xD;
      realized for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these examinations, in particular invasive morphological, are more and more integrated in&#xD;
      the practice of modern interventional cardiology especially for complex or infrequent&#xD;
      situations, like this setting. They afford accurate diagnosis of coronary disease on one hand&#xD;
      and on the second hand they determine the causal or at least participating factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive and systematic analysis of this particular entity that is MI in young woman,&#xD;
      would improve our knowledge of this disease and then enable to offer patients a more&#xD;
      appropriate treatment and monitoring. It is necessary to progress in the understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanisms of the early onset of coronary artery disease in its most acute and most serious&#xD;
      presentation and to clearly define the specificities of coronary disease in young women.&#xD;
      Moreover, a more precise identification of risk factors of MI in a woman under 50 will allow&#xD;
      a better screening and even introduction of preventive strategies.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in France. In-hospital&#xD;
      mortality after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains significantly higher than in men, with&#xD;
      a relative risk of up to 150%, especially among young women1,2. Early mortality rate of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI) continues to decline but that of women remains higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The risk of ACS increases with age, especially after menopause and in the presence&#xD;
      of classic cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes. Nevertheless&#xD;
      premenopausal women presenting MI are not exceptional even in the absence of risk factors.&#xD;
      The worse prognosis in women, particularly in individuals under 50 years could result from&#xD;
      the combination of harsher clinical presentation, less typical symptoms, and delayed&#xD;
      diagnosis. Moreover, it is not uncommon that an ACS occurs in young women without the usual&#xD;
      risk factors. Hormonal changes in particular related to contraceptive treatments have been&#xD;
      incriminated, likewise chronic inflammation related to systemic diseases. To date the impact&#xD;
      of hormonal, inflammatory or thrombophilia changes has not been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays use of endovascular imaging during diagnostic coronary angiography is become common&#xD;
      practice in particular in the absence of obvious culprit thrombotic or obstructive lesion.&#xD;
      These invasive imaging techniques such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or OCT (Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography), bring highly relevant complementary information in this setting,&#xD;
      particularly to clarify the mechanism of MI such as rupture or erosion of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque, spontaneous dissection or intramural hematoma. The incidence of these particular form&#xD;
      of acute coronary artery lesions are higher in women, especially among the youngest one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In young, an angioCT or angioMRI (aortic and/or cerebral) are often performed looking for&#xD;
      other atherosclerotic risk locations or morphological abnormalities in favour of a particular&#xD;
      disease such as a fibrodysplasia. PET scan (18FDGlusose scintigraphy), when available,&#xD;
      provides a valuable complement: it is a functional imaging research for other arterial&#xD;
      locations for hypermetabolic inflammatory arteritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual laboratory tests will be made at admission and discharge as done in routine practice.&#xD;
      These tests include blood count, electrolytes, blood urea, creatinine, prothrombin time,&#xD;
      activated partial thromboplastin time, glucose, HbA1C, lipide profil, hemoglobin&#xD;
      electrophoresis, CRP, fibrinogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover some tests are recommended in case of ACS in a young patient not made&#xD;
      systematically. It is the objective of our work to make a comprehensive and systematic&#xD;
      analyse. Some assays require special techniques, to avoid any variability and therefore bias&#xD;
      in interpretation of results, those will be, after preparation of the samples in the original&#xD;
      department, centralized: such as homocysteine, markers of thrombophilia and hormone assays.&#xD;
      Individually, these markers have been associated with the presence and progression of&#xD;
      atheroma. However, these assays are rarely made and have not been comprehensively and&#xD;
      systematically studied in the population of young woman presenting MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover it has long been accepted that women were less exposed than men to the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease due to the protective role of oestrogen. However this assumption has&#xD;
      been questioned by recent work on the hormonal treatment of menopause. The administration of&#xD;
      oestrogen does not prevent ischemic arterial disease in postmenopausal women and may even be&#xD;
      deleterious in older women. Then it then appears crucial to analyse hormone levels in the&#xD;
      acute phase of MI in order to progress in the understanding of the hormonal role in ACS, so&#xD;
      far this has never been made in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a prospective multicentric observational clinical study. All women under&#xD;
      50 years admitted in one of the 32 participating centres, for acute MI, with and without ST&#xD;
      segment elevation, will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For any women admitted for acute MI with or without ST segment elevation in an&#xD;
           investigation centre, participation in the study will be proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coronary angiography will be performed in emergency at admission according to current&#xD;
           guidelines in case of STEMI. In case of NSTEMI, patients will benefit from coronary&#xD;
           angiography according to defined risk stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An IVUS imaging will be done in centers that practice this technique, the data will be&#xD;
           collected as part of the study. This imaging will be performed if possible during the&#xD;
           initial coronary angiography in order to objectify intraluminal thrombus, plaque&#xD;
           rupture, hematoma or spontaneous dissection. This diagnostic strategy is carried out in&#xD;
           common practice in the participating centers in atypical situations, particularly in the&#xD;
           absence of obstructive lesion or visible thrombus at angiography. OCT may be carried out&#xD;
           in a second step after mechanical and/or pharmacological thrombectomy in order to&#xD;
           improve sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in the study will be proposed and agreement will be signed before&#xD;
           discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the centers performing cardiac MRI, the MRI data will be collected as part of the&#xD;
           study. Cardiac MRI will be done at the earliest after coronary angiography during the&#xD;
           same hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The usual blood tests will be performed at the patient's admission and then repeated at&#xD;
           least 24 hours after coronary angiography, including repeated sampling assays for&#xD;
           troponin, in order to measure the peak, following the routine of the department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The specific assays, corresponding to the tests carried out as part of the WAMIF study&#xD;
           will be sampled before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During one of these blood samples a 5 ml sample of blood will be made for later analysis&#xD;
           in the context of a serum bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some assays, including hormonal and thrombophilia will be centralized in order to&#xD;
           standardize the results and their interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second angiography associated with a challenge test by Methergin® can be planned, at&#xD;
           the discretion of the referring cardiologist, within 5 days after the index event. This&#xD;
           test will be especially recommended if no etiology has been found by OCT or MRI in order&#xD;
           to diagnose a spastic angina. The test will be performed during coronary angiography&#xD;
           with intravenous injection of 0.4 mg of Methergin® (méthylergotamine) followed by a&#xD;
           control angiography 3 minutes followed by a test after intracoronary injection of&#xD;
           nitrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the data will be collected locally with the help of clinical studies technicians&#xD;
           from the WAMIF study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the biological data will be pooled and analyzed by IVS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data management will be performed by the clinical research assistant from the SFC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A telephone interview will be conducted at 12 months to collect the major cardiovascular&#xD;
           events (death from any cause, cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, stent thrombosis,&#xD;
           stroke and major bleeding). These events will be specified through hospital reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration: 18 months + follow up at to 12 months: 30 months Inclusion period: 18&#xD;
      months Duration of participation for one patient: 12 months Number of participating centers:&#xD;
      32 Average number of inclusions per month per center: 0.5 to 1&#xD;
