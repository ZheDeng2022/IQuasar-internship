    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion Count at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from baseline in inflammatory lesion count at week 12 was reported. Inflammatory lesions included facial inflammatory lesions of rosacea (that is [i.e.] papules and pustules) which were defined as follows: Papule - a small, solid elevation less than 1.0 centimeter (cm) in diameter; and Pustule - a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin, which contains yellow white exudates. Papules and pustules were counted separately on each of the 5 facial regions (forehead, chin, nose, right cheek and left cheek). Notably, nodules (i.e. circumscribed, elevated, solid lesions more than 1.0 cm in diameter with palpable depth) were not included in the count of inflammatory lesions.</description>

          <title>Skin phototype</title>
          <description>Fitzpatrick skin phototype is a system used to describe a person's skin type. It ranges from skin phototype I to VI. Where, skin phototype I = pale white skin, always burns easily, never tans; skin phototype II = fair skin, always burns easily, tans minimally and with difficulty; skin phototype III = darker white skin, burns minimally, tans gradually and uniformly; skin phototype IV = light brown skin, burns minimally, always tans well; skin phototype V = brown skin, rarely burns, tans profusely; skin phototype VI = dark brown or black skin, never burns, tans profusely.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion Count at Week 12</title>
        <description>Percent change from baseline in inflammatory lesion count at week 12 was reported. Inflammatory lesions included facial inflammatory lesions of rosacea (that is [i.e.] papules and pustules) which were defined as follows: Papule - a small, solid elevation less than 1.0 centimeter (cm) in diameter; and Pustule - a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin, which contains yellow white exudates. Papules and pustules were counted separately on each of the 5 facial regions (forehead, chin, nose, right cheek and left cheek). Notably, nodules (i.e. circumscribed, elevated, solid lesions more than 1.0 cm in diameter with palpable depth) were not included in the count of inflammatory lesions.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with 100% reduction in inflammatory lesions at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 was reported. Inflammatory lesions included facial inflammatory lesions of rosacea (i.e. papules and pustules) which were defined as follows: Papule - a small, solid elevation less than 1.0 centimeter in diameter. Pustule - a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin, which contains yellow white exudates. Papules and pustules were counted separately on each of the 5 facial regions (forehead, chin, nose, right cheek and left cheek). Notably, nodules (i.e. circumscribed, elevated, solid lesions more than 1.0 cm in diameter with palpable depth) were not included in the count of inflammatory lesions.</description>

        <population>ITT population consisted of the entire population enrolled and randomized. The LOCF method was used to impute missing values for inflammatory lesion count.</population>

        <description>The evaluator assessed the participant's diffuse persistent facial erythema of rosacea by performing a static (&quot;snap shot&quot;) evaluation of erythema severity at a social distance of approximately 50 centimeter (cm) using CEA scale, at each visit. CEA is a 5 point scale where 0 = clear (clear skin with no signs of erythema); 1 = almost clear (almost clear; slight redness); 2 = mild (mild erythema; definite redness); 3 = moderate (moderate erythema; marked redness); 4 = severe (severe erythema; fiery redness).

        <description>The evaluator assessed the participant's rosacea by performing a static (&quot;snap shot&quot;) evaluation, at a social distance of approximately 50 cm, using the IGA score. IGA is a 5 point scale where, 0 = clear (no inflammatory lesions present, no erythema); 1 = almost clear (very small papules/pustules, very mild erythema present); 2 = mild (few small papules/pustules, mild erythema); 3 = moderate (severe small or large papules/pustules, moderate erythema); 4 = severe (numerous small and/or large papules/pustules, severe erythema).</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population consisted of the entire population enrolled and randomized. The LOCF method was used to impute missing values for inflammatory lesion count.</population>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a 5-level, 5-dimensional format standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome used to assess the impact of study treatments on participants quality of life as follows: 1) mobility; 2) self-care; 3) usual activities; 4) pain/discomfort; 5) anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprised of 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores, where 1 indicated no problems, and 5 indicated extreme problems. Participant selected answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his/her health today with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). An increase in the EQ-5D-5L total score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>WPAI:GH questionnaire was an instrument to measure impairments in both paid work and unpaid work. It measures absenteeism, presenteeism as well as the impairments in unpaid activity because of health problem during the past seven days. Low scores indicate little or no impact of health problems on work and activities, and a negative change in the WPAI score indicates improvement. Currently Employed question was assessed in this outcome measure.</description>
