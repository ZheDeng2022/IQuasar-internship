    <textblock>
      Mass media plays more and more important role in health education, especially in some chronic&#xD;
      diseases which related closely with the behavior and habits. Past experience tells us that&#xD;
      with the help of related health education in mass media such as newspaper articles,&#xD;
      advertisements and videos on television, peoples can change their behaviors and habits in a&#xD;
      short period of time. But when these educational information were stopped, peoples usually&#xD;
      return to their original habits. Besides the national policy of the country how to improve&#xD;
      the long-term health education in the mass media should be considered.This study hopes to&#xD;
      seek an effective method to keep the mass media long-term focus on health education.&#xD;

      In this study, reporters just like researchers were in charge of the low-sodium salt&#xD;
      intervention. Reporters are responsible for recommended objects and measure their blood&#xD;
      pressure personally. By observing personally the change of blood pressure pre and post&#xD;
      low-sodium salt intervention, reporters will increase their confidence and come to the&#xD;
      conclusion that the low salt diet is an economical way to reduce blood pressure. Those&#xD;
      reporters would share their experiment with other people including their colleagues,&#xD;
      Hopefully, those reporters that took part in the trial would consciously keep a sustained&#xD;
      focus to this topic, thereby retaining a long-time education in mass media.There were two&#xD;
      interventions. One is low-sodium salt intervention and the other is informational&#xD;
      intervention. Low-sodium salt intervention was carried out on those family members&#xD;
      recommended by reporters, and informational intervention. Low-sodium salt intervention was&#xD;
      only on the reporters. The evaluation criteria of low-sodium salt intervention is the blood&#xD;
      pressure value, and the evaluation criteria of informational intervention are the numbers of&#xD;
      related articles in certain newspaper and the awareness of related knowledges in local&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
