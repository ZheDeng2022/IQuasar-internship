      This is a study to assess the benefit of sodium hyaluronate (Ostenil) injection for plantaris&#xD;
      friction syndrome (PFS) associated with midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Functional outcome&#xD;
      scores will be recorded prior to treatment and at regular intervals up to 2 years. Changes in&#xD;
      tendon structure will be assessed using ultrasonographic tissue characterisation (UTC). UTC&#xD;
      will be performed prior to treatment and also at regular intervals up to 6 months following&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;

      Introduction Midportion Achilles tendinopathy is a common source of disability, with typical&#xD;
      features including pain, swelling and dysfunction [Roche]. The causes are multifactorial&#xD;
      [Roche]. First line treatment is typically non operative and includes an eccentric loading&#xD;
      program [Alfredson-1998], high volume injection [Chan], platelet rich plasma [de Vos JAMA&#xD;
      2010], sclerosing agent injections [Alfredson-2005] , shock wave therapy [Lynen][Saxena] and&#xD;
      for resistant cases, surgery [Alfredson-2011].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plantaris friction syndrome (PFS) One possible cause of midportion Achilles tendinopathy is&#xD;
      plantaris friction syndrome (PFS). In this subset of patients, the pain is located to the&#xD;
      postero-medial aspect of the Achilles tendon. The plantaris tendon is a small vestigial&#xD;
      tendon originating from the lateral femoral condyle, crossing obliquely to the medial side of&#xD;
      the Achilles tendon and inserting into the medial side of the calcaneum. The anatomy at the&#xD;
      insertion is highly variable. Over 80% of plantaris tendons insert separately to the Achilles&#xD;
      tendon [Daseler]. Biomechanical evidence suggests that the plantaris tendon is stiffer and&#xD;
      stronger than the Achilles tendon [Lintz]. Under load therefore, differential movement&#xD;
      between the tendons may occur. Subsequently the plantaris tendon can become tendinopathic and&#xD;
      thickened. Adhesions may develop between it and the adjacent Achilles tendon [Bedi],&#xD;
      initiating medial midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Sensitization of the nerve endings in the&#xD;
      fat layer between the Achilles and plantaris has also been demonstrated. The optimal&#xD;
      treatment of PFS is currently unclear. Treatments include physiotherapy, injection and&#xD;
      surgical excision [Bedi][Pearce][Weinberg][Calder-2014][Alfredson-2011].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium Hyaluronate One potential treatment is injection with sodium hyaluronate which is a&#xD;
      viscosupplement solution. It has primarily been used for joint lubrication in arthropathy,&#xD;
      but can also be used for tendinopathy [Lynen]. Ostenil Tendon is a sodium hyaluronate&#xD;
      solution that potentially acts in several ways to reduce pain. One mode is to act as a&#xD;
      lubricant between tendons or between the tendon and its sheath [Akasaka 2005][Akasaka&#xD;
      2006][Nishida][Kumar][St Onge]. It may also promote tendon healing [Chen][Yagishta].&#xD;
      According to unpublished work, Ostenil Tendon significantly reduced pain at 6 weeks for&#xD;
      peroneal and also midportion Achilles tendinopathy [Company literature]. It may also act as a&#xD;
      medium to allow free passage of nutrients to the tendon [Hagberg]. Sodium hyaluronate&#xD;
      injection placed in the interval between the plantaris tendon and Achilles tendon could&#xD;
      potentially reduce friction and subsequently pain. Although the effect of sodium hyaluronate&#xD;
      injections have been reported in the hip and knee, no previous studies have reported its&#xD;
      efficacy for PFS. The primary aim of the current study is to assess the impact of sodium&#xD;
      hyaluronate injections in patients with PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound tissue characterization Methods of assessing the Achilles tendon for tendinopathy&#xD;
      continue to be debated. Common methods include ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      [Khan][Astrom]. A novel assessment tool is ultrasound tissue characterization (UTC) which&#xD;
      uses ultrasound to quantify tendon structure [van&#xD;
      Schie][Docking-2015][Docking-2016][Rosengarten][Bedi].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural integrity of the tendon matrix is categorized in four echo types (1-green, 2-blue,&#xD;
      3-red, 4-black). Echo types 1 and 2 reflect aligned fibrillar structure, whereas types 3 and&#xD;
      4 indicate disorganised tissue [Bedi]. The entire length of the tendon can be analyzed with a&#xD;
      minimum detectable difference in structure to be 1% [Docking-2015]. Bedi et al showed&#xD;
      significant improvement in UTC following excision of plantaris for midportion Achilles&#xD;
      tendinopathy [Bedi]. However this study was limited because UTC images were not performed at&#xD;
      a uniform time pre- and post- surgery [Bedi]. Masci et al found improvement in UTC&#xD;
      echo-structure at 6 month follow-up post plantaris excision combined with improvement in&#xD;
      VISA-A scores [Masci]. It is debated as to whether fibrillar integrity and matrix&#xD;
      organisation correlate with symptoms. For example, a study in elite Australian football&#xD;
      players showed that UTC changed following pre-season training, but all players remained&#xD;
      asymptomatic at the start and end of the study [Rosengarten]. Ultrasound studies have also&#xD;
      questioned the relationship of tendon structure in tendinopathy and patient function&#xD;
      [Khan][McAuliffe]. In a study of gymnasts, clinical assessment has only moderate correlation&#xD;
      with ultrasound and MR appearances [Emerson].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the novelty of UTC for the Achilles tendon, the secondary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess whether UTC changes following treatment for PFS and to correlate any changes with&#xD;
      functional outcome scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims summary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine changes in Achilles tendon matrix structure using UTC before and after&#xD;
           treatment (6 month follow up)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess medium term (2 years) effectiveness of a sodium hyaluronate injection in the&#xD;
           space between the plantaris and Achilles tendons for midportion Achilles tendinopathy&#xD;
           which is associated with PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate UTC changes with functional scores&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The alternate hypotheses are that sodium hyaluronate injection improves both 1)&#xD;
      function and 2) structure of the Achilles tendon for PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonographic tissue characterisation (UTC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional scores - Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A)&#xD;
           [Robinson] and Foot and Ankle Outcome scores (FAOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This will be a single centre prospective case series of patients in whom PFS has been&#xD;
      diagnosed based upon clinical examination by a Consultant foot &amp; ankle surgeon,&#xD;
      physiotherapist and imaging. Patients will be prospectively followed up with pre and post&#xD;
      intervention patient reported outcome scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Population 33 patients diagnosed with PFS will be identified and invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study once the decision has been made to treat with sodium hyaluronate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria Patients aged 18-75 years Able to provide informed consent Diagnosis of&#xD;
      PFS requiring sodium hyaluronate injection Able to follow physiotherapy instructions&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Previous Achilles tendon surgery Previous injection therapy for Achilles&#xD;
      midportion tendinopathy Age &lt; 18 &gt;75 years Active local infection Active bleeding disorder or&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy Allergies to lignocaine or sodium hyaluronate Active deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment and Consent All patients will be given the information sheet regarding&#xD;
      the study and will be consented by the CI or the Fortius foot and ankle fellow. All be&#xD;
      patients will be recruited and treated at the Fortius Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed treatment will include one or two sodium hyaluronate (Ostenil Tendon) injections.&#xD;
      Physiotherapy is a routine part of current treatment, usually provided off site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection protocol All injections will be carried out by a Consultant Radiologist at the&#xD;
      Fortius Clinic. Approximately 3-5mm of 1% lignocaine will be injected to create a plane&#xD;
      between Plantaris and the medial Achilles tendon. Subsequently, 2-3ml of Ostenil Tendon&#xD;
      (sodium hyaluronate) will be injected into the space between the Achilles and plantaris&#xD;
      tendons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UTC assessment UTC assessment at 6 and 12 weeks is a routine part of our current treatment&#xD;
      protocol for PFS and allows guidance of treatment. Patients will have pre and post treatment&#xD;
      UTC assessment of the Achilles tendon. For the purposes of the study, an extra UTC assessment&#xD;
      will be performed at 6 months, during part of their routine clinical follow up appointment.&#xD;
      This final UTC assessment will be provided free to the patients. All UTC assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted by the same experienced physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Patient reported outcome scores will be completed prior to treatment and at 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months,6 months, 1 and 2 years. Outcome scores at 1 and 2 years will be performed&#xD;
      online via an automated email system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UTC will be conducted at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be free to choose to participate or not in the study. If they choose not to&#xD;
      participate it will not affect their treatment in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No patient or volunteer will take part in the study without giving written informed consent&#xD;
      and we will exclude those patients who are unable to give this consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legal Issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no legal issues identified that will affect this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at the Fortius Clinic, which is a private clinic. The patients&#xD;
      included would be receiving one or two sodium hyaluronate injections, and two UTC assessments&#xD;
      as part of the routine treatment of PFS. They will be charged for this as normal. There will&#xD;
      be no additional charge for the final UTC assessment at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients agreeing to take part in the study will be receiving the routine treatment for PFS&#xD;
      that they would be receiving even if the study was not taking place. There are therefore no&#xD;
      additional risks to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection All data collection will be done within the premises of the Fortius clinic by&#xD;
      members of the clinical team, which includes a physiotherapist who works on site for the&#xD;
      Tendon Performance Clinic. In addition to the outcome score and UTC data information&#xD;
      regarding patient demographics, medical history and treatment will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data confidentiality Data will be stored in Fortius/Tendon Performance Clinic computers which&#xD;
      are password protected and comply with information governance guidelines. No one outside the&#xD;
      clinical team will have access to the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any information that leaves the clinic will have patient identifiable information removed.&#xD;
      All of the results will be analysed and published using anonymous data only. Details about&#xD;
      patient's involvement in the study will also be recorded in patients' medical records held by&#xD;
      the Fortius Clinic/Tendon Performance Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis In 18 asymptomatic elite Australian football players, UTC demonstrated&#xD;
      improvement in Achilles tendon structure over a 5 month period following pre-season training&#xD;
      [Docking-2016]. Bedi et al reported UTC changes following Plantaris excision and ventral&#xD;
      paratendinous Achilles tendon scraping in athletes. In 11 patients, the fibrillar structure&#xD;
      of the Achilles tendon improved from 90 to 96%, SD 8% p=.04. Mean VISA-A scores improved from&#xD;
      51 to 95, SD 12, p=.0001. Regarding sodium hyaluronate injection, only one study was found&#xD;
      assessing its use for midportion Achilles tendinopathy [Lynen]. Lynen et al compared two&#xD;
      paratendinous injections with three ESWT treatments given at weekly intervals in 62 patients.&#xD;
      No previous studies have assessed its use for PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the limited evidence available, we estimate the sample size required to&#xD;
      demonstrate improvements in UTC (assuming change in type 1 and 2 echo types from 90% to 96%,&#xD;
      SD 8%) to be at least 28 patients. With an expected drop out rate of 15%, we plan to recruit&#xD;
      33 patients to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Analyses will be conducted using a statistical package. A paired t test&#xD;
      will be used to compare pre and post treatment VISA-A scores. UTC results will be compared&#xD;
      using Wilcoxon signed rank test (non parametric data). A p value of 0.05 will be defined as&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
