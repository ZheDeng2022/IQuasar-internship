  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tropical diseases are continuously on the rise throughout the world as they are spreading and&#xD;
      manifesting in various locations globally. The more prominent vector tends to be the mosquito&#xD;
      after it bites a previously infected host. The viruses of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue are&#xD;
      some of the tropical diseases that are affecting large populations and expanding rapidly.&#xD;
      Developing countries are at the highest risk because of the lack of preventive methods that&#xD;
      are customarily demonstrated in developed countries. Sanitation issues complicate the problem&#xD;
      as contaminated wastewater is ideal for mosquitos to lay eggs. In addition, the organic&#xD;
      material in the wastewater serve as food for larvae. The purpose of this study is to test&#xD;
      bodies of waters in Peru and examine if contaminated water is a contributing factor in the&#xD;
      proportion of the population infected with Zika, Chikanguyna or Dengue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tropical diseases are active in South America and measures need to be taken to control these&#xD;
      diseases. Sanitation is a major contributing factor as it serves for an ideal breeding ground&#xD;
      for vectors. The EPA regulates water contamination and states that a water source can be&#xD;
      recognized as contaminated if it contains anything above zero total coliforms. The severity&#xD;
      of the water contamination within Peru can be observed by the presence of thermotolerant&#xD;
      coliforms in 48% of all water samples. Studies have also found that on 23% of hands, 16% of&#xD;
      utensils, and 4% of meals, E. coli was present. The most frequently contaminated item was&#xD;
      kitchen cloths in which 89% had coliforms and 42% with E. coli. In 33% of drinking water, 27%&#xD;
      of meals, and 23% kitchen utensils, diarrheagenic E. coli was present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose behind the research being conducted is to assist Peru concerning various factors&#xD;
      in order to facilitate the process of working towards the reduction or complete elimination&#xD;
      of tropical disease infections such as Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya. The reason Peru has&#xD;
      been identified as being the focal point for the proposed research lies within the factors&#xD;
      that surround Peru. Peru is considered a developing country and with that encompasses&#xD;
      consequential issues. These issues can manifest in malnutrition, disease ridden environments,&#xD;
      debilitating physical repercussions, and many other linked issues.5 Peru also has a&#xD;
      substantial market in which producers partake in sugar cane cultivation. &quot;In Peru, Maple&#xD;
      Energy anticipates that in 2013, it will harvest 1.075 million gross tons of sugar cane from&#xD;
      its plantation for ethanol production.&quot; This is significant considering that sugar cane and&#xD;
      molasses production attracts mosquitoes and creates a prime nesting ground for mosquitos&#xD;
      considering the product as well as the climate which is required to grow these items. The&#xD;
      fact that Dengue is so rampant in Peru presents the great possibility that the masking of&#xD;
      other infections with similar symptoms such as Chikungunya and Zika is present. Given that&#xD;
      Peru is a developing country makes this fact even more feasible considering the minimal&#xD;
      access to quality healthcare in many locations, especially rural communities. The location of&#xD;
      Peru gives rise to believe that many patients go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed since Peru&#xD;
      borders Brazil, in which currently Zika and Chikungunya are currently epidemics sweeping the&#xD;
      country. The lack of mandated hygienic practices allows the circulation of many diseases to&#xD;
      fester and plague the Peruvian society.&#xD;
