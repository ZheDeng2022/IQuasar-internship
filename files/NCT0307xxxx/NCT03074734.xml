      Within the TackSHS project (H2020 project grant agreement No 681040), we will conduct a&#xD;
      clinical research study, aiming at: i) to measure respiratory health effects when exposed to&#xD;
      secondhand smoke (SHS) in patients with asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      (COPD); ii) to investigate exposure levels to SHS in smoking areas provided by bars, casinos,&#xD;
      bingo halls, etc. The study will involve 60 patients (volunteers) in three European&#xD;
      countries: Czech Republic, Ireland, and Spain, recruiting 20 patients in each participating&#xD;
      country (10 COPD and 10 asthma patients).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a part of the TackSHS project and will be conducted in three selected&#xD;
      European countries, coordinated by Prof Luke Clancy, Director General of TobaccoFree Research&#xD;
      Institute (Dublin, Ireland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Respiratory disease causes an important worldwide health burden. It was estimated&#xD;
      that in 2020, of 68 million deaths worldwide, 11.9 million will be caused by lung diseases,&#xD;
      4.7 by COPD, 2.5 by pneumonia, 2.4 by TB and 2.3 million by lung cancer. Over the past two&#xD;
      decades, scientific evidence has accumulated linking secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure&#xD;
      to adverse health outcomes, including respiratory outcomes in children and adults, acute&#xD;
      cardiovascular effects, and lung cancer. However, there is scarce knowledge about health&#xD;
      effects of SHS on respiratory disease patients. TackSHS is a new research project funded by&#xD;
      the European Commission (EC) within the Horizon 2020 programme (Grant Agreement: 681040).&#xD;
      Within the TackSHS Project, WorkPackage 5 is aimed to broaden knowledge and improve&#xD;
      understanding of (immediate) effects of SHS to respiratory health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measure respiratory health effects when exposed to SHS in: patients with asthma and COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigate exposure levels to Second Hand Smoke (SHS) in smoking areas provided by&#xD;
           bars, casinos, bingo halls, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Population: The study population will consist of 30 Asthmatic and 30 COPD&#xD;
      subjects to be recruited through the European Lung Foundation (ELF) in three EU countries (20&#xD;
      subjects in each country), leading to a total sample of 60 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study location: Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study description&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the above mentioned objectives the described below study was designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will visit the centre on 2 occasions. During the first visit the study will be&#xD;
      explained to the participants, both in written (information sheet) and oral forms, the&#xD;
      recruitment questionnaire will be filled to ascertain personal smoking status, other sources&#xD;
      of exposure, average weekly exposure in hospitality premises, and experience of respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms; in addition, CO reading and spirometry will be performed by experienced nurse.&#xD;
      During this session, patients will be also trained of fitting and use of necessary devices:&#xD;
      Respeck / AirSpeck. Diary cards will be demonstrated and explained to the patients. This&#xD;
      first visit will be scheduled during the day prior to exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first visit, all participants will be asked to fill in daily diary cards recording&#xD;
      morning and evening peak flow results, medication consumed, any occurring symptoms (cough,&#xD;
      wheeze), doctor or hospital visits, exposure to SHS and number of cigarettes smoked (if any).&#xD;
      The participants will be also asked to note when the exposure to outside SHS occurred as well&#xD;
      as peak flow results pre and post exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be trained in the use of monitoring equipment, which will measure their&#xD;
      exposure to pollutants including SHS as well as measuring the effects on their health. Air&#xD;
      pollution will be measured through the use of a cutting-edge, small portable instrument that&#xD;
      can continuously and rapidly record changes in the air. Respiratory function will be measured&#xD;
      by Spirometry and exhaled breath gases (e.g. Carbon Monoxide). A small sensor attached to&#xD;
      each participant's chest (RESpeck) will measure and record respiratory rate and or wheeze.&#xD;
      This will not cause any undue discomfort or inconvenience to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (Exposure) At least one outing to an outdoor smoking area should happen. The&#xD;
      duration of time to be spent in the outdoor smoking area is to be a minimum of 15 minutes&#xD;
      with a preferable time of 30-60 minutes. Diary card entries are to be done on day of exposure&#xD;
      and will include description of premises visited number of smokers and or E-cigarette users&#xD;
      present during exposure time as well as any use of medication required during the 24hour&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second (post exposure) visit all data recorded by devices will be downloaded and&#xD;
      checked and any diary card anomalies will be addressed and clarified with the patient. In&#xD;
      addition, CO reading and spirometry will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Partners will be trained in the use of devices measuring exposure using AirSpeck and&#xD;
      respiratory rate using RESpeck. Data will be transmitted to a secure server for analysis Data&#xD;
      collection, analysis and report writing: this will be carried out by TFRI in collaboration&#xD;
      with Project Partners and in consultation with Prof Rod Jones and Prof DK Arvind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor personal exposure to SHS in areas exempted from legislation in pubs, bars and&#xD;
           casinos etc. using novel monitoring technologies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To simultaneously monitor the respiratory effects as indicated by changes in respiratory&#xD;
           rate and flow and activity levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor peak flow rates recorded by patients using diary cards and peak flow meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication usage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary care and/or hospital visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CO monitoring pre and post study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry results pre and post exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval was sought from DIT Ethics Committee prior to beginning of the project. All&#xD;
      documentation relating to the project was provided for ethical review. There are no perceived&#xD;
      Ethical issues as patients will be fully informed and there will be no intervention other&#xD;
      than monitoring. It was considered that requesting subjects to go into outside smoking areas&#xD;
      might be a problem so only subjects who are already frequent visitors of such areas will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility has been determined patients will be given an appointment in a research&#xD;
      center where they will receive an information leaflet. Once this has been read and any&#xD;
      concerns of the participant addressed and explained, they will then be asked to provide&#xD;
      written consent prior to their study enrolment. Consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      participants. Consent is on-going and participants can revoke consent at any stage of the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of all research participants will be considered at all times, they will be seen in&#xD;
      an insured medical practice. All personnel dealing with patients will be fully trained and&#xD;
      insured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored on a secure server and will be de-identified. Data will be entered&#xD;
      giving each participant a unique identifier code; neither their name, address, nor date of&#xD;
      birth will be recorded in order to protect the confidentiality of the participant. Analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out on a blinded dataset using SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All digitally recorded data will be downloaded from the device to a secure server. A Post Doc&#xD;
      and or a Research assistant working with TFRI with advice from partners will further examine&#xD;
      study data. Any anomalies found will be addressed and resolved from source data.&#xD;
