  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have shown that serum cholesterol level is correlated with&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk, and that Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk increases with&#xD;
      increasing LDL cholesterol levels. Fortunately, it has been confirmed that&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering therapy is effective in preventing Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), and&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering with statin therapy is a primary strategy in the prevention of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). Despite the fact that statins reduce both LDL cholesterol and&#xD;
      future cardiovascular outcome, the association of statin intensity and the achieved level of&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol with cardiovascular outcome has not been fully elucidated, because statins&#xD;
      have pleiotropic effect as well as LDL lowering effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of statin on future Cardiovascular (CV) outcome seems to be more associated with&#xD;
      statin intensity relating pleiotropic effects rather than with achieved LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      level, because LDL-lowering by inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis is linked to&#xD;
      reciprocal increment of cholesterol absorption from the intestine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is easily extrapolated the relationship between LDL-C level and the incidence of&#xD;
      Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) after statin therapy from the correlation&#xD;
      between LDL-C level and the incidence of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) in&#xD;
      subjects without statin therapy and from the results of most lipid-lowering trials showing&#xD;
      that 'the lower achieved LDL-C level, the better clinical outcomes. However, the association&#xD;
      of statin intensity and the achieved level of LDL-C with cardiovascular outcome has not been&#xD;
      fully elucidated, because the absolute amount of LDL cholesterol reduction is dependent not&#xD;
      only on statin intensity, but also on inter-individual variation of statin responsiveness. In&#xD;
      studies, the response to therapy with hypolipidemic agents shows considerable individual&#xD;
      variation, and the use of the same dose of the same statin in different patients produces&#xD;
      LDL-C decrease in a wide range from 8 to 55 %. These differences may be due to the&#xD;
      interaction of environmental and genetic factors that affect drug bioavailability, receptor&#xD;
      function or ligand structure and candidate gene analyses have found variants in known&#xD;
      regulators of cholesterol metabolism such as HMGCR, Apolipoprotein E (APOE), PCSK9,&#xD;
      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), NPC1L1, and Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) to&#xD;
      be associated with statin response. Therefore, investigator suspects there could be some&#xD;
      mistakes in interpreting the result of clinical trials with different intensities of statin.&#xD;
      Actually, most of statin trials only compared the mean values of achieved LDL-C to the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in the statin therapy with different intensity, and there were few reports&#xD;
      about the relationship between the individual values of achieved LDL-C and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in the statin therapy with same intensity. To accept the role of achieved LDL-C level for the&#xD;
      prevention of Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, it should still have a significant value after&#xD;
      adjusting with statin intensity. In PROVE IT-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 22&#xD;
      study using either 80 mg of atorvastatin or 40 mg of pravastatin in Acute Coronary Syndrome&#xD;
      (ACS) patients, IDEAL study with either 80 mg of atorvastatin or 20 mg of simvastatin in&#xD;
      Acute Mycardial Infarction (AMI) patients, and TNT study with 80 mg of atorvastatin or 10 mg&#xD;
      of atorvastatin in Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients, the authors demonstrated the&#xD;
      relationships between the levels of achieved LDL-C after statin therapy and those between&#xD;
      statin intensity and the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or death from coronary&#xD;
      causes separately. However, they did not report the relation between achieved LDL-C level and&#xD;
      primary outcome after adjustment with statin intensity. Therefore, investigator think it may&#xD;
      be inaccurate to determine the role of achieved LDL-C level in Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Disease (ASCVD) prevention in clinical trials when those trials include the subjects with&#xD;
      different intensity of statin therapy. Same phenomenon can also occur in meta-analysis of&#xD;
      clinical trials with different statin intensity. Therefore, in Cholesterol Treatment&#xD;
      Trialists' Collaboration (CTTC) meta-analyses, it should be reconsidered that the absolute&#xD;
      amount of LDL-C reduction is dependent not only on statin intensity, but also on&#xD;
      inter-individual variation of statin responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Univariate analysis for each&#xD;
      baseline characteristic of the patients, Cox proportional hazard model including age, sex,&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), achieved&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol level, achieved C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level, statin intensity As in other&#xD;
      studies using multiple doses of statin, investigator would like to evaluate the linear&#xD;
      regression analysis between achieved LDL cholesterol level and CV outcome in total group, and&#xD;
      it will show the correlation between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, when investigator evaluates the linear regression analysis between achieved LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol level and Cardiovascular (CV) outcome in the group treated with 10 mg of&#xD;
      atorvastatin, it will show no relation between them, because of individual variability of&#xD;
      LDL-C lowering effects by same statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same result can be expected the relationship between achieved LDL cholesterol level and&#xD;
      Cardiovascular (CV) outcome in the group treated with 80 mg of atorvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the survival curve using Cox proportional hazard model for total Major Adverse Cardiac&#xD;
      Events (MACE) and each component, investigator evaluates the impact of the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Achieved LDL-C level ( quartiles)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statin intensity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Achieved C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level ( quartiles)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Absolute mount of LDL-C lowering&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Absolute mount of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) lowering&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Other risk factors such as age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and etc.&#xD;
