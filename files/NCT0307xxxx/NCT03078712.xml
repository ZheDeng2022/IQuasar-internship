      Septic shock is a highly lethal condition associated with a mortality risk of 30 to 60%.&#xD;
      Optimizing tissue perfusion and oxygenation is the aim to decrease mortality and morbidity in&#xD;
      septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent hyperlactatemia after initial resuscitation is particularly difficult to&#xD;
      interpret, although optimizing systemic blood flow might reverse ongoing hypoperfusion.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, if persistent hyperlactatemia is caused by non-hypoperfusion-related&#xD;
      mechanisms, then sustained efforts aimed at increasing cardiac output (CO) could lead to&#xD;
      detrimental effects of excessive fluids or inotropes. Another potential alternative&#xD;
      resuscitation target is peripheral perfusion as assessed by capillary refill time (CRT),&#xD;
      mottling score or central-to-toe temperature differences. Reversal of abnormal peripheral&#xD;
      perfusion might represent improvement in tissue hypoperfusion with the advantage of a faster&#xD;
      recovery than lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Peripheral perfusion guided resuscitation in septic shock is associated with&#xD;
      lower mortality, less organ dysfunctions, less mechanical ventilation (MV), less vasopressor&#xD;
      load, and less renal replacement therapies than a lactate-targeted resuscitation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective To test if peripheral perfusion targeted resuscitation in septic shock is&#xD;
      associated with lower 28-day mortality than a lactate targeted resuscitation.&#xD;

      Early Goal Directed Therapy using a Physiological Holistic View. A multicenter study in Latin&#xD;
      America: The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Peripheral perfusion guided resuscitation in septic shock is associated with lower&#xD;
      mortality, less organ dysfunctions, less mechanical ventilation (MV), less vasopressor load,&#xD;
      and less renal replacement therapies than a lactate-targeted resuscitation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a holistic view of optimizing tissue perfusion and oxygenation the investigators aim to&#xD;
      decrease mortality and morbidity in septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Background Septic shock is a highly lethal condition associated with a mortality risk of&#xD;
      30 to 60%. It is currently the most frequent cause of death in the intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      as the investigators demonstrated in a recent Chilean prevalence study. Several pathogenic&#xD;
      factors such as hypovolemia, myocardial depression, vasoplegia, and microcirculatory&#xD;
      abnormalities can induce progressive tissue hypoperfusion in severe cases. In this context,&#xD;
      persistent hyperlactatemia has been traditionally considered as the hallmark of ongoing&#xD;
      tissue hypoxia during septic shock, and therefore lactate normalization is recommended as a&#xD;
      resuscitation target by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiologic determinants of persistent hyperlactatemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiologic basis of lactate generation or clearance during septic shock has been matter&#xD;
      of active research. Hypovolemia-induced hypoperfusion is probably the predominant pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanism during the early phase. Some patients resolve acute circulatory dysfunction and&#xD;
      clear lactate after initial fluid resuscitation, while others evolve into a persistent&#xD;
      circulatory dysfunction with hyperlactatemia. Several mechanisms have been associated to&#xD;
      persistent hyperlactatemia besides hypoperfusion, but recent literature has highlighted the&#xD;
      role of sustained hyperadrenergia with increased muscle aerobic glycolysis, a condition&#xD;
      denominated stress hyperlactatemia, and also of impaired hepatic lactate clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have explored the significance and potential determinants of&#xD;
      hyperlactatemia in a series of clinical physiological studies performed over the last 15&#xD;
      years. These studies have addressed the three most relevant pathogenic factors involved in&#xD;
      persistent hyperlactatemia: overt or occult hypoperfusion, hyperadrenergic state and impaired&#xD;
      hepatic clearance. The complexity of this subject is also highlighted by a more recent study&#xD;
      where the investigators demonstrated that lactate decrease during successful septic shock&#xD;
      resuscitation exhibits a biphasic pattern, an early rapid decrease in parallel to&#xD;
      normalization of more flow-sensitive variables (see below), followed by a slower recovery&#xD;
      thereafter. The latter eventually related to non-flow dependent mechanisms such as&#xD;
      hyperadrenergic state and/or delayed hepatic clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent hyperlactatemia after initial resuscitation is particularly difficult to interpret&#xD;
      as suggested by the extensive research summarized above. Optimizing systemic blood flow might&#xD;
      reverse ongoing hypoperfusion, a potential source of anaerobic lactate generation. Under this&#xD;
      perspective, some of the pathogenic factors involved in hyperlactatemia are potentially&#xD;
      flow-sensitive, and others are not. Distinction between the two scenarios could strongly&#xD;
      impact further resuscitation. If persistent hyperlactatemia is caused by&#xD;
      non-hypoperfusion-related mechanisms, then sustained efforts aimed at increasing CO could&#xD;
      lead to detrimental effects of excessive fluids or inotropes, a fact now well demonstrated in&#xD;
      the literature. The decision of when to consider that a patient has been fully resuscitated&#xD;
      and as a consequence stop further interventions is a milestone, and appears as highly&#xD;
      relevant since the results of a number of recent studies have increased awareness about the&#xD;
      risk of fluid overload and/or of vasopressors and inodilators such as pulmonary edema,&#xD;
      increased intraabdominal hypertension, acute kidney injury, delayed weaning, arrhythmias,&#xD;
      hepatosplanchnic or myocardial ischemia, among other problems. By these means,&#xD;
      over-resuscitation could eventually increase morbidity and/or mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is hyperlactatemia a valid resuscitation target in septic shock?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not surprisingly, lactate clearance or normalization is used worldwide as resuscitation&#xD;
      targets. Indeed, SSC the most ambitious and global collaboration in critical care has&#xD;
      proposed to focus septic shock resuscitation on normalizing macrohemodynamic parameters and&#xD;
      lactate. SSC guidelines are followed in many countries and adherence to recommended&#xD;
      management bundles have been reported to be associated to improved survival, although the&#xD;
      role of each individual component is not clear. Lactate clearance, defined by a change of&#xD;
      lactate levels between two time-points, and expressed as a 10-20% hourly lactate reduction,&#xD;
      or a decrease of at least 10% in 6h during early resuscitation has been related to survival,&#xD;
      and tested as a goal in two important studies with conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are several unresolved aspects and concerns about the role of lactate as an&#xD;
      appropriate resuscitation target. First, it is not clear if selecting lactate clearance&#xD;
      versus lactate normalization as resuscitation goals is equivalent, but more importantly, if&#xD;
      this decision leads to similar timely resolution of tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxia. Second,&#xD;
      since non-hypoperfusion related causes of hyperlactatemia might predominate in an unknown&#xD;
      number of patients, this could lead to over-resuscitation in at least some of them as stated&#xD;
      above. Third, the dynamics of recovery of lactate might exhibit a biphasic pattern and&#xD;
      therefore, the real-time response of lactate to fluid challenges could be not straightforward&#xD;
      depending on the hypoperfusion context. Some survivors might even normalize lactate only&#xD;
      after 24h of evolution. Therefore, to explore other potential resuscitation targets appears&#xD;
      as mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential alternative resuscitation targets in septic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
      A foremost priority is to rule out ongoing hypoperfusion in septic septic shock patients&#xD;
      under active resuscitation. The investigators recently proposed that a simultaneous analysis&#xD;
      of central venous O2 saturation (ScvO2), central venous-arterial pCO2 gradient (P(cv-a)CO2),&#xD;
      and peripheral perfusion as assessed by capillary refill time (CRT), mottling score or&#xD;
      central-to-toe temperature differences, might be helpful in suggesting a hypoperfusion&#xD;
      context for patients with or without hyperlactatemia. From a theoretical point of view, these&#xD;
      three easily assessable perfusion-related variables offer an important advantage over lactate&#xD;
      as potential resuscitation targets in septic shock patients: they are clearly flow-sensitive&#xD;
      and exhibit a much faster dynamics of recovery after systemic blood flow optimization. In&#xD;
      other words, these parameters might clear in minutes in fluid-responsive patients as compared&#xD;
      to lactate, which sometimes takes hours to recover. The investigators demonstrated this by&#xD;
      analyzing the dynamics of recovery of these parameters in a cohort of ultimately surviving&#xD;
      septic shock patients. ScvO2, P(cv-a)CO2 and CRT where already normal in almost 70% of the&#xD;
      patients after 2h of fluid resuscitation, as compared with only 15% in the case of lactate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are also a couple of drawbacks for some of these perfusion-related&#xD;
      flow-sensitive parameters. ScvO2 is a complex physiological variable. It was widely used&#xD;
      until recently as the resuscitation goal in critically ill patients, although several&#xD;
      limitations may preclude a straightforward interpretation of its changes. For instance,&#xD;
      normal or even supranormal ScvO2 values do not rule-out global or regional tissue hypoxia for&#xD;
      several reasons that have been highlighted elsewhere, but that include severe&#xD;
      microcirculatory derangements impairing tissue O2 extraction capabilities. Vallee et al found&#xD;
      persistent abnormal P(cv-a)CO2 values in 50% of septic shock patients who had already&#xD;
      achieved normal ScvO2 values after initial resuscitation. Nevertheless, in some hyperdynamic&#xD;
      states a high efferent venous blood flow could be sufficient to wash out the global carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (CO2) generation from hypoperfused tissues and thus, P(cv-a)CO2 could be normal&#xD;
      despite the presence of tissue hypoxia. Another problem for these two variables is that they&#xD;
      necessarily require a central venous catheterization to be assessed, a task that might be&#xD;
      complex to perform in limited-resource settings or emergency departments (ED). Therefore,&#xD;
      peripheral perfusion appears as the most promising alternative resuscitation target in septic&#xD;
      shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral perfusion as a potential resuscitation target in septic shock patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin territory lacks auto-regulatory flow control, and therefore sympathetic activation&#xD;
      impairs skin perfusion during circulatory dysfunction, a process that could be evaluated by&#xD;
      peripheral perfusion assessment. Indeed, peripheral perfusion can be easily evaluated in many&#xD;
      ways at bedside, and therefore, it could be a valuable monitoring tool in any setting. The&#xD;
      presence of a cold clammy skin, mottling or CRT are frequently described as indications to&#xD;
      initiate fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis-related acute circulatory dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of CRT, the most relevant parameter, is based on this assumption. It was proposed&#xD;
      initially in trauma patients but some negative studies that found no correlation with&#xD;
      systemic hemodynamics precluded further research on this variable. More recently however,&#xD;
      Lima et al found that abnormal peripheral perfusion is associated with hyperlactatemia and&#xD;
      organ dysfunctions in critically ill patients. Other authors confirmed this finding and built&#xD;
      up a robust body of evidence supporting the strong prognostic value of abnormal peripheral&#xD;
      perfusion in the intensive care unit (ICU) context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators observed that CRT was the first parameter to be normalized in a cohort of&#xD;
      septic shock patients and this predicted lactate normalization at 24h and survival. Moreover,&#xD;
      some recent clinical data suggest that targeting peripheral perfusion during septic shock&#xD;
      resuscitation might improve outcome. van Genderen et al performed a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial comparing two resuscitation protocols; one targeted at normal peripheral perfusion and&#xD;
      the other to standard management in 30 ICU patients. The study demonstrated that targeting&#xD;
      peripheral perfusion is safe, and associated with less fluid administration and organ&#xD;
      dysfunctions. Therefore, a parameter like CRT with a rapid-response time could be very useful&#xD;
      to test the response to treatments with strong physiologic impact such as fluid loading,&#xD;
      especially at the ED or in limited-resource settings. In a prospective non published study&#xD;
      performed in a cohort of 100 patients just admitted to the ED, the investigators found that&#xD;
      patients exhibiting a normal CRT after initial fluid loading had a hospital mortality of less&#xD;
      than 10% as compared to 55% in patients with abnormal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How can fluid loading and resuscitation improve peripheral perfusion? There is an intricate&#xD;
      relationship between macrohemodynamics and peripheral perfusion. Both are affected by&#xD;
      hypovolemia and tend to improve in parallel in fluid-responsive patients. Their relative&#xD;
      changes, though, are not well correlated. The beneficial effects of fluids and vasoactive&#xD;
      drugs may be explained by an increase in CO or perfusion pressure, a decrease in the&#xD;
      neurohumoral response to hypovolemia, and eventually by direct effects at the&#xD;
      microcirculatory level. Whatever the mechanism, normalization of peripheral perfusion&#xD;
      parameters appears to indicate a successful reversal of initial circulatory dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some data that suggest that vasopressor adjustment and/or inodilators could induce&#xD;
      favorable effects on peripheral perfusion or microcirculation under certain circumstances.&#xD;
      Jhanji et al demonstrated that increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 90 mmHg with&#xD;
      norepinephrine (NE) doses up to 0.41 mcg/kg/min improved cutaneous tissue oxygen pressure&#xD;
      (PtO2) and cutaneous microvascular red blood cell flux in a cohort of septic shock patients.&#xD;
      The same group obtained similar results in another cohort of postoperative patients after&#xD;
      major abdominal surgery but with an intervention consisting in stroke volume optimization&#xD;
      with fluid challenges and an inodilator (dopexamine) in fixed dose. Dubin et al demonstrated&#xD;
      that rising MAP to 85 mmHg with incremental doses of norepinephrine (NE) up to 0.74&#xD;
      mcg/kg/min improved sublingual microcirculatory flow in septic shock patients with the worst&#xD;
      microcirculation at baseline. Dobutamine in fixed doses of 5 mcg/kg/min improved sublingual&#xD;
      microcirculatory flow in another cohort of septic shock patients. On the other hand active&#xD;
      vasodilation with nitroglycerine induced a clear improvement of peripheral perfusion&#xD;
      parameters in a group of shock patients, despite a mean fall in MAP of 14 mmHg. Based on&#xD;
      these findings and other data, it was proposed that permisive hypotension could eventually&#xD;
      improve microcirculatory driving-pressure in patients with acute circulatory failure. In&#xD;
      summary, it appears that pharmacological therapies aimed at improving peripheral perfusion&#xD;
      might be individually tailored but could imply increasing or lowering vasopressors and MAP,&#xD;
      inodilators or pure vasodilators according to the clinical context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently Bakker et al, added another important piece of information after performing a&#xD;
      pilot study in 30 septic shock patients subjected to early resuscitation. In this study, CRT&#xD;
      and skin mottling were correlated with the pulsatility index, a sonographic surrogate of&#xD;
      vascular tone, of visceral organs. This means that improvement in peripheral perfusion might&#xD;
      move in parallel with improvement in hepatosplanchnic perfusion, eventually explaining the&#xD;
      good prognosis associated with recovery of CRT and other related parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using peripheral perfusion to target resuscitation in septic shock has also several potential&#xD;
      drawbacks. First, there is some degree of subjectivity and inter-observer variability in some&#xD;
      of the parameters used to assess it such as CRT and mottling. Second, it cannot be evaluated&#xD;
      in some settings such as dark skin patients. Third, and more importantly, the corpus of&#xD;
      evidence that supports that improvement of peripheral perfusion is associated with resolution&#xD;
      of profound tissue or microcirculatory hypoperfusion, or hypoxia is still scanty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the excellent prognosis associated with CRT recovery, the rapid-response time to&#xD;
      fluid loading, the simplicity of its assessment, its availability in limited resource&#xD;
      settings, and recent data suggesting that it might change in parallel to perfusion of&#xD;
      physiologically more relevant territories such as the hepatosplanchnic region, constitute a&#xD;
      strong background to promote studies evaluating its usefulness to guide resuscitation in&#xD;
      septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why to compare peripheral perfusion with lactate as targets for septic shock resuscitation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarizing the theoretical background stated above, it is plausible that normalization of&#xD;
      peripheral perfusion as compared to normalization or a rapid decrease (&gt;20%/2h) of lactate&#xD;
      might be associated with less fluid resuscitation and secondarily less positive 24h fluid&#xD;
      balances. Eventually, less positive fluid balances might be associated with less organ&#xD;
      dysfunctions, especially respiratory (oxygenation, mechanical ventilation days), renal (less&#xD;
      increase in creatinine and renal replacement therapy), and gastrointestinal (less increase in&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure). In addition, peripheral perfusion targeted-resuscitation might be&#xD;
      also associated with less vasopressor load and inodilator use thus preventing other set of&#xD;
      potential complications such as hepatosplanchnic hypoperfusion, arrhythmias or myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia. At the end, this could result in less mortality for a combination of the previous&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Peripheral perfusion guided resuscitation in septic shock is associated with lower&#xD;
      mortality, less organ dysfunctions, less mechanical ventilation (MV), less vasopressor load,&#xD;
      and less renal replacement therapies than a lactate-targeted resuscitation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Multicenter, open-label randomized controlled study, conducted under supervision of an&#xD;
      independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective To test if peripheral perfusion targeted resuscitation in septic shock is&#xD;
      associated with lower 28-day mortality than a lactate targeted resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome All-cause 28-day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Need of mechanical ventilation Need of renal replacement therapies (RRT)&#xD;
      Days free of MV, vasopressors and RRT in 28-days Sequential Organ failure Assessment (SOFA)&#xD;
      at 8, 24, 48 and 72h Acute kidney injury (AKI) Intra-abdominal hypertension Fluid balances at&#xD;

&#xD;
      I. Patients Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (≥18 years) will be screened for the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic shock diagnosed at ICU admission according to the Sepsis-3 Consensus Conference,&#xD;
      (basically septic patients with hypotension requiring norepinephrine (NE) to maintain a mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mmHg, and serum lactate levels &gt; 2 mmol/l after initial fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation with at least 20/ml kg in one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anticipated surgery or dialysis procedure during the first 8h after septic shock&#xD;
           diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do-not-resuscitate status&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Child B or C liver cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Active bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Acute hematological malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Severe concomitant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. More than 4h after officially meeting septic shock criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Randomization Recruited patients will be randomized to a peripheral perfusion-targeted&#xD;
      resuscitation (group A) with a goal of normalizing capillary refill time (CRT), or a&#xD;
      lactate-targeted resuscitation (group B) with a goal of either normalizing lactate or&#xD;
      achieving a &gt;20% decrease per hour during the 8h study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization sequence will be generated by an external statistician of the DSMB with the&#xD;
      use of a computer program and an allocation of 1:1. The randomization using a block size of&#xD;
      eight will be stratified according to participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment will be maintained by means of a web-based central, automated&#xD;
      randomization system, available 24 hours a day (RedCap Cloud). The group to which the patient&#xD;
      is allocated will only be disclosed after the information is recorded in the electronic&#xD;
      system. Such measure prevents the investigator and the medical team from predicting to which&#xD;
      treatment group the patient will be allocated. To include a patient in the study,&#xD;
      investigators must simply access the study website and fill in a short medical record form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statisticians and the researcher responsible for event assignment will be blinded to the&#xD;
      group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignment will not be recorded in the medical chart or electronic patient data&#xD;
      monitoring system and clinicians on general wards, who care for the patients after ICU&#xD;
      discharge, will not be aware of the treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assessments Baseline Demographics, comorbidities, acute physiology and chronic health&#xD;
      evaluation (APACHE) II, sepsis source and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      pre-ICU resuscitation and fluid balance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers: procalcitonin (PCT) or c-reactive protein (CRP), and adrenomedullin (MR-ProADM)&#xD;
      sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOFA + AKI criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamics: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP),&#xD;
      MAP, central venous pressure (CVP), dynamic predictors (DP) of fluid responsiveness (FR),&#xD;
      intraabdominal pressure (IAP), NE levels, diuresis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perfusion: lactate, ScvO2, P(cv-a)CO2, hemoglobin (Hb), central venous and arterial blood&#xD;
      gases, CRT, mottling score, perfusion index (where available)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evolution SOFA and AKI criteria at 8, 24, 48 and 72h Hemodynamics hourly up to 8h Fluid&#xD;
      administration and balance at 8, 24, 48 y 72h Complete perfusion assessment when the targeted&#xD;
      parameter is normalized and then at 8, 24, 48 and 72h Register of vasoactive drugs and&#xD;
      dobutamine/milrinone use Register of MV and RRT Source control re-analysis at 4h Rescue&#xD;
      therapies: high-volume hemofiltration (HVHF), vasopressin, epinephrine, steroids, others&#xD;
      Echocardiography at least once during the study period Follow-up till 28 days for use of MV,&#xD;
      RRT and vasopressors All cause mortality at hospital discharge, 28 and 90 days Cause of death&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Principles of general management Sepsis source identification and treatment should be&#xD;
      pursued as a priority of first line treatment. A central venous catheter and an arterial line&#xD;
      are inserted in all, and the use of a pulmonary artery catheter or a PiCCO device is&#xD;
      recommended for patients with a past medical history of heart failure or with concomitant&#xD;
      ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography will be performed routinely as soon as possible after admission to evaluate&#xD;
      basal cardiac function, and repeated as necessary to aid in assessing preload status through&#xD;
      inferior vena cava distensibility when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NE will be the vasopressor of choice and adjusted to a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoglobin concentrations will be maintained at 8 g/dl or higher to optimize arterial O2&#xD;
      content. Mechanical ventilation settings are adjusted according to current recommendation.&#xD;
      Rescue therapies such as epinephrine, vasopressin analogues, steroids or different blood&#xD;
      purification techniques like high-volume hemofiltration will be decided following usual&#xD;
      practice of the involved centers in patients evolving with refractory septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sequential approach to resuscitation will be followed in both groups. Time 0 is the&#xD;
      starting point when after randomization, a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line&#xD;
      are in place, and the basal measurements are performed including hemodynamics and blood&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will be of 8 hours and after this, attending intensivists can continue&#xD;
      treatment according to their usual practice or department protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Tests and Procedures during the study period Capillary refill time assessment CRT will be&#xD;
      measured by applying firm pressure to the ventral surface of the right index finger distal&#xD;
      phalanx with a glass microscope slide. The pressure will be increased until the skin is blank&#xD;
      and then maintained for 10 seconds. The time for return of the normal skin color will be&#xD;
      registered with a chronometer, and &gt; 3 seconds is defined as abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactate measurements A normal lactate value is defined as less then 2 mmol/l. Lactate will be&#xD;
      assessed with the technique more easily available for each center, including arterial serum&#xD;
      levels (with common gas analyzers at the central lab), or capillary levels with lactate scout&#xD;
      strips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid responsiveness (FR) This is the first step. FR will be assessed with a structured&#xD;
      approach. Basically, dynamic predictors (DP) will be evaluated depending on the patient&#xD;
      background status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sedated adapted mechanically ventilated patients without arrhythmias, pulse pressure&#xD;
      variation (PPV) or stroke volume variation (SVV) will be used as first choice. A FR+ status&#xD;
      is established with values ≥ 13% and 10%, respectively. If negative, PPV and SVV will be&#xD;
      reassessed after transiently increasing tidal volume (VT) to 8 ml/kg (one minute). An&#xD;
      increase &gt;3.5% and 2.5% in PPV or SVV, respectively will be considered as FR+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with arrhythmia, the preferred tests will be the end expiratory occlusion test&#xD;
      with a 15 sec pause (&gt; pulse pressure &gt;5% considered as positive), or echocardiography&#xD;
      assessing inferior vena cava (IVC) distensibility index (&gt;15% considered as +).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spontaneous breathing patients or non-sedated patients under MV, a passive leg rising&#xD;
      (PLR) maneuver will performed with an early (&lt;1min) increase in pulse pressure &gt; 10%&#xD;
      considered as FR+. If this is not obtained and to rule out a false negative response, the&#xD;
      maneuver will be repeated assessing aortic velocity time integral (VTI) with echocardiography&#xD;
      before and after PLR with a &gt;15% increase in VTI accepted as FR+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid Challenge In FR+ patients, the first resuscitation step is to administer a fluid bolus&#xD;
      (FB) of 500 ml of crystalloids every 30 min until CRT is normalized in group A, or DP becomes&#xD;
      negative in group B. DP and CVP will be measured before and after each bolus in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures during fluid challenges Central venous pressure (CVP) and FR will be&#xD;
      reevaluated after any fluid challenge. If CVP increases &lt;5 mmHg and FR is still +, another FB&#xD;
      is administered and so on while the goal is not reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CVP increases ≥ 5 mmHg or FR is -, fluids will be stopped and the patient will be moved to&#xD;
      the next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressor test In FR- patients with persistent abnormal CRT or with a still abnormal&#xD;
      lactate that decreased &lt;20%/2h, a vasopressor test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previously hypertensive patients, MAP will be increased to the range of 80-85 mmHg by&#xD;
      transiently rising NE doses. CRT and lactate rechecked (CRT at one h and lactate at 2h). If&#xD;
      CRT is normal in the group A, or lactate normalizes or decreases &gt;20% in group B,&#xD;
      resuscitation will be stopped and NE dose maintained. If not, NE will be reduced to the&#xD;
      pre-test doses, and the protocol moves to the next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all the other patients, MAP will be reduced to the range of 60-65 mmHg by transient&#xD;
      decreases in NE doses, with the same objectives and principles as stated above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of inodilators Dobutamine 5 mcg/kg/min or Milrinone 0.25 mcg/kg/min in fixed doses will&#xD;
      be started, and CRT or lactate rechecked (CRT at one h and lactate at 2h). If, the goals are&#xD;
      not reached, drugs will be discontinued and no further action will be taken during the study&#xD;
      period, except recheck FR every hour and restart fluid challenges if patients get FR+ again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In responders (same criteria as with vasopressor test), the inodilator will be continued&#xD;
      along the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a safety measure, inodilators will be stopped if HR increases &gt;15%, or arrhythmias,&#xD;
      ischemia or hypotension develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A. Management of peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group, the goal is to normalize CRT by following the next steps in the given order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of FR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fluid challenges until CRT is normal, the patient is fluid unresponsive or a safety&#xD;
           measure is met&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vasopressor test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inodilator test&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a safety measure, resuscitation will be stopped even with normal CRT only in the presence&#xD;
      of a stable macrohemodynamics as demonstrated by heart rate (HR) &lt;120 beats per minute, and&#xD;
      stable MAP with no increase in vasopressors during the last hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After CRT normalization at any step, CRT will be reassessed hourly during the study period.&#xD;
      If at any point, it turns abnormal again the resuscitation sequence will be restarted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B. Management of lactate-targeted resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group the goal is to normalize lactate levels or get a decrease rate of at least&#xD;
      20%/2h, by following the next steps in the given order, always reevaluating lactate at 2h&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of FR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fluid challenges until FR- or safety CVP limit is reached during the bi-hourly intervals&#xD;
           between lactate assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vasopressor test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inodilators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactate will be assessed every two hours during the 8h study period. If after obtaining the&#xD;
      lactate goal, lactate gets abnormal again or the decrease rate turns &lt;20%/2h at any of the&#xD;
      following bi-hourly controls during the study period, the resuscitation sequence will be&#xD;
      restarted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Sample size Mortality in patients with increased lactate levels in circulatory dysfunction&#xD;
      has been shown to exceed 40%. In addition, several studies have shown that abnormal&#xD;
      peripheral perfusion is associated with a mortality exceeding 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators should enroll 420 patients. With these sample size the study will have 90%&#xD;
      power to detect a reduction in 28-day mortality from 45% to 30%, at a significance level of&#xD;
      5%, considering time-to-event analysis. The investigators consider a decrease of 15% in&#xD;
      mortality to have direct clinical implementation effect. Similar effects on mortality have&#xD;
      been shown in early resuscitation studies. In addition limiting fluid administration in&#xD;
      patients with septic shock and normal peripheral perfusion has been shown to decrease organ&#xD;
      failure, which is the leading cause of death in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When aiming for a smaller decrease in mortality (like 10%), this sample size would only have&#xD;
      57% power to detect benefit. Therefore the investigators will use an adaptive approach that&#xD;
      will allow for a sample-size re-estimation at the interim analysis when 75% of the sample has&#xD;
      been recruited. The sample-size re-estimation will be conducted by the DSMB if the effect&#xD;
      size observed in the interim analysis is between 10% and &lt;15% absolute reduction in&#xD;
      mortality. A smaller effect size would turn achieving adequate sample size unfeasible,&#xD;
      whereas a larger effect size will provide the study with more than 90% power to detect the&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared before proceeding to patient enrolment.&#xD;
      The essential characteristics of this statistical analysis plan are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      the effect of peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation (group A) compared to&#xD;
      lactate-targeted resuscitation (group B) on the primary outcome through hazard ratio with 95%&#xD;
      of confidence interval (CI) and Kaplan-Meier curve comparison (using log-rank test). Binary&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be compared through relative risks, 95%CIs, and chi-square tests.&#xD;
      Results for continuous outcomes with normal distribution will be expressed as mean&#xD;
      difference, 95%CI, and P-value calculated by the t-test. Continuous outcomes with&#xD;
      asymmetrical distribution will be assessed by the Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze the effects of the study fluids on the primary outcome in the&#xD;
      following subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with lactate &gt; 4.0 mmol/l as set by SSC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients without a confirmed source of infection (as this could increase the translation&#xD;
           of the study to other critically ill).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with low APACHE II / SOFA scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with a more than 10% difference in lactate level between the very first one&#xD;
           measured and the baseline when starting the study.&#xD;
