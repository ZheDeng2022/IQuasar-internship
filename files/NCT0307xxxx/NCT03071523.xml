  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different augmentation techniques has been proposed to resolve problem of hard and/or soft&#xD;
      tissue ridge defects to enable dental implant placement. Guided bone regeneration GBR&#xD;
      procedure is considered as an acceptable reliable surgical procedure for localized ridge&#xD;
      augmentation. Exposure of the membrane used for the GBR is considered a major disadvantage of&#xD;
      this procedure. In order to avoid such complication, various flap advancement techniques have&#xD;
      been proposed such as Periosteal releasing incision,Double-Flap Incision,Coronally advanced&#xD;
      lingual flap. The study compare between the flap advancement provided by Periosteal releasing&#xD;
      incision,versus,Coronally advanced lingual flap in the treatment of class 1 ridge defect.&#xD;

      Two arms RCT will be conducted as followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (intervention):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full-thickness crestal incision will be made over the edentulous ridge followed by one&#xD;
      full-thickness vertical incision on the buccal side. On the buccal side, full thickness&#xD;
      mucoperiosteal flap will be raised with horizontal incision 1-3 mm in depth performed in the&#xD;
      buccal flap. On the lingual side, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated until&#xD;
      reaching the mylohyoid line. A band of connective tissue continuing with the epimysium of the&#xD;
      mylohyoid muscle is usually located in the first molar area, and is1 to 2 cm wide in a&#xD;
      mesiodistal direction. This band is inserted into the inner part of the lingual flap&#xD;
      approximately5 mm from the crest in an apical direction. A blunt instrument will be inserted&#xD;
      below that connective band, and, with gentle traction in the coronal direction, this muscular&#xD;
      insertion should be detached freeing the lingual flap from the mylohyoid muscle. Then&#xD;
      Xenograft and Ti-mesh will be used to augment the defective site and the flap will then be&#xD;
      sutured with interrupted sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B ( control ):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full-thickness crestal incision will be made over the edentulous ridge followed by one&#xD;
      full-thickness vertical incision on the buccal side and a full thickness flap will be raised.&#xD;
      Xenograft and Ti-mesh will be used to augment the defective site then incremental incisions&#xD;
      of 1-3 mm into the periosteum and submucosa will be used to advance the muco-periosteal flap.&#xD;
      The flap will then be sutured with interrupted sutures.&#xD;
