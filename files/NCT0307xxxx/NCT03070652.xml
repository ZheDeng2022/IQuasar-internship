      Key research question This project addresses the following key research question: What are&#xD;
      the short and long term effects on child and family outcomes of a universal intervention&#xD;
      delivered by a Health Visitor addressing the newborn´s behavior in a shared observation with&#xD;
      the parents (NBO)? The aim is to enhance the parent's sensitivity to their infants' unique&#xD;
      capacities and thereby create an early parental understanding for the individual infant's&#xD;
      strengths as well as its needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis concerning main outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universal Health Visiting with facilitation of the early relationship building introduced by&#xD;
      the NBO to an intervention group of new families will- when compared to a control group of&#xD;
      new families who receive health visitor support as usual:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve sensitive responsive parenting to the infant's behavior, needs for feeding and&#xD;
           comfort, and rise understanding of parental influence on the infants' self-regulatory&#xD;
           capacities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase parental confidence and reduce experiences of stress and symptoms of depression&#xD;
           among new mothers and fathers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the infant's self-regulatory capacities regarding sleep, crying, feeding and&#xD;
           engaging in social interactions, being more cooperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhance the sensitive early parent/infant relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve exclusive breastfeeding duration and delay introduction to solid food&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The project is formed as a community based randomized trial. The complexity in&#xD;
      community based intervention research is the existence of two target groups, in this case: 1)&#xD;
      the primary study population of new parents that receive the supportive intervention and 2)&#xD;
      the secondary study population of Health Visitors that deliver the supportive intervention.&#xD;
      The complication of catching the effects in a universal approach will be addressed through a&#xD;
      variety of outcomes that capture both the aspect and the development of the infant, the&#xD;
      mother and the father and the interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and randomization Four medium-sized municipalities will join in the trial. To&#xD;
      avoid side-effects the districts of the Health Visitors in the participating municipalities&#xD;
      will be regarded as clusters. A restricted randomization procedure is decided to achieve&#xD;
      balance in the two study arms because of a relatively small number of clusters (n=17) with&#xD;
      huge differences in birth rate. The criteria for the restricted randomization is a&#xD;
      geographical balance with all participating municipalities represented by both intervention&#xD;
      and comparison districts and a numerical balance with expected number of births attempted&#xD;
      between the intervention and comparison group. An external data manager performed the entire&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The primary study population is formed by new families, mothers and fathers&#xD;
      and their infant/s. Substantiated in that we are operating with a community based universal&#xD;
      intervention with no side effects and we seek to measure the effect in a natural population&#xD;
      we will have no exclusion criteria except parents or infants affiliated to special treatment&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study population of new parents there will be subgroups: First time parents will&#xD;
      represent around 40 %, around 6 % will have given premature birth, 2% twin birth, 10-14% of&#xD;
      the mothers and 7-8% of the fathers will suffer from birth depression in the postnatal&#xD;
      period, and 7-20% will have a cultural background other than Danish depending on geographical&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of 100 first-time mothers in each group of intervention and comparison are drawn&#xD;
      consecutively among responders for video recording in the middle of the project period after&#xD;
      specified characteristic criteria with regard to first-time-, depressed- and given premature&#xD;
      birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and data-collection Data will be collected from two sources: (1) self-reported data from&#xD;
      the new parents collected via questionnaire; (2) observational data from video recordings,&#xD;
      Infant CARE-Index. Questionnaire data will be delivered and collected though an internet&#xD;
      based system. Participating mothers and fathers will receive separate questionnaires at 1-2&#xD;
      weeks postpartum (baseline data), 3 months postpartum, 9 months follow-up, 18 months&#xD;
      follow-up. Videos are recorded at 3 months post-partum (corrected age for premature infants)&#xD;
      with 3 minutes of unstructured time together; (Infant CARE Index). All data will be linked&#xD;
      via the Danish Personal Register (CPR) identifier. To minimize bias introduced by data&#xD;
      collection, data will be collected in the same way and with the same timing in the&#xD;
      intervention and comparison groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Intention to treat analysis will be used to detect the effect of the community&#xD;
      based intervention where motivation and participation may vary in both the primary and&#xD;
      secondary study population. Supplemental analysis will be performed to identify an&#xD;
      intervention effect for subgroups and marginal groups of parents according to parity, preterm&#xD;
      delivery, and depression symptoms.&#xD;
