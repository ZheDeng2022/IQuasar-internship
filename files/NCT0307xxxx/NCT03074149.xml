  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To gain further insight on the characteristics, management, disease progression and the&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with IPF, as diagnosed and treated under real-world, clinical practice&#xD;
      conditions in Greece. More specifically, this registry will be used to: Provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical picture of IPF, Track access to health care and cost of caring for IPF&#xD;
      patients over time, Examine the implementation of treatment guidelines used on patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with IPF, according to the existing diagnosis guidelines, Characterization of&#xD;
      patients on different treatments. To provide information regarding survival and mortality&#xD;
      causes, IPF exacerbations as well as IPF patient co-morbidities including myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, CNS infarction, other arterial thromboembolic events, deep vein thrombosis,&#xD;
      hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation and pulmonary hypertension. Data regarding IPF&#xD;
      patient hospitalization will be collected and evaluated with regards to potential respiratory&#xD;
      causes, and there will be documentation of treatment patterns and economic aspects. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for 2 years and information regarding IPF treatment changes since the&#xD;
      last visit will be collected.&#xD;

      Purpose: To gain further knowledge on the characteristics, management, progression and&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with IPF as treated under real-world, clinical practice conditions in&#xD;
      Greece&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      National, multi-center, observational disease registry based on new data from a significant&#xD;
      sample size of IPF patients in Greece. Patients will be followed up for 2 years and&#xD;
      information will be collected during this time period. This is a non-interventional study and&#xD;
      primary data collected during study visits will be used&#xD;
