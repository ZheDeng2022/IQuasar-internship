    <textblock>
      Prospective, cross-sectional, observational study. Patient are undergoing vitreoretinal&#xD;
      surgery for a variety of indications including, but not limited to, epiretinal membrane&#xD;
      (ERM), macular hole, vitreous opacities, vitreous hemorrhage, aphakia, dislocated or&#xD;
      displaced intraocular or crystalline lens, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and tractional&#xD;
      retinal detachment. In this prospective, single-center, unmasked cross-sectional,&#xD;
      observational case series, at minimum of 100 consecutive eyes will undergo 23-, 25-, or&#xD;
      27-gauge 3-port pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with the Constellation Vision System (Alcon&#xD;
      Laboratories, HÃ¼nenberg, Switzerland) using either the NGENUITY 3D HUD surgery platform or&#xD;
      standard operating microscope (OPMI Lumera 700 surgical microscope with ReSight (Carl Zeiss&#xD;
      AG, Gena, Germany), with 1:1 randomization. Surgical gauge will be dictated by operating&#xD;
      surgeon preference. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in&#xD;
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable HIPPA regulations. All&#xD;
      surgeries will be digitally recorded (as is routinely done for educational purposes) and&#xD;
      video data will be stored on password-protected, encrypted external hard-disk drives. These&#xD;
      drives will be stored in a secure, locked cabinet in the Research Department of the Retina&#xD;
      Service when not in use. All surgeries will be performed by 2 surgeons (AH and JH). Those&#xD;
      randomized to 3D HUD surgery will undergo PPV with a 3D high dynamic range camera (ICM5),&#xD;
      specialized image processing software (Version 9.5.4; TrueWare, Santa Barbara, CA), and a 46&quot;&#xD;
      high-definition (1980x1024 pixel) liquid crystal display (GD-463D10, Yokohama, Japan). During&#xD;
      surgery with the 3D HUD, the surgeon will wear passive 3-D polarized glasses and will be&#xD;
      positioned approximately 1.5 m from the display. Iris aperture and image gain will be&#xD;
      standardized and unchanged for all cases performed with the 3D HUD. Enrolled patients will be&#xD;
      monitored at post-operative day 1, week 1, month 1, and month 3 to measure visual acuity,&#xD;
      undergo optical coherence tomography (OCT) if clinically indicated, and further examination&#xD;
      to document anterior segment and dilated funduscopic examination findings. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing epiretinal membrane (ERM) and internal limiting membrane (ILM) removal for either&#xD;
      macular pucker or macular hole repair will be subjected to a disease-specific surgical&#xD;
      protocol to examine potential differences in macular surgery between 3D HUD and traditional&#xD;
      microscope visualization. These patients will undergo 25-gauge 3-port PPV with 1:1&#xD;
      randomization to either visualization with the 3D HUD or standard operating microscope.&#xD;
      Indocyanine green (ICG) vital dye (**% solution) will be injected in 0.1 cc aliquots to stain&#xD;
      the ILM with the infusion cannula clamped and 60 seconds allowed for the dye to stain the&#xD;
      ILM. Endoillumination levels will initially be set to 1% and will be increased by 1%&#xD;
      intervals until the operating surgeon notes enough illumination to proceed with ERM/ILM&#xD;
      peeling. ILM peeling will be performed to the boundaries of the retinal vascular arcades and&#xD;
      the duration of membrane peeling will be documented. If the operating surgeon requests&#xD;
      increased endoilluminaton power during membrane peeling, the increased value will be&#xD;
      recorded. The number of macular hemorrhages and contusions induced by direct forcep trauma as&#xD;
      well as iatrogenic retinal breaks sustained during membrane peeling will also be recorded.&#xD;
      Data Collection Demographic data, diagnosis, clinical presentation, and history will be&#xD;
      recorded for each patient on initial examination as is done in the course of routine care.&#xD;
      Data elements will include age, race, date of birth, date of evaluation, medical record&#xD;
      number, chief complaint, past ocular history, past medical history, visual acuity, anterior&#xD;
      segment exam findings (i.e. ocular surface disease, lens status, etc.), funduscopic exams,&#xD;
      preoperative imaging and testing (OCT, FAF, Fundus Photography). Intraoperative&#xD;
      endoillumination levels will be recorded. Recorded surgical video files and follow-up status&#xD;
      will be compiled for each patient and various metrics will be recorded including total&#xD;
      operative time, time of ILM/ERM peeling, number of ICG aliquots required to visualize the&#xD;
      ILM, and intraoperative complications. Baseline and follow up data will also include visual&#xD;
      acuity, anterior segment and funduscopic examination, and OCT data if applicable. Other data&#xD;
      collected will include subjective physician surveys on the use of the two visualization&#xD;
      systems, including quality of visualization on a 10-point scale, perceived subjective&#xD;
      difficulties with vitreoretinal visualization, and overall ergonomic comfort on a 10-point&#xD;
      scale. Human Subjects and Informed Consent The tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki will be&#xD;
      followed and written informed consent obtained at the time of patient enrollment. Patients&#xD;
      will also be provided with a lay explanation of the study goals and protocol. The decision to&#xD;
      enroll in the study is entirely elective and patients will not be reimbursed for their&#xD;
      participation. The PHI and privacy of subjects will be maintained by strict adherence to&#xD;
      HIPPA and Wills Eye Institute policies. The aforementioned data will be stored prospectively&#xD;
      as patients are enrolled. All data upon collection will be coded and de-identified. Codes&#xD;
      will be created for each consecutive patient via a random number generator. All data will be&#xD;
      stored on a computer stored and ecrypted hard drives within an ecrypted password protected&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel file only accessible to members of the study team. De-identified data will be&#xD;
      linked to medical record numbers and date of birth. No other patient identifiers will be&#xD;
      recorded&#xD;
