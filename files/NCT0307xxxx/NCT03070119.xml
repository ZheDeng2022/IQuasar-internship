  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      BIIB067 in participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and confirmed superoxide&#xD;
      dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutation. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), biomarker effects, and efficacy of BIIB067 administered to&#xD;
      participants with ALS and a confirmed SOD1 mutation.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 364</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization, significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly.</description>

    <description>The ALSFRS-R measures 4 functional domains, including respiratory, bulbar function, gross motor skills, and fine motor skills. There are 12 questions, each scored from 0 to 4, for a total possible score of 48, with higher scores representing better function.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 364</time_frame>
    <description>Vital capacity will be measured by means of an SVC test, administered in the upright position. Upright SVC will be determined by performing 3 to 5 measures, in accordance with criteria established by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have diagnosis of superoxide dismutase 1-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&#xD;
             (SOD1-ALS), and must have completed the End of Study Visit for either Parts A, B, or C&#xD;
             of Study 233AS101 (NCT02623699) (i.e., were not withdrawn).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If taking riluzole, participant must be receiving a stable dose for ≥30 days prior to&#xD;
             Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If taking edaravone, participant must have initiated edaravone ≥60 days (2 treatment&#xD;
             cycles) prior to Day 1. Edaravone may not be administered on dosing days during this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

             abnormalities, neoplasms, or other abnormalities) and underlying disorders of the&#xD;
             coagulation cascade, platelet function, or platelet count (e.g., hemophilia, Von&#xD;
             Willebrand's disease, liver disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted central nervous&#xD;
             system (CNS) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or current treatment with small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA), stem cell&#xD;
             therapy, or gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with another investigational drug, biological agent (excluding BIIB067), or&#xD;

             Investigator, of copper (II) (diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)) or&#xD;
             pyrimethamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants who are pregnant or currently breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current enrollment in any other interventional study.&#xD;
